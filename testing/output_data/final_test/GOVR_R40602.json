    "content": "The Department of Homeland Security's primary mission is to prevent terrorist attacks in the United States, reduce vulnerability to terrorism, and assist in recovery from attacks. DHS has had an intelligence component since its inception in 2003, tasked with analyzing and integrating information to identify and assess terrorist threats. Congress emphasized the importance of information sharing for homeland security following the 9/11 Commission Report in 2004. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required the new DHS intelligence organization to disseminate analyzed information to relevant government agencies and private sector entities to prevent terrorist attacks. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated the creation of an information sharing environment for terrorism information. In response, former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff reorganized DHS to enhance intelligence and information sharing capabilities by establishing a strengthened Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A). Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff reorganized DHS by establishing a strengthened Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) and appointing the Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis as the Chief Intelligence Officer (CINT). The goal was to ensure coordinated, fused, and analyzed intelligence within the Department, act as a primary connection between DHS and the Intelligence Community, and provide information to state, local, and private sector partners. The first DHS CINT emphasized the importance of Homeland Security intelligence as a tool for securing the nation. Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff reorganized DHS by establishing a strengthened Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) and appointing the Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis as the Chief Intelligence Officer (CINT). The goal was to ensure coordinated, fused, and analyzed intelligence within the Department, act as a primary connection between DHS and the Intelligence Community, and provide information to state, local, and private sector partners. The current priorities for DHS include improving intelligence analysis quality, integrating DHS IE, supporting state, local, tribal, and private sector authorities, solidifying relationships with Congress, and enhancing transparency and responsiveness. Additionally, Congress imposed requirements on DHS to integrate and standardize intelligence products, establish review procedures, and disseminate information to federal partners within the Intelligence Community. The DHS IE focuses on intelligence missions within DHS, including I&A. It aims to connect various DHS elements, establish partnerships with fusion centers, and coordinate with state, local, and tribal law enforcement for threat assessment and information dissemination. The DHS Intelligence Enterprise (IE) includes elements with an intelligence mission such as I&A, Homeland Infrastructure Threat and Risk Analysis Center, and intelligence divisions of operational components like CBP, ICE, USCIS, TSA, USCG, and USSS. Caryn Wagner was confirmed as Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis in 2010. Congress is likely interested in the integration progress and quality of intelligence within DHS. In February, DHS published its first Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR), outlining its long-term strategy and priorities for homeland security. The next step is to conduct a \"bottom-up review\" to link strategy to program to budget, crucial for Congress considering an authorization bill for DHS. There is a broad homeland security intelligence enterprise involving various organizations at different levels. The report focuses on the DHS Intelligence Enterprise (IE) at various levels, including headquarters and components, supporting key departmental activities like homeland security analysis, threat warning, border security, and critical infrastructure protection. It also addresses oversight challenges and options for Congress to consider. The mission of I&A is to strengthen DHS and its partners' ability to perform homeland security functions by accessing, integrating, analyzing, and sharing timely and relevant intelligence while protecting privacy and civil liberties. The Under Secretary for I&A leads the Department's intelligence efforts, ensuring information on security threats is collected and shared with various stakeholders. I&A participates in the intelligence cycle, involving planning, collection, processing, analysis, and dissemination of intelligence. The Department of Homeland Security's intelligence efforts involve the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information on security threats. While not engaging in traditional foreign intelligence collection activities, intelligence is gathered from routine observations and activities to identify patterns and flows essential for analysis. The Department of Homeland Security's intelligence analysis combines information from various sources to develop homeland security intelligence, including border security, human smuggling, cargo data, critical infrastructure protection, infectious diseases, and violent radicalization. The core customers of DHS Intelligence & Analysis are the President and the Secretary of Homeland Security. I&A Strategy focuses on sharing intelligence with various partners at state, local, tribal, and private sector levels to protect communities. State, local, and tribal law enforcement are crucial in preventing terrorism and need timely intelligence to respond to threats effectively. Under Secretary Wagner emphasizes the importance of converting disparate information into actionable products for the safety of communities. DHS Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) provides support to operators of critical infrastructure by sharing threat information and intelligence to aid in risk management decision making. Former Under Secretary Charles Allen highlighted the importance of staying ahead of terrorist tactics to secure the nation. I&A collaborates with federal, state, and local partners to ensure timely information sharing for national security. DHS Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) supports critical infrastructure operators by sharing threat information and intelligence. I&A contributes staff to the National Counterterrorism Center and provides a unique homeland security perspective to the President's Daily Brief. DHS has faced challenges integrating 22 legacy and newly-created agencies, including intelligence activities of operational components. The 2005 reorganization aimed to enhance integration, including intelligence. The 2005 reorganization of the Department aimed to enhance integration, including intelligence efforts. The Under Secretary for I&A is also the Chief Intelligence Officer for the Department, responsible for establishing intelligence priorities and policies. The heads of DHS intelligence components do not report to the Under Secretary but coordinate closely with them as per the 9/11 Commission Act. The HSIC provides senior-level direction for Department-wide intelligence activities and promotes integration efforts. The Homeland Security Intelligence Council (HSIC) is chaired by the Under Secretary and includes key intelligence officials from DHS components. It focuses on governance-level objectives and oversees the coordination of analytic production plans for the Department's intelligence activities. The HSIC is funded through the classified National Intelligence Program (NIP). The Homeland Security Intelligence Council (HSIC), chaired by the Under Secretary, oversees intelligence activities funded through the classified National Intelligence Program (NIP). Intelligence spending is divided between the NIP and the Military Intelligence Program. The DNI does not publicly disclose details about the intelligence budget, but reported an aggregate amount of $49.8 billion for FY2009. The Under Secretary for I&A presents a consolidated intelligence budget to the Secretary, integrating Department intelligence activities. DHS operational component intelligence activities are generally not classified under the NIP. The Homeland Security Intelligence Council oversees intelligence activities funded through the classified National Intelligence Program (NIP), with the exception of the Coast Guard's National Intelligence Element. The total I&A budget figure is combined with operational activities within the Analysis and Operations category. I&A is led by an Under Secretary, currently Caryn Wagner, supported by a Principal Deputy Under Secretary, Bart R. Johnson. The current I&A organization supports the strategic goals of its December 2009 Strategy. I&A is realigning organizationally in 2010 to support strategic goals and homeland security missions. They focus on five \"analytic thrusts\" related to border security, radicalization, critical infrastructure, and weapons of mass destruction. Analytic resources are being realigned to better support state, local, and tribal consumers. In 2008, I&A realigned its finished intelligence product line to include the Homeland Security Threat Assessment (HSTA), an annual assessment of major threats to the homeland from domestic and foreign terrorists and extremists. The Homeland Security Threat Assessment (HSTA) focuses on domestic extremists, international terrorists, and systemic threats like pandemics and transnational criminal organizations. It includes classified and \"Unclassified/For Official Use Only\" versions, as well as Intelligence Warnings, Notes, Assessments, Monitors, and Reference Aids. The Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) division produces reports on various threats such as anthrax labs and improvised explosive devices (IED). These reports include photos and diagrams to inform law enforcement and first responders on what to look for and how to respond. They also produce joint reports with the FBI and longer-term analytic pieces. Additionally, they create Homeland Intelligence Reports (HIR) and Homeland Security Intelligence Reports (HSIR) containing valuable information for homeland security. The I&A division produces reports on various threats like anthrax labs and IEDs, providing valuable information for homeland security. The Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) facilitates information sharing between federal, state, local, tribal, private sector, and international partners. It connects states and urban areas with the National Operations Center (NOC) in real-time. The HSIN network includes five community of interest portals: Emergency Management, Critical Sectors, Law Enforcement, Multi-Mission Agencies, and Intelligence and Analysis (HSIN-Intelligence). The HS-SLIC portal allows state, local, and tribal authorities access to unclassified intelligence products and has a governance board with strong state and local official participation. The HSDN provides access to Secret-level terrorism-related information, including NCTC Online. I&A provides access to Secret-level terrorism-related information through HSDN terminals deployed to state and local fusion centers. However, there is a challenge in the relevance of I&A analysis and products to its customers, as some state and local participants have expressed dissatisfaction with the timeliness and value of intelligence from DHS. Former Under Secretary Allen established a State and Local Fusion Center (SLFC) Pilot Project Team in 2006 to enhance DHS support for intelligence sharing. Fusion centers were established post-9/11 to improve collaboration between federal, state, and local agencies in detecting and preventing criminal or terrorist activity. By the end of 2009, there were 72 designated fusion centers under DHS/FBI for state and Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) efforts. DHS/FBI designated 72 fusion centers under the State and Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) to enhance intelligence sharing post-9/11. Congress mandated DHS support for fusion centers in the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. I&A provides operational, analytic, and training support to these centers, including intelligence officers assigned to provide briefings, analyze reports, and develop intelligence products. As of March 2010, 57 officers are deployed to fusion centers with plans to increase to 76 by the end of FY2010. Fusion center directors value the contributions of I&A officers and are eager to have them assigned. The ITACG program aims to enhance federal intelligence product accessibility for state, local, and tribal officials. The ITACG program aims to enhance federal intelligence product accessibility for state, local, tribal, and private sector officials through an Advisory Council and Detail consisting of homeland security and law enforcement officers and intelligence analysts. The Under Secretary for I&A is responsible for establishing and maintaining the ITACG Detail. The ITACG Detail, led by a senior intelligence officer reporting to the Director of NCTC, aims to facilitate intelligence sharing with state, local, and tribal officials by focusing on relevant information needed for threat recognition. Security clearances and source protection have been barriers, but the Detail educates NCTC analysts on meeting the requirements of these officials. The ITACG Detail, consisting of state and local law enforcement officers, aims to assist NCTC analysts in preparing intelligence products at a low classification level for state, local, tribal, and private sector customers. There is a need for increased representation in areas such as tribal operations, homeland security planning, health and human services, and intelligence analysis at the state and local level. The goal is to expand the ITACG Detail to include ten SLT representatives. The ITACG Detail assists in preparing intelligence products for state, local, tribal, and private sector consumers. Achievements include shaping IC products for state and local agencies, participating in the production of 214 intelligence products, and creating the Roll Call Release (RCR) for first responders focusing on terrorist tactics and trends. Since its creation in December 2008, the product line has resulted in 26 published RCRs and over 350 TERRSUM products. The ITACG Detail collaborates with NCTC's Operations Center to prepare the daily TERRSUM, providing intelligence of interest to SLT entities. The ITACG Intelligence Guide for First Responders was developed to help SLT first responders access and understand federal intelligence reporting, including IC jargon and acronyms. The ITACG Intelligence Guide for First Responders has been distributed widely to help first responders access and understand threat reporting. Feedback from senior police officials indicates a positive impact on intelligence product writing, but concerns remain about the need for cultural change within the intelligence community. The senior police official recommends authorizing the ITACG as a dissemination point for state and local fusion centers nationwide. ITACG liaison personnel are needed to release current intelligence to state and local agencies. The Office of the Deputy Under Secretary for Mission Integration is responsible for DHS IE integration activities, policies, training, and information systems architecture. The Deputy Under Secretary for Mission Integration (DU/S-M) oversees program review, department-level analysis, and intelligence initiatives. They chair the Intelligence Career Management Board, develop core competencies for the intelligence cadre, and manage I&A responsibilities for the Counterintelligence Program and Integrated Border Intelligence Program. The IBIP enhances support for border security activities by linking DHS intelligence resources. The Integrated Border Intelligence Program (IBIP) enhances border security by linking DHS intelligence resources with state and local partners and the Intelligence Community (IC) to provide actionable intelligence to front-line operators. The Homeland Intelligence Support Team (HIST) was deployed in 2007 to El Paso, Texas to coordinate national intelligence delivery and enhance information fusion for DHS operational missions at the border. HIST serves as a bridge between national and field levels, facilitates communication between I&A and component intelligence staffs, and collaborates with state and local law enforcement officials on topics like border violence and alien smuggling. The Homeland Intelligence Support Team (HIST) at the El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) focuses on border violence, alien smuggling, weapons trafficking, illicit finance, drug trafficking, and the nexus between crime and terrorism. The \"Borders Branch\" within I&A's analytic element has increased staffing to support specific departmental concerns, shifting away from purely terrorism issues. The number of analysts working on border issues has increased from three in 2005 to 20 in mid-2008, with a significant rise in the production of border-related reports. The Civil Applications Committee (CAC) has been facilitating requests for space-based imaging and remote sensing capabilities for over 30 years. In 2005, a DNI study group recommended expanding the CAC's scope to include homeland security and law enforcement applications. In 2007, DHS was designated as the executive agent for the National Applications Office (NAO) to utilize IC technological assets. However, the establishment of the NAO has been controversial, with Congress prohibiting its operations in 2008. The National Applications Office (NAO) was established by DHS in 2007 to utilize IC technological assets for homeland security and law enforcement applications. However, in 2008, Congress prohibited its operations until compliance with all laws and standards was certified. After a review in 2009, Secretary Napolitano decided to end the NAO program. The Civil Applications Committee (CAC) will continue to facilitate information sharing and provide necessary skills and information for asset protection. HITRAC, the Department's infrastructure-intelligence fusion center, works to produce and disseminate threat- and risk-informed analytic products to influence infrastructure protection strategies. It is jointly managed by I&A and the Office of Infrastructure Protection within DHS. HITRAC is organized into two divisions responsible for its principal functions. The Risk Analysis Division prioritizes infrastructure risk analysis for decision making, managing Tier 1 and Tier 2 Program and Critical Foreign Dependencies Initiative. The Threat Analysis Division offers critical infrastructure, cyber, and regional threat analysis, supporting the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. HITRAC produces State Threat Assessments, Regional Infrastructure Assessments, and Quarterly Suspicious Activity Analysis. The Infrastructure Intelligence Notes provide timely perspective on events for private sector security planning. Former Secretary Chertoff directed the enhancement of the OPS organization in 2008 to improve coordination for non-routine operations. OPS Intelligence Division, supported by I&A staff, communicates intelligence impacting U.S. security. The Department of Homeland Security faces challenges integrating 22 legacy and newly-created agencies. Despite most operational responsibilities being transferred to DHS, components still have operational independence. Department-wide operations planning is being developed to support integration, especially for crisis and contingency planning. The Intelligence Division at OPS supports the Secretary of Homeland Security in domestic incident management by providing timely intelligence products and services. It coordinates with various intelligence organizations to gather threat-related intelligence and analysis. The OPS Intelligence Division integrates intelligence research and analysis into operational planning, aiming to develop a Common Intelligence Picture (CIP). Former Secretary Chertoff emphasized the importance of understanding enemy intent and capabilities for border security and infrastructure protection. Fusion of intelligence from various sources is crucial for effective response preparedness. The OPS Intelligence Division integrates intelligence from various sources to develop a Common Intelligence Picture for the department. CBP, established in 2003, is responsible for securing the nation's borders and preventing entry of terrorists and illegal immigration. It also regulates international trade, enforces trade and drug laws, and protects Americans and U.S. agricultural interests. CBP enforces U.S. trade and drug laws, protects Americans and U.S. agricultural interests by preventing harmful imports, and intercepts illegal narcotics, firearms, and contraband at the border. In 2007, CBP reorganized its intelligence and anti-terrorism functions to target terrorists, WMDs, illegal aliens, and narcotics traffickers. The Office of Intelligence and Operations Coordination (OIOC) at CBP manages field operations, coordinates with other agencies, and provides intelligence to support CBP missions. OIOC is divided into four divisions and works closely with agencies like NCTC and NJTTF. The CBP Office of Intelligence and Operations Coordination (OIOC) supports CBP missions by engaging in the entire intelligence cycle, including planning, collection, processing, production, and dissemination of \"all source\" information. While CBP does not conduct traditional foreign intelligence collection, it receives information from DHS I&A, the IC, and law enforcement agencies. CBP also gathers and analyzes data on persons and cargo entering the U.S., as well as information from apprehensions and border enforcement activities. CBP collects advance passenger information for air and ship travelers to the U.S. Officers examine various items for intelligence gathering. The data aids in national security missions. CBP screens people and goods for admissibility and intercepts threats. Due to the high volume of entries, physical inspection of every person or shipment is impractical. CBP uses the Automated Targeting System (ATS) to analyze trade data and manifest information to target high-risk persons or cargo shipments arriving at U.S. ports. Intelligence from other agencies is also reviewed to identify potential threats. ATS employs weighted rule sets to assign risk scores to cargo, with high-risk cargo subject to further inspection. ATS is used by CBP to analyze data for risk assessment in cargo and passenger screening. Various data sources are utilized, including ACS, ABI, AMS, and Automated Commercial Environment. ATS-P processes traveler information against threat-based scenarios to aid CBP officers in identifying individuals for additional screening. Unlike cargo, ATS-P does not use a scoring system for risk assessment. The ATS-P system compares Passenger Name Record (PNR) and information from various databases to identify suspicious activity based on past investigations and intelligence. This risk assessment helps CBP officers in identifying illegal activity before a traveler's arrival or departure from the United States. The ATS-P system aids DHS officers in detecting illegal activity by analyzing passenger data. The NTC, part of CBP, uses ATS to support officers at POEs, gathering intelligence for security actions and tracking passenger movements. The NTC, part of CBP, utilizes targeting techniques at ports to detect drug smuggling and currency violations, adapting practices post-9/11 for anti-terrorist and national security purposes. The NTC was split into NTC-Passenger and NTC-Cargo in 2007, working with intelligence agencies to develop targeting rules for high-risk passengers entering the US. They analyze API data from commercial carriers to provide real-time responses to CBP officers in the field. The NTCC, part of CBP, examines data on air and ship passengers and crew traveling to the US to detect possible matches with watchlists for terrorists and other persons of interest. It uses advanced risk-assessment techniques to analyze electronic manifest information for all modes of transportation, sorting it based on over 100 variables including port of origin, cargo nature, and importer/exporter track records. The NTCC also supports Cargo Security Initiative ports. The NTCC collaborates with OIOC to develop targeting rule sets for cargo in the Cargo Security Initiative ports. They work with NTCP to identify passenger matches to terrorist-related lookouts and run them against databases. NTCC focuses on inspecting cargo that could be used for weapons of mass destruction, illegal drugs, and conventional weapons. Daily sweeps target suspect chemical, biological, radiological, conventional weapons, explosives, and ammonium. The NTCC collaborates with OIOC to develop targeting rule sets for cargo in the Cargo Security Initiative ports, focusing on inspecting cargo for weapons of mass destruction, illegal drugs, and conventional weapons. They target suspect shipments of chemical, biological, radiological, conventional weapons, explosives, and ammonium nitrate. This targeting led to the seizure of chemicals for methamphetamines and assault rifles worth over $3 million. CBP officers work at POE's, while Border Patrol agents patrol vast areas along the borders and the Office of Air and Marine supports operations in air and maritime environments. The Border Patrol is supported by the Border Field Intelligence Center (BORFIC) and the Air and Marine Operations Center (AMOC). Intelligence units are placed within each of the 20 Border Patrol Sectors. OIOC provides real-time intelligence and strategic analyses on methods used by undocumented aliens, human smugglers, and drug traffickers to enter the United States. A report in April 2006 highlighted vulnerabilities at the U.S. southern border, leading to the development of a multi-pronged plan by DHS to address these issues. The Border Field Intelligence Center (BORFIC) was established in 2004 to support border security missions by conducting intelligence activities to predict, detect, deter, and interdict terrorists, human traffickers, and contraband smugglers entering the United States. It was fully integrated into CBP OIOC in 2007 and is responsible for security efforts on both the northern and southern borders. The organization implemented a plan to address vulnerabilities, including training to eliminate false passports and enhance detection capabilities in certain countries. BORFIC supports security efforts on the northern and southern borders by exchanging intelligence with various agencies and participating in interagency groups. It shares law enforcement information with state and local fusion centers through the HS-SLIC portal and has personnel assigned to the El Paso Intelligence Center. AMOC in Riverside, California, is a 24/7 coordination center for multiple agencies. The AMOC in California is a 24/7 coordination center that monitors air and marine tracks of interest across the nation's borders. It also hosts CBP's long-range unmanned aircraft systems and coordinates with the USCG for maritime operations. The center is staffed with intelligence specialists and liaison officers from various agencies, producing a comprehensive air surveillance radar picture through the AMOSS system. The AMOC in California operates an extensive network of military and civilian radars in the US and Canada, processing large amounts of data to provide real-time information on suspicious aircraft and vessels to various agencies. Detection Systems Specialists have access to databases for detailed information on flight plans, ownership, and criminal backgrounds. The center also supports airspace security for the National Capital Region. The AMOC in California supports airspace security for the National Capital Region by providing radar data and law enforcement capabilities to identify threats from non-compliant aircraft in the DC ADIZ. OIOC collaborates with CBP to develop IDSO's based on threat information, enhancing CBP inspection operations with enforcement actions vetted through DHS CINT. CBP developed an IDSO to intensify inspection activity on persons and routes from a particular country. Following the Madrid train bombings in March 2004, CBP assigned officers and resources to targeted POE's to intensify inspections of railcars. ICE, the largest investigative organization within DHS, was established in 2003 by consolidating investigative elements from U.S. Customs Service and INS. ICE, established in 2003, enforces trade and immigration laws, investigates threats to US safety, and tackles illegal activities like weapons trafficking, narcotics smuggling, human trafficking, and financial crimes. It has four operational divisions, including the Office of Investigations (OI) responsible for national security threats. ICE's Office of Intelligence coordinates and manages intelligence activities, collecting, analyzing, and disseminating strategic and tactical intelligence for operational elements.ICE Special Agents are key members of Joint Terrorism Task Forces, focusing on immigration crime, human rights violations, smuggling, and other criminal activities. Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) is responsible for identifying, apprehending, and removing illegal aliens from the United States. The Office of International Affairs (OIA) develops partnerships with foreign governments to advance homeland security goals. ICE's Office of Intelligence focuses on gathering and analyzing information related to the movement of people, money, and materials in and out of the United States to support investigative activities. They collect data from various sources, including federal agencies, state, local, tribal, and foreign agencies, to identify criminal patterns, predict threats, and mitigate vulnerabilities. The Office of Intelligence within ICE conducts operational activities like investigations, document exploitation, and detainee interviews. They gather information from classified intelligence reporting, law enforcement sensitive data, and open source material. The consumers of ICE intelligence products include ICE investigators, DRO and FPS officials, ICE and DHS leadership, DHS partners like CBP, Department of State, FBI, DEA, ATF, and state/local law enforcement agencies. The Office of Intelligence is led by a Director and consists of six divisions and 26 Field Intelligence Groups, providing support to ICE field components. The Intelligence Programs Division within ICE produces finished intelligence products to support ICE, DHS, and other consumers. It includes specialized units such as Counter Proliferation Intelligence, Human Smuggling and Public Safety, Contraband, Illicit Finance/Trade Fraud, and International Intelligence. The Tactical Intelligence Center in Mississippi collaborates with the NSA to analyze signals intelligence, human intelligence, and law enforcement information for ICE investigations and strategic intelligence analysis. The International and Border Support unit focuses on supporting ICE Attach\u00e9s through the International Intelligence Unit and Southwest Border operations targeting criminal organizations contributing to violence along the border. Southwest Border operations include the Border Violence Intelligence Cell, Border Enforcement Security Taskforces, Operation Armas Cruzdas, and Operation Firewall, with a focus on weapons smuggling investigations and combating violence along the US-Mexico border. BVIC collaborates with Homeland Intelligence Support Team and partners at EPIC. ICE works closely with partners at EPIC and Mexican law enforcement agencies on initiatives to enhance border security and disrupt criminal organizations. The BVIC supports programs like BEST, Armas Cruzadas, and Operation Firewall by providing intelligence analysis and operational leads. In collaboration with CBP and DHS I&A, the BVIC produced an Intelligence Report on US Southbound Weapons Smuggling in November 2008. The BVIC, in collaboration with CBP and DHS I&A, produced an Intelligence Report on U.S. southbound weapon smuggling trends to support the BEST initiative and other operational components. The BEST initiative involves multi-agency task forces led by ICE to disrupt criminal organizations threatening border security, with participation from agencies like DEA, ATF, FBI, USCG, and state and local law enforcement. Mexican law enforcement agency Secretaria de Seguridad Publica is a partner in border security efforts. The Secretaria de Seguridad Publica partners on the southern border, while the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Border Services Agency are partners on the northern border. BEST task forces focus on specific threats in their respective areas, such as cross-border violence, weapons and drug smuggling, money laundering, and human trafficking. The Office of Intelligence supports Southwest Border BESTs with 28 analysts for intelligence sharing. Armas Cruzadas is a U.S.-Mexican law enforcement partnership for synchronized efforts. Armas Cruzadas is a U.S.-Mexican law enforcement partnership aimed at disrupting trans-border weapons smuggling networks. ICE Border Liaisons and a Weapons Virtual Task Force enhance bilateral communication and intelligence sharing. ICE, ATF, and CBP are key participants in Armas Cruzadas, with Operation Firewall targeting bulk cash smuggling. Operation Firewall is an initiative by ICE and CBP to combat bulk cash smuggling, a method used by criminal organizations to move proceeds from criminal activities. It targets various smuggling methods including vehicles, airline shipments, and pedestrians crossing U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada. The Collection Management and Requirements Division coordinates intelligence efforts within ICE to articulate intelligence requirements to ensure effective enforcement. The Office of Intelligence within ICE manages intelligence requirements and the Joint Intelligence Operations Center. It has two support divisions: Business Management and Executive Information and Technology. Business Management handles daily operations, procurement, budget, logistics, and training. The Executive Information and Technology Division provides IT services for day-to-day operations, managing information, and secure communication systems. This division also includes the Intelligence Document Exploitation program for analyzing captured media. The Office of Intelligence within ICE utilizes various forms of data, including hard copy documents, audio recordings, and electronic media, to create intelligence products. This information is digitized for analysis, pattern recognition, and information sharing among intelligence analysts and investigators. The field organization consists of 26 FIGs aligned with ICE SAC offices nationwide, replacing the former Field Intelligence Units to enhance connectivity with operational elements and coordination with partners. Each FIG is managed by a Field Intelligence Director and staffed with a mix of intelligence and operational personnel to identify and analyze criminal trends and threats. The Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center (HSTC) was established in 2004 as the U.S. Government's intelligence fusion center for federal agencies addressing human smuggling, trafficking, and terrorist mobility. Human smugglers profit from illegal transportation of persons, while human traffickers profit from exploiting individuals. These issues are major problems for the United States, with transnational organized crime groups involved. The Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center (HSTC) was established in 2004 to address human smuggling, trafficking, and terrorist mobility. It focuses on transnational issues related to illicit international travel, bringing together federal agency representatives to convert intelligence into effective law enforcement and diplomatic action. The HSTC prepares strategic reports for U.S. law enforcement and policymakers, mandated to produce an annual report on vulnerabilities in travel systems. It also serves as a focal point for international police agencies. The Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center (HSTC) is a focal point for international police agencies, facilitating information exchange between the US and its allies. ICE contributes personnel to the HSTC, with the Director being an ICE employee. The shortage of staff at the Center hinders its mission, as stated in the HSTC charter. The Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center (HSTC) relies on detailed personnel from various agencies, but key members like DOD, FBI, and CIA have not provided staff. Congress may need to mandate minimum staffing and consider dedicated funding for detailee positions to support the Center's mission. USCIS plays a crucial role in establishing immigration services and policies to uphold America's legacy as a nation of immigrants. USCIS, established in 2003 under the Homeland Security Act, focuses on adjudicating immigration benefits, naturalization petitions, and refugee/asylum claims. It is not a law enforcement agency and primarily funded by fees from applicants. USCIS processes applications for immigration benefits, collects biometrics, and combats immigration fraud. It issues Green Cards, adjudicates refugee applications, and naturalizes new citizens daily. Congress recognizes USCIS as responsible for anti-fraud initiatives and background checks on applicants. The Office of Fraud Detection and National Security (FDNS) was established by USCIS in 2004 to conduct background checks on immigration applicants and prevent fraud. FDNS was later promoted to a Directorate in 2010 to emphasize its anti-fraud and national security responsibilities. The Office of Fraud Detection and National Security (FDNS) is responsible for detecting, pursuing, and deterring fraud in the immigration system. It ensures background checks are conducted on all benefit seekers and identifies vulnerabilities to enhance national security efforts. The Intelligence Branch within FDNS manages the analysis and dissemination of immigration-based intelligence products to address fraud trends and vulnerabilities. The Intelligence Branch within FDNS collaborates with state and local intelligence fusion centers and various law enforcement agencies to promote information sharing. Liaison officers are placed within multiple organizations to provide immigration subject matter expertise. Intelligence Research Specialists conduct research and analysis to identify national security threats. The Intelligence Branch within FDNS collaborates with various agencies to produce and disseminate immigration-related intelligence products, including analyzing data from USCIS electronic databases and immigrant Alien Files. They also create intelligence reports, such as one following the 2007 failed bombings in London and Glasgow. The FDNS Intelligence Branch collaborates with agencies to produce immigration-related intelligence products, including analyzing USCIS databases for individuals with backgrounds similar to UK plotters. They produced a classified report identifying national security-related hits and individuals under investigation. Over 30 intelligence reports were disseminated to the Intelligence Community. Additionally, they administer the USCIS Request for Information program. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was established in November 2001 through the Aviation and Transportation Security Act. It was initially part of the Department of Transportation but was later transferred to the Department of Homeland Security in March 2003. TSA is responsible for security in all modes of transportation, including aviation, maritime, mass transit, highway, motor carrier, freight rail, and pipeline. The majority of transportation infrastructure in the United States is privately-owned. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) collaborates with industry and government operators to reduce security risks in the transportation sector. TSA provides threat intelligence and works to enhance capabilities to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks. TSA uses a threat-based, risk management approach to security. The TSA's intelligence function, led by the Assistant Administrator for Intelligence, analyzes threats related to transportation security. The Office of Intelligence consists of six divisions and an intelligence cell at the Transportation Security Operations Center in Virginia. While not an intelligence collector, the office collaborates closely with IC agencies to assess threats specific to transportation. The Office of Intelligence (OI) collaborates with IC agencies to analyze intelligence relevant to transportation security. It receives information from various sources including DHS components, law enforcement agencies, and transportation system operators. OI also reviews suspicious activity reports and works on intelligence issues with counterparts in the UK and Canada. Additionally, OI has established an information sharing and analysis center for transportation funded by the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. The Office of Intelligence (OI) is developing a Transportation Security Information Sharing and Analysis Center (TS-ISAC) to enhance collaboration and information sharing with stakeholders in the transportation industry. OI analysts produce intelligence on threats to U.S. transportation modes, support Federal Air Marshal missions, and provide security for special events. The Intelligence Watch and Outreach Division offers 24/7 threat warnings, while the Transportation Intelligence Analysis Division conducts in-depth threat analyses for dissemination to stakeholders. The Office of Intelligence (OI) disseminates intelligence products to TSA leadership, Office of Security Operations, Office of Global Strategies, Transportation Security Network Management, FAMS, and transportation industry stakeholders. Products include Administrator's Daily Intelligence Brief, Information Bulletins, Transportation Suspicious Incident Reports (TSIR), and Transportation Intelligence Note (TIN) containing potential threats, trends, and observations in transportation systems. Products are produced at the Unclassified/For Official Use Only level for TSA employees and security professionals. The TSA Office of Intelligence (OI) disseminates intelligence products at the For Official Use Only level to TSA employees and security professionals. Field intelligence officers are deployed to major airports to provide intelligence support, threat briefings, and liaison with law enforcement agencies. Former TSA Administrator, Kip Hawley, emphasizes the importance of a multi-layered aviation security strategy. The TSA Office of Intelligence plays a crucial role in anticipating and preventing terrorist acts before they occur by using intelligence to identify and intercept potential threats. This includes supporting airline passenger prescreening systems like the No Fly and Selectee Lists. U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies also focus on identifying individuals suspected of terrorism and nominating them for inclusion in the TSDB watchlist. The TSDB is the U.S. Government's consolidated terrorist watchlist, containing the \"No Fly\" and \"Selectee\" lists for screening air travelers. The \"No Fly\" list prohibits individuals from boarding aircraft due to terrorism threats, while the \"Selectee\" list includes those associated with terrorist organizations or activities. Individuals on the Selectee List may fly only after additional screening. The No Fly and Selectee lists were transferred to the Terrorist Screening Center in 2004. TSA and CBP are responsible for screening passengers on domestic and international flights. Airlines match passenger names against watch lists provided by TSA. Controversy surrounds the No Fly list. The No Fly list, maintained by the TSA, has been controversial due to its size and the names on it. The ACLU claimed in 2008 that the list had over 1 million names. Politicians, musicians, and other professionals have been reported to be on the list, causing travel delays or refusals. Federal Air Marshals were even denied boarding on flights they were assigned to protect because their names matched those on the list. The U.S. Government stated that there are 2,500 individuals on the No Fly list, with fewer than ten percent being U.S. persons, and less than 16,000 on the Selectee lists. Following the attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253 on December 25, 2009, the No Fly List nearly doubled to around 6,000 individuals, including those associated with al-Qa'ida's Yemen branch and others with ties to the alleged bomber. The DHS has established a redress mechanism called DHS TRIP for individuals who believe they are on the lists in error. The No Fly and Selectee Lists are crucial for TSA's pre-screening system to keep dangerous individuals off aircraft, with OI playing a limited role in list nominations. After the attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253, DHS re-evaluated the Terrorist Screening Database criteria and process. TSA shifted watch list matching responsibilities to TSA with the Secure Flight program, following a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission. Secure Flight is a program implemented by TSA to improve the accuracy of matching names on watchlists with airline passengers. Airlines are required to collect additional information such as full name, date of birth, and gender to prevent inconveniences at the airport. The program aims to maintain the confidentiality of government watchlist information while protecting passengers' privacy and civil liberties. The Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) was established in 1968 to deter hostile acts targeting U.S. air carriers. After 9/11, the program was expanded and transferred to TSA. FAMS provide support during national emergencies and participate in anti-hijacking duties. The Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) was established in 1968 to deter hostile acts targeting U.S. air carriers. They provide in-flight security for commercial airline flights and participate in Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response (VIPR) teams. Concerns have been raised about the limited coverage of air marshals on flights, with fewer than 1 percent of flights protected by armed federal air marshals according to a CNN report in March 2008. TSA argues that the size of the air marshal cadre and their flight details should remain classified to prevent terrorists from knowing the probability of air marshals being on specific flights. The TSA uses an intelligence-driven, risk-based approach to determine which flights should be covered by air marshals. The Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) has a strategic interest in the maritime domain due to the complex nature of the oceans bordering North America. The USCG is a military maritime service responsible for safety, security, and stewardship in the maritime domain, including international waters and America's coasts. It has diverse missions such as national defense, homeland security, maritime safety, and environmental stewardship. The USCG is a unique armed service and the nation's primary maritime law enforcement agency. Maritime domain awareness is crucial for detecting, deterring, and defeating adversaries, making it a principal objective of the USCG intelligence program. The USCG intelligence program is a collaborative effort with the U.S. Navy, DHS components, and other Federal agencies. Coast Guard intelligence collection includes maritime surveillance activities using various technologies. The mission of Coast Guard Intelligence and Criminal Investigations is to oversee operations supporting USCG objectives. It consists of two parts: The National Intelligence Element conducts intelligence activities as defined by Executive Order 12333 and the National Security Act of 1947. The USCG Cryptologic Program is part of the National Intelligence Element, which oversees intelligence activities under the National Security Act of 1947. The Law Enforcement Intelligence Program focuses on collecting, retaining, and disseminating information related to USCG law enforcement and regulatory authorities. The Assistant Commandant for Intelligence and Criminal Investigations supervises these programs. The Assistant Commandant for Intelligence and Criminal Investigations oversees the USCG intelligence and criminal investigations enterprise, provides intelligence support to USCG operations, and leads the Cryptologic Program to collect intelligence in the maritime environment for national security objectives. The US Coast Guard provides timely signals intelligence to support national security interests, with cryptologic capability being integrated into new and legacy cutters for operational effectiveness by early 2011. This capability allows for interoperability with the US Navy and reduces training costs. The USCG views cryptologic capability as essential for Global Maritime Intelligence Integration, reducing training costs. The Coast Guard Counterintelligence Service safeguards operations from foreign intelligence activities, supporting anti-terrorism efforts and ensuring interoperability with DHS. The CGIS conducts professional criminal investigations. The CGIS is a federal law enforcement agency under DHS with authority to conduct criminal investigations, provide protective services, and support maritime law enforcement missions worldwide. USCG special agents have the power to investigate criminal activity, carry firearms, serve warrants, and make arrests within their jurisdiction. The Coast Guard is divided into Atlantic and Pacific areas, each with districts responsible for different coastlines. The Coast Guard is divided into Atlantic and Pacific areas, each responsible for a portion of the nation's coastline. The intelligence elements overseen by the Assistant Commandant include the Intelligence Coordination Center, Atlantic and Pacific Area Intelligence staffs, Maritime Intelligence Fusion Centers, and District and Sector Intelligence staffs. The ICC manages, analyzes, and produces intelligence for Coast Guard missions at the national level. The Intelligence Coordination Center (ICC) manages and produces maritime intelligence for the USCG, focusing on law enforcement, military readiness, counterterrorism, force protection, marine environmental protection, and port security. It also screens arriving commercial vessels for security threats and manages intelligence collection requirements. Coastwatch requires vessels over 300 gross tons to submit advanced notice of arrival information to the National Vessel Movement Center 96 hours before arrival in the U.S. They check this information against federal databases to identify security threats, providing advanced warnings to decision makers for appropriate responses. Coastwatch also provides intelligence analysis on geopolitical issues, terrorism, vessel movements, transnational crimes, and identifies national security or criminal threats. The Atlantic and Pacific Maritime Intelligence Fusion Centers (MIFC) in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and Alameda, California respectively, cover various regions including the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, Pacific Rim, and South America. They provide intelligence support for port security, vessel movements, transnational crimes, and coordinate human intelligence collection. The District intelligence staffs oversee Sector Intelligence Officers and support Coast Guard operations. The Sector Intelligence Staff (SIS) is led by a Sector Intelligence Office (SIO) who advises the Sector Commander. They integrate Field Intelligence Support Teams (FISTs) to provide maritime threat assessments and liaise with various partners. The SIS conducts debriefings with ship crews returning from foreign ports to identify potential threats to maritime security. The USSS, originally established in 1865 to investigate counterfeiting, now also protects the President and Vice President. It became part of DHS in 2003 and is responsible for safeguarding the nation's financial infrastructure. The USSS, originally focused on investigating counterfeiting, now investigates financial crimes like fraud and money laundering. It employs over 6,000 personnel in various roles and operates in multiple locations worldwide. The agency is organized into seven offices, with Investigations and Protective Operations being the main operational units. The USSS has two main operational offices: Investigations and Protective Operations. The Office of Protective Research investigates financial crimes, while Protective Operations provides protective services for high-profile individuals and locations. This includes security for the President, Vice-President, visiting heads of state, and other key figures. The USSS's Protective Research office is responsible for protective intelligence, analysis, and implementing technology-based countermeasures. The Protective Intelligence and Assessment Division evaluates threat and vulnerability assessments to support the USSS protective service mission. They receive, evaluate, disseminate, and maintain information on potential threats and conduct protective intelligence advances before protectee travel. The USSS's Protective Research office is responsible for protective intelligence, analysis, and implementing technology-based countermeasures. The division is organized into foreign and domestic branches, with a 24-hour duty desk to collect and process threat information. The National Threat Assessment Center uses historical information, investigative records, interviews, and other primary source material to produce long-term behavioral research studies for homeland security or public safety purposes. The National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC) was established in 1998 by the USSS to prevent targeted violence and provide leadership in threat assessment. NTAC was authorized by Congress in 2000 to assist law enforcement at all levels in understanding and preventing threats. NTAC was authorized to provide assistance to law enforcement on training, consultation, and research in threat assessment. Research projects include the Safe School Initiative and the Insider Threat Study. The NTAC conducted various research projects on threats to the education system, including intellectual property theft, fraud, and sabotage. Several reports were published based on these studies, such as the Bystander Study and the Institutions of Higher Education Targeted Violence Study. The NTAC is collaborating with the Department of Education and the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit to research targeted violence at institutions of higher education. Managing competing claims for intelligence support is a significant challenge. The DHS IE faces challenges in managing competing claims for intelligence support, with a focus on providing real-time information to identify threats and support security measures. Responsibilities include supporting national leaders with a strategic perspective on homeland security issues, including terrorism threats and collaboration with state, local, tribal law enforcement, and critical infrastructure operators. The Department of Homeland Security faces challenges in managing competing claims for intelligence support, including providing timely and actionable intelligence to national leaders and critical infrastructure operators. Congress may consider options to help achieve the right balance in intelligence resources. In 2009, Secretary Napolitano directed the establishment of a new program office, the JFC PMO, to strengthen state and urban area fusion centers. The office will be managed by I&A with involvement from all relevant DHS components. The new JFC PMO will lead efforts to develop survey tools for state, local, and tribal customers to define their homeland security information needs. It will also work to enhance fusion centers' capabilities in gathering, analyzing, and sharing information to provide a comprehensive view of threats. The Secretary requested a recommendation on the feasibility and structure of the JFC-PMO by March 2010. The Department is considering how the JFC-PMO will align with the White House's direction for DHS. The pending JFC-PMO will align with the White House's direction for DHS to lead the National Fusion Center Program Office. Law enforcement officers praise fusion centers for information sharing but express concerns about consistent funding from SHSGP and UASI managed by FEMA GPD within DHS. The success of fusion centers depends on funding arrangements, with options like designating a percentage of SHSGP and UASI funds or creating a new grant program. The program relies on shared space architecture for information sharing, where fusion centers control what data to share through a secure portal. The NSI project team has created a secure portal for fusion centers to search and aggregate relevant information from national databases. Each fusion center needs a server and software to translate data to a separate database. Establishing electronic trust and a federated capability for identity and privilege management is crucial for information sharing objectives and network security. The secure portal for fusion centers allows for the communication of user roles, rights, and privileges to ensure network security and privacy. Congress may consider funding and leadership to provide this capability to all fusion centers. The QHSR report outlines the Nation's homeland security missions. The QHSR report outlines the Nation's homeland security missions, including preventing terrorism, securing borders, enforcing immigration laws, safeguarding cyberspace, and ensuring resilience to disasters. It calls for strengthening the homeland security enterprise by building awareness of risks, conducting risk assessments, enhancing information sharing, safeguarding privacy and civil rights, and promoting situational awareness in various domains. The QHSR report emphasizes the importance of integrating counterintelligence in homeland security to prevent attacks and promote a culture of cooperation. A review of the report and the upcoming \"bottom-up review\" will inform Congress on the latest homeland security risks and resource needs for DHS authorization. Former Secretary Chertoff highlights the significance of scientifically informed decisions and innovative technological solutions in addressing these risks. Former Secretary Chertoff emphasizes the importance of risk-based priorities for DHS as Congress considers an authorization bill. DHS defines risk as a combination of threat, vulnerability, and consequence. The DHS Intelligence Enterprise focuses on measuring and monitoring the threat variable. Challenges in generating useful threat judgments have been noted, with suggestions for improving collaboration between risk and intelligence analysts. Terrorism remains a top concern for the Department. The latest National Intelligence Estimate highlights Al Qa'ida as the most serious terrorist threat to the United States, focusing on prominent targets for mass casualties and economic impact. Aviation security received significant attention after the 9/11 attacks, with resources disproportionately allocated compared to other transportation modes. The 2006 Transatlantic Airlines Plot and the Christmas Day 2010 bombing attempt underscore ongoing security challenges. The 2006 Transatlantic Airlines Plot and the Christmas Day 2010 attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253 show the evolving threat to commercial aviation by terrorist groups with anti-Western ideologies. Other deadly attacks post-9/11 include Bali 2002, Madrid 2004, London 2005, and Mumbai 2008, all resulting in mass casualties and visually dramatic destruction. In the period from May 2009 to March 2010, there were 12 \"homegrown\" jihadist-inspired terrorist attacks and plots in the United States, involving American citizens or lawful permanent residents. This increase in domestic radicalization has raised concerns about potential attacks on softer targets such as nightclubs, commuter trains, and buses. The rise in domestic radicalization in the United States has sparked concerns about new methods of attack, including pyroterrorism. Australian scholar Mervyn Bendle warns of the extreme danger posed by pyroterrorism, which can cause harm to natural resources, infrastructure, economies, and populations. Bendle's study highlights the potential impact of pyroterrorism on society and political systems. Pyroterrorism, an \"Islamophobic\" notion, has been suspected in various countries including Greece, Israel, Spain, and Estonia. The Earth Liberation Front also conducted arson attacks in the late 1990s in the United States. Homeland security risk managers should consider alternative hypotheses to prevent a \"failure of imagination.\" Threat assessment is crucial for risk management and resource allocation in the evolving threat environment. Congress may need to explore how Intelligence and Analysis will support the Department's QHSR process. The Department is conducting a top-to-bottom review to align strategy with program and budget. Intelligence analysis guides funding priorities for homeland security programs, influencing funding levels. DHS aims to enhance collaboration between risk and intelligence analysts."
