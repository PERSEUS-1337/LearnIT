    "content": "The United States maintains economic sanctions on Sudan due to its support of terrorism, military dictatorship, and debt repayment issues. Sanctions include restrictions on foreign aid, trade treatment, commercial exports, defense exports, and financial support. The US also blocks arms sales to non-government entities as required by the United Nations. The US government enforces sanctions on Sudan, including blocking arms sales to non-government entities. Secretary of State Powell confirmed genocide in Darfur and froze assets of those involved in human rights atrocities. Congress also declared the situation in Darfur as genocide. The UN report on Darfur concluded that Sudan is not pursuing genocide. The report outlines UN actions and US economic sanctions on Sudan, imposed by Resolution 1556. The Security Council cited its authority under chapter VII of the UN Charter to address the crisis in Darfur. The Security Council issued UNSC Resolution 1556 to address the crisis in Darfur, calling on Sudan to facilitate relief efforts, investigate human rights violations, establish security conditions, and support peace talks. The resolution endorses the African Union's deployment of monitors and urges member states to support this effort. It also requires states to prevent arms sales to non-government entities in Sudan. The Security Council requested that Janjaweed militias be brought to justice for human rights violations in Darfur. Secretary General Kofi Annan will report on Sudan's progress monthly, with further action planned for non-compliance. Jan Pronk's report to the Security Council found no recent evidence linking Khartoum to the militias, which was criticized by the United States citing a contradictory African Union report. The African Union report contradicted Jan Pronk's assessment on Darfur, leading to a call for more observers in the region. Secretary of State Powell declared genocide in Darfur and called for a UN investigation, despite challenges in gaining support for sanctions from countries like China and Russia. Security Council Resolution 1564 was adopted on September 18, 2004, requesting a full investigation by Secretary General Annan. Resolution 1564 was adopted by the Security Council to establish an international commission of inquiry to investigate violations of international humanitarian and human rights law in Darfur, including acts of genocide. The resolution also supports the African Union's monitoring efforts and calls for member states to provide material and humanitarian support. Additionally, it declares the intent to impose restrictions on Sudan's oil industry and travel. The Security Council may impose sanctions on Sudan's oil industry and individuals in the government if they do not comply with UNSC Resolutions 1556 and 1564. An International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur was appointed in October 2004 to report on violations of international law and human rights, including genocide. The Commission found the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed responsible for serious violations. The Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed are responsible for serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in Darfur, including indiscriminate attacks, killing of civilians, torture, rape, and forced displacement. These acts may amount to crimes against humanity, resulting in extensive destruction and displacement, affecting countless women, men, and children. Many have been arrested, detained, and tortured, with the majority of victims being from the Fur and Zaghawa tribes. The International Commission of Inquiry found that the Government of Sudan did not pursue a policy of genocide in Darfur, but individuals, including government officials, may have committed acts with genocidal intent. The report called for a competent court to evaluate the evidence, leading to further scrutiny. The call for a \"competent court\" to evaluate evidence in Darfur led to international debate. The United States proposed an \"accountability tribunal\" or referral to the International Criminal Court, while Sudan wanted prosecutions in its own courts. Resolution 1591 required member states to prevent entry of identified individuals. Resolution 1591 requires member states to freeze assets of individuals impeding peace in Darfur. Resolution 1593 refers the situation to the International Criminal Court. Sudan has been denied U.S. foreign aid since 1988. Since 1988, Sudan has been denied U.S. foreign aid due to defaulting on debt, military overthrow of a democratically elected government, and support of international terrorism. However, humanitarian and food aid, averaging over $48 million annually from 1988 to 2001, are exempt from restrictions. The United States remains the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to Darfur, providing nearly $768 million from February 2003 to September 2005. The United States provided $768 million to NGOs in Darfur and the Chad/Sudan border from 2003 to September 2005. Funding was also given to support the African Union's deployment of cease-fire observers and human rights monitors in the region. The United Nations called for an increase in African Union forces to 7,700, with possible assistance from NATO, the European Union, and Ukraine. Sudan defaulted on its debt to the United States in December 1988, leading to a denial of most foreign assistance since then. The President can waive this restriction if it is in the U.S. national interest. Sudan's debt arrearage, support of international terrorism, and military dictatorship led to ineligibility for foreign assistance. President Bush denied aid to Sudan in 1990, pending a return to democracy. The President can waive the restriction if it serves U.S. national interest. Sudan's ineligibility for foreign assistance is due to its military dictatorship and support of international terrorism. Aid has been prohibited since FY1989, with specific restrictions in FY2005's foreign operations appropriations act. Sudan must have a democratically elected government in place to be eligible for U.S. debt restructuring programs. The foreign operations appropriations measure seeks to continue restrictions on aid to Sudan related to democracy, foreign military financing, and debt arrearage. It also includes funding for disease control programs and debt reduction in Sudan, contingent on disarming government-supported militia groups in Darfur. The Government of Sudan is subject to economic restrictions and a withdrawal of U.S. foreign aid due to its support for international terrorism. U.S. exporters need validated licenses for exports to Sudan, with a presumption of denial for certain goods. Sudan is generally denied foreign assistance and other forms of support. The Clinton administration removed food and medicine from sanctions policies, issued new regulations for countries like Iran, Libya, and Sudan, and enacted the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 to exempt food and medicine exports in sanctions regimes. Sudan, a state sponsor of terrorism, is denied foreign assistance and support. The US government prohibits financing of commercial exports to state sponsors of terrorism like Sudan, unless certified by the President for national security or humanitarian reasons. Economic and diplomatic prohibitions against Sudan have been layered over the years, denying access to funds and aid. President George H.W. Bush suspended trade preferences for Sudan in 1991 due to worker rights violations. In 1997, President Clinton imposed economic sanctions on Sudan for supporting terrorism, human rights violations, and destabilizing neighboring governments. The President has the authority to lift sanctions based on improved conditions. Executive Order 13067 was issued by President Clinton to impose sanctions on Sudan for human rights violations, including slavery and denial of religious freedom. The order blocks Sudanese government assets in the US and prohibits most transactions with Sudan, including imports, exports, grants, and loans. In November 2000, Congress adopted legislation to require the Secretary of the Treasury to consider approving licenses for the import of gum arabic from Sudan, a resin-based substance widely used in various industries. Sudan's monopoly on high-grade gum arabic caused devastation to the U.S. processing industry due to a prohibition under Executive Order 13067. The U.S. gum arabic processing industry was devastated by Sudan's monopoly on high-grade gum arabic, leading to economic sanctions imposed by President George W. Bush in 2003 for human rights violations. Sudan was restricted from nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related foreign assistance until compliance with minimum standards. Sudan was moved from Tier 3 to Tier 2 status in 2005 for efforts in combating trafficking, including prosecuting traffickers, protecting victims, and implementing anti-trafficking measures despite resource constraints and political challenges. Sudan was commended for its commitment to combat trafficking in persons, particularly in implementing a plan to end sexual violence against women in Darfur. Congress made efforts to distinguish between the government of Sudan and its people, allowing aid and commerce to reach the general population through the Assistance for International Malaria Control Act. The text chunk discusses the authorization for programs in Sudan to provide emergency relief, promote economic self-sufficiency, build civil authority, provide education, enhance rule of law, support reconciliation efforts, and implement peace agreements. It also exempts exports from areas outside the control of the Sudanese government from certain prohibitions. The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2005, limits economic sanctions in Sudan to areas under government control. The President can override aid restrictions for the population, excluding the National Democratic Alliance of Sudan from sanctions. Sanctions in Sudan under the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2005, allow for Economic Support Funds to be used to protect civilians from attacks by the Sudanese Government forces. The Sudan Peace Act requires the President to certify negotiations between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement every six months. The Sudan Peace Act instructs the President to impose economic and diplomatic sanctions on the Government of Sudan, including denying access to oil revenues and seeking a U.N. arms embargo. The President can lift the sanctions if good faith negotiations resume. The Act also allows for increased assistance to areas not controlled by the Sudanese government. The Sudan Peace Act instructs the President to impose sanctions on the Government of Sudan, including denying access to oil revenues and seeking a U.N. arms embargo. The Act also allows for increased assistance to areas not controlled by the Sudanese government, including support for civil administration, communications infrastructure, education, health, and agriculture. The President must suspend aid to the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) if negotiations are not in good faith or agreements are not honored, and suspend aid to the Government of Sudan if objectionable human rights behavior resumes. The Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act of 2004 authorizes the President to provide $100 million for FY2005 and unspecified amounts for the subsequent two years to support peace efforts. The Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act of 2004 authorizes the President to provide $100 million for FY2005 and unspecified amounts for the subsequent two years to support the implementation of a comprehensive peace agreement in Sudan, including the Darfur region. The Act also allows the President to use $200 million in FY2005 to address the humanitarian crisis in Darfur and eastern Chad, supporting the African Union mission in Darfur, with no assistance to the Government of Sudan. The Act requires the President to impose economic and diplomatic sanctions on Sudan within 30 days of enactment. The Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act of 2004 authorizes the President to waive implementation within 30 days of enactment if in the national interest. It continues restrictions on foreign aid unless specific conditions are met by the Government of Sudan, including steps to ensure human rights, disarm militias, allow humanitarian assistance, and allow an international inquiry into atrocities in Darfur. The Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act of 2004 authorizes an investigation of atrocities in Darfur, in line with UN Resolution 1564. It aims to identify perpetrators of violations of international law, ensure accountability, cooperate with international missions, facilitate the return of displaced persons, and implement peace agreements. The Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan was signed on June 5, 2004."
