    "content": "The Act titled \"Cytology Proficiency Improvement Act of 2007\" establishes revised standards for quality assurance in screening and evaluation of gynecologic cytology preparations. The Cytology Proficiency Improvement Act of 2007 sets new standards for quality assurance in gynecologic cytology laboratories, including requirements for continuing medical education programs for individuals involved in screening and interpreting cytological preparations. The American Academy of Continuing Medical Education provides gynecologic cytological preparations to improve skills and maintains records of cytology continuing medical education. The cytology continuing medical education program includes reviewing individual performance and providing remedial training when necessary. The laboratory must submit continuing education program results for each individual to the accrediting organization for review and monitoring, including plans for corrective action if needed. The amendment made by subsection (a) applies to gynecologic cytology services provided on or after the first day of the calendar year beginning 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary shall issue final regulations implementing such amendment not later than 270 days after such date of enactment. The Secretary shall terminate the individual proficiency testing program established pursuant to section 353(f)(4)(B)(iv) of the Public Health Service Act. The Public Health Service Act specifies the termination of the individual proficiency testing program at the end of the calendar year including the date of enactment of the amendment."
