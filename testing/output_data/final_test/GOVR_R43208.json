    "content": "The President signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of FY2015, allocating $3.066 billion for the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Block Grant program and a $500 million loan commitment ceiling for the CDBG Section 108 loan guarantee program. The CDF account includes CDBG and Section 108 loan guarantees, as well as funding for other initiatives supporting neighborhood revitalization and economic development. The CDF account includes formula-based grants allocated to entitlement communities, states, and insular areas for housing, community development, and economic development activities. The Obama Administration's FY2015 budget proposed $2.870 billion for CDF activities, a decrease of $230 million from the previous year. The Obama Administration's FY2015 budget proposed reducing total funding for CDF activities by $230 million to $2.870 billion. This budget also includes a 7.6% decrease in funding for CDBG formula grants, with $70 million allocated for competitively awarded CDBG funds to Indian tribes. Additionally, funding for Section 4 capacity building, Integrated Planning and Investment Grants, and Neighborhood Stabilization Program activities would be requested under separate HUD accounts. The Obama Administration's FY2015 budget proposed reducing total funding for CDF activities by $230 million to $2.870 billion. The Administration requested $2.800 billion for the CDBG formula component, with $70 million allocated for Indian tribes. Reforms to strengthen the CDBG program and enhance accountability were planned. The Obama Administration's FY2015 budget proposed reforms to the program, including reducing the number of small grantees and reforming the program's allocation formula. The budget recommended $75 million in funding for Regional Integrated Planning and Investment Grants (RIPIG) to allow grantees to achieve administrative savings and make strategic investment decisions. The FY2015 budget proposed reforms to the program, including $75 million for Regional Integrated Planning and Investment Grants (RIPIG) to support housing, transportation, economic development, and land use planning at the metropolitan level. The Administration did not fully explain how RIPIGs differed from previous proposals. Additionally, the budget included a $15 billion Project Rebuild program to assist communities affected by the mortgage foreclosure crisis. The Administration proposed expanding a program to assist communities affected by the mortgage foreclosure crisis, including commercial properties. Funds would be allocated to states and local governments for acquiring, rehabilitating, and reselling abandoned properties. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows borrowing for economic development and housing projects. The FY2015 budget proposed a loan commitment ceiling of $500 million with a fee-based access requirement. The Administration proposed expanding a program to assist communities affected by the mortgage foreclosure crisis, including commercial properties. Funds would be allocated to states and local governments for acquiring, rehabilitating, and reselling abandoned properties through the CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program. A fee of 2.42% of the loan amount will be charged after available credit subsidies are depleted, as approved by Congress in FY2014. HUD published notices in February 2015 regarding the fee structure, with proposed rules for future years when credit subsidies are insufficient. The House approved H.R. 4745 in June 2014. The House-passed bill recommended $3.060 billion for activities funded under the CDF account, including $3.0 billion for CDBG formula grants. This was $30 million less than the previous year's appropriation, $200 million more than requested by the Administration, and $20 million less than recommended by the Senate bill. An amendment was approved to protect the entitlement status of communities receiving CDBG grants. The House bill, H.R. 4745, did not include funds for a new round of Integrated Planning Grant activities. It supported converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based structure with a loan guarantee ceiling of $500 million. The bill also proposed funding Section 4 separately from the CDF account. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of the THUD Appropriations Bill for FY2015, recommending $3.090 billion for activities funded under the CDF account, including $3.020 billion for CDBG formula grants. This was $10 million less than the previous year's appropriation and $220 million more than requested by the Administration. The bill also supported funding for Indian tribes, mold remediation, Section 108 loan guarantee program, and Section 4 activities. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $3.090 billion for CDF activities in the FY2015 THUD Appropriations Bill, including $3.020 billion for CDBG formula grants. The bill did not support transferring the Section 4 program to a new account or funding the Administration's Neighborhood Stabilization Initiative proposal. It included a provision to prevent communities from exchanging CDBG funds for non-CDBG funds, aimed at stopping affluent communities like Beverly Hills from avoiding participation in the CDBG program. The bill also directed HUD to establish a $2 million demonstration program for developing a best practices database using CDBG funds. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2014 allocated $3 billion for CDBG formula grants, with $66 million set aside for the Indian CDBG program. This represents a 7% increase from the Administration's request but a 1% decline from the previous year. Additionally, a $2 million program was established to develop a best practices database using CDBG funds to aid communities in post-disaster recovery efforts. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2014 allocated $3 billion for CDBG formula grants, with $66 million set aside for the Indian CDBG program. The act appropriated $4 million less for the ICDBG program than in FY2014, with $6 million designated for mold remediation in Indian housing. It also supported a $500 million loan commitment ceiling for the CDBG Section 108 program and continued funding for capacity building activities, including $35 million for Section 4 activities. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2014 allocated $3 billion for CDBG formula grants, with $66 million for the Indian CDBG program. It did not support transferring the Section 4 program to a new account or fund the Administration's Neighborhood Stabilization Initiative proposal. The act included provisions on CDBG allocations and prohibited the use of CDF funds for certain projects. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2014 included $3.143 billion for activities funded under HUD's CDF account, representing 6.6% of the total budget authority requested. The proposed budget would have marginally increased funding for CDF activities by $8 million, while reducing funding for CDBG formula grants by $280 million to $2.798 billion. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2014 included $3.143 billion for activities funded under HUD's CDF account. This would have reduced funding for CDBG formula grants by $280 million to $2.798 billion. The budget proposal also included funding for regional planning grants and a new Neighborhood Stabilization Initiative. The Obama Administration's FY2014 budget requested $70 million for Indian tribes, a $13 million increase from FY2013. Additionally, $75 million was requested for Regional Integration Planning Grants under the Sustainable Communities Initiatives, which had not been funded in FY2012 or FY2013. The Obama Administration's FY2014 budget did not include funding requests for the Sustainable Communities Initiatives (SCI) components like Community Challenge Grants (CCG). Approximately $30 million was appropriated for CCG activities in FY2011. Funds were competitively awarded to selected communities for promoting sustainable growth through reforming building codes and zoning ordinances. The Sustainable Communities Initiatives (SCI) aimed to promote sustainable growth and discourage inefficient land use patterns through funding for local planning grants. However, Congress has not funded SCI activities since FY2011. The Obama Administration's FY2014 budget did not include funding requests for SCI components like Community Challenge Grants (CCG). The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 created the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) to assist states and local governments with abandoned and foreclosed properties. $3.92 billion in NSP-1 funds were allocated to 309 recipients based on foreclosure rates. NSP funds can be used to acquire, resell, demolish, and finance properties to revitalize neighborhoods and provide homeownership opportunities. Since the passage of HERA, Congress has appropriated additional funds for the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) to assist state and local governments in acquiring, rehabilitating, demolishing, and reselling abandoned and foreclosed properties. NSP-2 funds were awarded competitively to non-profit and for-profit entities in partnership with government entities, while NSP-3 funds were allocated based on a formula under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The NSP program, funded through the HERA, aims to help state and local governments address abandoned and foreclosed properties. Despite its success, there are still many such properties in some communities. The Obama Administration proposed an additional $200 million in NSP funds (NSP-4) to be awarded competitively to areas with high concentrations of vacant, foreclosed, abandoned, and blighted homes. Grantees would need to show need and the ability to leverage other funds for activities like acquisition, demolition, and land banking. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows states and entitlement communities to borrow up to five times their annual allocation for economic development, housing, public facilities, and infrastructure projects. The funds must support job creation and meet the national goals of the CDBG program, benefiting low or moderate income persons, preventing slums or blight, or addressing urgent threats to residents. The financing is secured by the community's current and future CDBG allocations and is tied to U.S. Treasury yields. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows states and entitlement communities to borrow up to five times their annual allocation for economic development, housing, public facilities, and infrastructure projects. The program is tied to U.S. Treasury yields and the Administration's budget proposed doubling the loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2014 to help finance job creation activities. Additionally, the Administration proposed charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program to eliminate the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $3.295 billion for CDF activities in FY2014, including $3.150 billion for CDBG formula grants. This was a 7% increase from the previous year, with additional funding for Indian tribes and mold remediation in Indian housing. The Senate committee bill recommended full funding for Integrated Planning Grants, conversion of Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program, and an increase in loan guarantee commitment to $500 million for FY2014. It also recommended continued funding for Section 4 activities at $35 million but did not support transferring the program to a new account. The bill did not include language supporting a minimum CDBG allocation. The House Appropriations Committee reported the THUD Appropriations Act for FY2014, recommending $1.697 billion for CDF activities, including $1.637 billion for CDBG formula grants. This was significantly less than the previous year's funding and the Senate bill recommendation. The bill did not include funding for the Administration's Neighborhood Stabilization Initiative proposal. H.R. 2610 recommended $10 million less than the Senate's $70 million for Indian tribes. The House approved an amendment increasing CDF funding by $350 million. The bill did not include funding for Integrated Planning Grant activities or the NSI proposal. It did support converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based structure. H.R. 2610 recommended a loan guarantee ceiling of $500 million and continued funding for Section 4 activities at $15 million. President Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2014, which included $3.100 billion for the Community Development Fund, with $3.030 billion allocated for formula-based Community Development Block Grants. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2014 allocated $3.1 billion for the Community Development Fund, with $3.03 billion for formula-based Community Development Block Grants. The act also included $70 million in competitively awarded funds for Indian tribes, but did not fund the Administration's Neighborhood Stabilization Initiative or Regional Integration Planning Grants. It continued funding for Section 4 activities at $35 million. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2014 allocated $3.1 billion for the Community Development Fund, with $3.03 billion for formula-based Community Development Block Grants. It continued funding for Section 4 activities at $35 million. P.L. 113-76 directs HUD to convert Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based, zero-subsidy program as requested by the Administration. HUD is directed to develop rules governing the imposition of a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2013 included $3.143 billion for activities funded under the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Fund (CDF) account, representing 8.9% of the total discretionary budget authority requested. The proposed budget would have increased funding for CDF activities by 4.5% or $135 million, including reinstating funding for regional planning initiatives and transferring funding for Section 4 capacity building activities. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget request included $100 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) and transferring $35 million for Section 4 capacity building activities to the Community Development Fund (CDF) account. The budget also requested $2.948.1 billion for the CDBG formula grants, with allocations for entitlement communities, state-administered programs, and others. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget included $882 million for CDBG entitlement communities, $882 million for CDBG state-administered programs, $7 million for insular areas, and $60 million for Indian tribes. Additionally, $100 million was requested for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to reinstate funding for program activities. The SCI, initially proposed in FY2010, would have received $46 million for Regional Integrated Planning Grants in up to 25 metropolitan areas. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget included funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to integrate planning requirements for sustainable communities with various federal agencies. Grant awards focused on housing, transportation, economic development, energy, and land use planning. Community Challenge Grants aimed to reform building codes and zoning ordinances for sustainable growth. $8 million was allocated for a research initiative on housing-transportation integration by HUD, DOT, and EPA. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget included funding for a joint HUD, DOT, and EPA research initiative to evaluate benefits of various efforts. Funds were allocated for long-term benefits evaluation of Regional Integrated Planning Grants and Community Challenge Grants. $3 million was requested for technical support in developing a residential energy modeling system, common energy standards, and sources of funds for energy efficiency improvements. The budget proposed doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling from $240 million to $500 million in FY2013. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget proposed increasing the program's loan commitment ceiling from $240 million to $500 million to help local governments finance job creation activities. The Administration also suggested charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program to eliminate the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $3.210 billion for activities funded under the CDF account, including $3.100 billion for CDBG formula grants. The bill recommended restoring funding for SCI activities with an appropriation of $50 million, half of the amount requested by the Administration. Additionally, the bill supported the conversion of Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program and increasing the loan guarantee commitment to $500 million for FY2013. The Senate committee bill also recommended continued funding of Section 4 for Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $3.404 billion for activities funded under the CDF account, including $3.344 billion for CDBG formula grants. This was 13% more than the previous year's appropriation and 8% more than the Senate bill. The bill also supported the Administration's $60 million funding request for Indian tribes. H.R. 5972 recommended just over $2 million for closeout and evaluation of previously awarded SCI awards, not supporting the Administration's budget request for Section 108 loan guarantees. It also recommended $6 million in loan subsidies for a $244 million loan guarantee ceiling, and continued funding for Section 4 activities at $35 million. The full House began floor consideration of the bill on June 27, 2012. During floor debate, several amendments were introduced calling for funding reductions or elimination of the CDBG and Section 108 loan guarantee programs, but none were approved. Amendments proposing funding reductions for salaries and expenses, reducing the House committee recommendation for the CDF, and eliminating funding for the CDF were all defeated. The 112th Congress considered appropriation measures for FY2013, including funding for the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. Several amendments proposing funding reductions or eliminations were introduced but defeated. A continuing resolution was signed into law, funding government agencies, including HUD, at 0.612% above their previous levels. The 113th Congress worked on completing the FY2013 appropriations process, with the House approving H.R. 933 for full-year government-wide appropriations. The bill proposed funding levels for programs like CDBG at FY2012 levels with reductions due to sequester measures. The Senate passed a substitute amendment with similar funding levels and maintained sequester-imposed reductions. The House and Senate approved H.R. 933 for FY2013 appropriations, including $3.1 billion for CDF activities. This included $3.078 billion for CDBG formula grants, a 4.4% increase from FY2012. Additionally, P.L. 113-2 was signed into law for disaster relief funding. The President signed P.L. 113-2 into law in 2013, allocating $16 billion for HUD's CDF, with $10 million transferred to the Inspector General for oversight. The act included a $10 million set aside for salaries and expenses for technical assistance. HUD could distribute CDBG disaster funds to areas affected by Hurricane Sandy and other disasters in 2011-2013. P.L. 113-2, signed into law in 2013, allocated $16 billion for HUD's CDF, with specific terms and conditions for the CDBG program related to disaster plans, fund allocation, and waiver authority. HUD was directed to establish regulations within 45 days, requiring grantees to submit approved disaster plans before funds could be used, ensuring financial controls, preventing duplication of benefits, and encouraging timely expenditure. P.L. 113-2, signed into law in 2013, allocated $16 billion for HUD's CDF, with specific terms and conditions for the CDBG program related to disaster plans, fund allocation, and waiver authority. The law aimed to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse, and directed HUD to allocate one-third of CDBG disaster appropriations to states and local government grantees within 60 days. Grantees could use up to 5% of their allocation for administrative expenses, but were prohibited from contracting out program administration. Additionally, grantees had to maintain a publicly accessible website detailing fund usage. P.L. 113-2, signed into law in 2013, allocated $16 billion for HUD's CDF, with specific terms and conditions for the CDBG program related to disaster plans, fund allocation, and waiver authority. The law aimed to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse, and directed HUD to allocate one-third of CDBG disaster appropriations to states and local government grantees within 60 days. Grantees could use up to 5% of their allocation for administrative expenses, but were prohibited from contracting out program administration. Additionally, grantees had to maintain a publicly accessible website detailing fund usage, contracting, and procurement processes. The law also ensured that regular CDBG allocations to states or communities would not be affected by disaster-assistance allocations. HUD was granted broad authority to waive or establish alternative program requirements, with exceptions for fair labor standards, fair housing, civil rights, and environmental review provisions. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA, P.L. 112-25) established discretionary spending limits for FY2012-FY2021, triggering automatic spending reductions through budget sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps for FY2013. The law allowed HUD to expedite fund release, reduce LMI-targeting requirements, and waive or establish alternative program requirements. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA, P.L. 112-25) established discretionary spending limits for FY2012-FY2021, triggering automatic spending reductions through budget sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) was required to implement across-the-board spending cuts to achieve budget reductions from both defense and nondefense funding. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) postponed spending reductions required by the sequestration process to March 1, 2013. President Obama ordered sequestration as mandated by the BCA, resulting in an $85 billion reduction in FY2013 discretionary spending, including a 5% reduction in funding for CDF activities. The OMB document identified a $965 million reduction in funding for CDF activities, including $800 million from CDBG disaster relief and $165 million from CDF FY2013 regular appropriations. The reductions in appropriations for formula grant activities from FY2011 to FY2013 led to a decline in the average grant amount for entitlement communities. The average grant amount awarded to entitlement communities decreased by 10.1% from FY2011 to FY2013, totaling $1.8 million in FY2013. This reduction in funding was less than the 45% proposed in the FY2014 Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act, which would have significantly impacted long-term community and economic development plans. The proposed funding reduction in H.R. 2610 would have undercut resources for non-profit organizations serving as CDBG sub-grantees, impacting public services like homeless shelters and job counseling. Supporters argue that the reduction disproportionately affects low and moderate income households, as communities are required to allocate at least 70% of funds to benefit them. The FY2012 appropriations for the CDBG program were the lowest in over a decade, leading to delays in projects and reduced support for entitlement communities. The average funding for CDBG program declined due to lower appropriations and more communities qualifying for entitlement status. Congress is unlikely to provide significantly higher funds, so options to address the decline include mitigating inflation impact and increasing eligible communities. The decline in average CDBG formula allocations could be addressed by raising the population threshold for entitlement city status, which would eliminate direct funding for hundreds of cities. This would result in many communities being included in their urban county's calculations instead. The Administration's FY2014 budget proposed eliminating funding for cities no longer meeting the minimum population threshold for entitlement status. The HUD proposal aimed to eliminate direct funding for entitlement cities with allocations below 0.0125% of the total, transitioning them to nonentitlement status by 2018. This would affect 239 communities in FY2014, with an additional 57 grandfathered cities losing entitlement status due to population changes. These cities could join their urban county's CDBG program instead. The HUD proposal aims to transition entitlement cities with low allocations to nonentitlement status. These cities could join their urban county's CDBG program to reduce costs and promote cooperation, or compete for state funds."
