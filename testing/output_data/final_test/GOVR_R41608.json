    "content": "Increasing numbers of animal and plant species are facing possible extinction due to habitat loss caused by various factors like development, climate change, and invasive species. The 1973 Endangered Species Act (ESA) is controversial as it aims to protect endangered and threatened species, but its provisions can impact both federal and nonfederal lands and resources. Congress must balance these interests with the protection of species and their ecosystems. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to protect species at risk of extinction and their habitats. Despite strong support and opposition, the ESA has not been reauthorized since 1992. Congressional efforts in subsequent sessions focused on specific controversial aspects of the ESA, but little legislation related to it was enacted. The ESA's express purpose is to conserve the ecosystems on which endangered and threatened species depend. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to protect species at risk of extinction by listing them as either endangered or threatened. More flexible management is provided for threatened species, while legal tools are available to aid in species recovery and protect habitat. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to protect species at risk of extinction by listing them as either endangered or threatened. Legal tools are available to aid in species recovery and protect habitat, leading to conflicts when not used. The ESA is administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), with a total of 1,234 animal species and 820 plant species listed as endangered or threatened. In the United States and its territories, 1,436 species are listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA, with 80% covered in active recovery plans. In FY2011, federal and state expenditures on these species totaled $1.59 billion, with top expenditures on species like steelhead, Pacific salmon, pallid sturgeon, bull trout, and red-cockaded woodpecker. Species evolve and fluctuate in abundance. Conservationists are increasingly focusing on ecosystems as units of interest, not just individual species. Efforts to protect declining species often reveal larger issues of resource scarcity and ecosystem alterations. Controversial past resource debates involving ESA-listed species include Tennessee's Tellico Dam, Pacific Northwest timber harvest, and the management of the Apalachicola Basin in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is the domestic legislation implementing the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Convention on Nature Protection and Wildlife Preservation in the Western Hemisphere. CITES categorizes species based on the risk trade poses to their survival, using three major categories, while ESA divides listed species into groups based on the estimated risk of extinction. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) implements CITES by classifying species based on trade risks. Violations of CITES are also violations of U.S. law under ESA. Both laws regulate wildlife trade to combat illegal activities. FWS's Multinational Species Conservation Fund supports conservation efforts for various endangered species. In the 112th Congress, legislation was proposed to strengthen protections for polar bears, sharks, and bluefin tuna under CITES. Various bills aimed to reauthorize conservation programs for elephants, rhinoceroses, tigers, migratory birds, great apes, and marine turtles through FY2017. Hearings were held on these bills in the House Natural Resources Subcommittee. In the 112th Congress, legislation was proposed to strengthen protections for various species under CITES. Bills aimed to reauthorize conservation programs for elephants, rhinoceroses, tigers, migratory birds, great apes, and marine turtles through FY2017. Hearings were held on these bills in the House Natural Resources Subcommittee. Additionally, discussions were held on the reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the delisting of species under the act. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been cited for reasons such as recovery, extinction, and original data errors. Some species that have recovered include the American alligator, bald eagle, and gray wolf. Extinct species include the dusky seaside sparrow and Guam broadbill. It can be challenging to determine if rare species are truly extinct. The ESA has faced criticism for only delisting 28 species due to recovery. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has faced criticism for delisting only 28 species due to recovery, while 10 species have been delisted because of extinction. Challenges in recovery efforts include habitat loss and invasive species. Priority is given to species in desperate situations, making recovery difficult. Despite this, some species have stabilized or increased populations, with 35 species downlisted from endangered to threatened. Overall, the ESA has shown success in improving population levels for 41% of listed species. According to studies, some species have improved or stabilized their population levels after listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Species like red wolves and California condors might not exist without ESA protection. Recovery objectives in species plans have shown varying rates of achievement over time. Conservation efforts may be underestimated as they do not consider species that would have deteriorated further without action. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) spends a significant portion of recovery funds on high-priority species. The GAO found that funding allocation for species recovery by FWS is influenced by factors other than priority ranking, with no routine assessment process in place. A House Committee oversight report critiqued the measurement of recovery under the Endangered Species Act. GAO's study on federal efforts to recover 31 species highlighted the importance of recovery plans in the process. Critics claimed bias in the GAO study on recovery planning. Despite progress in implementing recommendations, key issues remained unresolved, such as clarifying critical habitat roles and tracking consultation preparation time. NMFS released a report in 2011 summarizing recovery efforts for 64 species under its jurisdiction. In May 2012, the Center for Biological Diversity released a report on the recovery rates of 110 species protected by ESA, with 90% recovering as predicted. The House Committee on Natural Resources held a hearing on ESA in the 112th Congress, discussing potential impediments to recovery efforts. Controversies have arisen in various situations, such as the Florida panther, Klamath River Basin species, gray wolf, and Sonoran Desert bald eagles, leading to legal, economic, and social disputes. Critics question the rigor of science supporting ESA actions for rare and endangered species, citing challenges in studying hard-to-find species. Limited resources and personnel hinder research on lesser-known species, leading to debates on the role of science in species conservation. The cost and time required for comprehensive data collection further complicate decision-making processes. Courts have held that agencies must use the best available biological information when considering species for listing under the Endangered Species Act. The \"best scientific and commercial data available\" standard does not require absolute certainty, but rather proactive conservation measures before a species is at the brink of extinction. Agencies cannot ignore current data or treat species differently, and must not rely on uncertain future actions. The court emphasized the importance of utilizing the best scientific data available, not the best possible, to ensure agency decisions are not arbitrary. In Arizona Cattle Growers Association v. United States Fish and Wildlife Service, it was ruled that FWS must demonstrate a species' presence before regulating it and establish a causal connection between land use and harm to the species. Mere speculation is not sufficient. In July 2012, the Center for Biological Diversity found that peer reviews of ESA critical habitat designations may not be adequately considered by federal agencies. Congressional hearings were held in 2011 on the nexus of science and policy under ESA, as well as the scientific basis for fisheries restrictions and critical habitat designations for certain species. The debate over science and the Endangered Species Act (ESA) includes discussions on expanding critical habitat designation for the Santa Ana sucker by FWS. H.R. 4301 proposed amending the ESA to consider \"best scientific and economic data available,\" including costs and benefits analysis. Some suggest using the ESA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, but no court opinion has addressed this issue yet. The argument is that listed species could be impacted by emissions from sources like coal-fired power plants, potentially violating ESA Section 9. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) could potentially be used to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from sources like coal-fired power plants, impacting listed species' habitats. However, court cases have not yet addressed this issue directly, with some challenges related to federal projects involving power plants. The ESA has not been consistently used as an enforcement tool for climate change arguments. Despite no direct court cases addressing ESA claims related to greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, regulatory changes were made in December 2008 to limit lawsuits based on climate change impacts on listed species. Definitions were modified to state that consultation on greenhouse gas emissions' contribution to global warming and its impacts on species was not required. The regulatory changes in December 2008 limited lawsuits based on climate change impacts on listed species, including the polar bear. The polar bear rule restricts lawsuits to instances where the agency action occurs in Alaska, despite the species being listed due to habitat loss from climate change. The law allowing revocation of these regulations did not lead to action on the polar bear rule. On December 7, 2010, FWS designated 187,000 square miles in Alaska as critical habitat for polar bears. Conservation efforts face challenges due to dwindling open space and increasing human populations. Regional resource issues related to the ESA have sparked controversy, such as the Bureau of Reclamation's decision in 2001 regarding Klamath irrigation water. The Bureau of Reclamation announced it would not release water from part of its Klamath irrigation project to protect endangered fish species. This decision has sparked conflicts between upstream farmers and downstream salmon fishery advocates. The Bureau of Reclamation faces challenges in meeting irrigation contract obligations while protecting endangered fish species in the Klamath basin. Political intervention allegations and a Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement have further complicated the issue. The Klamath River stakeholders negotiated an agreement in 2010 to address water management conflicts. A related Hydropower Settlement Agreement could lead to the removal of four dams blocking salmon and steelhead spawning areas. Congress considered supporting these agreements through H.R. 3398 / S. 1851 for Klamath Basin restoration. Wolf population protection has fluctuated since 2003. The wolf population protection has been a contentious issue since 2003, with multiple attempts by FWS to delist wolf populations being rejected by courts. Various DPS designations and delistings have been nullified and vacated, leading to a complex regulatory and legal saga. In December 2008, FWS returned wolves in the Western Great Lakes and parts of the Northern Rocky Mountains to their former protected status, eliminating DPS designations. Wolves in southern Montana, southern Idaho, and all of Wyoming were designated as \"nonessential experimental populations.\" FWS established DPSs in the Western Great Lakes and Northern Rockies in April 2009, delisting both populations except in Wyoming. Legal challenges led to the Western Great Lakes wolves returning to threatened or endangered status, while a court ruled the Northern Rockies delisting violated the ESA, returning them to experimental population status. Congress approved language in P.L. 112-10 (H.R. 1473) to reissue a final rule without judicial review, affecting the status of wolves in the Western Great Lakes and Northern Rockies. The final rule issued in November 2010 by the District of Wyoming returned to the April 2009 rule, delisting gray wolves in the Northern Rockies except for Wyoming. This made the gray wolf the 49th species to be delisted under the ESA, but it remained listed in other states. FWS had previously attempted to delist the species based on scientific support, and the species had met and exceeded numeric goals. The final rule issued in November 2010 delisted gray wolves in the Northern Rockies except for Wyoming. The science supported delisting and the species had met numeric goals. FWS proposed delisting wolves in the Western Great Lakes and recognizing wolves in the eastern states as a different species. The eastern wolf (Canis lycaon) is being reviewed by the Service to establish its status as a distinct species in the United States and Canada. Proposed bills in Congress, such as H.R. 509 and S. 249, aim to amend the ESA to eliminate wolf protection, while H.R. 510 seeks to prohibit gray wolf protection. These proposals may face litigation and congressional attention. H.R. 510 and S. 321 proposed changes to the ESA regarding gray wolf protection in Idaho and Montana. H.R. 838 also addressed wolf protection in the Great Lakes area. H.R. 1819 aimed to allow state management of gray wolf populations. H.R. 2584 included provisions regarding the status of gray wolves in Wyoming and the Western Great Lakes Distinct Population Segment. The gray wolf population segment not endangered or threatened may be managed by states under agreements with the Secretary of the Interior, exempt from judicial review. H.R. 3453 proposed permits for wolf takings to prevent depredation in states exceeding recovery goals. The Delta smelt, a threatened fish species in California's Bay-Delta, has seen a drastic decline due to various factors like water export pumps and competition from exotic species. The decline of the delta smelt in California's Bay-Delta is attributed to factors like water export pumps, competition from exotic species, warmer water temperatures, toxic contaminants, habitat changes, and food supply alterations. The impact of pumping changes on delta smelt has led to reduced water supply for users, triggering consultation under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). This has resulted in controversy over reduced pumping and water availability. In 2004, an ESA Section 7 consultation was initiated between FWS and the Bureau of Reclamation to address the impact of pumping changes on delta smelt. FWS issued a no-jeopardy BiOp in 2004, re-issued in 2005 to address critical habitat issues. In 2007, the FWS BiOp was found non-compliant with ESA, leading to consultation reinitiation. Interim protective measures were implemented in 2007, and a revised BiOp was issued in 2008, determining that water projects in the Bay-Delta were likely to jeopardize delta smelt's existence. In 2008, FWS issued a revised BiOp stating that water projects in the Bay-Delta were likely to jeopardize the delta smelt's existence. This led to reduced water deliveries for users south of the Delta, sparking controversy and litigation over reasonable and prudent alternatives (RPAs). The 112th Congress focused on oversight of proposals to change operations for the Central Valley Project and concerns over environmental and economic damages from federal water project operations. In the 112th Congress, various bills were introduced to address ESA compliance for the Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project, but only H.R. 1837 made progress in the House before stalling. In the 112th Congress, H.R. 1837 made progress in the House regarding ESA compliance for the Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project. However, other bills like H.R. 1287, S. 1720, and S. 706 aimed to prohibit restrictions on project operations under certain conditions, highlighting conflicts between ESA regulations and property owners' economic desires. The issue of property \"taking\" under ESA has been a central concern, despite mechanisms intended to soften its impact. The Supreme Court struggles to define government actions that constitute a \"taking\" of private property without just compensation. Government actions are considered a taking if they result in a permanent physical occupation of property or a total elimination of its economic use. A three-factor balancing test is used when only part of the property's use or value is affected. Lower court decisions indicate that a severe impact on the property as a whole is necessary for a taking to occur. Despite challenges to ESA restrictions on property, most court decisions have not found a taking. Court decisions have mostly not found a taking in challenges to ESA restrictions on property, with restrictions on timber cutting, water delivery, shooting animals, and transport/sale of endangered species. Taking claims failed due to wrong court filings or lack of ripeness. When reached, claims were rejected due to insufficient economic impact or government not being responsible for wild animal actions. Only two decisions favored property owners, one involving reduced water delivery for listed fish. The court decision regarding reduced water delivery for listed fish has been challenged, with the trial court dismissing the case as not ripe. Critics in the 1990s sought to amend the ESA to provide compensation for property impacts beyond what the Constitution allows. The Constitution does not specify a fixed percentage of ESA-related property value loss for compensation. Concerns have been raised about consultation and biological opinions on pesticides affecting ESA-listed Pacific salmon. Illegal online sales of about 10% of ESA-listed plants have been reported. Congressional hearings have been held on pesticide registration consultations, litigation impeding recovery efforts, and the cost of attorney fees in ESA litigation. The 112th Congress addressed various issues related to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), including legislation to exempt state transportation departments from ESA consultation requirements for construction projects. Additionally, provisions in bills such as H.R. 7 and H.R. 4348 aimed to exempt state highway and public transportation projects from ESA regulations under certain conditions. The 112th Congress considered legislation to exempt state transportation projects from Endangered Species Act (ESA) consultation requirements. Various bills proposed exemptions for road, highway, and bridge reconstruction after declared emergencies. However, these provisions were not included in the final legislation. The 112th Congress considered legislation to exempt state transportation projects from Endangered Species Act (ESA) consultation requirements. H.R. 1837 and S. 2365 proposed exemptions for high-speed rail projects and the Central Valley Project, respectively. H.R. 1837 would have repealed the San Joaquin Restoration Settlement and S. 2365 would have declared ESA not to apply to certain projects. The House considered legislation regarding the protection of salmon in the Columbia River, including bills to reduce marine mammal predation and require a study on federal salmon recovery actions. The House considered legislation on federal salmon recovery actions, including authorizing the removal of Lower Snake River dams and declaring oil shale management regulations compliant with ESA. H.R. 3408 was reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources with ESA provisions in Section 2 and passed by the House on February 16, 2012. Title III of H.R. 4089, S. 1066, and Section 102 of S. 3525 aimed to amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act to allow importation of polar bear trophies from Canada. H.R. 991, H.R. 4089, and H.R. 4043 were discussed and passed by the House Committee on Natural Resources in 2011 and 2012. H.R. 4043 proposed special management areas for southern sea otters to accommodate military activities. On April 19, 2012, the House Natural Resources Subcommittee held a hearing on military readiness activities. The House passed H.R. 4310 on May 18, 2012, amending it to include language from H.R. 4043. Various sections of different bills directed the Secretary of the Interior to assign personnel for coordinating federal permits for oil and gas projects. On June 15, 2012, the House Committee on Natural Resources reported H.R. 4383, which would have prohibited funds from being used to modify pesticide registration in response to a biological opinion. H.R. 6083 also placed conditions on pesticide registration changes in response to a biological opinion. Additionally, H.R. 1505 and H.R. 2578 extended the Secretary of Homeland Security's authority to waive ESA within 100 miles of U.S. borders. The House Committee on Natural Resources reported bills related to protecting species under the ESA and prohibiting spilling water at federal dams to protect endangered fish. Resolutions were passed to designate \"American Eagle Day\" in 2011 and 2012 to celebrate the recovery of the bald eagle. The Senate agreed to designate June 20, 2012, as \"American Eagle Day\" to celebrate the recovery of the bald eagle. Legislation proposed scientific review of regulations impacting public health and the environment under the Endangered Species Act. Other bills aimed to assess the impact of ESA listing on forest fuel loads and include wildfire risk analysis in recovery plans for endangered species. S. 962 and H.R. 1858 would reauthorize the Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative Act, authorizing county Marine Resources Committees to assist in identifying local implications for ESA-listed Puget Sound salmon recovery. H.R. 909 and H.R. 3302 would declare compliance with ESA for the Draft Proposed OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2010-2015. H.R. 4094/S. 2372 and H.R. 2578 would restrict ESA implementation at Cape Hatteras National Seashore Recreation Area. The House Committee on Natural Resources reported H.R. 4094 (H.Rept. 112-526, Part I) and H.R. 4019, which declared environmental reports by the Secretary of Agriculture for certain Forest Service lands would suffice as compliance with ESA. S. 826, H.R. 1907, and S. 1401 aimed to establish programs for habitat conservation and salmon management. The House Committee on Natural Resources reported bills amending the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to provide exceptions for actions against grizzly bears in self-defense, establish procedures for settlement approvals, and require species to be treated as extinct if population does not increase within 15 years. Additionally, a provision in H.R. 5326 would have prohibited FY2013 funds expenditure by the Department of Interior. The House Committee on Natural Resources reported bills amending the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to provide exceptions for actions against grizzly bears in self-defense, establish procedures for settlement approvals, and require species to be treated as extinct if population does not increase within 15 years. H.R. 4244 directed the Secretary of the Interior to issue a final decision on a permit for an elementary school in San Diego, CA. Amendments to S. 782 proposed exemptions for species from ESA. H.R. 2973 and S. 1580 aimed to amend the special rule to permit taking of the Utah prairie dog under ESA. Various bills provided temporary exemptions from ESA restrictions in emergencies and required compliance by federal defense agencies. Section 3 of H.R. 332 would have required federal defense agencies to comply with environmental laws, including the Endangered Species Act (ESA). H.R. 1806 aimed to exclude bluefin tuna from being listed as endangered or threatened. H.R. 6474 sought to eliminate the income tax deduction for endangered species recovery expenses. Various bills addressed specific issues such as validating a patent for Nevada lands important for desert tortoise recovery, amending ESA to prevent listing of certain salamander species in Texas, and declaring May 18, 2012, as \"Endangered Species Day.\" Appropriations are crucial for funding ESA activities and consultations for federal projects. The Administration's FY2012 request for endangered species and related funding within FWS's Ecological Services Account was released on February 14, 2011. FWS asked Congress to add a cap on funding for processing new ESA petitions. The House Committee on Appropriations proposed significantly lower FY2012 funding for many ESA programs and policy restrictions under H.R. 2584. The FY2012 funding for ESA programs was proposed to be reduced significantly under H.R. 2584, with restrictions on funding for ESA listing and critical habitat activities. President Obama threatened to veto the bill due to specific provisions limiting ESA activities. On July 27, 2011, H.Amdt. 735 was adopted, removing funding limitations for ESA listing and critical habitat. President Obama signed P.L. 112-74 (H.R. 2055) on December 23, 2011, providing over $237 million for FWS endangered species programs in FY2012. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposed a $3.7 million increase for endangered species programs in FWS's Ecological Services account. The Administration proposed a $12.3 million increase for the Cooperative Endangered Species Fund in FY2013. The House Committee on Appropriations reported significantly reduced funding for most ESA programs in H.R. 6091. A continuing resolution, P.L. 112-175, provided FY2013 funding at the FY2012 level until March 27, 2013. NMFS funding for ESA programs is included under \"protected species research and management.\" The Administration's FY2012 request for endangered species funding was released in February 2011. The House proposed a significant reduction in funding for NMFS's Protected Species Program, while the Senate proposed a smaller cut. The Senate later passed a bill that included the Senate's proposed funding reduction. On November 1, 2011, the Senate passed H.R. 2112 with funding for protected species programs slightly over $176 million, $40 million less than requested. President Obama signed P.L. 112-55 on November 18, 2011. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposed a decrease in funding for NMFS's protected species programs. On April 19, 2012, the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended an increase in funding for Protected Species by $14.3 million. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended a decrease in FY2012 funding for Protected Species by $15.8 million (-9.3%) from the Administration's proposal. The House passed H.R. 5326 with amendments, and a continuing resolution provided FY2013 funding at the FY2012 level until March 27, 2013."
