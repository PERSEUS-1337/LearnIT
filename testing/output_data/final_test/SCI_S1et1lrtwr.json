The performance of these algorithms depends on the tasks available for meta-training, similar to how supervised learning generalizes best to test points from the same distribution as training points. Automating task design can lead to truly automated meta-learning algorithms. This work proposes a family of unsupervised meta-learning algorithms for reinforcement learning. Unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning offers accelerated learning without manual task design, surpassing learning from scratch. Meta-learning methods optimize for rapid adaptation by reusing past experience. In the context of reinforcement learning, meta-reinforcement learning algorithms can quickly solve new tasks through past experience without the need for a pre-specified task distribution. The performance of these algorithms depends on the meta-training task distribution, which influences how well they generalize to new tasks.

The paper introduces a framework for unsupervised meta-RL algorithms that automate meta-training without manual task design, improving performance compared to standard RL methods. Metalearning algorithms use data from multiple tasks to learn rapid adaptation procedures from experience, extending into the setting of RL. Performance depends on the meta-training task distribution, but the paper aims to provide a general recipe for avoiding manual task engineering by using unsupervised task proposals. The paper discusses unsupervised task proposals for meta-RL, utilizing methods like adversarial goal generation and information-theoretic approaches. Exploration methods for novel states are related to goal generation but focus on state space coverage rather than task generation or quick adaptation. Model-based RL methods are also mentioned as complementary approaches. The paper introduces unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning, which allows for solving arbitrary tasks at meta-test time without task parameterization or goal specification. The theoretical derivation first focuses on goal reaching before extending to general tasks, providing advantages over the goal reaching paradigm. Unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning aims to tailor a learning algorithm for specific environments without human supervision. It assumes tasks share dynamics but have different reward functions, using a controlled Markov process (CMP) for modeling. Unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning involves learning new tasks efficiently in Markov decision processes defined by a controlled Markov process (CMP) with unknown reward functions. The goal is to output a learning algorithm that can adapt to different environments without human supervision. Unsupervised meta-RL involves optimizing a fast learning algorithm on a known task distribution. The framework includes a task proposal mechanism and a meta-learning method based on a mapping from a latent variable to a reward function. Unsupervised meta-RL involves optimizing a fast learning algorithm on a task distribution by mapping a latent variable to a reward function. The meta-learning algorithm learns a RL algorithm that can quickly adapt to any task from the distribution. The meta-learning algorithm in unsupervised meta-RL quickly adapts to new tasks at meta-test time using a learned learning function. This generic approach, illustrated in Figure 1, collects meaningful information about the environment even without a reward function. The meta-learning algorithm in unsupervised meta-RL quickly adapts to new tasks at meta-test time using a learned learning function. This approach collects important information about the environment, such as policies, state distances, and dynamics models. The meta-learner can learn non-human-interpretable information for faster adaptation. The goal is to formulate an optimal unsupervised meta-learner that minimizes regret on new meta-test tasks without prior knowledge. This algorithm can train without hand-specifying task distributions and may use f to inform task acquisition. In this paper, the stagewise approach is considered for meta-learning, acquiring a task distribution once and meta-training on it. An optimal meta-learner is defined as one that minimizes expected regret when learning tasks from the same distribution. The task distribution is defined by a variable z \u223c p(z) and a reward function r z (s, a) : S \u00d7 A \u2192 R. The optimal meta-learner optimizes where p(r z ) is a. An optimal meta-learner minimizes expected regret by optimizing a distribution over reward functions. The behavior of the meta-learner depends on the task distribution, such as manipulating a robot's arms or legs. Inferring new tasks and acquiring policies for each task is essential, along with leveraging an internal model of the environment. In the context of optimizing a distribution over reward functions, the focus shifts to constructing unsupervised meta-learning algorithms based on the training task distribution. The goal-reaching setting involves episodes with a finite horizon and a discount factor, where tasks involve reaching an unknown goal state. The assumption is made that goal states are drawn from a known distribution, with the aim to later eliminate this dependency. The text discusses optimizing a distribution over reward functions in a goal-reaching setting where goal states are assumed to be drawn from a known distribution. It introduces the concept of a meta-learner f \u03c0 that explores using a policy \u03c0 until the goal state is found, incurring regret for each step before finding the goal. The expected hitting time of the goal state is defined as HITTINGTIME \u03c0 (s g ) = 1 \u03c1 T \u03c0 (s g ). In a goal-reaching setting, an optimal meta-learner explores until finding the goal state, choosing the trajectory that reaches it under deterministic dynamics. The cumulative regret is the episodes needed to find the goal state. The meta-learner cannot use information about multiple goals within a single episode. The optimal meta-learner's policy satisfies certain conditions. The optimal meta-learner explores with a uniform state marginal distribution to minimize worst-case regret. This exploration policy corresponds to training on a goal-reaching task distribution with uniformly distributed goals. Constructing this distribution is challenging. The key idea is to propose uniformly-distributed goals as tasks during unsupervised meta-training by maximizing mutual information between z and the final state s T. This can be achieved by defining a joint distribution \u00b5(s T , z) implicitly via a latent-conditioned policy, which becomes part of the task proposal mechanism. The task proposal mechanism involves defining a joint distribution \u00b5(s T , z) using a latent-conditioned policy. A task proposal distribution is then created by sampling z \u223c p(z) and using a reward function based on p(s T | z). This process is independent of the action a T. In the case of uniform prior and marginal distributions, the reward function is equivalent to DIAYN. Maximizing mutual information leads to sampling goals uniformly. Meta-learning on a uniform goal distribution produces the minimax-optimal meta-learner. Trajectory-matching tasks generalize goal-reaching tasks by rewarding optimal trajectories. This analysis extends to derive a framework for optimal unsupervised meta-learning. Trajectory matching tasks are more general than goal-reaching tasks, as they can involve reaching a goal while avoiding obstacles or reaching a goal in a specific manner. For CMPs with deterministic dynamics, non-Markovian tasks require an RL algorithm to guess the optimal policy and only receive a reward if their behavior aligns perfectly with that policy. Mutual information between z and trajectories provides the minimum regret solution in this scenario. Unsupervised meta-learning for trajectory-matching tasks is as challenging as for general tasks, with a defined distribution of trajectory-matching tasks. In trajectory matching tasks, a distribution over goal trajectories is defined. The hitting time and regret are then calculated based on this distribution. The optimal meta-learner's exploration policy is derived, but in cases where the trajectory distribution is unknown, a uniform policy is recommended to minimize regret. Learning skills with a trajectory-level mutual information objective helps in acquiring a policy with a uniform trajectory distribution. The optimal meta-learner for trajectory-matching tasks involves a uniform distribution over trajectories, leading to a minimax-optimal meta-learner. Learning skills with a trajectory-level mutual information objective helps in achieving this optimal policy. Trajectory-matching is a super-set of optimizing Markovian reward functions at test-time. Trajectories from non-Markovian policies may not be unique optima for Markovian reward functions. Regret on trajectory-level reward functions bounds regret on state-action level reward functions. Maximizing one side of the inequality gives a lower bound on the other side. This bound is loose due to the set of all Markovian reward functions. When considering meta-learning on all possible reward functions, the bound on trajectory-matching tasks becomes tight. In this scenario, optimal meta-learners aim to reach a goal or follow a specific trajectory at each episode, making intermediate states uninformative. Meta-learning algorithms that explore through posterior sampling are optimal for such problems. The analysis in the current section sheds light on optimal meta-learning algorithms and their exploration strategies for unsupervised task proposals. This approach offers advantages over traditional algorithms by accommodating arbitrary reward functions and utilizing intermediate states for more effective exploration. In the analysis, optimal meta-learners are introduced and their exploration behavior and regret on goal-reaching problems are examined. It is shown that the optimal meta-training task distribution for minimizing worst-case test-time regret is uniform over the space of goals. This distribution can be obtained through a mutual information maximization scheme. The analysis is extended to matching arbitrary trajectories as a proxy for arbitrary reward functions. A practical algorithm for unsupervised meta-learning is derived from this analysis, involving a task proposal mechanism based on mutual information objectives. The task proposal mechanism is based on mutual information objectives, including mutual information between states and z, pairs of start and end states and z, and entire trajectories and z. The algorithm uses DIAYN to extract task reward functions and updates them using MAML. DIAYN optimizes mutual information by training a discriminator network that predicts the latent-conditioned policy. The task proposal distribution is defined by log(D(z|s)). The unsupervised meta-learning algorithm follows a specific recipe. The unsupervised meta-learning algorithm utilizes DIAYN to acquire task proposals and MAML to learn a fast learning algorithm for quick adaptation to new tasks. The algorithm suggests that meta-RL methods based on posterior sampling may not be optimal for some tasks, hence MAML is chosen. The learning algorithm returned by MAML involves running gradient descent with the initialized parameters. The initialization of a learning algorithm is crucial, as discussed in prior work by Finn & Levine (2017). Random task proposals with a random reward function can be useful for simple tasks in unsupervised meta-RL, but become less effective for complex tasks. This supports the idea that even simple task proposals can accelerate learning in the meta-learning process. In experiments, we investigate if unsupervised meta-learning can accelerate RL on new tasks. Unlike standard meta-learning, our approach learns task distribution through unsupervised interaction. We compare it to learning from scratch and a standard meta-learning approach with a manually designed task distribution. Two variants of our approach are evaluated using DIAYN for task acquisition and meta-learning on 2D navigation Half-Cheetah Ant. Unsupervised meta-learning accelerates task acquisition using DIAYN and meta-learning on 2D navigation Half-Cheetah Ant. Results show faster learning compared to learning from scratch, especially on complex tasks. The approach outperforms learning with DIAYN initialization or policy pretrained with VIME. The study includes three simulated environments: 2D point navigation, 2D locomotion with HalfCheetah, and 3D locomotion with Ant. The study includes three simulated environments: 2D point navigation, 2D locomotion with HalfCheetah, and 3D locomotion with Ant. The evaluation tasks involve navigating to goal positions and running at different goal velocities. Default hyperparameters for MAML were used across tasks with varying meta-batch sizes. The default architecture of a 2 layer MLP with 300 units each and ReLU non-linearities worked well for meta-training. The study utilized a 2 layer MLP with 300 units and ReLU non-linearities for meta-training. Default hyperparameters for DIAYN were used, and ADAM with adaptive step size was found to be the most stable for learning from scratch. Unsupervised meta-learning outperformed learning from scratch and VIME-init, indicating the effectiveness of environment-specific priors in accelerating learning on new tasks. In experiments, UML-DIAYN outperforms learning from scratch and other optimization methods. Comparisons show that unsupervised meta-learning with DIAYN can match hand-designed task distributions in performance. In experiments, handcrafted meta-learning performs well initially but is matched by unsupervised meta-RL with DIAYN. Handcrafted meta-learning outperforms UML-DIAYN on the ant task due to the challenging task distribution. The DIAYN-based variant generally achieves the best performance in unsupervised meta-learning. Unsupervised meta-learning with DIAYN shows effectiveness in learning an environment prior, even with a random discriminator version providing competitive advantages over learning from scratch. The performance suggests that simply interacting with the environment allows meta-RL to learn effective adaptation strategies, indicating that task distribution alone does not explain the performance. Unsupervised meta-RL accelerates learning by acquiring an efficient RL procedure through meta-learning without hand-specified task distributions. Task proposals based on mutual information maximization can lead to a minimum worst-case regret meta-learner. Experiments show that this approach outperforms learning from scratch and matches the performance of conventional meta-learning algorithms. Our work on unsupervised meta-RL raises questions about algorithms for meta-learning without hand-specified task distributions. Extending the analysis to stochastic dynamics and more realistic tasks could lead to more intelligent learning algorithms. The worst-case regret for a policy \u03c0 with non-uniform \u03c1 T \u03c0 is greater than for a uniform \u03c0. The optimal policy must have a uniform marginal \u03c1 T \u03c0 for minimax. Mutual information is maximized by a uniform task distribution over goal states. The entropy H p [s T | z] is minimized when each latent variable z corresponds to one final state, while the marginal entropy H p [s T ] is maximized when the distribution is uniform. A uniform task distribution maximizes mutual information I(s T ; z). The optimal task distribution must be uniform to achieve the smallest conditional entropy. Additionally, an ablation study compares meta-test performance of policies at different iterations during meta-training to show the impact of additional training on fast learning for new tasks. At iteration 0 of meta-training, the policy is not a good initialization for new tasks. However, with further meta-training, the meta-learned initialization becomes more effective at learning new tasks, leading to improved meta test-time performance. The learned meta-training task distribution and evaluation tasks are compared, showing that while the meta-training distribution is broad, it does not fully cover the evaluation tasks. Nonetheless, meta-learning on this learned task distribution enables improved performance on new tasks. The meta-learning approach enables efficient learning on test task distributions by analyzing tasks discovered through unsupervised exploration. Tasks proposed via unsupervised exploration provide broad coverage but are distinct from meta-test tasks, suggesting tolerance for distributional shift. The study utilized unsupervised exploration to propose tasks for evaluation, showing that unsupervised task acquisition can be effective for meta-training, even when tasks do not closely match the discovered distribution. The tasks were acquired using DIAYN with specific skills for different environments, and fed into the MAML algorithm for evaluation. The study used unsupervised exploration to generate tasks for evaluation, demonstrating the effectiveness of unsupervised task acquisition for meta-training. Tasks were acquired using DIAYN with specific skills for different environments and inputted into the MAML algorithm for assessment. Parameters for test time learning were consistent across UMRL variants, utilizing REINFORCE with the Adam optimizer for comparison with learning from scratch."
