    "content": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers various programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty and contracting programs, direct loans for disaster recovery, and management training. Congressional interest in these programs has grown due to their potential to boost economic growth. The SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program, operational since 1971, aims to increase small businesses' access to government and private-sector contracts by guaranteeing bid, performance, and payment bonds. The SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program guarantees bid, performance, and payment bonds for small contractors. The program guarantees individual contracts up to $6.5 million, with a federal officer certifying up to $10 million if necessary. The SBA's guarantee ranges from 80% to 90% of the surety's loss in case of default. In FY2018, the SBA guaranteed 10,800 bid and final surety bonds totaling nearly $6.5 billion. The Surety Bond Guarantee Program, representing a small percentage of the market, involves a three-party agreement between a surety, contractor, and project owner. It reduces contracting risks and encourages project owners to work with small businesses. Surety bonds come in four general types, including bid bonds. Surety bonds are essential for small businesses seeking federal contracts over $150,000 for construction projects. There are four main types: bid bonds, payment bonds, performance bonds, and ancillary bonds. Bid bonds ensure the bidder will enter the contract, payment bonds guarantee payment to suppliers, performance bonds ensure contract completion, and ancillary bonds cover additional requirements. Performance and payment bonds are required for federal contracts over $150,000 to protect the government and suppliers. The bonds must be issued by a satisfactory surety and have penal amounts of 100% of the contract price. State and local governments have similar legislation, and private project owners also often require surety bonds. The SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program has evolved over time, including the introduction of the Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program (PSB program) with a lower guarantee rate for SBA-approved sureties. Legislation such as P.L. 114-92 increased the PSB program's guarantee rate to 90% of losses. The program's bond limit has also been raised. The Surety Bond Guarantee Program, authorized by P.L. 91-609, allows the SBA to guarantee sureties against losses from bond breaches. The program's eligibility standards, performance statistics, and bond guarantees issued annually are examined. The program covers bid, payment, and performance bonds for small businesses up to $500,000. The Surety Bond Guarantee Program, authorized by P.L. 91-609, allows the SBA to guarantee sureties against losses from bond breaches for small businesses. The program requires specific conditions to be met for the bond guarantee, including the small business being unable to obtain the bond on reasonable terms without the guarantee, meeting SBA requirements for contract feasibility, and having reasonable terms and conditions for the bond. The SBA's guarantee cannot exceed 90% of the surety's loss in case of breach. The SBA was authorized to finance the Lease and Surety Bond Guarantee Revolving Fund with $5 million from its Business Loan and Investment Revolving Fund, raising the fund's capital to $10 million. The program could receive up to $1.5 million annually for three years if needed. The SBA was directed to administer the program prudently and charge a uniform annual fee to cover administrative costs. The Surety Bond Guarantee Program aimed to reduce administrative costs by charging a uniform annual fee and processing fees for guarantees. It was designed to help small and minority contractors in the construction business by facilitating their entry and advancement. The Surety Bond Guarantee Program, implemented by the SBA in 1971, aimed to assist small and minority contractors in the construction business. Initially piloted in Kansas City, it later expanded nationwide. The program guaranteed 90% of surety bonds, charged 10% of the bond premium, and required small business applicants to pay 0.2% of the contract price for payment and performance bonds. Contractors had to have less than $750,000 in gross annual revenue to participate. The Surety Bond Guarantee Program, launched by the SBA in 1971, aimed to help small and minority contractors in the construction industry. Applicants had to have less than $750,000 in annual receipts to qualify. The program exceeded expectations, guaranteeing 16,118 contracts worth nearly $1.1 billion, leading to a request for an additional $25 million in funding in 1974. In 1974, the SBA requested $25 million for the Surety Bond Guarantee Program to accommodate projected growth and establish a reserve fund. Congress held hearings to discuss financing options, including higher fees, reduced guarantee percentages, or additional appropriations. The SBA has adjusted fees and guarantee percentages in the past to manage program expenses. The SBA has historically maintained low fees and high guarantee percentages for the Surety Bond Guarantee Program. There is a proposal to decrease the guarantee extended to sureties from 90% to 80%, which could reduce SBA's loss exposure. However, this may impact the willingness of sureties to participate in the program. Increasing contractor's fees could benefit the program's income but may disadvantage small business-contractors in competitive bidding. The SBA is required to ensure low fees for the Surety Bond Guarantee Program. Congress is interested in the program's size and has requested testimony on its necessity for small and minority-owned businesses. The Government Accountability Office has also been asked to assess the program and recommend improvements. In 1974, Congress passed P.L. 93-386 to establish a separate Surety Bond Guarantees Revolving Fund account within the Department of the Treasury to support the program. The act increased the total contract amount that could be guaranteed to $1 million from $500,000 and recommended $35 million in additional funding for the Revolving Fund. The Ford Administration proposed a $20 million transfer from the SBA's Business Loan and Investment Revolving Fund instead of additional appropriations for the Revolving Fund. The Revolving Fund received additional appropriations and an increased bond limit in the 1980s and 1990s. Despite this, the program's growth slowed down as the number and amount of surety bonds guaranteed by the SBA decreased. The trend continued until the individual surety contract amount was increased by subsequent acts in 2009 and 2012. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 made the Revolving Fund permanent and increased its bond limit. Congress provided funding for the Revolving Fund in various amounts from FY2005 to FY2008. In FY2009, additional appropriations were made to support a temporary increase in the bond limit to $5 million. In FY2010, the Revolving Fund received $1 million in appropriations. Congress has not approved funding for the Revolving Fund since then, citing sufficient reserves to cover claim defaults. The SBA increased program fees in the 1970s to finance expansion, including raising surety fees to 20% from 10% and contractor applicant fees to 0.5% from 0.2% of the contract price. The number and amount of final surety bonds guaranteed by the SBA increased rapidly during the 1970s, but declined in the 1980s and 1990s. There was no single factor identified for the program's contraction during that period. The demand for surety bonds fluctuates with changes in the economy. During the 1980s and 1990s, the economy saw periods of growth and decline. The ability of small businesses to access surety bonds without SBA assistance did not significantly improve. Factors contributing to the decline in SBA-guaranteed surety bonds included surety companies' reluctance to participate and alternative underwriting methods. During the 1980s and 1990s, congressional leaders became reluctant to provide additional resources for the SBA's surety bond program. Congressional hearings shifted focus from praising the program's success to highlighting its shortcomings, including concerns about fraud and mismanagement. Reports by GAO and the SBA's inspector general questioned the SBA's management of the program. During the 1980s and 1990s, congressional leaders criticized the SBA's surety bond program for lacking underwriting guidelines and verification procedures. The number and value of bonds guaranteed by the SBA decreased over the years but have since increased, likely due to economic improvements and higher contract guarantee amounts. The surety bonding process involves surety companies evaluating contractors' ability to complete a job and providing bonds. If a surety does not provide a bond, the forms are forwarded to the SBA for consideration of a surety bond guarantee. The individual contract amount guaranteed can range from $2 million to $6.5 million, or up to $10 million with certification from a federal contracting officer. The SBA surety guaranteed program's bonds were initially underwritten by large surety companies, but their participation declined due to administrative burdens. The requirement for sureties to submit all bond applications to the SBA for review and approval, along with the costs of dealing with small bonds, led to the larger companies leaving the program. The SBA surety guaranteed program saw a decline in participation from large surety companies due to administrative burdens and economic factors like the Israeli-Egyptian War in 1973. This led to smaller contracting companies failing, prompting surety companies to enhance underwriting standards. As a result, larger surety companies became reluctant to participate in the program, leading to specialty surety companies filling the void. Specialty surety companies filled the void left by standard sureties in the SBA-guaranteed surety bond program. They later expanded to offer high-risk bonds and required collateral from contractors, charging higher premiums. In 1982, the SBA sought ways to encourage standard surety companies' participation, as some specialty sureties were linked to organized crime and fraud. The SBA aimed to attract larger surety companies back to the program to lower premiums for small businesses. Standard surety companies proposed a special program where pre-approved \"preferred sureties\" could issue SBA-guaranteed bonds without prior approval, subject to audits and standards set by the SBA. The SBA's Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program allowed standard surety firms to accept a 70% guarantee against losses without prior approval from the SBA. Authorized in 1988, the program was made permanent in 2005. The SBA's Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program, authorized in 1988 and made permanent in 2005 by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, increased the guarantee for preferred sureties from 70% to 90% of losses under P.L. 114-92, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. The SBA can guarantee surety bonds for contractors or subcontractors meeting size standards, unable to obtain bonds without a guarantee, and expected to fulfill contract conditions. Good character and reputation are also required. The applicant must demonstrate good character and reputation by not having a criminal record, regulatory license issues, or fraudulent bond guarantees. They must also certify subcontracted work percentage and not be primarily brokers or subcontract control. The SBA requires applicants to certify they are not debarred or suspended from federal transactions. Additionally, a conflict of interest prohibition applies to ownership interests in the applicant's affiliates. The SBA guarantees contracts up to $6.5 million, or up to $10 million with certification from a federal contracting officer. There is no limit to the number of bonds guaranteed for a contractor, with the SBA covering up to 90% of the loss incurred by a surety. The SBA guarantees up to 90% of the loss for contracts $100,000 or less or for certain types of small businesses. The guarantee rate is 80% for contracts over $100,000. The SBA does not charge application or bid bond guarantee fees for small business applicants. If the SBA guarantees a final bond, the principal must pay a contractor fee determined by the SBA. The SBA contractor fee for FY2019 is 0.6% of the contract price for a final bond, rounded to the nearest dollar and paid to the surety. Sureties charge principals a premium ranging from 1.5% to 3.0% of the contract amount based on risk assessment and job size. Sureties interested in the Prior Approval Program or PSB program must apply to the SBA and meet eligibility criteria set by the U.S. Treasury. The SBA evaluates sureties for the PSB program based on underwriting limitations, premium charges, income sources, and authority delegation. The surety must meet specific criteria, including a minimum underwriting limitation, premium restrictions, income limitations, and authority delegation. The surety's rating or ranking designation is also considered by the SBA. Sureties in the Prior Approval Program must obtain SBA approval before issuing guaranteed bonds, while those in the PSB program can issue bonds without prior approval but must notify the SBA electronically. PSB sureties are subject to a maximum guarantee authority amount set by the SBA. The SBA requires newer sureties in the PSB program to obtain approval before issuing bonds over $2 million. Terms of bond guarantee agreements vary based on surety's experience. Factors considered include rating, loss rate, contract amount, bond penalty, and bid bonds ratio. The SBA Surety Bond Guarantee Program requires sureties to evaluate the credit, capacity, and character of a principal, provide reasonable bond terms, monitor progress on guaranteed contracts, and maintain documentation of job status. The SBA Surety Bond Guarantee Program requires sureties to monitor the principal's progress on guaranteed contracts, maintain documentation of job status requests, minimize risk of loss, obtain written indemnity agreements, and pursue salvage and recovery in case of loss. Sureties are subject to audits by SBA-selected examiners and are required to pay a guarantee fee on each SBA-guaranteed bond. The SBA determines a fee for surety bonds, which is 20% of the bond premium due within 60 days of approval. The SBA does not receive non-premium charges from sureties. The number and amount of SBA-guaranteed bid bonds have increased in recent years, while final bonds declined during the 2007-2009 recession but have since increased. Recent increases in the Surety Bond Guarantee Program are attributed to improving economic conditions and legislation that raised the maximum contract amount. The program has maintained a positive cash flow for the past 12 years, with $97 million in the Revolving Fund. The default rate averages 3% to 5%, with larger contracts having lower default rates and higher recovery rates. Currently, 28 sureties participate in the Prior Approval Program and 6 in the PSB program. About 28 sureties are in the Prior Approval Program and 6 in the PSB program. Agents representing surety companies are licensed in all 50 states and various territories. 80% of SBA's surety bonds are issued through the Prior Approval Program, with the PSB program accounting for 20%. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated an extra $15 million to the program and raised the maximum bond amount to $5 million temporarily. The program's size standard was also revised. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated an extra $15 million to the SBA surety bond program, raising the maximum bond amount to $5 million temporarily. The program's size standard was revised to increase the number of qualifying businesses. The SBA made the temporary size standard permanent on August 11, 2010, arguing that the increased bond limit and size were necessary for small businesses to compete for contracts and grow. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated an extra $15 million to the SBA surety bond program, raising the maximum bond amount to $5 million temporarily. The program's size standard was revised to increase the number of qualifying businesses. The SBA made the temporary size standard permanent on August 11, 2010, arguing that the increased bond limit and size were necessary for small businesses to compete for contracts, grow, and hire more employees. They also believed that small businesses were finding it difficult to secure credit lines for bonds in the private sector during the economic recession. The temporary changes were seen as creating significant job opportunities for small businesses. The Obama Administration proposed the America's Recovery Capital (ARC) Loan program and increased the SBA's loan guaranty programs. Opponents suggested business tax reduction and financial credit market reform instead of modifying SBA programs. In 2011, the Administration advocated for a temporary increase in the SBA surety bond limit to $5 million. The Obama Administration proposed the America's Recovery Capital (ARC) Loan program and increased the SBA's loan guaranty programs. In 2011, the Administration advocated for a temporary increase in the SBA surety bond limit to $5 million, generated by the American Jobs Act's proposed infrastructure investments. Legislative efforts were made during the 112th Congress to increase the bond limit, but none were reported for consideration. The American Jobs Act of 2011 proposed increasing the SBA surety bond limit to $5 million, but legislative efforts to do so were unsuccessful. The Senate Committee on Appropriations later included a provision to increase the bond limit in the Hurricane Sandy Emergency Assistance Supplemental bill, which was removed after the approval of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013. This act increased the bond limit to $6.5 million, with the potential to reach $10 million. The SBA surety bond program's bond limit was increased to $6.5 million, with the possibility of reaching $10 million if certified by a federal contracting officer. There was limited discussion on the reasons for the increase in bond limits, with advocates arguing for alignment with other small business programs. The Small Business Administration increased the bond limit to $6.5 million, potentially reaching $10 million with certification by a federal contracting officer. Advocates sought alignment with other small business programs to provide consistency in contracting. Advocates argued for increasing the SBA surety bond program's limit to $6.5 million to match the 8(a) program's threshold for manufacturing contracts, aiming to enhance opportunities for small businesses to compete for federal contracts, especially in departments like the Department of Defense. The SBA had no opposition to raising bond limits, as higher limits did not necessarily increase program losses based on experience with Recovery Act bonds. Default rates were lower for Recovery Act bonds, encouraging surety participation. H.R. 776, the Security in Bonding Act of 2013, aimed to enhance surety participation in the SBA's program. The Security in Bonding Act of 2013 aimed to increase the PSB program's guarantee rate from 70% to 90% of losses. The bill was included in H.R. 4435 but was not passed by Congress. Advocates argued that the PSBP program has become less effective for small businesses due to limited surety participation. The PSBP program has become less effective for small businesses with limited surety participation. Legislation aims to standardize the guarantee rate at 90% to make the program more efficient and less risky for taxpayers. The SBA is considering restructuring the program to address the decline in preferred sureties. The decline in preferred sureties from 50% to 14% of the program is concerning, and more participation is needed. Increasing the guarantee rate for the PSBP program could potentially lead to higher program fees, causing hardship for some companies. H.R. 838, the Security in Bonding Act of 2015, was introduced to address these issues. The Security in Bonding Act of 2015, H.R. 838, aimed to increase the PSB program's guarantee rate from 70% to 90% and specify requirements for individual sureties. The bill's provisions were included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, P.L. 114-92, with a one-year delay for rulemaking. Congress added additional requirements for individual sureties. The SBA's final rule implementing the increased PSB program's guarantee rate was effective as of September 20, 2017. The SBA is focusing on strengthening relationships with individual surety companies and bond agents to reach more small businesses in need of bonding. They are emphasizing process improvements to streamline application requirements, such as the \"Quick APP\" for surety bonds up to $250,000. The SBA has streamlined the bonding application process for small businesses and contractors, increasing the Quick Bond Program threshold to $400,000 in 2017. They are considering merging the Prior Approval Program and PSB program to simplify bond approval and monitoring. Industry groups recommend merging the programs, maintaining reduced regulatory burdens, and keeping fees low to encourage more sureties to participate. Opposition to the merger of the Surety Bond Guarantee Program and the Prior Approval Program may arise from those who question the necessity of the Surety Bond Guarantee Program, believe the existing program is sufficient, or fear increased risk of defaults and program losses. Congressional testimony and GAO examinations have highlighted concerns for smaller contracting firms, especially minority-owned and women-owned businesses. Smaller contracting firms, especially minority-owned and women-owned businesses, face challenges accessing surety bonds in the private marketplace. In 1995, GAO found that small construction companies had difficulty obtaining surety bonds, with one in three small firms compared to one in six larger firms requiring collateral. Minority-owned firms were more likely to be asked for financial documentation, collateral, and faced more denials and bid delays. Women-owned and minority-owned firms faced challenges accessing surety bonds, including being denied bonds and experiencing bid delays. They were asked for more financial documentation and had to meet additional requirements such as establishing escrow accounts and hiring specific management firms. Congressional testimony and GAO examinations have supported the need for programs like the SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program. The SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program is essential, but testimonies and surveys have been somewhat less helpful in determining its appropriate size. Congressional witnesses focus on reducing paperwork requirements, keeping fees low, and guarantee rates high. The SBA aims to attract more sureties to reverse the program's decline in final bonds guaranteed over the past two decades. The SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program has seen a decline in final bonds guaranteed over the past two decades. Testimonies have not provided much insight into determining the program's appropriate size compared to the private sector. Congressional testimony suggests that the supply and demand for sureties fluctuate with the economy, with federal policies potentially needing to consider these fluctuations. When deciding on federal support for surety guarantees, market conditions must be considered. Establishing measures for supply and demand can help determine the size of the SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program. Personal views on the federal government's role in the marketplace and risk tolerance also play a significant role in this decision."
