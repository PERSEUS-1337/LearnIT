Section 794 of P.L. 109-97 (2005) prohibits the use of funds to pay for the inspection of horses under certain acts, effectively prohibiting the slaughter of horses for human consumption. The Department of Agriculture issued a regulation allowing slaughter plants to pay for inspections to continue slaughtering horses for human consumption. The 110th Congress prevented this by prohibiting funds from being used for inspections, effectively prohibiting horse slaughter for human consumption. The Department of Agriculture allowed slaughter plants to pay for inspections, but the 110th Congress prohibited funds for inspections, effectively banning horse slaughter for human consumption.

It authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to restrict import/export of animals to prevent disease spread. The Animal Welfare Act authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to establish standards for the humane handling, care, and transportation of animals by dealers, research facilities, and exhibitors. This includes minimizing animal pain and distress in experimental procedures and governing the transportation and treatment of animals by carriers. The Animal Welfare Act applies to warmblooded animals used for research, testing, experimentation, or exhibition purposes, excluding birds, rats, mice bred for research, horses not used for research, and other farm animals. Regulations previously excluded birds, rats, and mice from coverage, but a court decision overturning this exclusion was later dismissed due to lack of standing by the plaintiffs. The Animal Welfare Act initially excluded birds, rats, and mice from coverage, but a court decision allowed a plaintiff to sue the Secretary of Agriculture to enforce the act based on aesthetic interest in animals. The Department of Agriculture settled by agreeing to include birds, rats, and mice in regulations. Congress then prohibited funds from modifying the definition of 'animal' in existing regulations for FY2001 and FY2002. The Animal Welfare Act initially excluded birds, rats, and mice from coverage, but Congress later amended the statute to exclude them from regulations. A report was supposed to be submitted on the implications of including these animals, but it appears no report was written. Research facilities are required to establish an Institutional Animal Committee to ensure proper care and treatment of animals.

The provision prohibits the use of funds to purchase dogs or cats for training Department of Defense personnel in medical treatment, adhering to animal welfare laws. The prohibition continues unless repealed, with variations in wording in different statutes. The Comptroller General has clarified that the phrase \"or any other act\" extends provisions to other appropriations within the same fiscal year. An example of this is seen in legislation prohibiting bone trauma research at an Army Research Laboratory until certain conditions are met. Some limitations on the use of Department of Defense funds for animal research have been specified in various appropriations statutes, such as P.L. 103 - 139 \u00a7 8043 (1993) and P.L. 104 - 61 , \u00a7 8032 (1995).
