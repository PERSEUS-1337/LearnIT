    "content": "The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is a federal block grant program that provides annual grants to states, territories, and tribal organizations to assist needy households with home energy costs. LIHEAP was established in 1981 and has been reauthorized and amended multiple times. The program received $2.57 billion in total appropriation in the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The LIHEAP program received its largest ever appropriation of $2.57 billion in FY2008. Regular funds, also known as block grant funds, are allotted to states based on methods prescribed by the LIHEAP statute. In FY2006, $2.48 billion was distributed as regular funds, while $1.98 billion was allocated in both FY2007 and FY2008. Contingency funds can be released at the discretion of the President and HHS to address additional home energy assistance needs during emergencies. In FY2008, LIHEAP received $2.57 billion, with $1.98 billion allocated for regular funds. A 1.747% rescission reduced funding for various programs. The first distribution of regular funds occurred in December 2007. HHS later announced the distribution of funds for leveraging incentive and REACH grants in June 2008. In FY2008, Congress did not appropriate funds for leveraging incentive and REACH grants, resulting in $26.7 million being added to LIHEAP formula grants instead. This caused the funds to be distributed under the \"new\" LIHEAP formula. The LIHEAP formula distributes funds, with $2 billion requested for FY2009, including $1.7 billion for regular funds. Allocation amounts for states in FY2006, FY2007, and FY2008 are shown in Table 1. Table 2 displays estimated state allocations for LIHEAP funds at various appropriation levels ranging from $1.75 billion to $5.1 billion."
