Popular services like Gmail, Grooveshark, and Dropbox operate using cloud computing. Smartphone apps also utilize cloud computing for data storage. The number of cloud storage users is expected to reach 500 million by the end of the year and 1.3 billion by 2017. Cloud computing by Microsoft allows users to store information on a third-party computer and access it from any platform with Internet access. This raises privacy and security concerns regarding government access to personal data. The report discusses how the Fourth Amendment and federal electronic privacy laws apply to cloud communications and surveys recent legislation aimed at updating the statutory framework. The Fourth Amendment and federal communication statutes provide core privacy protections in the physical world, ensuring the privacy of individuals and preventing government intrusion. The Fourth Amendment aims to secure people's persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures. To determine if the Fourth Amendment applies, courts assess whether government activities constitute a search. The Fourth Amendment protects individuals' privacy in the physical world by preventing unreasonable searches and seizures. Justice Harlan's test in Katz v. United States requires an actual expectation of privacy recognized as reasonable by society. Baseline rules for communication protection exist, with postal letters serving as a close analog to emails. In Ex parte Jackson, the Supreme Court affirmed the privacy of letters in the mail from examination. The Fourth Amendment protects the privacy of letters and sealed packages in the mail, preventing unreasonable searches and seizures. Officials cannot open or examine mail without a warrant, similar to searches in one's own household. This principle must be upheld in all regulations regarding mail matter. The Fourth Amendment protects the privacy of letters and sealed packages in the mail, preventing unreasonable searches and seizures. In Ex parte Jackson, the Court distinguished between content and non-content of mail, with the inside of the letter being protected. United States v. Jacobsen affirmed the privacy expectation of sealed packages. However, officials can briefly detain packages without a warrant to confirm suspicions, and postal workers can record routing information. Postal workers can record routing information on letters under federal regulations for mail covers to gather evidence of a crime, but they are prohibited from opening the mail unless exceptions apply. The contents of conversations are protected under the Fourth Amendment, as seen in United States v. Katz, where the Court ruled that individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their conversations, even in public telephone booths. Congress passed the Wiretap Act in 1968, which prohibits the interception of private communications without consent or a warrant based on probable cause. Accessing telephone routing information requires lesser process than accessing the contents of a communication. In Smith v. Maryland, the Court applied the third-party doctrine to telephone numbers dialed, stating that voluntarily conveyed information is not protected by the Fourth Amendment. Congress later prohibited the use of pen registers and trap and trace devices without a court order under ECPA. The government can access information from third parties without a court order if it is deemed relevant to a criminal investigation. In United States v. Miller, the Supreme Court ruled that bank customers have no expectation of privacy in their banking documents. This is based on the third-party doctrine, which allows information shared with a third party to be disclosed to the government. The Right to Financial Privacy Act was enacted by Congress in response to the Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Miller, which established that bank customers have no expectation of privacy in their financial documents. The Fourth Amendment and federal statutes apply to Internet privacy, with courts treating traditional and cloud-based communication similarly under the Fourth Amendment. However, cloud computing lacks the same privacy protections as traditional email services under the Stored Communications Act. Courts have applied the Fourth Amendment to Internet communications by analogy to the physical world, focusing on whether the information sought is \"content\" or \"non-content.\" Access to Internet content requires a warrant, while non-content information like IP addresses has faced lesser legal scrutiny. In Forrester v. United States, the Ninth Circuit Court ruled that accessing non-content information in Internet communications does not violate the Fourth Amendment. The Ninth Circuit ruled that obtaining routing information from an email address did not violate the Fourth Amendment in a case involving the interception of defendant Dennis Alba's Internet and email activity during a drug investigation. The court compared this to the third-party case of Smith v. Maryland, where telephone numbers dialed were not protected under the Fourth Amendment. The court ruled that e-mail and internet users have no expectation of privacy in the to/from addresses of their messages or the IP addresses of the websites they visit, similar to the addressing information on physical mail. This information is provided to and used by the service provider for directing and routing purposes, therefore not entitled to Fourth Amendment safeguards. The court in v. Christie held that individuals do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their IP addresses. The FBI obtained IP addresses of users accessing child pornography websites and requested their names from ISPs. The court applied the third-party doctrine, stating that IP addresses are voluntarily turned over to ISPs and do not have Fourth Amendment protection. In 2010, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in United States v. Warshak recognized the difference between content and non-content information in email communications, holding that the content is protected under the Fourth Amendment. Warshak was investigated for fraud, and the government accessed 27,000 emails with ISP permission. The Sixth Circuit ruled that the email contents were protected under the Fourth Amendment, comparing emails to physical mail. The Ninth Circuit decision in Warshak compared e-mails to physical mail, stating that e-mails deserve Fourth Amendment protection. Government agents must obtain a warrant to access e-mail contents, establishing rules for Fourth Amendment protection in Internet communications. In the early 1980s, Congress expressed concerns about the lack of privacy for electronic communications compared to physical mail. The Senate Judiciary Committee emphasized the importance of protecting privacy in the digital age, while the House Judiciary Committee highlighted legal uncertainties regarding access to electronic communications. The House Committee was concerned about unclear legal standards for electronic communications access, fearing it would deter customers and impact police investigations. In response, Congress passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, including the Stored Communications Act (SCA) to regulate access to stored electronic communications. The SCA outlines procedures for government disclosure requests and rules for service providers sharing customer communications. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) covers providers of electronic communication and remote computing services, prohibiting them from knowingly disclosing the contents of communications in electronic storage. Electronic storage is defined as information stored during transmission or for backup purposes. Remote computing service providers are also prohibited from disclosing communication contents, with certain exceptions. Section 2703 of the Stored Communications Act outlines the procedures for the government to access electronic communications from ECS or RCS providers. The government needs a warrant to access content that has been in electronic storage for 180 days or less. For older communications, the government can access them with a subpoena or court order after providing notice to the customer. The Stored Communications Act allows the government to access electronic communications from ECS or RCS providers. For content stored for 180 days or less, a warrant is needed. Older communications can be accessed with a subpoena or court order under Section 2703(d) without customer notice. Access to subscriber information like name, address, and phone number can be obtained through a warrant, Section 2703(d) order, or administrative subpoena. Section 2702 of the Stored Communications Act outlines the circumstances under which service providers can disclose communication content and customer information. Public providers must adhere to specific exceptions for divulging communication content, while nonpublic providers can do so without any process required. Additionally, public providers can release customer records or non-content information under certain exceptions provided in Section 2702. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) outlines exceptions for disclosing communication content and customer information. Government access to unopened e-mails stored for 180 days or less requires a warrant, while those stored for more than 180 days can be accessed with a subpoena or Section 2703(d) order. Courts differ on whether opened e-mails stored for 180 days or less are in \"electronic storage,\" leading to varying warrant requirements for law enforcement. In Theofel v. Farey-Jones, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dealt with a case where the defendant subpoenaed the plaintiff's ISP provider for access to all e-mails. The plaintiffs sued under the Stored Communications Act, questioning if the e-mails were in \"electronic storage.\" The definition of electronic storage was a key issue in this case. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that e-mails stored on an ISP's server for backup purposes are considered in electronic storage under the Stored Communications Act. This allows users to have a second copy of their messages in case they need to download them again. The court emphasized that the backup protection does not have to be for the benefit of the ISP, but rather for the user. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that e-mails stored on an ISP's server for backup purposes are considered in electronic storage under the Stored Communications Act. This ruling may not apply to cloud computing where messages are only stored on the service provider's computer, as noted by the court. This distinction could impact the warrant requirement for accessing e-mails stored in the cloud. The District Court for the Central District of Illinois applied the Stored Communications Act to a case involving e-mails from a Microsoft Hotmail account in a child pornography investigation. The court had to determine if the e-mails were in \"electronic storage\" or \"storage\" to decide on the warrant requirement for access. The court determined that the e-mails from a Microsoft Hotmail account were not in temporary storage and were not being stored for backup protection, as they were accessible over the web and not automatically downloaded to users' computers. The court ruled that e-mails from a Microsoft Hotmail account were not stored for backup purposes, making Microsoft a RCS provider. In another case, the court considered if messages sent through private messaging services or posted on social networking sites are covered under the SCA. The court ruled that Facebook and MySpace are covered under the SCA, regarding access to communications. The court considered private messages as subject to subpoena requirements, while \"wall postings\" were likened to electronic bulletin board services. The court analogized Facebook and MySpace to electronic bulletin board services, stating that access to messages must be restricted for protection under the SCA. Messages not retrieved were considered to be in \"electronic storage\" under the SCA. The Court remanded the case to determine if public or limited access to plaintiff's Facebook and MySpace comments would fall under the SCA's protections. In Viacom Intern. Inc. v. YouTube Inc., the court had to decide if access to YouTube videos was governed by the SCA in a copyright infringement case. The court ruled that Google, as an RCS provider, was not permitted to disclose private videos under the SCA, despite Viacom's argument that users had authorized disclosure under certain provisions. The court found that YouTube's Terms of Use did not grant permission for Viacom to access private videos designated by the users. The court ruled that Viacom could not access private videos on YouTube marked as private by users. However, Viacom was allowed access to non-content data such as view counts. Similar to physical searches, electronic communications have a distinction between content and non-content data under the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment distinguishes between content and non-content data in electronic communications, such as e-mails. Law enforcement generally needs a warrant to access e-mail content, while routing information can be obtained with a subpoena. There are differences between searches in the physical world and the Internet, such as the government's ability to access e-mail contents stored for over 180 days with a subpoena. This contrasts with physical letters, which require a warrant for access, and evidence obtained illegally in the physical world is usually inadmissible in court. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) does not provide a suppression remedy for unlawfully obtained evidence, allowing it to be admitted in trial. The Fourth Amendment sets a baseline threshold that the SCA cannot diminish. Courts have distinguished between traditional e-mail services and cloud-based computing under the SCA, with different warrant requirements. Youtube was considered an RCS provider in Viacom Intern. Inc., subjecting posted videos to the subpoena requirement. Future courts may continue to apply this distinction. Several courts, commentators, and government officials have called for an overhaul of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) due to conflicting standards causing confusion for law enforcement, businesses, and consumers. Senator Patrick J. Leahy highlighted the complexity of ECPA, noting that a single email could have varying levels of privacy protections depending on storage location and timing. Observers have criticized the Stored Communications Act (SCA) for being more complicated than necessary. The SCA has been criticized for being overly complex and lacking in privacy protections. The Department of Justice has also suggested changes to the ECPA but warned against raising standards for accessing electronic communications, as it could slow down investigations. Legislation has been introduced to overhaul ECPA and strengthen requirements for accessing electronic communications under the SCA, aiming to speed up investigations in cases like terrorism and violent crimes. Bills in Congress would require a warrant based on probable cause to retrieve content from electronic communication providers and eliminate the 180-day rule in Section 2703(a). The proposed changes to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) include eliminating the 180-day rule in Section 2703(a), expanding coverage to communications being \"held or maintained\" by a service, requiring government notification of searches within three days, and restricting providers from voluntarily sharing information with the government without exceptions. Additionally, a previous bill aimed to create a suppression remedy for SCA violations and mandate reporting on orders or warrants for electronic communication contents. The proposed changes to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) include eliminating the 180-day rule in Section 2703(a), expanding coverage to communications being \"held or maintained\" by a service, requiring government notification of searches within three days, and restricting providers from voluntarily sharing information with the government without exceptions. Legislative proposals seek to require providers to report annually to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts the number of legal demands received from law enforcement agencies and the number of accounts about which information was disclosed, with compensation for compiling records. However, there are concerns that the rules may not capture all types of communications in the cloud, such as those on sites like eBay. The debate surrounds whether certain cloud services, like eBay, should be covered under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA). Suggestions include drafting specific language for cloud services or a broad definition for entities covered by the Act. One proposal aims to remove the 180-day rule, apply consistent rules to all service providers, and protect user communications even after they have been received or downloaded. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) requires a warrant for accessing wire or electronic communications, regardless of storage by the provider. There is debate on consent for interceptions, such as clicking on user agreements for email providers. Clarification is needed on what constitutes consent for accessing and sharing email content. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) requires user consent for sharing personal information with behavioral advertising agencies. However, ECPA lacks clarity on what constitutes consent, leaving users and service providers without guidance. Explicit opt-in consent, similar to the Driver's Privacy Protection Act, could be implemented to address this issue. The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of privacy in digital communications, stating that individuals should have the same protections online as they do in the physical world. Courts have ruled that Internet communications are protected by the Fourth Amendment, and the Stored Communications Act (SCA) provides additional privacy safeguards. The SCA provides varying degrees of privacy protections to public and private intrusions based on how long the communication has been stored and the classification of the network service provider. Courts have applied lesser protection to cloud-based communications compared to traditional Internet communications. Legislative proposals aim to apply the same rules to communications in physical and digital worlds, including traditional and cloud computing."
