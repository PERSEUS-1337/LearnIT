    "content": "The DOD provides guidance on military uniform procurement through various regulations, including the use of FedBizOpps for contract notices, DOD Instruction 4160.1-R for materiel management, and DOD Instruction 4140.63 for clothing and textiles management. Military uniforms are procured in accordance with these regulations. The Berry Amendment ensures that U.S. troops wear military uniforms and eat food produced in the U.S. Exceptions allow for the purchase of specialty metals and protective clothing from countries with procurement agreements. The Berry Amendment allows for domestic nonavailability determinations (DNADs) to be made by the Under Secretary of Defense and Secretaries of the military services for items not available in the U.S. Military uniforms are typically procured through competitive contracts, with access to various supplies and materials. C&T specialists can procure textiles directly from the industry for higher quality and cost savings in manufacturing uniforms. According to a GAO report, DLA manages eight uniforms for the military services. Vendors and customers can review solicitations in FedBizOpps for procurement opportunities. DLA has an automated system for contractors to search for solicitations and awards. The Clothing & Textiles supply chain has a Customer Contact Center for inquiries. Prospective bidders should obtain specifications before submitting offers. Contractors must register in the Central Contractor Registration before contract awards. DLA considers factors beyond price in contract awards to ensure reliable contractors with proven performance records deliver quality products at the lowest possible costs. This Best Value concept involves using discriminating factors in addition to price in the evaluation of proposals and award of contracts. The NDAA for FY2014 requires all military services to adopt a joint combat camouflage uniform by October 1, 2018, eliminating Armed Force-specific uniforms to be used by all members of the Armed Forces. The NDAA for FY2014 mandates the adoption of a joint combat camouflage uniform by October 1, 2018 for all Armed Forces, with exceptions for special operations forces and engineering modifications to improve performance. The NDAA for FY2014 mandates the adoption of a joint combat camouflage uniform by October 1, 2018 for all Armed Forces, with exceptions for special operations forces and engineering modifications to improve performance. The performance of combat and camouflage utility uniforms, including various features like power harnessing textiles and fire-resistant fabrics, is regulated by prohibiting certain ancillary uniform items and cosmetic modifications. The Secretary of a military department must register all uniforms with the Joint Clothing and Textiles Governance Board. The Secretary of Defense must issue guidance within 60 days to implement the requirement for all military departments to register uniforms with the Joint Clothing and Textiles Governance Board. The Secretary of a military department cannot restrict another department from authorizing combat or camouflage uniforms. Joint criteria for combat uniforms must be established in cooperation with combatant commanders within 180 days. The Act requires joint criteria for combat and camouflage uniforms to be established within 180 days, incorporating new technologies for improved survivability. The uniforms must meet geographic and operational requirements and achieve interoperability with other war fighter systems. Repeal of Section 352 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which outlined policies for military uniforms, including assessments and requirements for ground combat and camouflage uniforms. The Act also mandated joint criteria for uniforms to incorporate new technologies for improved survivability and interoperability with other war fighter systems. The Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps have established requirements for combat clothing, but performance standards lack specificity for the combat environment. Camouflage effectiveness is not a key operational criterion. Ground combat uniforms, protective gear, and body armor are said to be interoperable, but there is no regular testing for this. Production and procurement costs for ground combat uniforms make up 95% of the total costs. Additional logistical requirements for various uniforms in combat theaters are primarily related to storage. Military service officials reported that wearing the same ground camouflage uniform is unlikely due to service-specific pride and regulations prohibiting cross-service uniform use. Data on risks of wearing different uniforms during combat operations is not collected, emphasizing the importance of flexibility in uniform selection based on operational needs. GAO revisited the military uniform issue in 2012 to assess the extent of uniform standardization. In 2012, GAO found that DOD had not developed joint criteria for new camouflage uniforms, leading to increased costs and lack of collaboration among military services. Section 839 of P.L. 113-66 aimed to ensure that military footwear for enlisted personnel followed the Berry Amendment. The Secretary of Defense shall provide athletic footwear directly to new military members instead of a cash allowance, following specific procurement requirements. A cash allowance may still be given for medically required footwear that cannot be met with standard athletic footwear. The Secretary of Defense must certify that there are two compliant sources for athletic footwear before the new procurement requirements take effect."
