    "content": "Emergency departments (EDs) have a crucial public health role in providing emergency care to all patients regardless of their ability to pay. Federal law guarantees access to emergency services under EMTALA, requiring hospitals to screen and stabilize all patients with emergent conditions, even if they lack insurance. This results in hospitals providing un- or under-compensated emergency care, with over 40% of all ED visits being for emergencies. Emergency departments (EDs) play a vital role in providing emergency care to all patients, regardless of their ability to pay. More than 40% of ED visits are for uninsured or Medicaid-enrolled individuals, leading to un- or under-compensated care. EDs see a significant number of acute care visits, especially for patients with serious symptoms like chest pain and respiratory complaints. The number of ED visits has been increasing faster than the U.S. population due to immediate access to diagnostic resources and declines in primary or behavioral healthcare access. Emergency departments (EDs) handle a significant amount of care for safety net populations, including two-thirds of acute care visits for the uninsured and half for those on Medicaid or CHIP. Patients may seek nonemergency care in EDs due to lack of alternative sources, leading to higher costs for payers. This is because ED services are generally more expensive than those provided in community-based settings due to higher fixed costs and physician ordering practices. The Institute of Medicine declared that Emergency Department (ED) care was \"at a breaking point\" due to increased use, declining financial support, and challenges such as crowded EDs, ambulance diversions, and long patient wait times. Despite recent changes in healthcare delivery and financing, including the growth of retail clinics and increased insurance coverage, these challenges persist. The federal government is interested in the availability and appropriate use of Emergency Department (ED) services due to its role as a payer of healthcare services, supporting emergency preparedness, and the healthcare safety net. This is important as the government is the largest healthcare payer through Medicare and Medicaid programs, and investments have been made in emergency preparedness and healthcare access. The federal government is interested in the availability and appropriate use of Emergency Department (ED) services due to its role as a payer of healthcare services and supporting emergency preparedness. Congress may be interested in EDs for surge capacity in emergencies, reflecting community access to healthcare services. The report describes EDs, federal involvement, challenges like crowding, repeat care for frequent users, and providing care for behavioral health conditions. Emergency Departments (EDs) in the U.S. have evolved to provide after-hours care, serve the safety net population, and offer behavioral health care. They now also perform tasks traditionally done by primary care providers, such as diagnostic testing and chronic care coordination. EDs drive hospital admissions, impacting hospital revenue. Congress may consider policy options to enhance ED functioning and reduce payer costs. Emergency Departments (EDs) have expanded their role to provide emergency care, unscheduled urgent care, and safety net care due to patient populations and services offered. EDs may offer specialized services like trauma or burn care, and often provide primary and behavioral health care for patients with barriers to accessing other healthcare components. Community-based resources, including primary care, laboratory testing, medical imaging, and specialty care, are essential to reduce \"resource sensitive\" and preventable Emergency Department (ED) visits. These visits reflect gaps in care available to the surrounding community, where care may be unavailable due to insurance limitations or lack of coverage. Providing these services in an ED is not optimal, as EDs serve those with limited alternate options for healthcare. The federal government designates primary care health professional shortage areas to alleviate shortages in certain communities. Approximately 6,100 areas lack enough primary care providers. Emergency Departments (EDs) are often used for after-hours care when physician offices are closed, with 75% of children's ED visits occurring at night or on weekends. EDs may fill gaps in care but also actively seek patients, especially those with private insurance coverage. Hospitals seek patients with private insurance for uncomplicated medical conditions in the Emergency Department (ED) to generate revenue through higher reimbursements. ED use is driven by gaps in community-based health services for safety net populations like the uninsured or Medicaid beneficiaries, who may face barriers to accessing physician services. This leads to higher costs for payors compared to outpatient care. Patients with limited options often resort to self-pay for healthcare visits, which may not be affordable. Communities with federal health centers experience lower ED use, as these facilities provide primary and specialty care regardless of ability to pay. However, health centers may have limitations in reducing ED visits due to operating hours and capacity constraints. EDs serve as a resource for behavioral health services when other options are scarce, especially in areas with shortages of mental health providers. There are approximately 4,000 mental health professional shortage areas in the U.S., with over half of counties lacking behavioral health providers. Inpatient treatment options are also limited due to decreased funding in some states. Patients with mental health conditions may end up in the emergency department (ED) when law enforcement deems medical intervention necessary. However, EDs may not always have the resources or staff to provide adequate behavioral health care, especially for patients with complex conditions. The study by AHRQ and SAMHSA found that individuals with mental health and/or substance use disorders were more likely to have multiple ED visits, especially those with co-occurring chronic conditions like diabetes. Some ED visits are deemed inappropriate for minor ailments, but researchers have found that this is generally due to the ED's role as a gap filler. Researchers have found that Medicaid enrollees use emergency departments (EDs) more often due to limited treatment options or provider referrals. Despite perceptions of misuse, data shows that Medicaid enrollees are often evaluated for urgent complaints. Higher ED use by Medicaid enrollees can be attributed to chronic conditions and difficulty accessing other providers. Uninsured individuals may also use EDs for conditions treatable in outpatient settings. Some patients may use emergency departments (EDs) for health conditions that could have been treated in outpatient settings due to access issues. The Emergency Severity Index (ESI) categorizes complaints based on needed resources, physical assessment, and risk factors, sometimes labeling visits as \"non-urgent\" based on severity. However, it can be challenging to determine prospectively if a complaint is non-urgent, as patients may perceive their condition as a true emergency. Emergency departments (EDs) are increasingly used for non-urgent cases, leading to challenges in determining appropriate care. EDs are also handling more chronic illnesses, especially in older adults, due to gaps in primary care. Medical advances have expanded the range of treatable illnesses in the ED setting. The expanded diagnostic role of emergency departments (EDs) is driven by clinical and administrative factors, leading to ED physicians making more admission decisions. While EDs can evaluate patients with chronic illnesses, primary care physicians (PCPs) are better equipped for long-term management. Providing chronic illness care in EDs may be detrimental to patients due to lack of full medical records and interruptions in the ED environment. In an ED environment, providers face interruptions and rush due to emergencies, potentially leading to lower-quality care and medical errors for patients seeking primary care. EDs have high fixed costs but can generate revenue for hospitals through inpatient admissions. Between 2003 and 2009, non-elective admissions from EDs increased by 20%, driving total hospital admissions. This may result in additional ED care for patients. Even when ED visits do not lead to admissions, they can be profitable for privately insured individuals, especially when treating uncomplicated conditions. However, ED visits may not be profitable for Medicare, Medicaid, or uninsured patients. Despite potential losses, EDs can be profitable overall due to their link to admissions. Some hospitals have expanded ED services or created free-standing emergency rooms to increase profitability, especially with the ACA's expansion of private insurance coverage. Although ED care can be costly to payors, it remains profitable for hospitals. When EDs are used to treat uncomplicated conditions, it can be costly for payors as care could be provided at a lower cost in an outpatient setting. About 15% of ED visits result in admissions, making up nearly half of all hospital admissions and over two-thirds of non-elective admissions. Medicare beneficiaries have a high rate of ED visits resulting in hospital admission, with 60% of visits in 2010 leading to admission. Despite accounting for a large percentage of acute care visits, ED visits only make up 2% of all Medicare costs due to payment structures. The Affordable Care Act has impacted ED costs for Medicare beneficiaries. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is expected to increase hospital reimbursements for emergency care by reducing uninsured patients seeking uncompensated care in the ED. The effects of the ACA vary by state, with hospitals in states that implemented the Medicaid expansion reporting decreased expenditures on uncompensated care. In contrast, hospitals in states that did not expand Medicaid have not seen these declines. The ACA Medicaid expansion has led to decreased expenditures on uncompensated care in hospitals. However, hospitals are still facing payment reductions due to the ACA, which may strain them further. The impact of the ACA on emergency department (ED) use is uncertain, with possibilities of decreasing, slowing the growth, or increasing ED visits, especially among the newly insured. The ACA Medicaid expansion in Oregon has led to increased emergency department (ED) use, which could be temporary as newly insured individuals seek care. Concerns exist that some Medicaid-eligible individuals may still seek care in the ED due to lack of timely access to primary or specialty care. Three new outpatient healthcare options may help fill gaps in care and change the role of the ED. Retail clinics and urgent care clinics provide unscheduled primary care and after-hours access to a variety of services. Free-standing emergency rooms, operated by hospitals or private entities, may impact traditional emergency departments by catering to patients with private insurance and not being subject to EMTALA regulations. The federal government regulates and supports emergency department services by requiring hospitals to provide certain emergency services, reimbursing for services provided to individuals with federal insurance, and providing funds for uncompensated care. They also support hospital preparedness and the broader healthcare delivery system. This could strain traditional emergency departments if new facilities draw insured patients, leaving remaining patients disproportionately uninsured or on Medicaid. The federal government requires hospitals with dedicated emergency departments to screen and treat patients with emergent conditions regardless of their ability to pay, as mandated by the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) enacted in 1986. This legislation was a response to controversies where uninsured patients were denied emergency services, ensuring access to care for all individuals. EMTALA requires hospitals to provide emergency services to uninsured patients to prevent \"dumping.\" Hospitals must conduct a medical screening exam and transfer patients if necessary. Some hospitals struggle to recruit specialty physicians for on-call coverage due to liability concerns. Liability risk is a major concern for hospitals under EMTALA regulations. Physicians treating ED patients may feel at a higher risk due to potential lawsuits for errors or negligence. Specialty physicians may avoid taking ED call to avoid fines and exclusion from Medicare. The lack of specialty physicians willing to take ED call can impact health care access, leading some hospitals to close their ED or divert patients. EMTALA has created the perception that EDs provide free care for the uninsured, driving ED use for non-emergent conditions. The uninsured often use the emergency department (ED) for non-acute conditions, leading to hospitals receiving less payment from them compared to insured patients. Some uninsured individuals may be billed at higher rates, but not all can pay, and some hospitals offer free or reduced care through indigent-care programs. Not all hospitals have EDs, with requirements varying by state and hospital ownership type. Non-profit and government-operated hospitals are more likely to have EDs. Non-profit and government-operated hospitals are more likely to have an ED, providing charity care as part of their missions. The ACA requires tax-exempt hospitals to meet a \"community benefit standard,\" which can include free or reduced care. Federal government finances care for Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP beneficiaries, with emergency services covered. Emergency health services are considered essential under the ACA. The ACA mandates that emergency services are essential health benefits covered by non-grandfathered private insurance plans. Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and ACA exchange plans provide coverage to around 120 million people. Hospitals receive federal payments to offset costs of uncompensated care, including Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments. The ACA included changes to Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments to reduce the uninsured population. Medicaid DSH payment reductions have been delayed until FY2017. Hospitals also receive reimbursements for emergency care provided to certain individuals not eligible for Medicaid. Emergency Medicaid funds are available for services related to pregnancy for individuals who would have otherwise qualified for Medicaid. Federal funding was allotted to states for emergency care provided to undocumented aliens, with the six states with the highest number of apprehensions receiving one-third of the total funding. Emergency Medicaid funds are available for services related to pregnancy for individuals who would have otherwise qualified for Medicaid. Federal funding was allotted to states for emergency care provided to undocumented aliens, with some states still having funds remaining from their allocation. As of May 2014, twenty-nine states have exhausted their allocation, so new claims for services are not being accepted in these states. Some hospitals may not receive full reimbursement for care provided due to difficulties in determining their need for these funds. The federal government also supports hospital emergency preparedness through the Hospital Preparedness Program administered by the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR). The Hospital Preparedness Program, administered by the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), began in FY2002 with peak funding in FY2003 at $515 million, declining to $255 million in FY2014. The program awards grants to enhance surge capacity during public health emergencies, supporting communities and hospitals. While grants do not cover day-to-day operations, they strengthen medical surge capacity, including processes to improve emergency department operations for increased capacity during emergencies. ASPR also has the authority to provide grants for trauma care, although these have not been funded. Trauma care is specialized and offered in designated centers with more intensive services than traditional emergency departments. Trauma centers, distinct from EDs, also have an ED. EDs care for severely injured patients until transfer to a trauma center. Funding for trauma centers may reduce ED trauma care, freeing up resources. Federal support for health infrastructure could decrease ED use by filling system gaps. HRSA supports health workforce development. HRSA supports the development of the health care workforce, focusing on providers for disadvantaged populations. Grants are awarded to federal health centers providing primary, dental, and behavioral health care regardless of ability to pay, reducing ED use for treatable conditions. CMS awards funds to states for the Emergency Room Diversion Grant Program to increase community health centers and improve care coordination. The federal government supports the development of health care workforce, focusing on providers for disadvantaged populations. Grants are awarded to health centers for primary, dental, and behavioral health care to reduce ED use. SAMHSA programs aim to increase access to behavioral health care, potentially reducing ED visits. SAMHSA provides technical assistance and workforce support to ensure availability of behavioral health services. CMS is testing reimbursing certain psychiatric facilities to reduce Medicaid costs for psychiatric patients. These facilities, called Institutions for Mental Disease (IMDs), have traditionally been prohibited from receiving Medicaid payments for services provided to beneficiaries aged 22-64. The CMS-funded demonstration will examine health care costs overall and could provide information on whether reimbursing psychiatric facilities lowers ED use. The federal government supports care coordination through various mechanisms to reduce costs and improve health outcomes. Initiatives administered by CMS focus on coordinating care to reduce costs for beneficiaries. The federal government primarily supports medical research through the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NIH supports medical research and coordinates emergency care research through the Office of Emergency Care Research (OECR). OECR identifies funding opportunities for emergency care and does not directly fund research grants. It was established in 2012 following IOM emergency care reports. Nationwide, emergency departments (EDs) face common challenges in providing effective care, including overcrowding, repeat care for frequent users, and care for patients with behavioral health conditions. Strategies have been developed to address these challenges, but not all EDs will face them, depending on the population they serve. Some hospitals serving patients with better access to healthcare may not experience these challenges. Crowding in emergency departments (EDs) is a common challenge where the demand for services exceeds capacity, leading to long wait times and patients being treated in non-treatment areas. This reflects systemic issues in the healthcare system rather than just an ED problem. EDs often fill gaps in healthcare, especially in communities where they may be the only option available. Crowding reduces access to timely care, leading to ambulance diversions and long wait times for patients. Crowding in emergency departments (EDs) leads to long wait times, ambulance diversions, and patients leaving without being seen. This domino effect affects nearby EDs in urban areas, where healthcare infrastructure struggles to keep up with population growth. Hospitals with specialty services must accept transferred patients under EMTALA, even if their EDs are crowded, leading to increased crowding. ED crowding stems from a mismatch in healthcare supply and demand, often caused by boarding admitted patients due to bed shortages. Boarded patients in hospitals may be kept in the emergency department due to bed shortages or reserved beds for specific conditions or elective surgeries. This leads to worse outcomes for patients, including higher death rates and longer stays, exacerbating crowding in the ED. The primary cause of crowding in emergency departments is boarding patients due to bed shortages. Health system changes can alleviate crowding by addressing input, throughput, and output factors that affect patient care and length of stay in the ED. The emergency department process involves triage, diagnostic testing, treatment, and discharge. Throughput factors like CT scans and consultations impact efficiency. Boarding in the ED is affected by inpatient bed shortages. Population health can affect care needs. Output includes patient disposition post-ED visit. The disposition of a patient from an ED, including hospital admission, transfer, discharge, or death, depends on hospital capacity. Inpatient bed availability varies by hospital and specialty, impacting the ability to transfer admitted patients. Financial incentives may lead hospitals to reserve beds for elective procedures, affecting ED boarding and ambulance capacity. Shortages of beds in certain specialties, such as psychiatric units and intensive care units, can disproportionately affect crowding in emergency departments. Behavioral health patients are often boarded longer, contributing significantly to overcrowding. The lack of ICU beds is a particular concern for vulnerable ED patients requiring intensive care. The number of vulnerable patients requiring prompt ICU care has increased, leading to higher mortality rates. Crowding in emergency departments impacts patients, hospitals, and payers by increasing costs and delaying treatment, reducing access to critical care. Symptoms of crowding like LWBS and ambulance diversion have specific negative effects on patient health, such as missed medical emergencies. Crowding in emergency departments can lead to ambulance diversion, causing delays in patient care and impacting the community. Boarding can have adverse effects on elderly patients, who may experience worse outcomes. Inadequate equipment and staff in EDs can result in patients not receiving the necessary treatments. Inpatient units with specialized staff and routines aim to provide appropriate care to meet patient needs. Crowding and boarding in hospitals impact finances by reducing patient volume and revenue. Ambulance diversions and patients leaving without being seen result in missed billing opportunities. Studies show that reducing wait times and moving boarded patients promptly can significantly increase revenue and treatment capacity. Boarding also leads to longer hospital stays, affecting financial interests, especially under fixed-payment schemes like Medicare. Hospitals aim to reduce patient wait times and crowding in the emergency department to attract patients and improve financial outcomes. They may publicly advertise wait times and quality data to attract private insured patients. CMS reports hospital quality data, including measures related to ED wait times, which can help prospective patients choose a hospital with better outcomes. Some ED measures are linked to Medicare payments, leading hospitals to face financial penalties based on their reporting. Crowding in emergency departments can lead to financial penalties for hospitals due to reporting of ED-related measures. This can also contribute to nursing shortages and difficulty in filling staff vacancies. Experienced staff may leave due to increased patient-care demands, decreased job satisfaction, and concerns about patient safety and liability. Crowding in emergency departments can lead to financial pressures for hospitals, as it increases staffing turnover and training costs. This can also raise healthcare costs for payers, particularly impacting the Medicare program. Additionally, crowding may result in delayed treatment, leading to a higher risk of adverse events, which are more common in older adults and require additional medical care. Strategies to reduce emergency department crowding include moving boarders to inpatient halls, active bed management, and using \"reverse triage\" to create capacity during disasters. These strategies aim to free up emergency department beds and expedite proper inpatient placement. Implementing strategies like the \"four hour rule\" to reduce emergency department crowding by evaluating, treating, discharging, or admitting patients within four hours. Public reporting of data related to boarding and ED length of stay may provide hospitals with incentives to improve efficiency. The Medicare program requires hospitals to meet conditions of participation, including accreditation by organizations like the Joint Commission. Changes by CMS and the Joint Commission may incentivize hospitals to reduce crowding in emergency departments. Frequent ED users are individuals who repeatedly use emergency services. Frequent users of emergency departments (ED) are individuals who use the ED multiple times a year, representing a small percentage of users but accounting for a high number of total visits. They often have chronic conditions, but there is a misconception that they unnecessarily use the ED. Policy makers are concerned about frequent users due to crowding, increased costs, and potential poor care coordination. Frequent ED users can be categorized into three groups based on utilization patterns: frequent non-emergent users, high-cost health system users, and very frequent ED users. Policy options should target these different types of users, with strategies such as improving access and coordination in the ambulatory care system to reduce frequent ED visits. Providers are implementing various strategies to reduce inappropriate ED use, such as expanding outpatient care settings, increasing provider hours, and creating nurse advice lines. CMS has also initiated \"super-utilizer\" programs to control costs, focusing on frequent health system users. These programs target high-cost individuals, including Very Frequent ED Users, by managing chronic conditions and coordinating care. CMS and private payers are focusing on managing chronic conditions to reduce costs associated with ED visits, especially among super-utilizers who account for a significant portion of healthcare spending. Various initiatives are being implemented to target high-cost individuals and prevent unnecessary healthcare utilization. New payment models are being tested to control costs and reduce frequent users by incentivizing care coordination. Strategies to reduce super-users involve testing new payment methods supported by the federal government for Medicare and state Medicaid programs. These initiatives aim to manage chronic conditions and prevent unnecessary healthcare utilization. The federal government supports new payment models like Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), Bundled Payment for Care Improvement Initiative (BPCI), and Medicaid Health Homes to reduce super-utilizers by managing chronic conditions and coordinating care for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. These initiatives aim to lower healthcare costs and improve quality of care. The federal government supports new payment models like ACOs, BPCI, and Medicaid Health Homes to reduce super-utilizers by managing chronic conditions and coordinating care for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. States can enhance health home or managed care models by adding Targeted Case Management services. EDs face challenges in treating patients seeking care for behavioral health conditions and those with both physical and behavioral health conditions, leading to resource strain and crowded conditions. Behavioral health-only visits have also increased rapidly. The number of behavioral health-only visits has increased rapidly, presenting challenges for EDs due to crowded conditions. Mental health and substance use disorders are generally not suitable for ED treatment, except for acute episodes like psychiatric emergencies or overdoses. Patients with behavioral health conditions often turn to EDs due to a lack of community resources for their care. Insufficient community resources contribute to shortages in mental health and substance abuse services, leading to underreported rates of behavioral health conditions. Increases in drug use, like heroin, in certain communities also drive individuals to seek care in EDs. Insurance coverage plays a role, with uninsured individuals with behavioral health conditions making multiple ED visits but being least likely to be admitted. Admission likelihood varies based on patient characteristics. The likelihood of admission to hospitals varies based on patient characteristics, insurance status, and hospital size. Treating behavioral health care in emergency departments can lead to financial constraints and crowding, as patients may wait for transfer to appropriate facilities. Behavioral health patients in EDs may wait for hours or days for an available bed, contributing to crowding and requiring more staff for care. Treating behavioral health patients in emergency departments can lead to crowding and stress due to lack of specialized services and resources. This can exacerbate mental health conditions and result in longer wait times for necessary care. Research has shown that emergency department providers lack training and comfort in treating psychiatric patients, leading to delays in care. Community behavioral health treatment options can reduce ED visits for mental health conditions. Counties with mental health centers and inpatient facilities have seen fewer ED visits for behavioral health issues. Hospitals can also create partnerships with treatment facilities to better manage patients with behavioral health conditions. Increased access to behavioral health care can reduce emergency department (ED) visits for patients with behavioral health conditions. Insurance coverage, such as Medicaid acceptance by treatment facilities, can impact ED use. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) and federal parity requirements aim to expand behavioral health coverage, potentially decreasing ED visits if coupled with access to community providers. Provider shortages may still hinder this outcome. To address emergency care concerns, Congress could use various policy levers like oversight, reimbursement changes, directed spending, statutory mandates, and watchful waiting. These actions could help improve ED operations and access to behavioral health services for individuals gaining coverage. Congress may consider oversight actions such as holding hearings and requesting reports on topics related to ED care. This oversight could motivate HHS to address concerns discussed in the report. Medicare can influence hospital processes by amending conditions of participation and requiring accreditation based on new criteria. The Joint Commission requires hospitals to develop procedures for boarding, including psychiatric patients. Medicare could amend accreditation criteria to improve ED flow by placing a cap on elective admissions and smoothing surgery schedules. CMS proposed strengthening emergency preparedness requirements for Medicare and Medicaid hospitals in 2013. The new conditions of participation for Medicare and Medicaid hospitals require emergency preparedness programs and plans. Congress may provide funding to alleviate ED delivery issues through entitlement or discretionary programs. Statutory changes may be needed for new programs or extending funding. Financial challenges in EDs may require additional funding support from the federal government, as some hospitals provide uncompensated care to ineligible individuals. Congress could consider appropriating targeted funds to support hospitals that provide high volume of uncompensated care to undocumented immigrants, similar to the program that existed until FY2010. Additionally, Congress could review the current system of DSH payments to ensure hospitals with the highest burdens of uncompensated care receive adequate support. Consideration could also be given to a different funding source specifically for emergency care. Congress may wish to consider different funding sources for emergency care under EMTALA, review past efforts to reduce ED use, assess current coordination of care efforts, and evaluate reimbursement policies in federal programs affecting ED functioning. Reimbursement policies in EMS and Medicaid may incentivize unnecessary transport to EDs, leading to overcrowding and higher costs. Medicaid's exclusion of payment to IMDs for certain services limits psychiatric bed availability for adults aged 22-64 with severe mental illness. Changes to these policies could alleviate ED crowding and improve access to psychiatric care. The Medicaid IMD exclusion limits psychiatric bed availability for adults with severe mental illness, contributing to ED crowding. Hospitals face challenges in providing primary and behavioral health care due to provider shortages. Targeted federal investments in areas with high ED crowding could help alleviate these issues. Some evidence suggests that urgent care centers focusing on mental health treatment have reduced ED use in certain areas. Homeless individuals often rely on EDs due to lack of other care options or untreated behavioral health needs. Homelessness is a key factor in frequent ED use, and additional resources for homeless healthcare or better coordination of services could help reduce costs. Congress could consider providing support for emergency care research or the emergency care workforce, including funding for the NIH's Office of Emergency Care Research (OECR) to coordinate research. Currently, there is little support for research focusing on emergency care as a system, which could help develop policies to alleviate concerns in the ED delivery system. Additionally, Congress may need to assess if the current emergency care workforce is sufficient and provide support for its development and sustainability. Congress may consider appropriating funds to support the development of crowding quality measures in emergency departments. Measures like the Emergency Department Work Index and ED occupancy rate are currently used, but they do not fully capture the scope of crowding. Congress could also consider implementing recommendations from the EMTALA Technical Advisory Group to improve the flow of ED patients. Recommendations to address issues in hospitals with specialized behavioral health capabilities include requiring them to accept transfer of patients who are gravely disabled or a danger to themselves, amending EMTALA statute for liability protection, and developing an annual plan for on-call coverage. Congress may consider amending the EMTALA statute or regulations to address ED capacity issues by requiring inpatient units to board patients when the ED is at capacity. Watchful waiting is an option for Congress to assess challenges faced by EDs, such as those related to the uninsured population or fragmented care in the delivery system. Improving emergency department (ED) functioning may require system-wide changes in healthcare delivery, as ED care is influenced by various factors beyond its control. These changes could potentially reduce healthcare costs, as ED care is more expensive than outpatient treatment. Current delivery challenges in EDs also lead to increased costs by delaying patients' access to timely services. Factors such as insurance coverage, availability of inpatient hospital care, and outpatient providers all impact ED care. The availability of inpatient hospital care and outpatient providers, along with changes in healthcare delivery systems and population demographics, may impact ED functioning. Monitoring these evolving variables is crucial as they can either improve or harm ED operations."
