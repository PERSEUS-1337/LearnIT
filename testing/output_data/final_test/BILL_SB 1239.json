The paragraph outlines exemptions from biennial smog check inspections for certain vehicles, including those undergoing initial registration in the state, specially constructed vehicles, vehicles selected for testing, and diesel-powered vehicles. Additionally, the Department of Motor Vehicles can exempt at least 15% of the lowest emitting vehicles from the inspection, as well as any vehicles presenting prohibitive inspection or repair problems.

Vehicles four or less model years old are exempt, unless they are six or less model years old and the state board determines an exception would hinder meeting federal Clean Air Act requirements.
