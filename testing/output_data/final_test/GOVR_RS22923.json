    "content": "The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) procures DOD's ground and air transportation fuels, reselling them to military customers worldwide at a uniform price. DESC buys bulk energy commodities, including jet, diesel, motor, and aviation gasoline, and arranges contracts for fuel supply at commercial airports and military posts. The largest annual fuel procurement is JP-8 and JP-5 jet fuel. In FY2007, the DOD's largest annual fuel procurement was JP-8 and JP-5 jet fuel, followed by diesel fuel. JP-8 represented ~50% of total DOD petroleum product purchases. It is used primarily by Air Force and Army aircraft, as well as in Army tactical vehicles like the Abrams M1A1/M1A2 Main Battle Tank. In Iraq, the breakdown of petroleum used by DOD in FY2007 was 81.5% jet fuel, 15.8% diesel, and 2.6% gasoline. The average cost for fuel ranged from $2.00 a gallon for diesel to $2.05 for JP-8 in FY2007. Commercial jet fuel (Jet A-1) averaged $2.17 per gallon, and refiner crude oil $1.62 per gallon. The DESC reports buying fuel used in support of CENTCOM AOR from five suppliers with contracts containing price escalation provisions. Fuel costs ranged from $1.96 to $2.88 per gallon in 2007, except for AVGAS at $4.98 to $5.29 per gallon. Fuel prices rose in FY2008, with gasoline now ranging from $3.39 to $4.52 a gallon and diesel from $4.08 to $5.21 a gallon. Fuel for use in Iraq is purchased from five companies, including one based in the United States, one from Kuwait, and three from Turkey. Some of these companies have been top suppliers to the Defense Logistics Agency. Fuel is transported into Iraq from Kuwait and Jordan, with transportation costs ranging from $159 to $194 per truck per day. Fuel costs from Turkey also include shipping. The DESC purchases fuel from companies in the United States, Kuwait, and Turkey. Fuel is transported into Iraq from Kuwait and Jordan, with transportation costs included. Fuel costs from Turkey also include shipping. JP-8 jet fuel is supplied by truck under a separate tender agreement by ICTB. Deliveries to the DESC in 2007 include AVGAS, diesel, motor gasoline, Jet A-1, and JP-8 jet fuel from various suppliers. The DESC pays for fuel destined for Iraq, which does not directly impact military units. The DESC purchases fuel from various suppliers in the United States, Kuwait, and Turkey for Iraq. The price of fuel charged to U.S. military units by DESC was raised in 2008 due to increased crude oil costs. In Iraq, 81.8% of fuel used is jet fuel, 15.8% diesel, and 2.6% gasoline, with heavily subsidized gasoline prices by the Iraqi government. Fuel subsidies have been reduced as part of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The official price for a gallon of regular gasoline in Iraq is approximately $1.44, but the black market price can be almost three times higher at around $4.00. The black market price may better reflect the true cost of gasoline in Iraq. The U.S. military pays higher prices for fuels compared to Iraqi civilians due to government subsidies and other factors. The Iraqi government subsidizes gasoline and diesel costs in Iraq, leading to a lower official price compared to the black market. The U.S. military incurs higher transportation costs for fuel in Iraq, and the Defense Energy Support Center charges a standard price to all military customers worldwide."
