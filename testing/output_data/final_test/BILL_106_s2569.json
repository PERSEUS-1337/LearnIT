A new HUBZone pilot program for sparsely populated areas is introduced, allowing flexibility in employment requirements from 2000 to 2003. On September 30, 2003, a small business concern in Alaska, an Alaska Native Corporation, or a subsidiary, joint venture, or partnership can qualify as a HUBZone small business if its principal office is in a HUBZone within the state and at least 35% of its employees working on awarded contracts are in the HUBZone. The contract awarded under section 31(b) requires the work to be performed in a HUBZone within the State of Alaska, with at least 35% of employees residing in a HUBZone in Alaska or an Alaska Native Village. This requirement does not apply in subsequent fiscal years if the total contract dollars awarded exceed a certain threshold. The contract dollars awarded in support of contracting goals for small businesses in Alaska must be more than 2% of the total contract dollars awarded nationally to small businesses. This does not disqualify a HUBZone small business from performing a contract awarded to it.

Section 3(p)(5)(D)(i) is amended to clarify the certification required for a qualified HUBZone small business concern.
