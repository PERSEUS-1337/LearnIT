    "content": "Multiple decades of scientific studies have shown that human activities contribute to global climate change by emitting greenhouse gases from various sources. This led to the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988, under the United Nations, to provide assessments on climate change science and potential response strategies. This eventually led to the creation of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992. The UNFCCC, established in 1992, is a key international cooperation framework for addressing climate change. It includes the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, along with guidelines for implementation. The report focuses on the upcoming COP25 conference and does not cover other aspects of climate cooperation. The report highlights information relevant to the 2019 climate change conference, COP25. The UNFCCC, established in 1992, is the primary multilateral vehicle for international cooperation on GHG-induced climate change. There are 197 Parties to the UNFCCC, including the United States, with broad agreement on the need for all countries to participate to achieve its objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The UNFCCC aims to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere through abatement of emissions and adaptation to climate change for sustainable development. This requires reaching \"net zero\" emissions by balancing emissions and removals of GHGs, with the possibility of continued emissions if accompanied by increased removals. The treaty serves as a framework for international collaboration and evolution of efforts over time. The UNFCCC, adopted in 1992, provides a framework for international collaboration on climate change. The governing body, COP, met in its 25th session in 2019. All Parties have common obligations to inventory, report, and mitigate GHG emissions. The UNFCCC, adopted in 1992, requires all Parties to inventory, report, and mitigate their human-related GHG emissions. Annex I Parties have additional obligations, such as more frequent reporting and providing financing and technology transfers. The distinction between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties has been a point of contention in climate change negotiations. In the 1990s, Annex I Parties expected developing countries to transition into donor countries as their incomes and emissions increased. Disagreements over this issue led to U.S. nonparticipation in the Kyoto Protocol and the collapse of negotiations in Copenhagen in 2009. Some Parties did not adopt GHG abatement targets for the second period of the Kyoto Protocol from 2013 to 2020. The Copenhagen Accord, a nonbinding political statement, marked a shift towards more explicit commitments by non-Annex I Parties to GHG mitigation under the UNFCCC. It specified that Annex I Parties would implement quantified economy-wide GHG targets for 2020. The Annex I Parties would implement quantified economy-wide GHG targets for 2020 in an agreed reporting format, while non-Annex I Parties would commit to mitigation actions in an alternative format. Over 43 Annex I Parties and 47 non-Annex I Parties submitted nonbinding pledges, with differences in the type of action and reporting requirements. The submissions would be compiled separately by the UNFCCC Secretariat. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol was the first subsidiary agreement to the UNFCCC, entering into force in 2005. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol (KP) was the first subsidiary agreement to the UNFCCC, entering into force in 2005. It established legally binding targets for high-income countries and the EU to reduce GHG emissions by 5% below 1990 levels during 2009-2012. Developing countries were not obligated to mitigate GHG emissions. Parties could meet their targets by acquiring emission reduction credits through market mechanisms like the Clean Development Mechanism and emissions trading. Compliance was judged after the first commitment period of 2009-2012. Most high-income Parties, including EU members and other European nations, have committed to further GHG reduction targets for 2013-2020. The Secretariat's assessment found that while Annex I Parties are progressing towards their 2020 targets, some still need to strengthen implementation of existing policies and measures, use market-based mechanisms, and consider contributions from land use, land use change, and forestry to meet their goals. Some Parties are facing challenges due to inadequate policies, high mitigation costs, or energy system constraints. Most high-income Parties, including EU members and other European nations, have committed to further GHG reduction targets for 2013-2020. While Annex I Parties are progressing towards their 2020 targets, some still need to strengthen implementation of existing policies and measures, use market-based mechanisms, and consider contributions from land use, land use change, and forestry to meet their goals. The United States did not join the Kyoto Protocol, and Canada withdrew before the end of the first commitment period due to objections from non-Annex I Parties. Australia, Japan, and other Parties sought an agreement with commitments from all Parties, leading to the Durban Mandate in 2011. This resulted in the 2015 Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement (PA) is the second major subsidiary agreement under the UNFCCC, intended to replace the Kyoto Protocol (KP). The United States has given notice of withdrawal from the PA, effective no earlier than November 4, 2020. Until then, the US may participate as a Party, and after withdrawal, it may participate in a more limited way as an Observer State. The PA was meant to be legally binding on its Parties, although not all provisions are. The Paris Agreement (PA) is intended to be legally binding on its Parties, with nonbinding pledges in NDCs to mitigate GHG emissions and enhance removals. Key aspects include a temperature goal of below 2 o Celsius and a single GHG mitigation framework. Reporting and review provisions are binding, while others are recommendations or collective commitments. The Paris Agreement (PA) establishes a process for countries to set and achieve GHG emission mitigation pledges in five-year increments. It includes a compliance mechanism for accountability and promotes adaptation to climate change through preparedness plans by Parties. Parties agreed to prepare and communicate adaptation plans, with communications recorded in a public registry. The PA reaffirms the financial obligation for developed countries to provide resources for mitigation and adaptation, aiming to mobilize at least $100 billion annually by 2025. Despite progress at COP24/CMA1, unresolved issues will likely continue negotiations at COP26/CMA3. Negotiations on key issues will continue at COP26/CMA3 in Glasgow, Scotland in November 2020. The Katowice Package clarified ambiguities in the Paris Agreement, including guidelines for reporting NDCs and the Enhanced Transparency Framework. Parties agreed to update NDCs every five years to increase ambition in reducing GHG emissions. Details on communication formats for NDCs are still being discussed, with no agreement yet on common timeframes. The details of NDCs are still being worked out, with no agreement on common timeframes yet. Parties with NDCs up to 2025 must submit new ones by 2020, while those with NDCs up to 2030 must communicate or update them in 2020. The content of NDCs remains nationally determined and nonbinding, reflecting a Party's intentions. Guidelines for NDCs submitted in 2025 are provided, with Parties encouraged to use an agreed format for updates in 2020. The PA allows for voluntary cooperation between Parties to implement their NDCs. The Paris Agreement allows for voluntary cooperation between Parties to implement their NDCs, promoting sustainable development and environmental integrity. Market mechanisms can be used to achieve GHG mitigation at a lower cost, inducing Parties to take stronger mitigation commitments. The Adaptation Fund was also discussed in Katowice, with Parties agreeing to provide information on adaptation priorities, needs, plans, and actions through new \"adaptation communications\" and NDCs. Parties in Katowice agreed that the Adaptation Fund, established under the Kyoto Protocol, will serve the Paris Agreement as one of its financial mechanisms. The Global Stocktake, to be held every five years, will assess progress towards the UNFCCC's objective and the PA's goals using the best available science, covering mitigation, adaptation, financial flows, equity, and means of implementation. The next Global Stocktake is scheduled for 2023, with decisions made on the information it will receive from various sources, including non-state actors. The United States has prioritized transparency in reporting efforts under the UNFCCC, with ETF guidelines specifying information required for NDCs. Parties must provide quantifiable information on GHG mitigation actions, implementation time frames, and other details. Technical issues will rely on IPCC advice, and all Parties must report on specific aspects of their NDCs. The guidelines for NDCs include information on targets, time frames, scope, national planning processes, assumptions, fairness, and contribution to UNFCCC objectives. Compliance with guidelines is reviewed by a technical group of experts, with flexibility in reporting only for certain provisions. The Paris Agreement allows flexibility in reporting, review modalities, and progress consideration. Developing countries can use flexibilities if they lack capacity, but must clearly explain this in their Biennial Transparency Report. A 12-member committee facilitates PA implementation. The 12-member committee established to facilitate implementation of the Paris Agreement supports Parties in meeting their obligations as a consultative, pro-compliance mechanism. Developed countries pledged to mobilize US$100 billion annually by 2020 for mitigation and adaptation in low-income countries, with a goal to continue this through 2025 and set a new financial resources goal before then. The financial pledges of US$100 billion annually by developed countries are not enforceable commitments but are crucial for low-income countries to contribute to GHG abatement and adaptation. These resources are also important politically to build confidence in the UNFCCC and PA and to foster trust between lower and higher income economies. Some countries have made pledges towards this goal, with developing countries submitting NDCs with GHG mitigation targets that require adequate financial and technical support. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was established in 2014 to assist lower-income countries in combating climate change through grants and financing for projects. It is funded by contributions from donor countries and other sources, including the private sector. The GCF had raised over $10.2 billion as of April 2019. The GCF has raised over $10.2 billion in signed pledges from 48 countries. The board approved 10 new projects, bringing the total to 111 projects with over $5.2 billion in funding. During a Pledging Conference in Paris, 27 countries pledged $9.8 billion for the next four years. The Adaptation Fund will now serve the Paris Agreement, alongside other funds. Funding arrangements for the transition from the Kyoto Protocol to the Paris Agreement are still being finalized. Funding arrangements for the transition from the Kyoto Protocol to the Paris Agreement are still being finalized. Parties are in disagreement over using market mechanisms under Article 6 to finance the Adaptation Fund. Developed countries are required to submit biennial communications on climate finance starting in 2020. The Standing Committee on Finance will report on support needs for developing countries to implement the UNFCCC and the PA. The committee is tasked with considering financial needs for developing countries to implement the UNFCCC and the PA, focusing on long-term low-emissions and sustainable development pathways. The Technology Framework of the PA aims to guide the Technology Mechanism under the UNFCCC to promote the sharing of information and cooperation in developing new low-emission and climate-resilient technologies. The framework has five focus areas: innovation, implementation, enabling environments, collaboration, and support. The Technology Framework of the Paris Agreement aims to facilitate stakeholder participation, sustainable development, gender equality, and capacity building for indigenous people. The Executive Committee is expected to provide progress reports in collaboration with the Climate Technology Centre. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change includes various reports on the implications of U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, legal frameworks for international agreements, climate change financing, China's contributions to addressing climate change, and joint announcements by China and the United States.
