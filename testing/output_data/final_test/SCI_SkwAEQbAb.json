    "content": "In this study, a novel method using SVD is introduced to determine the number of latent dimensions in machine learning. The method compares the singular value curves of the SVD decomposition of a data set with randomized data set curves to find the crossing point, indicating the number of latent dimensions. The method is compared with Kaisers eigenvalue-greater-than-one rule, Parallel Analysis, Velicers MAP test, and Silhouette Width technique. Results on synthetic data show that Parallel Analysis and the new method are more accurate than other techniques. The Bootstrap SVD method is proposed to estimate the number of latent dimensions using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and comparing singular values from original data with bootstrapped samples. This method is compared to mainstream techniques for determining latent factors in machine learning. The Bootstrap SVD method is compared to mainstream techniques for estimating latent dimensions in dense vs. sparse matrices for Normal and non-Normal distributions. The paper outlines various methods, introduces BSVD algorithm, presents experiments, and discusses results. The study addresses the problem of finding latent factors in different fields and provides a systematic review on latent variables and their applications. In BID15, BID12, and BID21, various techniques of factor analysis are discussed to determine the number of factors to retain, including Kaiser's eigenvalue-greater-than-one rule, Parallel Analysis, Cattell's Scree test, and Velicer's MAP test. The K1-Kaiser method, introduced by BID4 and popularized by BID11, is an early strategy based on eigenvalues of the correlation matrix. Despite some considering it unreliable, it is still used in comparison experiments. The curr_chunk discusses the Parallel Analysis method for determining the number of latent factors in factor analysis. It uses bootstrapping on the correlation matrix and compares eigenvalues to the average data set eigenvalue. BID26 showed improvements over this method, but it is still considered appropriate and accurate by several researchers. The curr_chunk discusses the Scree test as a graphical method to determine the number of components to retain in factor analysis. It involves identifying the elbow point on the plot and keeping the components to the left of it. Researchers can use a ruler to draw a line across the elbow and retain all components above it. The MAP approach by Mumford et al. (2003) based on PCA and partial correlation matrices is a reliable method to determine the number of important factors to retain. Ledesma Clustering can also be used for dimensionality reduction by defining a new space using cluster centroids and point distances. The PAM method, using the Silhouette technique, automatically determines the optimal number of clusters based on the number of latent dimensions in the dataset. SVD is a matrix factorization technique that decomposes the original matrix into eigenvector matrices and a diagonal matrix of singular values, determining dimensions based on their importance. The BSVD method determines the number of dimensions by comparing singular values of \u03a3 and \u03a3 B from a randomized matrix R B generated through bootstrap sampling. The crossing point indicates remaining singular values are not due to influential factors. An example in figure 2 shows data generated with 9 dimensions, identifiable by the elbow at dimensions=9. Bootstrapped samples R B are created through random sampling with replacement. The ability of BSVD to identify latent dimensions is evaluated using synthetic data, limiting generalizability to real datasets. The synthetic data is generated by sampling from distributions to create matrices P and Q, then obtaining R through their product plus Gaussian noise. Two types of distributions are used, normal (Gaussian) and uniform, with specific means and standard deviations. The size of all R matrices is 150 \u00d7 240. The study explores latent dimensions in R matrices of size 150 \u00d7 240, with sparsity created by randomly selecting missing values. Different percentages of sparseness are applied to the data set, and results are compared with existing approaches. The study explores latent dimensions in R matrices of size 150 \u00d7 240 with varying sparsity levels. Missing values are imputed using row and column means, followed by BSVD application. Results are compared with existing methods like Horn's PA and K1 implementations. The BSVD algorithm outperforms other methods, especially in sparse data sets, as shown in tables 1 and 2. Our method, BSVD and PA, show equal and better accuracy than other approaches on dense data sets. Varying sparsity levels affect precision, with BSVD, PA, and K1 performing well in dense data sets with normal distribution. SW technique excels in non-normal dense data sets. In sparse data sets, BSVD and PA continue to demonstrate accuracy. The study compares different methods on sparse data sets with normal and non-normal distribution. BSVD, PA, and K1 perform better in normal sparse data sets, while MAP and SW excel in non-normal sparse data sets. The study concludes that BSVD is superior, especially in sparse data sets, based on t-test results with PA. The study repeats experiments on sparse data sets with normal and non-normal distribution, comparing BSVD and PA using t-test. The results in TAB1 show that increasing sparsity in the sparse data set with normal distribution yields significantly better results with BSVD. However, interpreting the results for non-normal sparse data sets is challenging as the green cells are not affected by increasing sparsity. Overall, the results suggest significance with increasing sparsity. The study introduces a new method for finding latent dimensions using SVD, inspired by PA. Results show significant improvement with increasing sparsity, especially in sparse data sets. BSVD and PA perform similarly in dense data sets, but the new method outperforms in sparse data sets. T-tests confirm the statistical significance of the results. The study introduces a new method for finding latent dimensions using SVD, inspired by PA. Results show significant improvement with increasing sparsity in sparse data sets. The new method outperforms BSVD and PA in sparse data sets, as confirmed by T-tests. The method's performance is limited to the presented experiments and data sets. Further analysis is needed to generalize the method to more complex data sets."
