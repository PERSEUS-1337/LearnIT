The HOPE VI Program Reauthorization and Small Community Mainstreet Rejuvenation and Housing Act of 2003 amends the selection criteria for grants under the United States Housing Act of 1937. Criteria for awarding grants are established, with a focus on involving public housing residents in the planning process for revitalization programs. The HOPE VI Program Reauthorization and Small Community Mainstreet Rejuvenation and Housing Act of 2003 updates grant selection criteria under the United States Housing Act of 1937. The criteria now emphasize involving public housing residents in revitalization planning, including considerations for minimizing displacement and providing supportive services. The updated criteria for grant selection under the United States Housing Act of 1937 include considerations for sustaining project-based housing units, prioritizing existing residents for occupancy, and defining severely distressed public housing. The United States Housing Act of 1937 has been amended to include criteria for grant selection, such as prioritizing existing residents for occupancy and defining severely distressed public housing. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 has also been included in the amendments. The United States Housing Act of 1937 has been amended to extend the program until September 30, 2005. SEC. 3. HOPE VI GRANTS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THROUGH MAIN STREET PROJECTS. The purpose of this section is to provide assistance to smaller communities for developing affordable housing in connection with main street revitalization projects. Grants are available for assisting affordable housing developed through main street projects in smaller communities. The Secretary may make grants to smaller communities for eligible main street projects to develop affordable housing. Grants can only be used for eligible activities within the smaller community's jurisdiction. The Secretary may make grants to smaller communities for eligible main street projects involving affordable housing in commercial areas. Requirements for main street projects include revitalization of historic commercial areas, government and private entity investment, and compliance with historic preservation guidelines. The Secretary may make grants for eligible main street projects involving affordable housing in commercial areas, with a focus on preserving historic architectural features. Eligible affordable housing activities must be conducted with respect to affordable housing and exclude activities related to severely distressed public housing projects. The maximum grant amount for these activities is specified. The maximum grant amount for smaller communities under this subsection is $1,000,000. Smaller communities applying for grants must follow contribution requirements and use supplemental amounts for eligible affordable housing activities. The Secretary will provide a process for smaller communities to apply for grants under this subsection. The Secretary may establish separate criteria for grant applications under this subsection. Selection criteria for grants will be based on criteria from subsection (e)(2) with appropriate changes. Cost limits from subsection (f) apply to affordable housing activities funded by grants. Other provisions do not apply. The provisions of subsections (g), (h), and (i) do not apply to grants under this subsection. Smaller communities receiving a grant must submit a report on its use. Definitions for \"affordable housing\" are provided. The term 'smaller community' refers to a local government unit defined in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. These communities must adhere to specific rules regarding income levels, rent or purchase contributions, and terms of rental or purchase for housing units assisted with a grant under this section. The Community Development Act of 1974 defines smaller communities as those with a population of 30,000 or fewer, not served by a public housing agency, or served by a single agency with 100 or fewer public housing units. Amendments to the United States Housing Act of 1937 require an annual report specifying assistance provided under subsection (n). The United States Housing Act of 1937 has been amended to include a new paragraph regarding the types of projects funded and affordable housing units developed with grants under subsection (n). Additionally, a set-aside for main street housing grants has been established, allocating up to 5 percent of the annual appropriation for grants under subsection (n)."
