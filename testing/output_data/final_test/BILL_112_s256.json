    "content": "The \"American Opportunity Act of 2011\" includes the provision for an Angel Investment Tax Credit under section 30E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"American Opportunity Act of 2011\" includes a provision for a tax credit against the tax imposed by the chapter for the taxable year, equal to 25 percent of qualified equity investments made by a qualified investor in a qualified small business entity. The provision defines qualified equity investments as any form of equity, including partnership interests, common or preferred stock, convertible debt, and warrants. A rule similar to section 1202(c)(3) applies for redemptions. The term \"qualified small business entity\" is defined for the purposes of this section. The term 'qualified small business entity' refers to a domestic corporation or partnership that is a small business, headquartered in the US, and engaged in high technology trades or businesses related to advanced materials, aerospace, biotechnology, electronics, energy, or clean technologies. The term 'qualified small business entity' refers to a domestic corporation or partnership that is a small business, headquartered in the US, and engaged in high technology trades or businesses related to various sectors such as forest products, agriculture, information technology, communication technology, life sciences, marine technology, transportation, or other high technology trades as determined by the Secretary. The business must have been in existence for less than 5 years, employ less than 100 full-time equivalent employees, and have more than 50 percent of its employees. For a corporation or partnership to qualify as a 'qualified small business entity', it must have more than 50 percent of its employees working in the US and have designated equity investments not exceeding $10,000,000 in total. The section discusses the requirements for taxpayers to qualify for certain tax benefits based on the total amount of qualified equity investments made by them or all taxpayers. A qualified investor is defined as an accredited investor or investor network that evaluates new businesses for potential investment. The curr_chunk discusses an investor fund, which is a group of accredited investors organized to make qualified equity investments. The investor fund can be structured as an S corporation, general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, trust, or limited liability company, and the tax credit is allocated to the shareholders or partners based on their ownership interest. The investor fund's tax credit can be claimed by the owner of a single member limited liability company if they are subject to tax under this title. The term 'qualified investor' excludes individuals controlling 50% of the small business, employees of the entity, and certain financial institutions. There is a $500,000,000 annual limitation on angel investment tax credits for 2011-2015, allocated by the Secretary. The Secretary allocates paragraph (1) among qualified small business entities. Any excess angel investment tax credit limitation for a year carries over to the next year. The credit is treated as part of the general business credit, except in specific cases. The credit allowed under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall be treated as a credit allowable under subpart A for such year, with limitations based on the amount of tax. The credit allowed under subsection (a) can exceed the regular tax liability plus section 55 tax, but not the credits allowable under subpart A and section 27. Any excess can be carried forward for up to 20 taxable years if it exceeds the limitation imposed by section 26(a)(1) or subparagraph (B). The unused credit can be carried forward for up to 20 years if it exceeds the limitation imposed by section 26(a)(1) or subparagraph (B). Related parties are treated as one person, and the basis of any investment for which a credit is allowed is reduced by the credit amount. The recapture of any credit allowed under subsection (a) for a qualified equity investment held for less than 3 years is provided for by the Secretary through regulations. Exceptions to recapture include transfers due to death, between spouses, incident to divorce, or transactions under section 381(a). The Secretary will prescribe regulations to prevent abuse, impose reporting requirements, and apply provisions to newly formed entities regarding acquisitions of assets by corporations. The angel investment tax credit is included in the general business credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The angel investment tax credit is amended in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, with changes to sections 1016(a), 24(b)(3)(B), 25(e)(1)(C)(ii), and 25A(i)(5)(B) and (5) to include section 30E. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include section 30E in various sections such as 25B, 26, 30, 30B, 30D, 904, and 1400C. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new item in the table of sections for subpart B of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. Sec. 30E. Angel investment tax credit. The amendments apply to investments made after December 31, 2010. Regulations on allocation of national limitation must be prescribed within 120 days. Regulations specify how small business entities apply for an allocation and the criteria for determining allocation. The Secretary or delegate must ensure proper allocation of funds to qualified small business entities, considering factors such as angel investment tax credits, federal grants, and population density in different states. The Comptroller General will audit and report on the angel investment tax credit program, including allocations to qualified small business entities."
