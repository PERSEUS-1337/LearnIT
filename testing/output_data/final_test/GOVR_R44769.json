    "content": "The 104th Congress added a provision to House Rule X requiring standing committees to adopt oversight plans by February 15. The 115th Congress added a requirement for committees to include statements on authorizations for programs or agencies within their jurisdiction. These statements must identify programs with lapsed authorizations and those needing a comprehensive review. Committees must also describe programs or agencies to be authorized in the current or next Congress and outline oversight plans to support these authorizations. Recommendations for program consolidation or termination are also required. The committees are tasked with making recommendations for consolidating or terminating duplicative or unnecessary programs and agencies, converting mandatory funding to discretionary appropriations, and addressing federal rules inconsistent with Congress's authority. Committee chairs must coordinate with other committees to ensure comprehensive authorization efforts. House rules allow for exceptions to the general division of policy and funding responsibilities. The House rules include exceptions for legislative language in appropriations bills that reduce expenditures, known as the Holman rule. This rule, named after Representative William Holman, requires the language to be relevant and result in clear budget reductions. The House has narrowed the rule's application over time through precedents. The House has adopted a separate order for the first session of the 115th Congress that allows reductions in expenditures by cutting amounts of money in the bill, reducing the number and salary of officers, or cutting compensation from the Treasury. This rule, known as the Holman rule, only applies when clear budget reductions are achieved through legislative provisions in appropriations bills. The Holman rule allows for reductions in government activities, federal employees, offices, and pay in appropriations bills. Amendments cannot increase budget authority without an equal or greater decrease. The standing order in Congress requires any amendment to include an equal or greater decrease in budget authority. This rule aims to prevent savings from one amendment being used as an offset for another. It mandates the inclusion of a spending reduction account in general appropriations bills to temporarily hold transferred budget authority. The bill allows the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee to add a spending reduction account after the bill is reported. It also requires a spending reduction account in general appropriations bills and allows en bloc amendments to transfer appropriations. Amendments can be made to portions of the bill not yet open for amendment without a division of the question. A point of order prohibits measures that exceed allocated budget authority. During the 109th Congress, the House adopted a resolution (H.Res. 248) to enforce budget authority limits on appropriations bills. This resolution prohibits a motion for the Committee of the Whole to rise and report an appropriations bill if it exceeds the allocated budget authority. If a point of order is made and sustained, a vote is required before rising and reporting. The Committee of the Whole may rise and report the bill if voted in the affirmative, with one proper amendment allowed to bring the measure into compliance. Advance appropriations are funds available for obligation in future fiscal years, with limits set by the House in recent years. In recent years, the House has set limits on advance appropriations through budget resolutions and separate orders. The 115th Congress prohibits advance appropriations exceeding $28,852,000,000 for specified programs and $66,385,032,000 for veterans' accounts. The House has set limits on advance appropriations, with a standing order related to direct spending known as the long-term spending point of order. It requires the Congressional Budget Office to estimate if certain legislation would increase spending by over $5 billion in any 10-year period. The House has set limits on advance appropriations with a standing order related to direct spending. Legislation that would cause an increase in spending is prohibited, except for certain exceptions. A point of order is established against legislation that would reduce the actuarial balance of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund. The point of order applies to legislation that would negatively impact the actuarial balance of the OASDI Trust Fund and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund over a 75-year period. It aims to prevent the transfer of funds between the two trust funds. The standing order pertains to budgetary treatment of legislative provisions for federal land conveyance to state, local, or tribal entities in the House. It clarifies that such provisions will not increase spending, decrease revenues, or be subject to budgetary points of order or leadership protocols related to budgetary legislation."
