Congress findings show that the average public school in America is 42 years old, with rapid deterioration after 40 years. It would cost $112 billion to bring all schools into good condition, and one-third need extensive repair. Many schools lack infrastructure for necessary technologies. The Federal Government can assist State, regional, and local entities in addressing school construction needs by providing low-interest loans for paying interest on bonds and supporting State-administered school construction programs. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"bond\" includes any obligation, \"Governor\" includes the chief executive officer of a State, \"local educational agency\" is defined as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and \"public school facility\" excludes certain athletic and non-government owned facilities. A qualified school construction bond is a bond issued by a state or local entity for the construction, rehabilitation, or repair of a public school facility. A stabilization fund refers to the fund established under section 5302 of the Act. The term \"State\" refers to each of the several States of the United States, along with other territories and regions. SEC. 4. Loans for school construction bond interest payments and other support. Loans and state-administered programs under section 5(b) provide funds to States for making loans to entities for school construction bond interest payments. The funds support State revolving fund programs or other State-administered programs that assist entities in paying for construction, rehabilitation, repair, or acquisition. States with restrictions may use the funds to support programs if they have laws prohibiting certain loans. Governors of each State can make requests for funding. The Governor of each State must request assistance from the Secretary of the Treasury for funds under this Act. Priority should be given to entities with projects for schools in greatest need, considering factors like high education costs per child. Children from low-income families living in areas with high concentrations of low-income families or in sparsely populated areas may qualify for assistance under the Act. States using funds for school facilities must repay the amount plus interest at a rate of 4.5 percent. States receiving assistance under the Act must repay the loan plus interest at a 4.5 percent annual rate. Repayment begins after the 15th year of eligibility, and must be completed within a 10-year period. Exceptions to interest accrual apply until January 1, 2006. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act requires full funding for special education services, with a promised level of 40 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure for each state. Starting January 1, 2006, a 0 percent interest rate applies to funds provided to states under the Act. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act mandates funding for special education services, with percentages ranging from 20 to 40 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure for each state. The federal government ensures proper distribution of funds for school construction bonds and related costs under the Act, with a minimum of 40 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure allocated to each state. The Act ensures proper distribution of funds for school construction bonds and related costs, with a minimum of 40 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure allocated to each state. The authority does not approve or disapprove school construction plans but ensures funds are used to supplement, not supplant, school construction efforts in the state. The Act ensures proper distribution of funds for school construction bonds with a minimum of 40 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure allocated to each state. From $20,000,000,000 in the stabilization fund, $400,000,000 will be allocated to assist Indian tribes. 50% of the assistance must be used for school construction bond interest payments, while the remaining 50% can support tribal programs. The Secretary of the Treasury will allocate funds from the stabilization fund to assist tribal governments with construction, rehabilitation, repair, or acquisition costs. Each State submitting a request will receive an amount based on their previous funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Education Act of 1965 allocates funds to states based on previous funding levels. The Secretary of the Treasury disburses funds annually from October 1, 2000, to September 30, 2017. States must receive a minimum of $100,000,000. The Secretary of the Treasury and Secretary of Education notify each state of their funding amount. The Secretary of Education and the Secretary of the Treasury will inform each state of the funds they are eligible to receive for loans and support under the Education Act of 1965."
