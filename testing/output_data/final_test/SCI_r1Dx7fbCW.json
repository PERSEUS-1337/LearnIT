    "content": "CROSSGRAD is a method for learning a classifier that generalizes to new domains without needing an adaptation phase or domain features. It utilizes domain signals for predicting labels and prevents overfitting by jointly training a label and domain classifier. This approach involves data augmentation through domain-guided perturbations of input instances, enabling direct perturbation of inputs without distributional assumptions. CROSSGRAD is a method for learning a classifier that generalizes to new domains without an adaptation phase. Empirical evaluation on three different applications confirms the effectiveness of this approach. Domain-guided perturbation outperforms generic instance perturbation methods in generalization to unseen domains. Data augmentation is a more stable and accurate method than domain adversarial training for training a classification model using multi-domain training data to generalize to labeling instances from unseen domains. This approach eliminates the need for a separate adaptation step between the source and target domains. During training, labeled data is obtained from a subset of domains. Each example consists of input x, true label y, and domain d. The goal is to predict labels for all domains, including unseen ones. Learning Pr(y|x) is challenging compared to Pr(y|x, d). Previous work used specific domain geometry, while our approach aims to avoid such constraints. In contrast to explicit domain representation in kernel regression, our approach relies on deep networks to discover implicit features. Conventional training objectives may lead to overfitting on seen domains. Domain adversarial training aims to create a domain-independent representation, but does not always prevent network overfitting. Our approach involves data augmentation through domain-guided perturbations of input instances, aiming to preserve domain signals for in-domain test instances. By replacing domain signals with those from other domains, we generate augmented instances. Imperfect domain classifiers are used to train the network for perturbing domain signals. The approach involves data augmentation through domain-guided perturbations of input instances to preserve domain signals. This is achieved by training a classifier network with a suitable loss function and using the loss gradient to perturb instances in directions that change the domain classifier loss the most. The training loss for the y-predictor network on original instances is combined with the training loss on augmented instances, known as cross-gradient training. Performance of this approach, called CROSSGRAD, is studied on various domain adaptive tasks with demonstrated gains on new domains without out-of-domain instances available at training time. Domain adaptation techniques, such as domain adversarial networks (DANs), have been used in various tasks in speech, language processing, and computer vision. DANs aim to learn a representation in the last hidden layer that does not differentiate between different domains. This approach is beneficial when target domain data is limited or unavailable. In this paper, the goal is to generalize to unseen domains by learning representations that minimize domain dissimilarity and retain the functional relationship with the label. Different approaches like BID20, BID1, and BID3 are discussed for domain generalization, with a focus on utilizing attribute annotations and shared features across domains. Domain adversarial networks (DANs) like BID2 are also mentioned as a method for domain generalization. Domain adversarial networks (DANs) like BID2 can be misled by over-fitting representation layers to training domains, hindering generalization to new test domains. Conventional regularization approaches are relevant for improving generalizability. Other methods like BID30 and BID13 use SVM classifiers with regularization techniques for domain-specific components. The method discussed focuses on adversarial training to augment training data by perturbing examples along domain loss. It models domain variation in a continuous space and projects perturbation to instances based on label and domain characteristics. The Bayesian model captures dependencies among label, domains, and input differently from existing methods. The method discussed focuses on adversarial training to augment training data by perturbing examples along domain loss. It models domain variation in a continuous space and projects perturbation to instances based on label and domain characteristics. The Bayesian model captures dependencies among label, domains, and input differently from existing methods. The alphabet and domain can be changed independently, with the distribution of domain features well-supported in the training set for generalizability to new domains during testing. The assumption of modeling domains in a continuous space allows for generalization to new domains, even if they are discrete. By estimating the inferred continuous representation of a domain, we can capture variations in domains like fonts and speakers through latent continuous features. The challenge lies in ensuring that the model for predicting outcomes is not overfitted on the inferred domain representations during training. To prevent overfitting, it is important to avoid using separate classifiers for each training domain. Instead, the goal is to encourage generalization by sampling new training examples from a continuous space of domains. This approach involves transforming the inferred domain of each training instance to a random domain while keeping the label unchanged. The aim is to create an augmented dataset that can generalize to new domains effectively. The proposed data augmentation strategy aims to perturb input data minimally to avoid changing labels significantly. A model G(x) is used to extract domain features, supervised to predict domain labels. The method involves creating a continuous space of domains for generalization and preventing overfitting by sampling new training examples. The classifier aims to minimize domain shifts by perturbing input data minimally. It samples new examples to ensure the domain is different from the original. The model trains the domain feature extractor to avoid domain shifts when perturbing data for label changes. The Jacobian matrix accounts for the change in continuous domain features. The JJ term in the model accounts for distortion in mapping between manifolds. The perturbation induces a natural domain perturbation and is part of a gradient descent process. The network architecture includes a domain classifier trained to be robust to label changes. The training algorithm, CROSSGRAD, integrates data augmentation and batch training. CROSSGRAD training involves updating parameter spaces for J l and J d simultaneously, showing superiority over independent training. The algorithm handles various correlations between y and d, providing effective domain generalization across different tasks and model architectures. The study compares different model architectures for domain generalization, showing that CROSSGRAD's domain guided perturbations outperform LABELGRAD. DANs, a domain adaptation method, provides little improvement. The dataset involves character recognition across fonts with 109 fonts partitioned for training, testing, and validation. The dataset includes handwritten characters from the Devanagari script and MNIST digits rotated at different angles for domain generalization. The neural network used is LeNet for character recognition and a 2-layer convolutional network for digit recognition. The network used for spoken word recognition across users is a 2-layer convolutional one. The Google Speech Command Dataset was utilized, with 20% of domains each for testing and validation. The number of training domains was 100 for the experiments. Hyper-parameters were selected based on accuracy on the validation set. In CROSSGRAD networks, perturbations have similar sizes as in LABELGRAD. Optimizers differ between datasets, with RMS prop used for the first three and SGD for the Speech dataset. CROSSGRAD incorporates g in the label classifier network. Comparison with DAN, LABELGRAD, and a baseline shows CROSSGRAD improves accuracy across all datasets. The study compares different methods with a model changed to a 2-block ResNet BID8 instead of LeNet for the Fonts and Handwriting dataset. Insights on CROSSGRAD are presented through experiments on the MNIST dataset, showing successful extraction of continuous domain representation. The classifier successfully extracts continuous domain representation even with categorical input labels. The embeddings are not correlated with labels, indicating CROSSGRAD's effectiveness in training domains that do not directly cover test domains. Increasing the number of training domains enhances CROSSGRAD's utility, as shown in experiments on the speech dataset. CROSSGRAD outperforms the baseline and LABELGRAD significantly with a small number of training domains. However, as the training data covers more domain variations, the improvement provided by CROSSGRAD decreases. When trained on over 1000 domains, both CROSSGRAD and LABELGRAD show no additional gains beyond the baseline accuracy of 88.3%. DAN provides unstable gains, while LABELGRAD shows smaller relative gains compared to CROSSGRAD. The handling of multidimensional, non-linear involvement of g in determining x by CROSSGRAD is challenging to understand. In a study on data augmentation for domain generalization, CROSSGRAD is compared against other methods using leave-one-domain-out experiments. Results show CROSSGRAD performs well except for extreme rotation angles, where it is beaten. The method is able to interpolate domain representations through 'hallucination' from other training domains. CROSSGRAD is a data augmentation method that considers domain and label interactions to generate perturbations for training. It performs well in domain generalization experiments, except for extreme rotation angles. The method can interpolate domain representations through 'hallucination' from other training domains. CROSSGRAD is a data augmentation method that excels in domain generalization experiments by effectively utilizing partially correlated y and d without explicit distributional assumptions. It performs best when training domains are limited and do not directly cover test domains. Future work includes extending CROSSGRAD to leverage labeled or unlabeled data in the test domain and integrating features of LABELGRAD and CROSSGRAD into a unified algorithm. The Jacobian, computed through back-propagation, is used to increment x by J \u2206\u011d in the initial gradient descent step."
