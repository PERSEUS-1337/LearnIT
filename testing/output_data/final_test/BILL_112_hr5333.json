The Middle Class Tax Fairness Act of 2012 includes a fair share tax on high-income taxpayers, imposing an additional tax based on adjusted gross income. The Middle Class Tax Fairness Act of 2012 introduces a fair share tax for high-income taxpayers, calculated as the excess of the tentative fair share tax over the sum of regular tax liability, section 55 tax, and payroll tax, minus certain allowable credits. The Middle Class Tax Fairness Act of 2012 establishes a tentative fair share tax at 30% of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income minus the modified charitable contribution deduction. The modified charitable contribution deduction is based on the amount of itemized deductions allowable under the regular tax for the taxable year. High-income taxpayers are defined as those with an adjusted gross income above a certain threshold. If an individual does not itemize deductions, the deduction for charitable contributions will be zero. The tax code adjusts the income threshold for high-income taxpayers annually based on inflation, increasing the limit for charitable contribution deductions. The tax code adjusts income thresholds for high-income taxpayers annually based on inflation, rounding amounts to the nearest $10,000. Payroll tax is calculated as taxes imposed minus deductions, with special rules for estates and trusts. The tax code adjusts income thresholds annually for high-income taxpayers based on inflation.
