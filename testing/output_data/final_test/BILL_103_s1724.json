Sickle Cell Disease disproportionately affects African-Americans, as well as other populations like Puerto Rican, Cuban, and southern Italian ancestry. It is a painful disorder caused by abnormal hemoglobin, leading to untimely death. Sickle Cell Disease is an inherited disorder that can be passed down to offspring if both parents carry the genetic trait. There is no national research center dedicated to this disease in the United States, and currently, there is no known cure. Louisiana's minority population is 1,299,281, with an estimated 3,248 individuals having the disease, and 25 percent of them will have the most severe form. Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is the largest predominantly African-American university in the United States with approximately 16,700 students. The university, along with the Louisiana Legislature, has committed resources to develop a National Center for Sickle Cell Disease Research. The National Center for Sickle Cell Disease Research is being established at Southern University in Baton Rouge with the goal of finding a cure for the disease through biomedical research and clinical investigations. The center will also conduct human behavioral studies to gain new knowledge on counseling and education methods. The National Center for Sickle Cell Disease Research at Southern University aims to improve coping skills of patients and families, collaborate with other Louisiana institutions for clinical trials, provide publishing opportunities for faculty, and train students in research methods for Sickle Cell Disease. The National Center for Sickle Cell Disease Research at Southern University aims to collaborate on research projects with other institutions on Sickle Cell Disease. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award a grant to the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals for the establishment of the National Center for Sickle Cell Disease Research at Southern University in Baton Rouge. Louisiana must certify that it has provided $7,000,000 to support the center and has a plan for continued funding. $21,000,000 is authorized for this purpose."
