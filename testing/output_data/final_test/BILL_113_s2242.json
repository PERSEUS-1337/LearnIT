The \"Community Financial Protection Act of 2014\" aims to address challenges faced by community bankers, credit unions, and independent depository institutions by allowing the prudential regulator to act as a conduit for report requests. Section 1026(b) of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 is amended to define 'publicly available information' as specific financial reports submitted to regulatory bodies. The Director shall request reports through prudential regulators from persons described in subsection (a) to support the Bureau in implementing Federal consumer financial laws, conducting examinations, and assessing risks. The Director may request institution-specific reports from persons described in subsection (a) to assess risks to consumers and consumer financial markets. Requests cannot be industry-wide or pertain to multiple persons. The Director must show that publicly available information is insufficient for the purpose of the request. The prudential regulator has the authority to deny requests for reports or information made by the Director. If the regulator decides to fulfill a report request, they must use existing reports related to the person in question provided to a Federal or State agency. The Director can accept these existing reports to meet the requirements. The prudential regulator can deny report requests from the Director but if fulfilled, reports must be in formats consistent with those submitted to Federal and State agencies."
