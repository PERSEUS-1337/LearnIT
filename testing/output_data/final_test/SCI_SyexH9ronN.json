    "content": "Meta-Reinforcement learning focuses on developing efficient exploration strategies by modeling a separate exploration policy for the task distribution. This approach allows for easier adaptation to specific tasks and stabilizes the training process. The model demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods. Meta-RL aims to improve data efficiency and generalization by incorporating multiple inductive biases and heuristics inspired by human learning abilities. Despite efforts, achieving human-level performance remains challenging in reinforcement learning due to overfitting and limited adaptability to new tasks. Meta-RL addresses data efficiency and generalization issues by learning inductive biases and heuristics from data. Policy initialization based meta-learning approaches like MAML have gained attention for adapting policies to new tasks efficiently. Efficient exploration strategies are crucial for quickly finding optimal policies in new environments, with recent works using latent variables to model exploration behaviors. Efficient exploration strategies are crucial for quickly finding optimal policies in new environments. Recent works focus on improving credit assignment for meta-learning objectives. To address issues with pre-and post-update policies exhibiting different behaviors, a separate exploration policy is proposed to find trajectories for fast adaptation of the exploitation policy on given tasks. Meta-RL aims to learn a policy that can generalize to a distribution of tasks, with each task corresponding to a different Markov Decision Process. The goal is to quickly adapt the policy to any task with the help of few examples. MAML is a gradient-based meta-RL algorithm introduced to find a good initialization for a policy that can be adapted to any task. Meta-RL algorithm MAML aims to find a good policy initialization that can be adapted to any task by fine-tuning with gradient updates using sampled trajectories. The objective function maximizes expected reward by optimizing for pre-update trajectory distribution to increase likelihood of good adaptation steps. ProMP BID9 addresses the limitation of MAML by incorporating the \u2207 \u03b8 J pre (\u03c4 , \u03c4 ) term in the update to gather useful experiences for fast adaptation. They use DICE BID2 for causal credit assignment on the pre-update trajectory distribution, but propose a low variance approximation to stabilize updates. The pre-update and post-update policies are expected to exhibit different behaviors, such as exploration and exploitation. The text discusses the challenges of transitioning from exploration to exploitation phases in reinforcement learning algorithms. It suggests using separate policies for pre-update and post-update sampling to address this issue. The inner loop updates involve importance sampling when using the exploration policy for sampling. This off-policy update results in high variance estimates due to misalignment of outer and inner gradients. Using a self-supervised/supervised objective can help address the instability in the inner loop updates. The inner loop updates aim to provide task-specific information to the agent for adapting its behavior in a new environment. To address instability, a network can predict task-specific properties like reward function or expected return, updating its parameters with a supervised learning objective. This approach differs from traditional meta-RL methods by using supervised loss for stability during updates. Our proposed model consists of three modules: the exploration policy, the exploitation policy, and the self-supervision network. The agent collects trajectories using the exploration policy for each task and updates shared parameters by minimizing regression. The choice of self-supervision/supervision objective heavily influences the update's variance and usefulness. The proposed model includes exploration and exploitation policies, as well as a self-supervision network. The exploitation policy is updated using the DICE operator to simplify gradient computation. Parameters are updated to adapt behavior for maximizing return, with trajectories used for policy gradient updates. The proposed model includes exploration and exploitation policies, as well as a self-supervision network. The gradients of J(z , \u03b8) w.r.t. \u03c6 are shown in Eq. 6, with high variance addressed by replacing return R \u00b5 t with advantage estimate A \u00b5 t. Evaluation was done on various environments, with network architecture and hyperparameters detailed in the appendix. Limited hyperparameter tuning was done due to computational constraints, expecting further improvements with tuning. Our proposed method outperforms baseline approaches like MAML, EMAML, and ProMP in benchmark continuous control tasks. Performance plots show our method has better asymptotic performance and training stability with lower variance. Particularly excelling in 2DPointEnvCorner, where rewards are sparse. Our method outperforms baseline approaches like MAML, EMAML, and ProMP in benchmark continuous control tasks, especially in 2DPointEnvCorner with sparse rewards. Our algorithm demonstrates stable updates and efficient exploration, outperforming ProMP which shows unstable training. Additionally, our method showcases good exploration behavior with only two trajectories for updates, highlighting the strength of our approach. The separation of exploration and exploitation policies allows for better performance in certain situations. Ablations: Ablation experiments were conducted to analyze the impact of different algorithm components on 2D point navigation task. Variants include VPG-Inner loop, Reward Self-Supervision, Vanilla DICE, and E-MAML Based. Results show varying performance levels due to factors like high variance off-policy updates and sparse rewards. Our model, using low variance dice gradients and return-based self-supervision, achieves peak performance and stable training in meta-RL. We propose a separate exploration policy for task distribution, providing flexibility in training and easier adaptation to specific tasks. Future work includes exploring separate exploration and exploitation policies in other meta-learning approaches. Our model, utilizing self-supervised techniques, outperforms previous works in both sparse and dense reward tasks, showing stability during training. The use of a separate exploration policy for initial trajectories and variance reduction techniques in the exploration policy significantly impact performance. The idea of separate exploration and exploitation policies is not limited to MAML and can be applied more broadly. Using successor representations provides a more accurate baseline than predicting N-step returns directly. Additional experiments on a different environment validate these findings. In a different environment, the agent is initialized at the center of a semi-circle, with tasks involving reaching randomly sampled goal locations. The agent must efficiently explore with only 2 pre-update trajectories per task to identify the goal. Our exploration agent's trajectories (orange and blue) show effective exploration compared to the exploitation/trained agent (green). Our agent has learned to explore the environment effectively, but a policy focusing on the periphery of the semi-circle would be more beneficial. By maximizing environment rewards, we can achieve this exploration behavior. Our experiment, Ours-EnvReward, demonstrates that decoupling exploration and exploitation policies provides flexibility in training and allows for the addition of domain knowledge. The experiment with Walker2DRandParams and HopperRandParams showed matching performance with baselines but no significant improvement. Future work may involve testing next-state prediction as a self-supervision objective. The shared parameter z is treated as a learnable latent embedding with fixed initial values. The policy networks in the experiments have the same architecture as in BID9. Hyper-parameters and optimization settings are kept consistent across all runs. The code is available in the supplementary material. The code for the policy networks used in the experiments is available in the supplementary material, and a cleaned version will be open sourced online soon."
