The devastating 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc on Sri Lanka, affecting over 70% of the coastline, displacing 800,000 people, injuring 14,000, and killing 40,000. Nearly 5,000 families were displaced, with 90,000 homes destroyed and 20,000 partially damaged. The country also lost hospitals, medical centers, clinics, and schools, impacting its tourist industry recovery after years of civil war. After more than 20 years of civil war, Sri Lanka suffered a loss of over 4,000 hotel rooms that are no longer usable. The main roads and railway system along the coastline were devastated, cutting off access to the affected areas. The fishing industry was severely impacted, with 80% of fishing boats destroyed, leading to a major loss of nutrition and employment for 170,000 fishermen. Ten out of 12 fishing harbors and most boat-building plants were also destroyed. The industry's nets, land storage, and transportation facilities were destroyed, along with ice making facilities. Coastal estuary sites and farmlands were silted up and destroyed. Over 40% of the population relied on fishing, while 11% depended on agriculture. Rebuilding will require billions of dollars and three to five years. Sri Lanka's key sectors were food processing, textiles, apparel, telecommunications, and banking. Agriculture accounted for 20.1% of GDP in 2003, while industry, including garments, food processing, and chemicals, accounted for 26.3% of GDP. The tsunami has prompted collaboration between the government and rebel forces in Sri Lanka for peace talks. Before the tsunami, Sri Lanka had implemented an economic reform program to open its economy to international competition, aiming for increased growth, international trade, and foreign investment. The United States has an opportunity to support Sri Lanka in relief efforts, economic reform, peace process, and rebuilding. \"Trade enhancement is emphasized in Section 3.\" Eligibility for duty-free treatment under subsection (c) requires Sri Lanka to establish a market-based economy, protect private property rights, uphold the rule of law, political pluralism, and ensure due process and equal protection under the law.

The curr_chunk emphasizes the need for infrastructure development, support for private enterprise, capital market formation, anti-corruption measures, and protection of worker rights. The curr_chunk highlights the criteria for countries to receive trade benefits, including adherence to labor standards, national security interests, human rights, and cooperation in combating terrorism.

If Sri Lanka fails to make continual progress in meeting the requirements, the President can terminate the preferential treatment. Duty-free treatment applies to Sri Lankan products that meet specific requirements.
