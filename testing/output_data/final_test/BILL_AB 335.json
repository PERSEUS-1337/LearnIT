    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 3 (Section 39150) of Division 26 of the Health and Safety Code establishes an enforcement policy for minor violations to ensure human health, safety, and the environment are protected efficiently. The intent is to promote faster compliance and cooperation between regulatory bodies and the regulated community. The state board and districts must implement regulations to classify minor violations based on factors like magnitude, scope, severity, and impact on health, safety, and the environment. The degree of violation's contribution to goal failure or compliance difficulty is considered for minor violations, excluding intentional violations, economic benefits, chronic violations, or by recalcitrant violators. For chronic violations or violations by recalcitrant violators, evidence of neglect or disregard for division requirements is considered by the state board or designated officer. A \"notice to comply\" is a written method for alleging minor violations. The notice to comply is issued during an inspection by an authorized representative to determine compliance. If testing is needed and cannot be done during the inspection, the representative has time to conduct it. If violations are found, the facility owner/operator is notified in writing. The notice to comply is issued during an inspection to inform the facility owner/operator of alleged minor violations, provide a way to achieve compliance, and set a 30-day time limit for compliance. It also includes information for possible reinspection of the facility. An authorized representative must issue a notice to comply for minor violations found during an inspection before leaving the site. A notice to comply must be signed and returned within the specified period after achieving compliance with cited requirements. A single notice will cover all minor violations found during the same inspection, listing each violation separately. A notice to comply is the only means by which a minor violation can be cited, and immediate correction in the presence of the inspector exempts further action. Compliance with the notice prevents other enforcement actions by the state board or district representative. If a person disagrees with violations cited in a notice to comply, they can appeal to the state board or district. Failure to comply may result in immediate enforcement action to prevent harm to public health, safety, or the environment. A notice to comply may lead to reinspection of the facility to ensure compliance or correction of minor violations. The state board or district may request documentation to support compliance on a case-by-case basis. (j) This section does not limit the ability of city attorneys, district attorneys, county counsel, or the Attorney General to bring criminal proceedings on behalf of the people of California. It also allows the state board or district to cooperate in such proceedings. If a minor violation warrants a civil penalty, the state board or district shall assess it in addition to issuing a notice to comply, based on written findings justifying the decision. The state board must report to the Legislature by January 1, 2020, on the implementation of the chapter. Districts must provide requested information to assess achievement of chapter goals. Certain sections do not apply to districts with existing similar programs as of January 1, 2015. No reimbursement is required by this act as local agencies or school districts have the authority to levy charges to cover mandated services or because costs may be incurred due to changes in penalties or definitions of crimes."
