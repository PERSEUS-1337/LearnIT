    "content": "Recent expansion in natural gas production, driven by new technologies like hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling, has made natural gas a significant component in the U.S. energy market. Advocates highlight its domestic availability, economic viability, and potential as a cleaner energy source. Natural gas offers versatility as a fuel for various purposes and can be exported when liquefied to support energy needs of allies. Natural gas, when liquefied, can be exported to support energy needs of allies. It emits less CO2 than oil or coal when used for electricity generation. Pollution control measures for natural gas have received less federal attention, but concerns have arisen with unconventional production methods. These concerns initially focused on water quality issues from hydraulic fracturing. Contamination of groundwater and surface water from hydraulic fracturing and related production activities has raised concerns. Issues such as water management practices, land use changes, induced seismicity, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions are also significant. There is confusion regarding the climate implications of natural gas, as it has lower CO2 emissions intensity than oil or coal, but methane leakage poses a challenge due to its potency as a greenhouse gas. The debate over the environmental and economic impacts of natural gas production continues, with concerns about methane leakage offsetting its lower CO2 emissions intensity. More analysis is needed to determine the net benefits to the economy, jobs, infrastructure, and the environment. This report does not delve into the economic or national security impacts, nor does it assess the full environmental impacts. This report focuses on the claim that natural gas production is less GHG-intensive than other fossil fuels, specifically looking at the climate implications of switching from coal to natural gas in the electric power sector. Congressional interest in U.S. energy policy revolves around securing economical and reliable fuel resources, with considerations for economic growth, job creation, national security, and environmental concerns. The recent increase in domestic natural gas production has led to advocacy for policies supporting its development. Various proposals by Congress and the Obama Administration aim to incentivize natural gas production and use, increase production on federal lands, and streamline infrastructure approval processes. Several bills and rules have been proposed to promote natural gas infrastructure development, transfer federal regulation to states, and implement EPA standards. Stakeholders recommend a thorough analysis of the costs, benefits, and impacts of these proposals. A thorough assessment of the economic and environmental impacts of increased natural gas development, including a comparative analysis of GHG emissions from natural gas and other fossil fuels. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is used to evaluate and compare environmental impacts, track CO2 and GHG emissions, and express them in a universal metric. Life-cycle assessments (LCAs) aim to be comprehensive by modeling GHG emissions from \"cradle-to-grave\" for fossil fuels in the power sector. This includes emissions from site preparation, extraction, processing, transport, combustion, and electricity transmission. LCAs help evaluate emissions intensity in fuel supply chains and compare different fuels or production methods. This report focuses on natural gas as a fuel for power generation. This report focuses on natural gas as a fuel for the electric power generating sector, assessing GHG emissions from burning fossil fuels, analyzing emissions in power plants, and considering the entire supply chain's LCA. The report examines the uncertainty in assessing fugitive emissions of natural gas and the time period for estimating impacts. It concludes with a summary of findings and policy discussions on GHG emissions from fossil fuel combustion, particularly CO2 emissions. Natural gas combustion has lower CO2 emissions intensity compared to other fossil fuels due to its methane content. Methane has a low carbon content relative to the energy it can release. Oil, on the other hand, is composed of longer hydrocarbon molecules. The combustion of fossil fuels, such as natural gas, oil, and coal, releases CO2 emissions during oxidation. Natural gas has lower CO2 emissions compared to coal due to its methane content. The efficiency of equipment using fossil fuels plays a role in CO2 emissions. This report focuses on electricity generating units (EGUs) like power plants. The combustion of fossil fuels in power plants accounts for 67% of U.S. electricity generation and 31% of U.S. GHG emissions. CO2 emissions rates at power plants are determined by their heat rate, which reflects their thermal efficiency. Higher heat rates indicate lower efficiency and more energy consumption for electricity production. The text discusses the thermal efficiency and CO2 emissions of different types of power plants in the United States. Data from existing power plants and advanced configurations show varying heat rates and emissions intensities. Natural gas-fired plants produced significantly less CO2 emissions compared to coal-fired steam generators in 2013. The text discusses the CO2 emissions of different types of power plants in the United States. Natural gas combined cycle plants emit less CO2 compared to single-cycle coal-fired generators. The existing U.S. fleet consists of various generator types, with new plants expected to use advanced technology. The CO2 emissions intensities from fossil fuel combustion at power plants are summarized in Figure 4. Other sources of GHG emissions in electricity generation include extraction, processing, and transport of fossil fuels, as well as transmission of electricity. Additional GHG emissions may include CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and sulfur hexafluoride. Analyses aim to quantify GHG emissions across the entire supply chain of fossil fuels. The following section discusses GHG emissions estimates for natural gas and coal production and transport as reported by DOE/NETL. The U.S. natural gas production and transport sector contributes to GHG emissions through leaking, venting, and combustion during industry operations. Emissions sources include construction, drilling, processing, and transmission equipment. The U.S. natural gas production and transport sector emits GHGs such as CO2 and methane from equipment like valves, compressors, and storage vessels. Methane is released during industry operations, primarily from the combustion of natural gas for process heat and electricity. Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is emitted during industry operations either intentionally through vents or unintentionally through leaks. These emissions result from various processes in natural gas systems and can vary depending on the resource basin. The GHG emissions estimates for natural gas production and transport vary by resource basin. The report compares the emissions of natural gas and coal, highlighting the CO2 emissions intensity of coal combustion. Analysis of GHG emissions from coal extraction and transport is essential for a meaningful comparison. The DOE/NETL reports emissions estimates for coal production and transport, including activities like land use changes, operation of mining equipment, and diesel-powered trains. Different coal basins have varying methane content levels. The DOE/NETL-2014 study reports methane emissions from coal production and transport activities, with varying levels of methane content in different coal basins. Extracted methane is often sold into the natural gas market, reducing overall methane emissions. Life-cycle GHG emissions estimates for selected power plants in the US include emissions from fuel combustion, extraction, processing, transport, and electricity transmission. Figure 6 illustrates these emissions. The figure shows that production and transport emissions contribute to 5% of total life-cycle emissions for coal-fired power generation and 15% for natural-gas-fired power generation. In 2013, one MWh of electricity from a natural-gas-fired combined cycle power plant produced 47% of the life-cycle GHG emissions of a coal-fired steam generator. The most efficient gas turbine power plant in 2013 produced 70% of the life-cycle GHG emissions of a coal-fired steam generator. Advanced combined cycle natural-gas-fired power plants would produce approximately 56% of the life-cycle GHG emissions of coal-fired power plants. A switch from coal to natural gas in U.S. power plants can reduce GHG emissions by 50%. Methane emissions play a significant role in the climate impact of fossil fuel use in the power sector. Methane is 25 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas. Fugitive emissions from fossil fuel infrastructure are a major source of methane release, making it challenging to track and quantify. This impacts the accuracy of GHG emissions estimates for power generation. The DOE/NETL estimate in Figure 7 shows methane losses during natural gas production and transport for the power sector. The study calculates rates for fugitive methane release and flaring/use in relation to gas production. In 2010, the FER was 1.15% and flaring/use rate was 6.98%, with data sensitive to various factors like gas transmission and extraction processes. The DOE/NETL study calculates methane emissions during natural gas extraction processes based on EPA data. EPA's Inventory uses formulas and equipment counts to estimate emissions annually. Table 5 displays initial emissions estimates from the Inventory. The table in the EPA's Inventory shows the evolution of measurement methodology and changes in annual emissions from the natural gas industry. Various studies have published differing estimates for methane releases by natural gas systems, with a harmonization conducted by researchers at DOE's Joint Institute for Strategic Energy Analysis and National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The harmonized FER estimates for natural gas resources in the electrical power generating sector range from 0.53% to 6.20%, with a mean value of 2.78%. This range is consistent with estimates from other studies and is used as a representative estimate in the report. The report uses DOE/NETL and DOE/JISEA harmonized estimates to show the impact of fugitive methane emissions on life-cycle GHG emissions from existing coal-fired and natural-gas-fired power plants. FER values in the natural gas sector significantly affect overall emissions estimates, with higher FER leading to increased emissions compared to coal-fired plants. The impact of fugitive methane emissions on life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas and coal-fired power plants is significant. Estimates suggest that natural gas could produce 50%-58% of the life-cycle GHG emissions of coal if the FER is in the range of 2%-4%. Methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2 initially, but it degrades faster in the atmosphere. Global Warming Potential (GWP) is used to measure methane's impacts against CO2. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) measures the energy absorbed by gases compared to CO2 over time. Methane emissions are 25 times more potent than CO2 over 100 years, with a GWP of 72 over 20 years. This is crucial for evaluating methane emissions in the next few decades to limit temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius. The report presents emissions estimates for both 100-year and 20-year scenarios to assess the cost-benefit analysis of climate policy choices. Figure 10 shows the impact of different values for FER in natural gas production on life-cycle emissions estimates for natural gas power generation over the first 20 years. If the FER is around 1.15%, one MWh of electricity from a US natural gas power plant in 2013 would produce about 51% of emissions. The life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of a U.S. natural gas power plant in 2013 would be around 51% of a coal-fired steam generator. Natural gas could produce 60%-80% of coal's emissions if the FER is in the range of 2%-4%. Time frames significantly impact life-cycle GHG emissions assessments, with methane's impacts shown at 20-year and 100-year marks. EPA revises GWP values for methane based on ongoing research. EPA revises GWP values for methane based on ongoing research. The AR5 lists methane's GWP as 34 and 86 over a 100-year and a 20-year time horizon, respectively. These values are currently employed by much of the academic literature. The life-cycle GHG emissions estimates for existing coal-fired and natural-gas-fired power plants under different fugitive emissions rate scenarios for natural gas systems are compared. Natural gas could produce 63%-87% of the life-cycle GHG emissions of coal over a 20-year time frame if the FER is in the range of 2%-4%. Natural gas-fired power generation can have 48% of the emissions of coal-fired power generation and 87% of the emissions of coal-fired power generation over a 20-year time frame. Assumptions regarding power plant efficiency, FERs, and GWPs significantly impact life-cycle GHG emissions comparisons among different fossil-fuel-fired power plants. Figure 13 illustrates that natural gas produces approximately 50% of the life-cycle GHG emissions of coal when generating one MWh of electricity in an average U.S. natural-gas-fired power plant in 2013. The analysis in Figure 13 compares the life-cycle GHG emissions of natural gas-fired and coal-fired power generation, showing that natural gas emits around 50% of the emissions of coal. This information is relevant for policy discussions on fuel-switching strategies in the U.S. power generation sector. The life-cycle GHG emissions of new, advanced power plant models were compared in Figure 14, showing that advanced natural-gas-fired plants emit 35-45% less emissions than coal-fired plants in the short and long term. If the FER is 2%-4%, natural gas emissions could be comparable to or even greater than coal initially. The analysis in Figure 14 compares life-cycle GHG emissions of new advanced power plant models, showing natural gas emits 35-45% less than coal. However, natural gas emissions could initially be comparable to or greater than coal if the FER is 2%-4%. The net climate impact of replacing fossil fuels with natural gas depends on various factors. The analysis compares life-cycle GHG emissions of new advanced power plant models, showing natural gas emits 35-45% less than coal. The accuracy of data is uncertain but significant in determining the emissions intensity. Natural gas combustion emits approximately 56% less CO2 than coal per unit of energy. Life-cycle assessments (LCAs) analyze emissions from extraction to end use, including methane emissions. Estimates for fugitive emissions range from 1% to 4% in natural gas systems. Gas systems have uncertain estimates for fugitive emissions rates (FERs) ranging from 2%-4%. Methane's climate impacts are more pronounced in the short term. A natural-gas-fired combined cycle power plant emits 50% less life-cycle GHG emissions compared to a coal-fired steam generator, with a FER of around 1% in natural gas systems. However, other natural gas technologies may have reduced emissions benefits. Higher fugitive emissions rates could make the life-cycle GHG emissions of natural gas comparable to coal. The life-cycle GHG emissions of existing natural-gas-fired technology could be comparable to coal-fired power generation initially and could remain within range of the coal plant's emissions over the first 20 years. Choices in power generation impact fuel emissions. LCA is a crucial decision-support tool for this purpose. LCA is an important decision-support tool for identifying effective improvement strategies and avoiding burden shifting. The choice of fuel resources, extraction processes, transport options, and power plant technologies for coal and natural gas results in significant differences in life-cycle GHG emissions estimates. Methane lost during fossil fuel production and transport greatly impacts GHG emissions for power generation. Effective policy considerations require specificity and detail to understand the climate implications of switching from coal to natural gas in the power sector. To fully realize climate benefits from switching to natural gas in the power sector, improvements in emissions inventories are needed. A FER of approximately 1% from natural gas systems is required, along with cost-effective technologies to mitigate fugitive emissions. EPA's finalized standards for the oil and natural gas sector aim to reduce emissions, emphasizing the need for targeted emissions rates to be achieved and maintained. Methane's unique characteristics as a GHG must be considered for effective policy strategies. The report compares life-cycle GHG emissions between coal and natural gas in the domestic power sector, considering short-term and long-term climate implications. It highlights the need for targeted emissions rates and effective policy strategies due to methane's unique characteristics as a potent GHG. Other fuel-switching scenarios require separate assessments and analytic inputs. The report compares life-cycle GHG emissions between coal and natural gas in the domestic power sector, focusing on methane's impact as a potent GHG. Different fuel-switching scenarios would need separate assessments and analytic inputs. Effective policy considerations require data and analysis with appropriate LCAs. A full assessment of the costs and benefits of fuel-switching strategies is necessary for national security, human health, safety, and environmental impacts. Integrated analysis across all issues is essential."
