    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. Congress finds that Eagle and Pitkin Counties in Colorado are offering to convey approximately 1,307 acres of patented mining claim properties to the United States within or adjacent to the White River National Forest. This includes 669 acres within wilderness areas, which would facilitate better management of the forest and its resources. The Mt. Sopris Tree Nursery lands in Eagle County, comprising approximately 217 acres, are available for exchange with the Counties for public purposes. The Act aims to facilitate an exchange where the Counties transfer National Forest inholdings to the United States in exchange for portions of the nursery lands, expedite resolution of private title claims, and address limitations after a certain period. The Act aims to quiet title in National Forest inholdings in the United States after the period of limitations has run for adjudication of private title claims, subject to valid existing rights. SEC. 2. OFFER OF EXCHANGE. The exchange directed by this Act shall be consummated if within ninety days after enactment, the Counties offer to transfer approximately 1,258 acres of Pitkin County lands and 49 acres of Eagle County lands to the United States. The Act directs the exchange of land between Eagle County and the White River National Forest in Colorado. Eagle County will transfer 49 acres to the Forest Service, and in return, the Forest Service will convey approximately 132 acres back to the county. The exchange involves Eagle County transferring 49 acres to the White River National Forest in Colorado, and in return, the Forest Service will convey approximately 132 acres of land and water rights, depicted as tract A on a map dated October 5, 1990.

The Secretary reserves land, water rights, and easements for public purposes in conveyance to the Counties. Appraisals of exchanged lands must be completed within 120 days, using nationally recognized standards. The Secretary will determine if the values of the lands to be exchanged are equal, with any cash equalization owed waived if values are not equal. The Counties must satisfy any amount owed to the United States through conveyance of additional lands within five years of transferring nursery lands. The additional lands must be approved by the Secretary and have a value equal to the amount owed plus interest. The Secretary may convey any or all of the lands. The Secretary may convey nursery lands reserved under subsection (a) for fair market value, with Counties having the right of first refusal to acquire the lands at fair market value as tenants in common. The Counties must offer to acquire the properties within sixty days of receiving written notice from the Secretary. The Secretary has discretion to accept or reject the Counties' offer. The National Forest inholdings acquired by the United States will become part of the White River National Forest or other designated national forests for management by the Secretary. Inholdings within certain wilderness areas will be incorporated into those areas and managed according to the Wilderness Act. SEC. 5. RESOLVING TITLE DISPUTES TO NATIONAL FOREST INHOLDINGS. The Quiet Title Act, specifically section 2409a of title 28, United States Code, is the sole legal remedy for any party claiming rights to National Forest inholdings conveyed by Counties to the United States. Upon conveyance, the Secretary must publish a listing of acquired inholdings in Pitkin and Eagle Counties, Colorado, notifying parties to assert claims within a specified period through legal action against the United States. The Quiet Title Act, under section 2409a of title 28, sets a limitation for civil actions to quiet title to National Forest inholdings conveyed to the United States. Any such action must be filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado within six years of the publication of the listing required by the Act. Rights to National Forest inholdings not vested by quitclaim deed shall vest in the United States, subject to any easements or rights of record. Rights to National Forest inholdings not vested by quitclaim deed shall vest in the United States on the date that is six years after the publication of the listing required by the Act, except in cases where title is adjudicated to be in a party other than the United States or the Counties, or is the subject of pending legal action to vest title in another party. The court may require a party who fails to prevail in an action against the United States regarding National Forest inholdings to pay costs and attorney's fees. Counties must reimburse the United States for 50% of costs exceeding $240,000 related to defending claims against the National Forest inholdings.
