    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Gallatin Land Consolidation Act of 1998\" and includes findings. The \"Gallatin Land Consolidation Act of 1998\" finds that the land north of Yellowstone National Park has valuable natural characteristics and wildlife habitats. It is in the interest of the United States to acquire land owned by Big Sky Lumber Co. and establish a logical ownership pattern for the Gallatin National Forest to reduce costs and enable public access for recreational uses. The Act defines key terms related to the acquisition of approximately 55,000 acres of land owned by Big Sky Lumber Co. for the Gallatin Range Consolidation and Protection Act of 1993. Key terms include BSL, BSL land, Exchange Agreement, and Option Agreement. SEC. 4. GALLATIN LAND CONSOLIDATION COMPLETION. The Secretary of Agriculture will convey fee title to up to approximately 25,000 acres of National Forest System land to BSL, grant timber harvest rights to up to approximately 50,000,000 board feet of timber, and accept a warranty deed to the BSL land. The Secretary of Agriculture will purchase land from BSL in the Taylor Fork area for $6,500,000 and the Secretary of the Interior will convey fee title to approximately 1,860 acres of Bureau of Land Management land to BSL. The property and assets exchanged will be of equal value as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture. Timber harvest rights will also be granted by the Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary of Agriculture will grant timber harvest rights to BSL over a 5-year period as part of the Option Agreement. The timber harvest volume will constitute the timber sale program for the Gallatin National Forest during this period. In case of exceptional circumstances, the Secretary will replace any diminished harvest rights. The Secretary of Agriculture will replace diminished harvest rights by substituting equivalent timber harvest rights, conveying national forest lands with merchantable timber, or making a payment from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Procedures for identifying timber will apply to all national forest timber harvest rights for exchange. The Secretary of Agriculture and BSL will develop harvest schedules for national forest timber exchange. Timber harvest rights granted to BSL will be sold through competitive bidding. BSL must comply with Forest Service small business program procedures. The Service small business program procedures, including payment schedules, harvest schedules, and bonds, are binding on BSL and its associates. Timber harvest rights granted in the exchange must comply with Option and Exchange Agreements. The Secretary of Agriculture will offer an Exchange Agreement for national forest timber exchange. The Secretary of Agriculture will offer an Exchange Agreement with BSL for the exchange of non-Federal and Federal land, including terms for timber harvest rights. The Agreement must be consistent with the Option Agreement and submitted to Congress upon completion. The Exchange Agreement between the Secretary of Agriculture and BSL involves the conveyance of easements and rights-of-way over National Forest System land, with delayed effectiveness until 30 days after submission to Congress. BSL will convey easements or rights-of-way over its land to the United States as agreed in the Exchange Agreement. The Secretary of Agriculture will review the title for BSL land within 60 days to ensure it meets federal land acquisition standards. The Secretary of Agriculture will review the title commitment to verify compliance with applicable standards. The title must include surface and subsurface estates without reservation, covering minerals, timber, water rights, and any other interests in the property. The Secretary of Agriculture will review the title commitment to ensure compliance with standards, including surface and subsurface estates, minerals, timber, water rights, and other property interests. If the title quality is inadequate, corrective actions will be advised for an affirmative determination. The Exchange Agreement must be completed within 60 days of the Act's enactment, and land conveyance must occur within 60 days of a positive title determination. The Secretary of Agriculture must complete the purchase of BSL land within 60 days of appropriated funds availability and a positive title determination. SEC. 5. GENERAL PROVISIONS. The Option Agreement and Exchange Agreement will undergo minor corrections as agreed by the Secretary of Agriculture and BSL. The Secretary of Agriculture will notify relevant committees and members of any changes. The agreements will be filed with county clerks in Montana and available for public inspection. The land conveyed under this Act will be added to the Gallatin National Forest and Deerlodge National Forest. The Secretary of Agriculture will ensure sufficient funds for the Gallatin National Forest to implement the Act."
