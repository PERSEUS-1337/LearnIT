    "content": "On February 11, 2013, NASA launched Landsat 8, a remote sensing satellite used for various applications such as land use planning, agriculture, forestry, and natural disaster management. Landsat satellites are operated jointly by the U.S. Geological Survey and NASA, with NASA developing the satellite and instruments, and USGS managing data distribution. All Landsat data in USGS archives are freely available for download. Landsat satellites have been collecting imagery of the Earth's surface for over 40 years at moderate resolution. Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 are currently in orbit, providing images for users. Landsat 5, launched in 1984, stopped acquiring data in 2011 due to electronic component issues. Landsat 8, initially known as Landsat Data Continuity Mission, was launched in February 2013 to fill the data gap. Data from Landsat 8 became available on May 30, 2013. Landsat 8, launched in 2013, replaced Landsat 7 and data became available on May 30, 2013. Users of Landsat imagery come from academia, private business, government sectors, and more. Majority use the imagery to answer questions, make decisions, and develop algorithms. The launch of Landsat 8 raises the question of whether there should be a Landsat 9. The debate in Congress is whether to support the development of Landsat 9, a moderate resolution land-imaging satellite. Alternatives to a fully federally supported system include commercialization, privatization, and partnerships with other satellite systems. The value and use of Landsat are key factors in the ongoing discussion, as outlined in the 2014 White House National Plan for Civil Earth Observations and a NASA/USGS Sustainable Land Imaging Architecture Study Team project. The ongoing NASA/USGS Sustainable Land Imaging Architecture Study Team project explores congressional views on a future U.S. land imaging program. Proponents highlight Landsat 8's 30-meter resolution as valuable for characterizing human-scale processes like urban growth and deforestation. They also emphasize the consistent collection of imagery from Landsat satellites since 1972, allowing for documentation of land changes despite technological advancements. Some argue that the current policy of providing Landsat imagery at no cost is a significant program value. The history of commercializing Landsat, including previous attempts and the current no-cost policy, could influence future discussions on the program's commercialization. Efforts to privatize Landsat have been ongoing since the early days of satellite launches, with Congress last debating a commercialization option over 20 years ago. This context may inform congressional debates on Landsat's future. The privatization of satellite systems, including Landsat, was discussed during the Carter and Reagan Administrations. Landsat was transitioned from a research system under NASA to an operational system under NOAA to expand its user base. The Reagan Administration proposed a more rapid privatization of operational satellite systems in 1983. The Reagan Administration proposed privatizing weather satellite systems, but faced opposition from Congress and stakeholders. Congress prohibited the sale of NOAA weather satellites in the FY1984 appropriations act. The House Science and Technology Committee emphasized maintaining global leadership in land remote sensing (Landsat) and transferring this capability to the private sector. The Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992 transferred Landsat program management from Commerce to NASA and the Department of the Interior, resolving issues of privatization and funding. Different views on whether the program served public or private interests influenced the outcome. Factors such as the importance of Landsat data in military operations and the presence of similar satellites from other countries shaped the privatization effort. The French SPOT satellite posed challenges to the U.S. stake in remote sensing data. Growing interest in global climate change led to the value of time-series data from a consistent space platform. Congress accepted Landsat as a public good due to difficulties in commercializing the system and high costs of Landsat images. The Landsat Data Distribution Policy established that unenhanced Landsat data should be available at the cost of fulfilling user requests. USGS policy now allows for free downloading of all Landsat imagery and data. Efforts to privatize Landsat in the 1980s and early 1990s are detailed in the Appendix. Other types of remote sensing data are available from satellites with different spatial resolutions and coverage frequencies. The National Plan for Civil Earth Observations provides strategic guidance for a balanced portfolio of Earth observations and observing systems, including Landsat imagery. Marketability issues aside, different types of remote sensing data are available with varying resolutions and coverage frequencies. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 tasked the OSTP with coordinating civilian Earth observations and updating a strategic implementation plan every three years. The National Plan supported maintaining a space-based land-imaging program to continue 42 years of multispectral and 36 years of thermal-infrared land-surface data. This likely referred to the Landsat observational record. The National Plan prioritized sustained Earth observations, emphasizing continuity for public services and research. NASA and the Secretary of the Interior were directed to implement a 25-year program for sustained land imaging, monitoring land-cover characteristics, land-cover change, and water resources. The National Plan prioritized sustained Earth observations, emphasizing continuity for public services and research. It directed NASA and the Secretary of the Interior to implement a 25-year program for monitoring land-cover change, water resources, and other uses. NASA would handle satellite development and launch, while USGS would manage user requirements, ground systems, operational control, and data processing. The National Plan valued Landsat-type observations highly and called for the continuation of similar space-based observations. The Earth-Observation Assessment (EOA) ranked Landsat as the third-highest observing system out of 145, behind GPS and NEXRAD. The National Plan emphasized the need for a 25-year program of sustained land imaging, including radar, LIDAR, and gravity measurements to supplement Landsat's optical imagery for monitoring changes in various environmental factors. The Administration is considering a future land imaging program that may differ from the current Landsat model. NASA and USGS are developing a post Landsat-8 strategy through the Sustainable Land Imaging Architecture Study Team (AST), focusing on data record continuity and sustainability without requiring additional funds. NASA is focusing on developing sustainable land imaging data sets that can operate long-term within budget constraints. Reliability is emphasized, with the program expected to continue functioning even in the event of satellite or instrument failures. Discussions have considered using data from other nations' satellites to fill potential coverage gaps. The Landsat orbiters and their ground-based receivers provide unique global coverage that cannot be replicated by foreign satellites. While foreign moderate resolution satellites could offer a partial solution to limit data losses, a 2005 study found that no international program could fully replace Landsat's capabilities. The study suggested capturing data from comparable systems to mitigate potential gaps. NASA, in partnership with other countries, is exploring options to address data continuity challenges. In the current Landsat partnership, NASA develops the satellite and instruments, launches the spacecraft, and checks its performance. USGS takes over satellite operations, manages and distributes the data. USGS proposes increased funding for Landsat-related activities in its FY2015 budget justification, focusing on land remote sensing and change science. The budget request aims to create Landsat-based products for natural resource management and develop essential climate variables and climate data records. The USGS proposes increased funding for Landsat-related activities in its FY2015 budget justification, focusing on developing essential climate variables and climate data records. The agency describes its participation in the NASA/USGS Sustainable Land Imaging Architecture Study Team, examining long-term operational alternatives to ensure sustained land imaging for 20 years. NASA would develop Landsat-compatible land-imaging capabilities, while USGS would fund ground system development, data processing, and distribution. The USGS proposes increased funding for Landsat-related activities in its FY2015 budget justification, focusing on developing essential climate variables and data records. The AST will consider new instruments, satellites, and international partnerships. The House Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 5171, supporting requested increases for USGS Landsat science products for climate and natural resources assessments. NASA states that Landsat is the only satellite system designed to observe the global land surface repeatedly at moderate resolution, with data available at no cost for agriculture, geology, and forestry. NASA and USGS are working on a successor to Landsat 8, with NASA proposing $64.1 million for Land Imaging in FY2015. Landsat data is available for free to various sectors including agriculture, geology, forestry, and global climate change research. NASA is already committing funding for a satellite system to succeed Landsat 8, with plans to define the scope, cost, and risk of a viable long-term land imaging system. The successor to Landsat 8 poses challenges in maintaining observational continuity while keeping costs low. NASA is exploring options like hosted payloads and international partnerships to achieve this goal, despite skepticism from Congress. Senate appropriators are critical of the Administration's approach to continuing a Landsat-type Earth observing system, emphasizing concerns over potential data gaps if Landsat 7 fails before a successor satellite is launched. They do not support alternative approaches dependent on commercial or independent partners. The committee recommended NASA to launch a follow-on to Landsat 8 by 2020 with costs below $650 million. Senate appropriators allocated $68.1 million for Landsat Data Continuity in FY2015, above the President's request. They emphasized the need for NASA to present a budget reflecting resources for a 2020 launch. In a report, appropriators expressed skepticism towards a hosted payload or international partner concept for Landsat 9, citing past distractions and delays. They criticized NASA for unrealistic cost expectations and capped spending at $650 million for Landsat 9. Senate appropriators recommended $30 million for Land Imaging activities in FY2014, matching the Administration's request. House appropriators objected to NASA's budget request for new projects in their FY2014 report. The report objected to NASA's budget request for projects supporting other agencies, stating they would have undefined costs and crowd out NASA's own priorities. Appropriators expressed disappointment in the elimination of funding for upcoming climate satellite programs, including NASA's Landsat. The Senate provided $30 million for Land Imaging at NASA for the next Landsat-like mission after Landsat 8. House appropriators did not mention this funding. The House appropriators did not mention Landsat or Land Imaging spending in the FY2015 appropriations bill, unlike the Senate which provided $30 million for the next Landsat-like mission after Landsat 8. Earlier objections to funding satellites for other federal agencies were not raised in the FY2015 appropriations bill. In FY2013, Senate appropriators recommended transferring funding and responsibility for procuring NOAA's operational satellites to NASA due to concerns about NOAA's mismanagement of the satellite procurement process. This decision was different from the House's approach and was not based on a debate over agency missions. The Senate appropriators criticized NOAA for mismanaging satellite procurement and suggested NASA could handle it better. This highlights differing views between House and Senate appropriators on NASA's role in joint-agency satellite programs. Future debates may arise over the Landsat budget and the potential privatization or commercialization of satellite-based land imaging. Some members of Congress question if the multiagency Landsat program aligns with NASA's mission, emphasizing the need to control costs for a Landsat successor. Congress may pressure the Administration to move forward on this issue. Congress may pressure the Administration to move forward on the next land imaging mission to prevent a data gap if Landsat 7 or 8 fails before the next satellite is in orbit. The AST study will determine the impact of data loss and whether non-U.S. satellites can offset it. Congress will likely debate program requirements and funding for the next U.S. land-imaging satellite. In 1983, Congress did not oppose the Reagan Administration's efforts to privatize Landsat, which was initiated by the Carter Administration in 1979. The move aimed to transition Landsat from a research to an operational program and eventually to the private sector due to a shrinking customer base and rising data prices. In 1983, sales of Landsat data decreased when NOAA took over the program and raised prices. Despite signs of a weak commercial market, Congress supported privatization with the Land Remote Sensing Commercialization Act of 1984. This law set policy and financial requirements for the transfer to the private sector, allowing private space systems to be licensed. Landsat data had to be made available to all users without discrimination. Proponents feared the program would be canceled by the Reagan Administration. Proponents of privatizing Landsat were concerned about the program's future under the Reagan Administration, fearing cancellation and lack of investment in necessary hardware and software. They argued that privatization would ensure data continuity and eventually lead to lower prices. The debate over Landsat's future revolved around whether it primarily served public or private interests, providing data for scientific research, federal land management, and economic activities like oil and gas exploration. The federal government provided a $250 million subsidy to EOSAT for developing new Landsat spacecraft, but the Reagan Administration did not fulfill the funding obligation, leading to concerns about the program's future. The Reagan Administration did not fulfill the original funding obligation to EOSAT for Landsat development, leading to disputes with Congress. The contract was revised for only Landsat 6, despite the need for two satellites. The funding dispute sparked debates over the program's future and launch vehicle choices. Ultimately, the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992 transferred Landsat program management to NASA and DOI, ending the privatization debate. The Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992 transferred Landsat program management to NASA and DOI, ending the privatization debate that had lasted nearly a decade. NOAA's unclear mandate for collecting land surface remote sensing data may have eroded customer confidence in the Landsat system. The Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992 reversed privatization for Landsat, returning it to the federal government. It authorized the Secretary of Commerce to license private remote sensing space systems, allowing operators to use data as they wish. This provision is seen as crucial for fostering commercial remote sensing in the US. Technology advancements in downloading, storing, and distributing data have enabled commercial interests to add value to satellite data, leading to a surge in geospatial information systems (GIS) use."
