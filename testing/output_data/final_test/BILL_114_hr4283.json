    "content": "The \"Consumers Rebate to ban Emissions and Boost Alternative Energy Act\" or the \"Consumers REBATE Act\" imposes an excise tax on the carbon dioxide content of coal, oil, and natural gas according to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This includes sections on the imposition of tax, carbon equivalency fee, definitions, and special rules. A tax is imposed on producing or importing a taxable carbon substance in the United States. The tax rate is based on the carbon dioxide content of the substance, starting at $15 per ton in 2016 and increasing by $15 each year. The tax rate for producing or importing taxable carbon substances in the United States starts at $15 per ton in 2016 and increases annually. The target attainment year is when emissions are 50% of 2005 levels, determined by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Administrator of the EPA. The tax is imposed by subsection (a) and paid by the responsible party. The tax on producing or importing taxable carbon substances is paid by the producer, miner, or importer. The Secretary will issue regulations for permit issuance and payment collection. \"SEC. 9902. CARBON EQUIVALENCY FEE.\" The purpose of this section is to ensure the environmental effectiveness of the subtitle by imposing carbon equivalency fees on imports of goods containing or produced using a taxable carbon substance. The fees collected by the U.S. Customs and Border Control Commissioner will be equal to the costs incurred by domestic producers due to taxes and carbon equivalency fees. This section will expire when an international agreement on carbon emissions is in place. The section requires countries that emit carbon dioxide or use taxable carbon substances in goods to adopt equivalent measures, or if the exporting country has implemented equivalent measures as determined by the Secretary. SEC. 9903. DEFINITIONS. The term 'taxable carbon substance' includes coal, oil, and natural gas. Coal encompasses various types like lignite and anthracite. Oil includes crude oil, natural gasoline, and shale oil. Natural gas refers to unmixed natural gas or any mix of natural and artificial gas. 'Life-cycle emissions' represent total carbon dioxide emissions throughout a product's life cycle. The term 'emissions' refers to total carbon dioxide emissions from a taxable carbon substance, determined by the EPA Administrator. The term 'United States' includes states, territories, and the District of Columbia. \"Special rules under SEC. 9904 are outlined.\" No tax is imposed on the production or mining of taxable carbon substances intended for export. Rules similar to section 4221(b) apply for proof of export. A credit or refund is available if tax was paid on a taxable carbon substance that was exported or used as a manufacturing input. If a taxable carbon substance was used in manufacturing a substance exported and taxed, a credit or refund can be claimed by the taxpayer who paid the tax, provided they repay the tax amount to the exporter. The Secretary will provide regulations for allowing refunds directly to exporters who provide required information and have the consent of the exporter who paid the tax. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for quarterly payments to eligible individuals from Treasury funds deposited under the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 requires quarterly payments to eligible individuals from Treasury funds deposited. The total amounts deposited in the Treasury for each quarter are calculated based on the number of eligible individuals. In 2027 and subsequent years, the average of amounts deposited in the Treasury for the four quarters of the previous year is used to determine the payment amount. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 mandates quarterly payments to eligible individuals based on the total number of eligible individuals with valid social security numbers who are lawfully present in the United States. The term \"United States\" refers to the States and territories. The term \"United States\" includes the States, territories, possessions, and the District of Columbia. Amendments are made to the table of subtitles for the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Subtitle L. Carbon Dioxide Content of Coal, Oil, and Natural Gas. The amendments made by this section will be effective on January 1, 2017."
