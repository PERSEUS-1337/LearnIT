    "content": "More than 400,000 children are in foster care due to abuse or neglect. Some receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or other Social Security benefits. Around 9.5% of youth who aged out of foster care in FY2010 were receiving SSI or Survivors benefits. The Social Security Administration can appoint a government entity as the representative payee for foster children if their parents or guardians are unavailable. As the representative payee, the state manages the child's benefits for their current maintenance. States use SSI and other Social Security benefits to pay for foster care, totaling $156.6 million in state FY2006. Legal challenges have been raised regarding using foster children's benefits to reimburse states for foster care costs, with the U.S. Supreme Court upholding this practice in the case of Washington State Department of Social and Health Services v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler in 2003. The Keffeler decision in 2003 raised concerns about using Social Security benefits for foster care. The report discusses the foster care system, benefits for eligible children, representative payees, and the use of benefits to reimburse states. Advocates propose changes to the current practice. Foster care involves the formal responsibility for a child's care and placement by a court or state agency due to neglect, abuse, or behavioral issues. Children in foster care may be placed in various settings, and state child welfare agencies use federal and state funds to support them. The federal government has requirements for state provision of foster care for all children in care. The federal government has requirements for state provision of foster care for all children in care, including a written case plan detailing placement and services for a permanent home. Plans must be reviewed regularly, with options for reuniting with parents or finding adoptive parents. Title IV-E of the Social Security Act authorizes federal-state foster care programs for partial reimbursement of room and board costs. The Title IV-E foster care program seeks federal funds for reimbursement of room and board costs for eligible children in foster care. The program is funded from the general treasury and provides an open-ended entitlement basis for states to be reimbursed for eligible costs. Around half of the 400,000 children in foster care in the US are estimated to be eligible for federal support under Title IV-E, subject to specific eligibility criteria. The state child welfare agency must use federal Title IV-E funds to provide foster care maintenance payments for eligible children placed in licensed settings. These payments cover the cost of food, clothing, shelter, supervision, school supplies, and other incidentals. States have the flexibility to determine the amount of payment for each child. In FY2011, states made foster care maintenance payments for an average of 168,385 Title IV-E eligible children each month, costing about $2.406 billion. The federal government reimbursed states approximately $1.169 billion, covering about 60% of the total costs. The average monthly maintenance payment per eligible foster care recipient was around $1,427, with the federal government reimbursing states about $829. In FY2011, states spent $4.075 billion on Title IV-E foster care administrative costs, with the federal government reimbursing roughly $829, covering about 60% of the total costs. In FY2011, states spent $4.075 billion on Title IV-E foster care administrative costs, with the federal government reimbursing roughly $2.038 billion, covering half of these costs. States also claimed reimbursement for training costs related to foster care, totaling $269 million, with a federal share of about $201 million. Additionally, some states received $683 million in federal Title IV-E foster care funding under special waiver authority for broader child welfare purposes. A million children in foster care do not meet federal Title IV-E eligibility criteria, but states still provide payments for their care. States spent $4.075 billion on Title IV-E foster care administrative costs in FY2011, with the federal government reimbursing roughly half of these costs. Maintenance payments for foster children who are not Title IV-E eligible must be provided by the state or local government. States can use federal funding from the Title IV-B program to offset administrative costs, but most costs for non-eligible children are covered by state or local funds, as well as other federal funding sources like TANF, SSBG, and Medicaid. Despite efforts to find permanent homes for all foster children, many are not federally eligible. Some foster children \"age-out\" of foster care before finding a permanent home, with an estimated 26,286 children aging out in FY2011. States can now seek federal reimbursement for providing foster care to eligible youth until age 19, 20, or 21, based on state selection criteria such as completing high school, vocational education, employment, or participation in programs promoting employment. States can seek reimbursement for providing foster care to eligible youth until age 19, 20, or 21, based on criteria such as completing high school, vocational education, employment, or participation in programs promoting employment. Additionally, states must provide services to help foster youth transition to independent adulthood and receive funds for independent living services after leaving foster care. These funds cannot be used for services after the youth turns 21. The report discusses Social Security and SSI benefits available to children, including those in foster care, under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act. Social Security benefits are for children of retired, disabled, or deceased workers, while SSI benefits are available for certain individuals. SSI benefits under Title XVI of the Social Security Act are available for children with disabilities from low-income families. Most states supplement the monthly SSI benefit with state funds. Children may also be eligible for Social Security benefits if they are the biological, adopted, or dependent stepchild of a person eligible for certain benefits. Children may qualify for Social Security benefits if their parent meets specific conditions such as being retired, disabled, or deceased. These benefits are meant to replace lost household income and can amount to up to 50% of a living parent's retirement or disability benefit, or 75% of a deceased parent's benefit. Family maximum rules apply, capping the total benefits available to a family. Children may receive Social Security benefits until the age of 18, or 19 if still in high school. Benefits can continue into adulthood if the child has a disability that started before age 22. Benefits end upon marriage. Blind or severely disabled children may qualify for SSI benefits regardless of parents' work history. Eligibility requires meeting blindness or disability criteria and falling below income and resource limits. Children may qualify for SSI benefits if they have central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in their better eye with a correcting lens. To be considered disabled for SSI eligibility, a child must have a physical or mental impairment causing marked and severe functional limitations, lasting at least 12 months or resulting in death, and earn less than the substantial gainful activity amount. Foster care payments under Title IV-E are not counted as earned income for disability determination. To determine SSI eligibility for disabled children, the Social Security Administration considers their total countable income and resources. SSI benefits aim to provide a minimum monthly income to disabled individuals and families with limited financial means. The SSA uses \"deeming\" to assign part of the parents' income and resources to the child. Children in foster care are not counted as having income for SSI eligibility. Children in foster care do not have their foster family's income deemed to them for SSI eligibility. However, IV-E payments are considered unearned income, reducing the child's SSI benefit dollar for dollar. SSI income limits vary by state, with a resource limit of $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples. Family resources are usually counted towards a child's SSI eligibility. The SSI resource rules allow for certain asset exclusions, such as a primary residence and automobile, to not count against the $2,000 or $3,000 resource limit. This makes it challenging for children receiving SSI benefits, including those in foster care, to save for adulthood or education without risking their eligibility. Children receiving SSI benefits, including foster children, cannot retain eligibility if they exceed $2,000 in savings. Back SSI benefits owed to a child must be placed in a dedicated account for specific purposes like medical care and education, but not for daily expenses. Once a child in the SSI program reaches age 18, their case is automatically reviewed by SSA to determine if they meet the SSI disability standard for adults. Redeterminations at age 18 are required by law, and 42% of SSI child recipients had their benefits cease due to an unfavorable redetermination. At age 18, parents' income and resources are no longer considered available to the child. Payments from SSA can be made directly to the beneficiary or to a representative payee. The Social Security Act allows payments to representative payees who must meet strict guidelines. Individuals cannot charge fees, but organizations can charge a small fee for administrative costs. Approximately 8.5 million beneficiaries receive payments through representative payees each month. Representative payees are more common in the SSI program, with 37.8% having one, compared to 10.2% in the Social Security program. Federal regulations assign payees for children in most cases. In most cases, the SSA assigns a representative payee for children receiving Social Security or SSI benefits. Exceptions include children nearing age 18, serving in the military, supporting themselves, or parents. Children under 18 receiving disability benefits based on their own work history and disability may receive benefits without a payee. The SSA selects the payee, following an order of selection, considering the beneficiary's best interests. The order of selection for children: 1) natural or adoptive parent with custody or legal guardian, 2) others if unavailable. A representative payee for children receiving Social Security or SSI benefits can be a parent with custody, a contributing parent without custody, a relative with custody, a contributing relative without custody, a close friend showing concern, or an authorized social services agency. Natural or adoptive parents act as representative payees in nearly 82% of cases. In SSI cases, parents act as payees in 82% of cases, while grandparents and relatives act in 14% of cases. Social service agencies act as payees in 1.4% of cases. The SSA's guidelines state that when an agency has custody of a child, they should not always be appointed as payee, and factors like how they got custody and if the child will return to a parent should be considered. The responsibilities of child welfare agencies as representative payees for child beneficiaries involve managing the beneficiaries' benefits according to the Social Security Act. SSA may assign a representative payee if it is in the beneficiary's best interest, and the payee must use the payment for the beneficiary's \"use and benefit.\" The payment to the representative payee must be used for the \"use and benefit\" of the beneficiary, including current maintenance costs for food, shelter, clothing, medical care, and personal comfort items. Creditors providing goods and services to the beneficiary are prohibited from serving as the beneficiary's representative payee. The regulations specify that a payee may not use benefit payments to satisfy a debt of the beneficiary if it arose before the payments were certified to the payee, unless the beneficiary's current and future needs are met. In December 2011, 1.3 million children in the US received SSI, requiring a physical or mental impairment with severe limitations to qualify. Children who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) must have a physical or mental impairment with severe limitations expected to last at least 12 months or result in death. Two-thirds of SSI recipients have a mental disorder, while the rest have serious physical impairments. Children in foster care have greater physical and mental health needs compared to the general population. Researchers estimate that over 20% of children in out-of-home care have conditions that could be life-threatening. Children in out-of-home care with physical or mental health conditions that could be life-threatening are likely eligible for SSI. Researchers found that 21% of children in out-of-home care for at least one year met this criteria. Over half of these children scored significantly lower in social skills, behavior, and health status assessments. The estimated SSI eligibility among children in out-of-home care is higher than the reported 6% of children in foster care receiving SSI. The study compared SSI eligibility among children in out-of-home care based on age, race, ethnicity, locality, and gender. Children aged 6-10 in rural settings had higher SSI eligibility rates. Age did not predict SSI eligibility for children in care for at least one year, but black children and boys were more likely to qualify. Most foster children meet income requirements for SSI. Some foster children eligible for SSI may not be receiving benefits due to lack of screening for eligibility. States have procedures in place to screen children, including written procedures, online tools, and social worker discretion. The Child Welfare Policy Manual provides official guidance on the Title IV-E foster care program. The Title IV-E foster care program allows children to receive both SSI benefits and foster care maintenance payments. However, the amount of the maintenance payment will reduce the SSI benefit dollar for dollar. If the maintenance payment exceeds the SSI benefit, the SSI benefits are suspended for that month. A child's SSI benefits are suspended when their Title IV-E foster care maintenance payment exceeds their federal SSI benefit plus any state supplement. If suspended, the recipient can start receiving payments again if their income is reduced. After 12 months of suspension, the person is removed from the SSI program and must reapply for benefits. Non-Title IV-E eligible children in foster care must be supported with state or local funds, which generally do not affect their SSI benefits. When a child's Title IV-E foster care maintenance payment exceeds their SSI benefit, the SSI benefits are suspended. The Child Welfare Policy Manual advises careful consideration of benefits under both programs to make an informed decision in the child's best interest. It is recommended to exchange information with local Social Security offices and refer clients for consultation or application when appropriate. Establishing SSI eligibility for a child in foster care can help parents meet the child's needs upon reunification. SSI recipients are automatically eligible for Medicaid, and foster youth are eligible for Medicaid until they age out of care. States must provide Medicaid to foster youth who age out of care until age 26 starting January 1, 2014. On January 1, 2014, states must provide Medicaid to foster youth who age out of care until age 26, regardless of income or assets. Title II benefits are not affected by foster care, as they are paid to children of retired, disabled, or deceased workers. SSI and Title IV-E foster care have income and resources eligibility criteria, making children receiving Title II benefits less likely to qualify for these programs. State child welfare agencies consider the benefits of each funding stream to meet the needs of youth. Most states use Social Security and/or SSI benefits of children in foster care as a source of federal funds for their programs, primarily for foster payments like food, shelter, and clothing. These funds are also used for medical, mental health, educational, and social needs, but to a lesser extent. The exact amount of child welfare funding derived from these benefits is uncertain. Among states that provided data to Child Trends, Social Security benefits (SSI and Title II) accounted for $156.6 million in funding for child welfare, representing roughly 61% of the FY2006 foster care caseload. If all states spent these funds at a similar rate, total use of Social Security benefits by state child welfare agencies would be around $258 million. This amount, while not insignificant, is a relatively small portion of the $25.7 billion total spending reported by child welfare agencies for SFY2006, with roughly half of these funds being federal dollars. In recent years, child welfare agencies have faced legal challenges regarding the use of foster children's Social Security benefits to cover the cost of foster care. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2003 that states could use these benefits to reimburse themselves for providing foster care. This practice has been a point of contention among child welfare advocates. The U.S. Supreme Court case involved Washington's appeal to overturn a ruling that their service as payee for foster children violated the Social Security Act. Washington State Supreme Court cited a creditor relationship and Ninth Circuit precedent. The Washington State Supreme Court discussed whether the state was acting in the best interest of foster children entitled to Social Security benefits, stating that using the benefits to reimburse the state may not always be in the beneficiary's best interest. The U.S. Supreme Court sided with Washington in the case involving their role as payee for foster children. The U.S. Supreme Court, in a unanimous opinion written by Souter, sided with the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, overturning the decision of the Washington Supreme Court. The Court held that the state could not be a foster child's creditor as they did not have an obligation to pay for foster care. The key question was whether the department's actions in becoming a representative payee for the children's Social Security benefits violated the \"anti-attachment clause,\" to which the Court ruled that it did not. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services could use Social Security benefits to reimburse the cost of foster care for children in their care. This decision was based on the regulatory requirement that funds be used for the beneficiary's benefit, including food, shelter, clothing, medical care, and personal comfort items. The Court rejected the argument that reimbursing the state for foster care costs was against the best interest of the foster child. The Court upheld the use of Social Security benefits to reimburse foster care costs, stating that SSA regulations align with the law's objectives of providing income for basic living expenses. The Commissioner's decision on representative payees prioritizing meeting basic needs was deemed in the beneficiary's best interest. The Keffeler decision affirmed states' right to act as representative payees for foster children receiving federal benefits, using those benefits to cover foster care costs. Some advocates are concerned that this practice may not always serve the children's best interests. Proponents argue that states lack a process to assess the individual needs of children in care, with some not keeping funds separate for these children. They believe using Social Security benefits solely for foster care costs makes children pay for their own care, unlike other children in care. Some advocates are concerned about child welfare agencies being assigned as payees for children in foster care, despite being the least preferred option. They argue that SSA should invest or save SSI and Social Security benefits for the child's future use, rather than using them for foster care costs. Youth aging out of foster care at 18 often struggle to find housing and income. Youth aging out of foster care at 18 face challenges in securing housing and income. SSI benefits could help ease their transition to adulthood by providing additional resources. Concerns exist about the $2,000 resource limit discouraging youth from accumulating assets. Some states hold excess funds in individual accounts for children exiting care. Some states hold excess funds in individual accounts for children exiting care, which are returned to SSA when the child exits care. State child welfare agencies argue that SSI and Title II funds are crucial for their tight budgets and are used to cover current maintenance costs. Child welfare advocates believe that states have used these funds in good faith, similar to a parent serving as a representative payee. State child welfare agencies and advocates argue that returning benefits to children that were already used to pay for their maintenance could cost states up to hundreds of millions of dollars. In Keffeler, the Supreme Court cited the Amici Curiae briefs filed by various organizations and states, claiming that without the ability to use Social Security and SSI benefits to reimburse the costs of foster care, states would be discouraged from serving as representative payees due to administrative costs. Child welfare advocates are concerned that if states cannot use SSI or Title II benefits to pay for foster care, they may stop screening children for eligibility. These screenings help determine a child's needs and secure extra benefits not normally available in foster care. Advocates argue that eligibility for these benefits may extend beyond foster care and provide crucial support for the child outside the system. Child welfare advocates argue that states should be able to use SSI and Title II benefits to offset the cost of therapeutic care for children leaving care due to adoption or reunification. They believe that without state assistance, many eligible children would not receive Social Security benefits. Additionally, advocates suggest that if child SSI beneficiaries received all their benefits while in foster care, they could accumulate savings and exceed the maximum SSI resource level. The Supreme Court upheld states' use of SSI and Social Security in 2003. The Supreme Court decision in 2003 allows states to use SSI and Social Security benefits for reimbursement of current maintenance for children in foster care. Policy changes could include screening children in foster care for benefits, passing through benefits to foster children, finding alternative payees, increasing asset limits for youth on SSI, and enabling youth in foster care to apply for benefits before aging out. States routinely screen children in care for SSI benefits, and policymakers could consider requiring automatic screening. Screening children in foster care for benefits can be beneficial as it allows state child welfare agencies to use funds for reimbursing foster care costs. Children may gain from screenings by receiving benefits even after leaving care, with automatic review for SSI eligibility at age 18. SSI recipients are also eligible for other federal benefits, including Medicaid. Bills in Congress aim to support foster children's self-support and prevent homelessness. The bills (S. 961, 112th Congress and H.R. 6192, 111th Congress) would require state child welfare agencies to screen all children in care for SSI benefits or other Social Security benefits and assist them in applying. Agencies must ensure screenings for children in care for six to eight months and after any material change in circumstances. They would also be responsible for appealing benefit decisions and becoming the representative payee if necessary. The bills would require state child welfare agencies to screen all children in care for SSI benefits or other Social Security benefits, potentially imposing a cost burden on states and the federal government. Eligibility determinations would be made by the federal Social Security Administration. The screenings may lead to more children applying for benefits, requiring additional staff for eligibility determinations. States acting as payees could pass through SSI and Title II benefits to foster children, with a proposed maximum amount of $2,000. California law requires consideration of reserving up to $2,000 to assist youth aging out of foster care. Counties serving as payees must establish interest-bearing maintenance accounts. The counties must establish procedures for dispensing money from an interest-bearing maintenance account to pay for expenses benefiting the child. Legislation aims to conserve benefits for foster children to achieve self-support after leaving care. Legislation proposes a plan to help foster children achieve self-support after leaving care by placing benefits in a designated account for specific purposes. The child, social worker, representative payee, and attorney/guardian ad litem would collaborate on developing and implementing the plan. The benefits would be reserved for expenses related to housing, education, transportation, employment, and health. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program allows for more Social Security and SSI benefits to be available to beneficiaries in foster care by assigning child support rights to the state. States may choose to pass through some of their share of child support payments collected on behalf of TANF families. States may choose to pass through some of their share of child support payments collected on behalf of TANF families, with 24 states currently providing this option. This federal initiative could allow children in foster care to receive part of the benefits instead of the states keeping them for foster care expenses, resulting in costs to the states. Child Support Enforcement, under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, collects payments from non-custodial parents for child support, with the requirement that states use the payments to reimburse the cost of providing foster care to children who receive the payments. The Obama Administration proposal would require states to pass child support payments collected on behalf of foster children to the eligible children. States must ensure that child support payments of foster children receiving Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments are assigned to the state. The payments are used to reimburse the state for foster care costs and also reimburse the federal government for its share of the foster care payment. The child support payments collected on behalf of foster children must be passed on to the state child welfare agency. Any excess funds are to be used for the child's best interests, including future needs or daily expenses. Any remaining amounts collected are to be distributed to the state for reimbursement of past foster care maintenance payments. Child Support Enforcement reported that in FY2009, $90.9 million in child support was collected for children in foster care receiving Title IV-E payments. State agencies collected $69 million in child support for these children, returning $39 million to the federal government as reimbursement. States are required to return a portion of child support collected for children in federal foster care. The Obama Administration seeks legislation to require states to use child support payments for children in foster care in their best interest, rather than as general revenue or to reimburse the federal government. This proposal would end federal \"cost recovery\" of Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments, increasing federal costs by $2 million in FY2013 and up to $34 million annually when fully implemented. The Obama Administration proposes legislative changes to ensure child support payments for children in foster care are used in their best interest, not for general revenue or federal reimbursement. This would increase federal costs by $2 million in FY2013 and up to $34 million annually when fully implemented. Legislation for this proposal has not been enacted yet. Some child advocates suggest clarifying the selection process for representative payees to prevent child welfare agencies from automatically being named as payees for foster care children. Improved notice is needed to assist SSA in naming a payee other than the state for children in foster care. Advocates recommend sending advance notice to individuals representing the child in judicial proceedings, including parents, foster care or relative caretakers, other parties in the proceedings, and the juvenile court judge. Attorneys or guardians ad litem can help identify better options for the child's interests, inform the court and child welfare agency about the child's needs, and educate the child about benefits and the redetermination process upon reaching adulthood. (H.R. 6192 in the 111th Congress and S. 961 in the 112th) Improved notice is recommended to assist SSA in selecting a payee for foster children. Suggestions include sending advance notice to individuals representing the child in judicial proceedings, such as attorneys or guardians ad litem. Alternative payees not on the SSA preference list could include volunteer programs and Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) volunteers. CASA volunteers advocate for abused and neglected children and can report the child's needs to the court regardless of placement changes. California law requires counties to apply to become the representative payee for foster children if no other suitable candidate is available. Proposed acts like S. 961 and H.R. 6192 would also mandate states to apply as payees if no other suitable candidate exists, with requirements for notifying interested parties like the child's attorney or guardian ad litem. Increasing the asset level for children receiving SSI could provide additional support for those aging out of foster care, as they often earn less than their peers. The current resource limit for individuals receiving SSI has been fixed at $2,000 since 1989 and is not adjusted for inflation. Auditing non-profit organizations serving as representative payees may strain SSA's administrative capacity. Former foster youth generally earned significantly less than their peers, receiving an average of $12,064 compared to $20,349 in 2008 dollars. Parents typically provide their children with around $38,000 between the ages of 18 and 34 for financial assistance, including college tuition and housing costs. However, foster care alumni are less likely to receive this level of support from their families, with only 35.5% receiving money from a family member in the past year. Foster care alumni have lower likelihood of living with parents or relatives compared to peers. Legislation aims to exempt assets accumulated by foster children from SSI eligibility determination. HHS guidance states that asset limit for Title IV-E foster care eligibility is only determined when a child enters care, no redetermination needed during stay. Initial and continuing eligibility for payments used to be based on AFDC qualification of original families. In 1999, Congress raised the resource limit for children eligible for Title IV-E services to $10,000, noting that children in foster care need more resources to prepare for independence. This is in contrast to the SSI program, where individuals are generally ineligible once they have $2,000 in countable resources. The SSI program has initiatives like PASS and IDAs for beneficiaries with assets above the limit. A PASS is an individual employment plan approved by the SSA that includes specific goals and resources not counted against SSI limits. Individuals can exclude resources in an approved PASS from SSI limits, including money for training or assistive technology. IDAs are matched savings accounts for low-income individuals to save for education, home purchase, or business creation, with funds not counted towards SSI limits. IDAs are savings accounts for low-income individuals to save for education, home purchase, or business creation. The money in an IDA, along with any interest earned, is not counted as a resource for determining SSI eligibility. There is no limit to the amount of money in an IDA that can be excluded from the SSI resource calculation, but there are limits to the amounts states and other entities can contribute to IDAs."
