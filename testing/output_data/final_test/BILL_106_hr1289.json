    "content": "The Act titled \"Tobacco Use Prevention and Public Health Act of 1999\" waives recoupment of Medicaid tobacco-related recoveries. The Social Security Act is amended to exempt states from certain provisions regarding tobacco settlement recoveries if they meet specific conditions, including spending a minimum percentage on tobacco control activities. The State must allocate at least 25 percent of recovered or paid amounts for health activities, excluding funds used to meet other requirements. These funds should supplement existing state or local government expenditures for similar activities, with a waiver possible for tobacco control activities. Expenditures for tobacco control activities must be sufficient to fund effective programs, including methods like cessation programs, counter-marketing, law enforcement, community-based programs, and education initiatives. Expenditures for tobacco control activities should fund research on nicotine addiction, cessation, and prevention, as well as economic development for tobacco farmers transitioning to a diversified economy. The State must contribute annually to the National Tobacco Use Prevention Program. State expenditures for outreach activities and medical assistance under this title are defined. A State's 'pro rata share' is calculated based on certain criteria. Amounts contributed under this provision are specified. Amounts contributed under subparagraph (C)(ii) will be deposited in the National Tobacco Use Prevention Account in the Treasury. These funds will be available for use under the Tobacco Use Prevention and Public Health Act of 1999. Any amounts recovered or paid to a State before, on, or after the enactment of this Act will be subject to the amendments made by this section. The National Tobacco Use Prevention Program is established under the Tobacco Use Prevention and Public Health Act of 1999. The National Tobacco Use Prevention Program, established under the Tobacco Use Prevention and Public Health Act of 1999, allocates funds for a national public awareness campaign and a program targeting tobacco use among minority groups. The Secretary will implement recommendations through the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Minority Health and an advisory committee. $5,000,000 annually from the National Tobacco Use Prevention Account will be provided to the Secretary of Agriculture for economic stabilization of tobacco farmers through regulations. The regulations require that from 2000 to 2004, tobacco purchases from US farmers must not fall below 1997 levels. Non-compliance can result in a penalty of up to $25,000 per day. The rules do not apply to purchases after January 1, 2005. If funds in the National Tobacco Use Prevention Account are insufficient, allocations will be adjusted proportionally. The regulations require tobacco purchases from US farmers to not fall below 1997 levels from 2000 to 2004, with penalties for non-compliance. Allocations from the National Tobacco Use Prevention Account will be adjusted proportionally if funds are insufficient. Amounts deposited for the fiscal year must total equally in a pro-rata manner."
