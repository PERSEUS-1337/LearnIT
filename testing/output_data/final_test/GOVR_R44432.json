    "content": "Authorization for siting of pipeline facilities involves approval of the route and location, overseen by FERC for natural gas pipelines and state-by-state for crude oil pipelines. Differences in regulatory treatment are attributed to transportation methods, regulatory backgrounds, and concerns over monopoly power. The section addresses federal and state laws for construction and operation of oil or gas pipelines, requiring specific approval from the federal government. Under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, FERC issues certificates for interstate natural gas pipelines after a hearing and determination of compliance with regulations. Under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, FERC issues certificates for interstate natural gas pipelines after a hearing and determination of compliance with regulations. FERC's siting jurisdiction does not extend to intrastate pipelines or local distribution facilities. States may have specific siting requirements for pipelines not under FERC's jurisdiction. Congress's enactment of the NGA shows intent to regulate interstate transportation and sale of natural gas, excluding state and local regulation for entities with FERC approval. Under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, FERC issues certificates for interstate natural gas pipelines, exempting holders from most state and local laws. However, FERC can impose compliance with such laws as a condition. State laws affecting pipeline siting may not be preempted unless they conflict with FERC's jurisdiction. The NGA also preserves states' rights under federal laws like the CZMA, CAA, and CWA. Federal laws and regulations provide avenues for states to provide input into FERC's siting review of interstate natural gas pipelines. States can participate as intervenors during certificate application proceedings and seek rehearing within 30 days of FERC issuing a certificate. Judicial review of FERC's orders can be sought in federal court of appeals. The NGA, amended by the EPAct, outlines procedures for judicial review of actions by FERC and other agencies under federal law. The NGA does not preempt state \"rights\" under federal laws like the CZMA, CAA, and CWA, allowing states to retain regulatory authority over pipeline projects. Federal courts of appeals have jurisdiction over civil suits regarding federal or state actions related to pipeline issuance. The NGA does not preempt state \"rights\" under federal laws like the CZMA, CAA, and CWA, allowing states to retain regulatory authority over pipeline projects. Federal courts of appeals have jurisdiction over civil suits seeking judicial review of federal or state actions concerning permits for FERC-certificated facilities. If actions are found inconsistent with federal law, the court can remand the proceeding for further action by the relevant agency. EPA has oversight authority over state administration of CAA and CWA. The Energy Policy Act (EPAct) designated FERC as the lead agency for coordinating NEPA reviews and required federal approvals for interstate natural gas pipeline certificate applications. FERC established a 90-day timeline for federal and state agencies to issue permits or approvals needed under federal law after FERC issues its final environmental document. Under the Natural Gas Act (NGA), federal and state agencies must issue permits within 90 days of FERC's final environmental document. Critics argue that the judicial remedy for delays is ineffective. The NGA grants eminent domain power to certificate holders to acquire property for pipeline construction if negotiations fail. Gathering lines transport oil or gas from wells to processing facilities. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has raised concerns about the safety of shale gas gathering lines due to their larger diameter and higher pressure. FERC does not have jurisdiction over facilities or pipelines used for gathering natural gas, but has a test to determine nonjurisdictional gathering lines. In a 2010 case, FERC ruled it lacked jurisdiction over a gathering line. FERC determined it lacked jurisdiction over a pipeline gathering gas from fracked Marcellus Shale wells, despite high pressure and crossing state lines. State siting approval varies, with additional federal or state authorizations needed for construction and operation under applicable laws for land management, environmental protection, and conservation. No specific federal approval process exists for siting crude oil pipelines within the US borders. State or local laws may dictate requirements, such as seeking approval for the pipeline route or obtaining eminent domain authorization. Additional federal and state authorizations may be necessary for construction and operation, including permits for water withdrawals and environmental impacts. Construction or operation of pipelines may require permits for water withdrawals, impacts on state-protected species, and crossings of public lands. Federal authorizations or consultations with agencies are also necessary depending on the pipeline route and its environmental effects. Lack of a centralized federal approval process for siting crude oil pipelines, especially interstate ones, can pose challenges for companies facing opposition from local landowners and the public. Federal law does not preempt state and local siting requirements, making it harder for pipeline companies to obtain necessary authorizations. The construction of pipelines may require various permits and consultations with agencies for water withdrawals, impacts on protected species, and crossings of public lands. Federal approval for siting interstate crude oil pipelines is not centralized, leading to challenges for companies negotiating with landowners. Companies must obtain approval on a state-by-state basis and may need to seek condemnation of property interests if negotiations fail. No federal law grants eminent domain rights for interstate oil pipelines, and there is no single federal agency responsible for coordinating federal authorizations. An entity building an oil or gas pipeline may need federal authorizations depending on the proposed route and impact on environmental resources. This could include approvals for crossing borders, emissions, or protected wildlife areas. The construction of oil or gas pipelines may require federal authorizations for crossing borders, emissions, or protected wildlife areas. The agency granting approval may impose conditions, and some authorizations may trigger NEPA review. FERC coordinates federal reviews and consultations for interstate natural gas pipeline projects, including compliance with laws like the Endangered Species Act and National Historic Preservation Act. States have a limited role in these federal authorizations and reviews. States have broad authority to regulate pollution and protect natural resources, while federal government controls border crossings for pipelines transporting gas or oil between the US and foreign countries. Presidential permit is required for cross-border facilities, as states lack authority in this matter due to federal government's constitutional powers over foreign commerce and affairs. The Supreme Court has interpreted the President's power to include conducting foreign relations. Executive Orders 10485 and 11423 delegate authority to FERC and the Secretary of State for reviewing and approving permits for cross-border gas and oil pipelines. Permits are issued if they are deemed to be in the public or national interest. States have limited involvement in this process. The State Department and FERC review cross-border pipeline permits under NEPA, with most projects involving short distances into border states. Environmental Assessments are typically conducted, but in 2006, EIS was required for a proposed oil pipeline project. Keystone XL pipeline is one such project that underwent EIS preparation. The federal government has ultimate authority over granting rights-of-way for pipeline crossings over federal lands, particularly in the Western states. Companies seeking to route oil or natural gas pipelines across federal lands can obtain rights-of-way through federal laws, such as Section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act. The Mineral Leasing Act authorizes the DOI to grant rights-of-way for oil or natural gas pipelines through federal lands, considering state standards for construction and operation. The Bureau of Land Management regulates various aspects of pipeline rights-of-way, specifying which lands are available for use. The Bureau of Land Management regulates rights-of-way for oil and gas pipelines on federal lands, while other federal agencies like the Forest Service and Fish and Wildlife Service also have regulations for pipeline construction. The National Park Service lacks general authority for new pipeline easements on its lands, but Congress has granted approval for specific projects in national parks. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement grants rights-of-way for offshore pipelines through submerged lands of the Outer Continental Shelf. Federal laws like the Clean Water Act may require permits for pipeline companies to control pollutants discharged into navigable waters. EPA and Army Corps of Engineers regulate the scope of protected waters under the CWA, with ongoing litigation determining the extent of its provisions. The Clean Water Act (CWA) envisions cooperation between the federal government and states for water quality laws. States can assume permitting responsibilities under CWA Sections 402 and 404, but EPA retains authority to review and deny state permits. States can regulate pollutants under state law as long as they are not less stringent than CWA standards. The Clean Water Act (CWA) requires permits for pipeline projects that may impact surface waters, in addition to other federal laws like the Rivers and Harbors Act. The Corps may require permits for projects involving obstructions to navigation or modifications to water bodies. OCSLA extends the Corps authority over obstructions to artificial islands and installations on the seabed. Discharges of dredged or fill material into protected waters are regulated under these laws. The Clean Water Act (CWA) requires permits for discharging dredged or fill material into protected waters, such as rivers, streams, and wetlands. Section 404 authorizes the Corps to issue permits for these activities, with states able to assume permitting responsibilities upon EPA approval. The Corps determines permit issuance based on a public interest test and conducts environmental reviews according to jointly developed guidelines. The Corps may authorize pipeline project activities under general permits instead of individual project permits, which authorize categories of similar activities with minimal adverse environmental effects. The EPA may veto disposal sites or restrict their use, and projects involving discharge into U.S. waters may require a CWA Section 402 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination permit. The project may need a CWA Section 402 NPDES permit from the EPA or authorized state for discharges into navigable waters. NPDES permits have technology-based and water-quality-based limits. CWA Section 401 requires certification for federal licenses or permits for activities with potential water discharges. States have the authority to require water quality certification for activities with potential water discharges, including pipeline projects, to ensure compliance with CWA requirements. Certification can be used to prohibit federal permits or impose additional conditions. EPAct 2005 amended the NGA to provide expedited review in federal court of appeals for state water quality certifications under the CWA. The Clean Air Act may also require permits for pipeline projects to regulate air pollutants and protect outdoor air quality. The Clean Air Act (CAA) exemplifies cooperative federalism, with states responsible for implementing and enforcing EPA air quality standards. States submit State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to attain and maintain federal air quality standards. Construction of pipeline-related facilities may require CAA permits based on emitted pollutants and air quality status in the area. In the context of pipeline facilities, federal CAA permitting requirements include Title V operating permits, New Source Review (NSR) permits, and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for controlling emissions of pollutants like VOCs and sulfur dioxides. The EPA proposed amendments to the NSPS to address VOCs and methane emissions from compressors in the natural gas sector. States can enforce stricter emissions standards than federal regulations for stationary sources. The EPA has authority to prevent construction or modification of major emissions sources if state or local governments do not follow permitting requirements. Federal laws may require consultation with agencies on potential impacts of pipeline projects on wildlife, natural resources, and cultural properties. During the NEPA process or permit evaluation, the lead agency may require additional federal authorizations or consultations. States can participate in consultations under laws like the National Historic Preservation Act, where they may assist in evaluating project impacts on cultural and historical properties. DOI can delegate authority to states for consultation on federal undertakings affecting historical properties and developing mitigation plans. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service before issuing permits that may impact endangered species or their habitats. The FWS issues a biological opinion on the potential harm to species and may suggest alternative actions to mitigate risks. The opinion may also allow for incidental \"takes\" of endangered species in certain circumstances. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service before issuing permits that may impact endangered species or their habitats. FWS policy allows for consultation with states when preparing a biological opinion, and states can have their own restrictions on taking endangered species. Similar consultation requirements exist under other federal statutes for projects affecting cultural, historical, or natural resources. States may also have their own environmental review and permitting requirements for projects. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) requires states to concur with federal permits that affect land, water use, or natural resources in the coastal zone. States must notify the federal agency of their concurrence or objection within 6 months to retain their rights. If the state does not respond, it waives its concurrence rights. The federal permit cannot be granted without the state's concurrence unless the Secretary of Commerce intervenes. The Commerce Secretary's decision on pipeline activities must align with CZMA objectives or national security interests. Pipelines, while generally safe, pose risks to public health and the environment. Recent accidents have highlighted these risks, especially with shale gas gathering lines operating at higher pressures. Federal and state authorities oversee pipeline regulation. The Pipeline Safety Act (PSA) gives federal and state authorities the power to regulate pipeline safety under Title 49 of the United States Code. The PSA aims to protect life and property by improving regulatory authority and enforcing safety standards for gas and hazardous liquid transportation. DOT is directed to set minimum safety standards and can enforce corrective actions on operators of hazardous pipeline facilities. The Office of Pipeline Safety under PHMSA administers and enforces the PSA, allowing states to certify their own pipeline safety programs. States must adopt PHMSA's safety standards to be validly certified. States can certify their own pipeline safety programs under PHMSA's oversight by adopting applicable safety standards. Certifications do not prevent PHMSA from enforcing new safety standards, and states can become authorized to administer federal standards by submitting valid certifications. PHMSA may also allow states to conduct inspections of interstate pipelines for compliance with federal standards. The DOT must consider comments from state committees when setting safety standards for pipelines. Congress is interested in the safety of gathering lines, with regulations determining federal oversight for onshore and offshore pipelines. Onshore gas gathering lines in rural areas are not federally regulated for safety. States can enforce more stringent safety standards for intrastate gathering lines regulated by DOT if they are compatible with federal minimum safety standards. Some intrastate gathering lines are not federally regulated for safety, allowing states to enforce stricter regulations if they align with federal standards. The relationship between federal and state authority in pipeline safety is governed by the PSA, which permits states to adopt additional safety standards as long as they are compatible with federal minimum standards. Federal laws preempt state laws in the regulation of interstate pipeline facilities and transportation under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. This occurs when Congress expressly states preemption, when state laws conflict with federal laws, or when federal regulation is pervasive. The Pipeline Safety Act includes an express preemption clause, eliminating the need to consider other forms of preemption. The Pipeline Safety Act contains an express preemption clause that distinguishes between state laws regulating intrastate and interstate pipelines. State safety standards for intrastate pipelines must be authorized by the DOT and compatible with federal standards to avoid preemption. Safety standards for interstate pipelines will also be preempted. A court would likely define the term \"safety standard\" to determine the scope of preemption. The court may determine the meaning of \"safety standard\" by looking at industry usage, statutory provisions, regulations, and standards promulgated by PHMSA under the Pipeline Safety Act. The regulations address minimum safety standards for pipeline facilities, personnel qualifications, and emergency response plans, with stricter standards in high population and environmental sensitive areas. The PSA does not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe pipeline facility locations or routing, limiting its preemptive effect. The Pipeline Safety Act does not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe pipeline facility locations or routing, limiting its preemptive effect on state laws unless they affect safety. Federal court opinions have addressed preemption of state laws affecting pipeline safety, with cases like Texas Midstream Gas Services LLC v. City of Grand Prairie determining that certain city requirements were preempted while others, like setback requirements for aesthetic concerns, were not. The Fourth Circuit ruled that local land use regulations are not preempted by pipeline safety standards, even if they prohibit a company from locating a facility in a certain area. Conflict preemption may arise when a state law conflicts with federal pipeline safety regulations, posing obstacles to achieving congressional objectives in providing protection against risks from pipeline transportation. It is challenging to predict when conflict preemption would occur without examining specific state laws."
