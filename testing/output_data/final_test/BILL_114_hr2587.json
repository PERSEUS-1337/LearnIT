    "content": "The \"State Trade Coordination Act\" establishes membership of state trade promotion agencies on the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee and requires a Federal and State Export Promotion Coordination Plan. The Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with State trade promotion agencies, will develop a plan to integrate State resources into the Federal trade promotion program. The plan will outline the role of State agencies, how they differ from Federal agencies, how to incorporate them into the Federal program, and how information and resources will be shared between Federal and State agencies. The plan, to be finalized within 12 months, will detail coordination between Federal and State agencies for education and trade events, efforts to increase efficiency, reduce duplication, and provide businesses with international trade information. The annual federal-state export strategy will detail coordination between agencies for education and trade events, aiming to increase efficiency and provide businesses with international trade information. The Secretary of Commerce will develop an annual Federal-State export strategy for each State, considering the State's export goals, key sectors, trade events, and efforts to enhance efficiency. The Federal-State export strategy must be submitted to the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee by February 1 each year. The Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with State trade promotion agencies, will develop a framework for sharing export success information and reporting metrics. A report containing the framework and metrics must be submitted to Congress within one year of the Act's enactment. Additionally, an annual survey, analysis, and report will be conducted under the National Export Strategy. The Export Enhancement Act of 1988 is amended to include a survey and analysis on Federal-State coordination and export promotion goals, in collaboration with State trade promotion agencies. This aims to assess effectiveness, provide best practices, recommendations for small businesses, and address relevant matters annually.
