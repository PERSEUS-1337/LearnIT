    "content": "The Act titled \"Childhood Lead Poisoning Protection Act of 1998\" aims to address findings and purposes related to lead poisoning in children. Congress finds that lead poisoning is a serious environmental risk, especially for young children, causing reductions in IQ, attention span, and other developmental issues. Children under 6 are at the highest risk, with poor and minority children being more vulnerable. Over 500,000 Medicaid-enrolled children have harmful lead levels, representing a significant portion of affected children in the US. The Act aims to establish a lead screening safety net for children enrolled in Medicaid and other entitlement programs, as current mandatory screening policies have not effectively identified at-risk children or provided adequate treatment services for those with elevated lead levels. Uniform lead screening requirements are lacking for children not enrolled in Medicaid. The Act aims to establish a safety net for low-income children at risk of lead poisoning, ensuring they receive blood lead screenings and follow-up care. Increased lead poisoning screenings and treatments will be provided under the Medicaid program. Penalty for Insufficient Increases in Lead Poisoning Screenings: Beginning in fiscal year 2000, States failing to meet minimum blood lead screening rates will have their Federal medical assistance percentage reduced by 1 percentage point. This penalty applies to items and services furnished under the State plan. In fiscal year 2000 and onwards, Medicaid-enrolled children must receive minimum blood lead screening rates, starting at 50% and increasing annually to 90%. Failure to meet these rates will result in a 1 percentage point reduction in Federal medical assistance percentage for States. This penalty applies to services under the State plan. In fiscal year 2000 and onwards, Medicaid-enrolled children must receive minimum blood lead screening rates, starting at 50% and increasing annually to 90%. The Secretary may modify or waive the application of the screening rates for States that have conducted a significant number of lead blood level assessments. Reporting requirements under the Social Security Act have been amended to reflect these changes. In addition to mandatory lead blood level screening requirements for Medicaid-enrolled children, contracts between states must comply with new reporting guidelines under the Social Security Act. Contracts between the State and entities responsible for providing medical assistance must comply with mandatory lead blood level screening requirements and coverage for qualified lead treatment services for children, as per CDC guidelines. The Social Security Act is amended to include reimbursement for qualified lead treatment services for children with elevated blood lead levels, as defined by CDC guidelines. Qualified lead treatment services are medically necessary services provided by a qualified provider to treat affected children. Qualified lead treatment services for children with elevated blood lead levels include environmental investigations, professional case management services, and emergency measures to reduce lead hazards as recommended by the CDC. These services are provided by qualified providers determined by the State. The amendments made by this section regarding children with elevated blood lead levels apply from October 1, 1998. State plans under title XIX of the Social Security Act may require legislation to meet these new requirements. The State plan is not considered non-compliant solely for not meeting additional requirements before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the State legislature's session. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is seen as a separate regular session. SEC. 4. Lead poisoning screening for Women, Infants, and Children program. Lead poisoning screening requirements for infants and children participating in the program under Section 17(d) of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 have been amended. Family members must provide proof of a blood lead test within 180 days of enrollment and periodically thereafter. Waivers may be granted by State or local agencies. The requirement for lead poisoning screening for infants and children in the program can be waived by State or local agencies if the area poses no risk of lead poisoning or if it goes against the family's religious beliefs. State agencies must provide screenings for infants or children who have not been screened and wish to participate in the program at no cost to the family. State agencies must perform blood lead tests on infants or children as appropriate, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will reimburse the cost of screening for those receiving medical assistance. State agencies are required to conduct blood lead tests on infants or children, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will cover the cost of purchasing approved portable blood lead analyzer instruments for screening. SEC. 5. LEAD POISONING SCREENING FOR EARLY HEAD START PROGRAMS. Section 645A of the Head Start Act is amended to include lead poisoning screening requirements for children participating in early Head Start programs. Families must provide proof of a blood lead test for the child within 180 days of enrollment and periodically thereafter. Waivers may be granted by the program entity. The entity may waive lead poisoning screening requirements for a child if the area poses no risk or if it conflicts with the family's beliefs. Entities must provide free blood lead tests for children seeking to participate in the program. The Secretary shall reimburse entities for lead poisoning screening costs for children receiving medical assistance under a State plan, including purchasing portable blood lead analyzer instruments approved by the FDA and providing screening through certified laboratories."
