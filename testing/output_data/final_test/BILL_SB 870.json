    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 273.5 of the Penal Code is amended to impose felony charges for willfully causing corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition to a specified victim, with penalties including imprisonment in state prison for two to four years, or in a county jail for up to one year, a fine of up to $6,000, or both. Any person who willfully inflicts corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition upon a victim described in subdivision (b), where the injury is caused by strangulation or suffocation, is guilty of a felony. The punishment includes imprisonment in state prison for two to four years, or in a county jail for up to one year, a fine of up to $6,000, or both. \"Strangulation\" and \"suffocation\" refer to impeding normal breathing or circulation by applying pressure on the throat or neck. This applies if the victim is the offender's spouse, former spouse, cohabitant, or former cohabitant. The law defines individuals who can be considered victims of corporal injury, including the offender's spouse, cohabitant, fianc\u00e9, or parent of their child. Traumatic condition is defined as physical injury, such as wounds or strangulation, caused by applying pressure on the throat or neck. A person can be considered the father or mother of another person's child if the alleged male parent is presumed the natural father under specific sections of the Family Code. Any person convicted of violating this section for acts occurring within seven years of a previous conviction under related sections shall face imprisonment and a fine. Any person convicted of violating this section for acts occurring within seven years of a previous conviction under related sections shall face imprisonment, a fine of up to $10,000, or both. Probation may be granted with specific conditions imposed by the court. If the defendant has prior convictions within seven years for specified offenses, probation may include mandatory imprisonment in a county jail for 15 days or 60 days. The court can waive this requirement for good cause shown. Probation conditions for a violation may include payments to a battered women's shelter or reimbursing the victim for counseling expenses. The court must assess the defendant's ability to pay fines, restitution, or payments to a battered women's shelter as probation conditions. Community property cannot be used to fulfill the offending spouse's liability for restitution until all separate property is exhausted. Upon conviction, the court may issue a restraining order for up to 10 years to prevent contact with the victim. The length of the order is based on the seriousness of the offense, likelihood of future violations, and victim safety. The order can be issued regardless of the defendant's sentence or probation status. If arrested for a violation, the victim is not required to make a citizen's arrest. Section 273.5 of the Penal Code is amended to allow for a restraining order of up to 10 years upon conviction to prevent contact with the victim, regardless of the defendant's sentence or probation status. Section 273.5 of the Penal Code is amended to include provisions for felony punishment for those who inflict corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition on specific victims, such as spouses, cohabitants, fianc\u00e9s, or parents of the offender's child. The punishment can include imprisonment in state prison for two to four years, a fine of up to $6,000, or both. The Penal Code now includes provisions for felony punishment for causing traumatic injury to specific victims, such as spouses, cohabitants, fianc\u00e9s, or parents of the offender's child. \"Traumatic condition\" is defined as a physical injury caused by force, including strangulation or suffocation. The presumed natural father under Family Code Sections 7611 and 7612 is considered the father of another person's child for the purpose of this section. Every person convicted of violating this section for acts occurring within seven years of a previous conviction shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail or state prison for varying durations, or by a fine. Probation may be granted consistent with specific provisions. If probation is granted for a defendant convicted under subdivision (a) with a prior offense specified in subdivision (f), the court shall impose conditions based on the number of prior convictions within the previous seven years. One prior conviction requires at least 15 days in county jail, while two or more prior convictions require at least 60 days in county jail. The court may waive mandatory imprisonment for good cause and impose probation with conditions such as payments to a battered women's shelter or reimbursing the victim for counseling expenses. The court determines defendant's ability to pay fines, restitution, or payments to a battered women's shelter as conditions of probation. Community property cannot be used to discharge liability for restitution until offending spouse's separate property is exhausted. Upon conviction, the sentencing court may issue a restraining order for up to 10 years to prevent contact with the victim. The length of the order is based on the seriousness of the offense, likelihood of future violations, and the safety of the victim and their family. Peace officers are not required to inform the victim of their right to make a citizen's arrest in cases of violation."
