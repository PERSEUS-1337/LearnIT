    "title": "SB 728",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 399.15 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to establish a renewables portfolio standard requiring retail sellers to procure a minimum quantity of electricity from eligible renewable energy resources as a specified percentage of total kilowatthours sold to their customers each compliance period. Retail sellers meeting certain renewable energy procurement criteria in 2010 will not have deficits from previous standards added to their requirements. The commission will implement these procurement requirements accordingly. Each retail seller must obtain a minimum amount of eligible renewable energy resources for specific compliance periods. The commission will determine the quantity of electricity products from renewable resources to be procured by each seller, ensuring equal percentages for all. The commission mandates retail sellers to procure a minimum of 20% of retail sales from eligible renewable energy resources for the compliance period from 2011 to 2013. Subsequent compliance periods require increasing percentages, reaching 33% by 2020 and maintaining that level in subsequent years. Retail sellers must procure quantities associated with all intervening years by the end of each compliance period, without needing to show specific yearly procurement. The commission has the authority to require procurement of renewable energy resources beyond specified quantities, evaluating economic impacts on California, including low- and middle-income individuals, families, and disadvantaged communities. The commission must evaluate economic impacts on California, including low- and middle-income individuals, families, and disadvantaged communities, before increasing procurement of renewable energy resources. Public workshops will be held for public comment at least 60 days before considering a rule requiring additional procurement. The commission includes electricity sold by the Department of Water Resources in retail sales calculations for renewables portfolio standards. Enforcement of this section may be waived under certain conditions beyond the control of the retail seller. The commission considers if retail sellers have taken timely measures to develop new transmission lines for renewable energy projects. Expectations for full-cost recovery are also taken into account. The commission evaluates if retail sellers have maximized cost-effective deliveries of electricity from renewable energy resources and managed portfolio risks effectively. The retail sellers are required to manage portfolio risks effectively by developing renewable energy resources, transmission, or energy storage. They must also procure a minimum margin of procurement above the renewables portfolio standard and take measures to procure cost-effective distributed generation. Additionally, they should address unanticipated curtailment of renewable energy resources. The commission may waive compliance requirements but will impose additional reporting requirements on retail sellers to show efforts to meet future procurement needs. Failure to comply without a waiver may result in enforcement action by the commission. Deficits from one compliance period cannot be carried over to the next. The commission sets limitations on procurement expenditures for renewable energy resources to comply with the renewables portfolio standard. The limitation is based on the renewable energy procurement plan, expected costs, and potential delays. It aims to prevent disproportionate rate impacts and includes all procurement costs towards meeting the standard. The commission assesses if electrical corporations can meet a 33-percent renewables portfolio standard by 2020 and proposes revised cost limitations if necessary. The requirement for submitting a report under Section 10231.5 of the Government Code is inoperative as of January 1, 2021. Reports must comply with Section 9795 of the Government Code. Electrical corporations may limit new contracts or construction if cost limitations are insufficient for meeting renewables portfolio standard requirements, unless renewable energy resources can be procured within the limitation. The commission monitors electrical corporations to ensure compliance with cost limitations. If a corporation may exceed its limit before meeting renewable energy requirements, the commission investigates and notifies the Legislature. The renewables portfolio standard does not implement the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978."
