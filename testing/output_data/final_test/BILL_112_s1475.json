The Act defines key terms such as \"City\" (North Las Vegas, Nevada), \"County\" (Clark County, Nevada), \"Economic Support Area\" (identified land), \"Federal land\" (1,211 acres in the County), \"Map\" (dated July 28, 2011), and \"Net proceeds\" (difference between gross revenues and development costs).

The Secretary refers to the Secretary of the Interior, and the State refers to the State of Nevada. SEC. 3. Conveyance of federal land to Clark County, Nevada. The Secretary shall convey Federal land to Clark County, Nevada for off-road vehicle recreation park use, including races and commercial services. The Federal land will be conveyed to Clark County, Nevada for off-road vehicle recreation park use, including races and commercial services. If the County ceases to use the land for these purposes, the title will revert to the United States. The Federal land conveyed to Clark County, Nevada can be used for generating renewable and solar energy for specific purposes, without interfering with national interests. If the County fails to use the land as intended, it will revert to the United States. Before the construction of any proposed project at Nellis Air Force Base, the project proponent must consult with the Secretary of Defense. An Economic Support Area has been designated, and before development, the City and County must enter into an interlocal agreement. The County will cooperate with the City to ensure compatible development of the Economic Support Area. The interlocal agreement shall not compromise aviation rights and future conveyances of Federal land must adhere to the agreement and aviation easement requirements. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Air Force and the County, may develop a special management plan for the Federal land to enhance public safety, off-highway recreation use, and ensure compatibility with the Nellis Air Force Base mission. The County shall deposit 50% of net proceeds from the Economic Support Area development into a Treasury account for Recreation Area use, and retain 50% for County use. Before the Federal land can be conveyed to the County, an interlocal agreement must be made between the County, Bureau of Land Management, and Nellis Air Force Base to enhance off-highway recreation use and ensure development is in line with the base's mission. The use of the conveyed land should not compromise national security. The conveyance of Federal land under subsection (a) must not compromise Nellis Air Force Base's national security mission or aviation rights. The Secretary may impose additional terms and conditions to protect U.S. interests. Each deed for the land conveyance must include a perpetual aviation easement to ensure unobstructed overflight for federal aircraft. Each easement described in paragraph (1) must include terms and conditions determined by the Secretary of the Air Force to comply with the requirements. The Nellis Dunes area is designated as the Nellis Dunes National Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area, with a special management plan for off-highway vehicle use. It is excluded from the National Landscape Conservation System and aviation rights apply. Land is withdrawn and reserved for Nellis Air Force Base. The Federal land and interests in Federal land identified on the map for Nellis Air Force Base are withdrawn from appropriation under land laws and jurisdiction is transferred to the Secretary of the Air Force. The reserved land is for the enlargement and protection of Nellis Air Force Base or other defense-related purposes. The Secretary of the Air Force must consult with the Secretary before using the withdrawn land for purposes other than those specified. The United States reserves the right of flight and to cause noise and other effects in the airspace above the land conveyed to the County."
