    "content": "The \"After School Education and Anti-Crime Act of 1999\" aims to improve academic and social outcomes for students, reduce juvenile crime, and prevent youth from becoming victims of crime by offering productive activities during after school hours. Congress finds that today's youth face increased social risks, spend more time unsupervised, and are most at risk of violence between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. Academic failure consequences are more severe in 1999. After school programs are effective in addressing youth social problems, with many governors supporting their expansion through a Federal/State partnership. Over 450 police chiefs, sheriffs, and prosecutors, along with police officer associations, have urged public officials to provide after school programs for children and teens in the US, emphasizing the importance of safe and positive learning environments during those hours. The goals of this Act include increasing academic success, promoting safe after-school environments, providing alternatives to negative activities, and reducing juvenile crime.
