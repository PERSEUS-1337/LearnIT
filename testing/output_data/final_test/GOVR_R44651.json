    "content": "There are 14 U.S. territories, five of which are inhabited: Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Each territory has its own tax system influenced by U.S. law, including the Internal Revenue Code. Changes in federal tax policy can impact the territories' economies and revenues. The dynamics between federal and territorial tax policy could interest Congress, especially since inhabited territories have representatives in Congress. The U.S. insular areas of Guam, AS, CNMI, USVI, and PR are represented in Congress by Delegates or a Resident Commissioner with limited voting powers. Congress may use tax policies to improve economic conditions in the territories, such as expanding federal tax benefits for lower-income households and introducing new incentives. Tax policies can be used by Congress to improve economic conditions in the U.S. territories. This includes using business-related tax incentives to encourage capital investment and employment. U.S. tax policies could impact the territories' fiscal balances, with potential implications for revenue. The bipartisan Congressional Task Force on Economic Growth in Puerto Rico is considering these policies, including recent legislation to create a fiscal control board for restructuring public finances. The Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) created a Task Force to recommend changes to federal law for economic growth in Puerto Rico. The report summarizes U.S. tax policy related to the territories and analyzes current tax policy issues. It aims to provide Congress with an overview of tax issues in the territories. The report provides an overview of tax issues related to U.S. territories, focusing on the distinction between mirror code and non-mirror code tax systems. Guam, CNMI, and USVI are required to have a mirror code, using the IRC as their territorial income tax law. Territories bound by the mirror code use the IRC as their income tax system, while those not bound can establish their own tax regulations. Territories can enact additional forms of taxation within certain boundaries set by federal statutes. Guam and CNMI, as mirror-code jurisdictions, can delink from the IRC under certain conditions. Guam and CNMI can delink from the IRC under certain conditions, including enacting a new local income tax system and entering into an implementing agreement with the United States. USVI, on the other hand, is required to mirror the IRC but has additional authority to levy taxes. Unlike Guam and CNMI, USVI was not granted the authority to delink from the mirror code. USVI has the authority to enact nondiscriminatory local income taxes in addition to those mirrored in the IRC. PR has its own income tax laws, while AS has adopted a modified version of the IRC for its territorial income tax laws. AS has adopted a modified version of the IRC for its territorial income tax laws, based on the version in effect on December 31, 2000, with some modifications. Federal taxes may also apply in the territories, with residents generally treated more similar to foreign citizens for tax purposes. U.S. territories are treated similarly to foreign citizens for federal tax purposes. Residents and corporations in the territories are subject to federal taxes only on income sourced to the United States. Territories are considered outside the physical borders of the U.S. for tax purposes, so certain IRC provisions may not apply unless specified. Bona fide residents of a territory are eligible for a possession-source income exclusion, exempting them from U.S. income tax on work or business. Residents of U.S. territories are treated like foreign citizens for federal tax purposes. They are only taxed on income sourced to the United States. Bona fide residents can exclude income from their territory and only need to file one tax return locally. Possession-source income exclusion applies to territories like American Samoa, U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam, and CNMI. Coordination between territories and the U.S. determines tax filing for residents with income earned outside their jurisdiction. Residents of U.S. territories are treated like foreign citizens for federal tax purposes. Bona fide residents with income from another jurisdiction might have to file returns with the IRS or their local tax authorities. Tax filing requirements for non-bona fide residents depend on the territory, citizenship, residency, and income source. U.S. tax procedures vary for excluding territorial-source income. Bona fide residency in a territory is determined by a three-part test in IRC Section 937, including a physical presence requirement. Residents of U.S. territories are treated like foreign citizens for federal tax purposes. Tax filing requirements for non-bona fide residents depend on the territory, citizenship, residency, and income source. Situations might arise regarding U.S. or territorial income tax due on certain sources of income. The IRS outlines rules for determining U.S. source of income in certain situations, and IRC Section 911 allows a capped exclusion of foreign wage and salary income for U.S. citizens and residents living and working abroad. U.S. citizens and residents in territories do not qualify for income exclusions under IRC Section 911. U.S. corporations pay tax on worldwide earnings, with foreign subsidiary earnings taxed upon repatriation. Income from territories is considered foreign-source and can be deferred, except for income from foreign branches. The taxation of highly mobile income earned by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations is generally not deferrable, except for active financing income. Subpart F income and passive foreign investment company rules prevent deferral due to potential tax avoidance. U.S. corporations can claim a foreign tax credit for taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions, up to the amount of U.S. income tax due. U.S. corporations can claim a foreign tax credit for taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions, up to the amount of U.S. income tax due. For example, a U.S. corporation earning $30 million worldwide income, with $10 million from a subsidiary in PR, would owe $9.5 million in income tax to the United States after applying foreign tax credits. U.S. subsidiaries of foreign-owned corporations are subject to U.S. corporate income tax on income connected to a U.S. trade or business. Dividends paid by U.S. corporations to foreign companies are generally subject to taxation. Foreign corporations in certain U.S. territories are exempt from the 30% withholding tax on dividends, as long as they meet specific ownership and activity requirements. Puerto Rican corporations meeting these requirements can reduce the U.S. withholding tax rate on dividends from 30% to 10%. Contributions Act (FICA) taxes apply to wages paid to individuals in U.S. territories, subjecting them to Social Security and Medicare taxes. FICA payroll taxes consist of a 1.45% tax for Medicare Hospital Insurance and a 6.2% tax for Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance. Employers in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are also subject to the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) tax. Employers and employees in U.S. territories are subject to FUTA tax at a rate of 6.0% of wages. Employers contributing to PR or USVI's unemployment insurance programs can receive a credit of up to 90% of the federal FUTA tax owed. Bona fide residents of a U.S. territory with self-employment income must pay self-employment tax to the United States. Withholding for U.S. income tax does not apply in the territories, as wages are subject to local income taxes. U.S. excise taxes generally do not apply in the territories. Environmental excise taxes, such as the ozone-depleting chemicals tax and the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund tax, apply in U.S. territories. A special excise tax is imposed on products manufactured in PR and USVI and shipped to the U.S. mainland to prevent tax advantages. These \"equalization taxes\" are transferred to the territories' treasuries by the U.S. Treasury. A portion of the federal excise tax on rum imported into the United States is transferred to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The territories use this revenue for marketing campaigns for the rum industry and economic development. U.S. citizens are taxed on the value of bequests and gifts at a rate of 40%. The federal tax code imposes a 40% tax rate on estates exceeding the unified credit. U.S. citizens in territories may be exempt, but their estates with U.S. property are still subject to estate and gift tax. Federal tax incentives are available for activities in territories, including deductions and credits for various purposes. The federal tax code provides tax incentives for activities in territories, such as rum cover-over payments for economic development projects. Congress has extended tax credits for manufacturing activities in Puerto Rico and business operations in American Samoa. Three tax policy issues relevant to territories include tax-based assistance to households, economic development, and tax arbitrage. Congress could use U.S. tax policy to provide economic assistance to households in territories by expanding the availability of federal tax credits like the earned income tax credit (EITC) and additional child tax credit (ACTC), as well as creating a payroll tax cut for territorial tax filers. The EITC is a refundable tax credit for eligible low-wage workers, issued annually based on earnings and other factors. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) are refundable tax credits that benefit low-income tax filers. The EITC encourages nonworking poor to enter the workforce, while the CTC reduces tax liability for families with children. Residents of territories may not qualify for the EITC, but some can claim the ACTC. Congress could expand these tax credits to provide economic assistance to households in territories. Residents of territories like Guam, CNMI, USVI, and certain PR residents can claim the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC). There are calls to expand eligibility of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and ACTC to more residents in non-mirror code territories. Research on the economic impact of these credits in the US could help policymakers. The Child Tax Credit (CTC) and ACTC could provide subsidies for low-income families, but it's challenging to isolate their effects due to the presence of the EITC. These tax provisions are unlikely to significantly influence families to have more children due to the high costs associated with raising a child. Expanding access to the EITC and ACTC for territorial residents could increase labor supply and reduce poverty, particularly for those with children. However, these policies may not benefit individuals without children or unemployed spouses as much as single mothers. Expanding access to the EITC and ACTC for territorial residents could have economic benefits, but barriers such as low-income households not filing U.S. tax returns may limit the impact. The U.S. Treasury could offset costs through the local tax code, but this may add responsibilities for territorial tax officials. Expanding eligibility for refundable tax credits in the territories could have economic benefits, but may face barriers such as improper EITC payments and constraints from local labor regulations. Introducing a tax-based labor subsidy or reducing the minimum wage applicability could help offset these constraints. However, expanding eligibility could also lead to significant budgetary costs. Expanding eligibility for refundable tax credits in the territories could have economic benefits, but may face barriers such as improper EITC payments and constraints from local labor regulations. Redesigning the benefit structure by adjusting phaseouts or benefit rates could help target \"low-income\" households more effectively. However, not adjusting thresholds could result in higher-income households receiving excessive tax benefits that may not contribute to the local economy. The IRC typically does not adjust benefit or threshold amounts for differences in economic conditions. The IRC does not adjust benefit or threshold amounts for differences in economic conditions between states or territories. One study found that some areas in the territories have higher costs of living than average metropolitan areas in the United States. Congress could increase territorial households' after-tax income by reducing payroll taxes for residents, targeting lower to upper-middle income households. This could help residents pay for basic needs more easily. Reducing payroll taxes for residents in the territories could increase after-tax income and help them pay for basic needs. This could be achieved by lowering payroll tax rates or implementing a temporary payroll tax cut similar to the Making Work Pay tax credit. Reducing payroll taxes in the territories could boost after-tax income by providing a tax credit of 6.2% of wages, phased in and out based on earnings, with a maximum credit of $400 for individuals ($800 for joint filers). This approach offers administrative advantages over the EITC and ACTC options, reaching households more quickly through paychecks. Congress should consider the role of tax policies in promoting economic growth. Congress could consider using tax policies to promote economic development in the territories, such as encouraging or discouraging certain industries or types of jobs. Historical examples include the now-repealed IRC Section 936 possessions tax credit and deferral of tax on earnings of territorial subsidiaries of U.S. corporations. Options for utilizing U.S. tax policies to affect territorial public finances could be explored by the Congressional Task Force on Economic Growth in Puerto Rico. Tax policies could be used to promote economic development in the territories by providing incentives for capital investment and hiring new workers. These incentives could be structured to benefit specific industries or provide a general boost to economic activity. However, there is a risk that these policies could redirect investment away from areas with the highest economic return and may have unintended side effects. Tax policies encouraging capital investment in territories may lead to more capital-intensive production and less reliance on labor. Tax incentives for economic activity in territories could have little impact on employment. The Section 936 possessions tax credit incentivized U.S. investment in Puerto Rico by allowing corporations to pay little to no U.S. tax on PR affiliate income, leading to profit shifting without significant real economic activity changes. The Section 936 credit incentivized U.S. investment in Puerto Rico, with 96.8% of corporate filings and 99.2% of credit amounts in 1987 coming from PR operations. It led to the development of a skilled labor force in industries like pharmaceuticals and electronics. A 1991 Treasury study showed that Section 936 corporations employed 82.3% of manufacturing workers in PR, with higher wages than the average. However, the incentives were seen as a subsidy almost equal to the average worker's wage. The Section 936 incentives provided a subsidy almost equal to the average worker's salary in industries like drug, chemicals, and electronics manufacturing. Studies showed that the tax benefits for corporations often exceeded average compensation per employee. Congress phased out Section 936 in 1996 due to costs outweighing benefits for a small number of U.S. corporations operating in the possessions. Analyses show that Section 936 provided significant benefits to U.S. parent corporations by allowing income shifting opportunities to PR affiliates, resulting in high returns for investors. Studies found that pharmaceutical and chemicals firms in PR had much higher returns on stockholders' equity compared to their counterparts in the United States. Tax arbitrage activity in the territories, such as Puerto Rico, contributes to the erosion of the U.S. tax base through international income shifting. U.S. corporations and individuals can reduce tax liability by taking advantage of the territories' foreign-like status for tax purposes and tax incentives for overseas investment. The phaseout of the Section 936 tax credit in 2005 ended some tax planning strategies, but opportunities for deferral and transfer still exist for U.S. corporations. Despite the end of some tax planning strategies, U.S. corporations can still lower their U.S. tax liability by utilizing deferral, transfer pricing, low tax rates in third-party countries, and special tax incentives offered by territories. This includes establishing holding companies in low-tax jurisdictions and transferring ownership of intangible assets to them, as well as shifting earnings from U.S. sales to subsidiaries in tax-friendly locations. Payments for intellectual property use in manufacturing products in PR can be reduced through transfer pricing strategies. U.S. individuals can utilize tax incentives in the U.S. or territories like PR to lower or avoid taxes. Establishing residency in PR can help individuals avoid U.S. worldwide tax on PR income. The Individual Investors Act in PR exempts new residents from most investment income taxes. By establishing residency in PR, U.S. taxpayers can accumulate capital gains on U.S. investments without being subject to U.S. or PR taxes, although their estate may still be subject to U.S. estate tax. Tax avoidance strategies in Puerto Rico, both at the corporate and individual levels, could impact revenue for the United States. These strategies may redirect new investment to the territories or simply reward existing behavior. The revenue from shutting off these tax strategies could be used for government debt reduction or spending programs to support economic growth. Tax avoidance opportunities in non-mirror-code territories could impact growth and income security. It distorts capital allocation across industries and raises issues of economic equity. A more efficient tax system would promote capital flow based on economic returns, not tax planning gains. Tax avoidance opportunities in non-mirror-code territories raise issues of economic equity, as multinational corporations and individuals with financial means can pay lower U.S. tax rates than others. This can lead to disparities in tax payments based on residency and income sources. The text discusses income tax filing requirements for U.S. citizens or residents in territories and mainland United States. It outlines scenarios for tax filers with territorial-source income, non-territorial income, and both. The information in Table A-1 pertains specifically to income tax filing under the IRC and does not cover other types of taxes like self-employment or payroll taxes. The table provides an overview of tax filing procedures for territorial residents and nonresident U.S. citizens with territorial income. It aims to inform the legislative debate and highlight potential challenges in extending IRC provisions to certain territorial residents. It is not a substitute for professional tax advice.
