Senator Joseph Lieberman introduced S. 2321, the E-Government Reauthorization Act of 2007, co-sponsored by Senators Susan Collins and Thomas Carper. The bill aims to amend and reauthorize appropriations for the E-Government Act of 2002, with five main sections outlining various activities and reauthorizations through FY2012. The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs reported the bill favorably without amendment on November 14, 2007. The E-Government Reauthorization Act of 2007 aims to enhance the use of community centers for computer and Internet access, develop common protocols for geographic information systems, and improve federal information security. It also includes provisions for privacy impact assessments and agency website guidance. The E-Government Reauthorization Act of 2007 requires the Director of OMB to provide guidance for making federal government information more accessible to search capabilities. Agencies must comply with this guidance within two years and report their activities in annual E-Government Status Reports to OMB. Additionally, OMB must provide Congress with copies of these reports. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs held a hearing on S. 2321 and related issues. Witnesses included Karen Evans from OMB, John Lewis Needham from Google, Ari Schwartz from the Center for Democracy and Technology, and Jimmy Wales from Wikipedia. The Chairman emphasized the importance of accessibility, accountability, interactivity, and public collaboration in government. Karen Evans discussed OMB's efforts to implement the E-Government Act and related initiatives. Initiatives like Science.gov and Grants.gov aim to improve access to government information. However, concerns have been raised about the invisibility of online government information to commercial search engines, affecting both public and government search engines. Commercial search engines remain the most popular way to find government information, according to Ari Schwartz. Some federal websites limit search engine indexing, hindering access to government information. The Sitemap Protocol helps websites communicate their content to search engines, but not all federal websites use it. The E-Government Reauthorization Act aims to improve accessibility of federal information online. Topics discussed include the effectiveness of current privacy protections, potential benefits of Web 2.0 technologies, and considerations for reauthorizing the E-Government Act. Congress may need to address issues related to implementation and oversight of e-government initiatives. The federal e-government initiatives aim to improve government operations by enhancing information delivery, services to citizens, and back-office administration. A report to Congress in February 2008 highlighted a cost savings of $508 million in FY2007 from these initiatives. Despite the relatively small savings compared to the $65.5 billion spent on IT investments, Congress should consider the non-financial benefits to government and citizens, such as improved performance and service levels. The E-Government Act authorized a significant sum for e-government initiatives, but concerns about oversight have limited appropriations to no more than $5 million. The clash between horizontal government-wide initiatives and vertical agency organization hinders cross-agency collaboration in funding allocation. The E-Government Act limited appropriations to $5 million due to oversight concerns. Congress rejected proposals to tap into GSA's surplus fund. The Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) is crucial for developing government-wide initiatives and addressing interoperability for improved collaboration. The federal enterprise architecture is crucial for improving interagency collaboration and information sharing. It is a significant challenge as the government implements cross-agency initiatives to streamline systems and enhance e-government services. Regular assessments of this process may be necessary to minimize complications. The upcoming transition of presidential administrations raises questions about the continuity and sustainability of IT investments. Each new administration brings its own priorities and implications for future projects. In preparation for a new administration, Congress may analyze e-government activities to guide funding decisions."
