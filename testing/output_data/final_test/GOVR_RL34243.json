    "content": "The Administration has increased interest in foreign assistance programs post-9/11, introducing new performance-based and sector-specific programs. A restructuring of aid programs aims to align with strategic objectives and improve coordination. Congress is considering policy and organizational reforms in annual appropriations. The 111th Congress is considering far-reaching reforms in foreign aid programs in 2009, amidst the Obama Administration's interest in aid reform. Criticisms include fragmented, cumbersome, and ineffective aid programs lacking flexibility, responsiveness, and transparency. There is ambiguity in aid policy development among various government departments, resulting in disillusionment with foreign aid due to perceived lack of progress in recipient countries. Criticism of foreign aid programs includes outdated Cold War-era structures, conflicting priorities, and lack of coordination among various agencies and donors. Key points of contention are the level and composition of aid, as well as the coordination among USAID, State Department, and other independent agencies. The challenges in foreign aid coordination include the involvement of multiple domestic agencies, the ambiguity in setting aid policy between the State Department and USAID, the effectiveness of aid programs, and the lack of a comprehensive foreign assistance strategy. The State Department and USAID are the main agencies providing foreign assistance, with the State Department controlling 64% of aid and USAID 20%. Other agencies like the Millennium Challenge Corporation and Peace Corps also manage some funds. Some funds are co-managed by both agencies, with major policy decisions usually made by the State Department. The State Department controls 64% of foreign aid, while USAID manages 20%. USAID focuses on long-term development, health programs, and disaster relief, while the State Department handles military assistance, narcotics, law enforcement, and other accounts. Coordination between the two agencies improved after 2006 reforms. There is little coordination between State and USAID at the budget and policy development level. Several independent agencies administer foreign assistance outside of State and USAID, funded in annual foreign operations appropriations bills. These agencies include the Millennium Challenge Corporation, Trade and Development Agency, Peace Corps, Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and Export-Import Bank. Critics argue that their activities are not well coordinated with State and USAID. Additionally, approximately 14 different departments and agencies administer aid programs, with the Department of Defense managing the largest portfolio, including humanitarian assistance and training foreign militaries. The United States provides foreign assistance through various agencies, including civic action activities, training foreign militaries, and health-related assistance. These programs operate outside the oversight of foreign operations appropriations subcommittees and lack a central reporting mechanism, leading to a fragmented aid structure. Critics argue that the lack of coordination between agencies impedes coherent foreign assistance policy and implementation. Since 9/11, Congress has generally increased funding for foreign assistance, with the FY2009 budget request at $26.1 billion, an 8.8% increase from FY2008. The trend of rising funding levels is partly due to the use of supplemental appropriations. Funding levels for foreign operations have been provided since FY1999 in both current and constant dollars, including regular and supplemental funds. The main statutory basis of foreign aid programs is the Foreign Assistance Authorization Act of 1961 (FAA), as amended. Congress has enacted a series of statutes to authorize specific aid programs, including the FREEDOM Support Act, the Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act, and the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002. The Foreign Assistance Authorization Act of 1961 (FAA) and related statutes have been recommended for replacement to update the statutory basis of aid programs. The rationale for U.S. foreign aid has historically been national security, humanitarianism, and commercial interest, evolving from post-World War II rebuilding to Cold War tensions. After the Cold War, foreign aid programs shifted focus to regional issues like Middle East peace, democracy in Eastern Europe, drug trafficking in the Andes, and illegal immigration. The rationale for foreign aid changed from anti-Communism to commercial and humanitarian reasons. Foreign assistance is justified for promoting U.S. exports, improving the global economic environment, and as a moral imperative to help poverty-stricken countries and those facing disasters or conflict. Providing aid for humanitarian reasons or in response to natural disasters is generally uncontested. Aid aims to promote economic growth, reduce poverty, improve governance, expand access to education and healthcare, protect the environment, promote stability in conflictive regions, uphold human rights, curb weapons proliferation, and address drug production and trafficking. The United States aims to promote national security, ensure a global economic environment for American products, and demonstrate humanitarian values through foreign assistance programs. Observers believe that poverty and lack of opportunity contribute to political instability and the rise of terrorist organizations. The focus of U.S. aid programs has shifted from anti-communism to anti-terrorism post 9/11. The Bush Administration's focus on global development as a pillar of U.S. national security was established in 2002. Initiatives in diplomacy and foreign aid were announced, including a transformational diplomacy initiative and the creation of the Director of Foreign Assistance position at the State Department in 2006. The Director of Foreign Assistance (DFA) at the State Department has established a new Strategic Framework for Foreign Assistance to improve coordination, coherence, transparency, and accountability in aid programs. The foreign aid budget has significantly increased due to new presidential initiatives like the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI). Increased pledges for aid to Africa and reconstruction costs in Afghanistan and Iraq have also driven the recent budget increases. U.S. foreign assistance programs have fluctuated since the 1940s, with significant investments like the Marshall Plan in rebuilding Europe. In response to world events, U.S. aid programs have fluctuated since the 1940s. Aid levels rose under President Kennedy with initiatives in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Aid spending leveled off in the 1970s but rose again in the 1980s for famine in Africa and peace efforts in the Middle East. In the 1990s, aid levels fell to their lowest, but recent initiatives focus on health funding and assistance to Africa. Beginning in 2003, the Administration launched new initiatives with sector or region specific focus. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) pledged $15 billion by FY2008 for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, primarily benefiting Africa. A follow-on plan was announced in 2007 to provide a total of $30 billion through FY2013. The Administration announced a follow-on plan to provide $30 billion through FY2013 for malaria prevention and treatment, doubling U.S. assistance to Africa by 2010. The FY2008 request includes $388 million for malaria and HIV/AIDS funds, with a 53% increase in bilateral aid to Africa. The President also initiated the Millennium Challenge Corporation with a pledge of $5 billion. The Millennium Challenge Corporation was established to reward recipient countries for good economic and governance policies, with a pledge of $5 billion in annual funding by FY2006. Requests have never exceeded $3 billion a year, and Congress has consistently cut MCC funding due to slow disbursement. The Africa Education Initiative, announced in 2002, pledged over $600 million for basic education over five years, focusing on teacher training, textbooks, and tuition scholarships. Funding distribution varies based on world events, with a significant increase in aid to Africa for malaria and HIV/AIDS prevention. The Administration announced the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), with a focus on Africa where 12 of the 15 focus countries are located. Aid to Africa has quadrupled since 2001, reaching $5.5 billion in FY2008. Aid to South and Central Asia has increased ten-fold, while assistance to Europe and Eurasia has decreased. The FY2008 budget continues funding to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic, with the 15 PEPFAR focus countries as main beneficiaries. The focus on Africa in aid funding has raised concerns about the impact on other regions. Excluding Global HIV/AIDS Initiative funds, Africa would have seen a 27% increase in funding since FY2001. U.S. aid programs have shifted focus over time, from rebuilding European infrastructure to addressing urban and rural poverty in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Under President Carter, human rights considerations influenced foreign aid policy, while the Clinton Administration focused on sustainable development and democracy. Current U.S. aid programs prioritize health and security assistance, with a significant increase in funding for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. Health funding now makes up nearly 30% of the foreign aid budget, while security assistance has slightly increased to 44% since FY1995. Supplemental appropriations for Foreign Operations programs have increased from 36% in FY1995 to 44% in FY2008. These funds have become a significant channel for U.S. international activities, particularly for reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. There is criticism that the Administration relies too heavily on supplementals, but they argue that it is necessary for unforeseen emergencies and rapidly changing overseas events. Supplemental appropriations for Foreign Operations programs have increased, with a growing reliance on emergency funding. In FY2007, Congress approved $6.146 billion in international affairs spending, including $4.42 billion for foreign aid. For FY2008, the Administration requested $3.3 billion for international affairs, with an additional $1.96 billion for foreign assistance. In June 2008, Congress passed a supplemental bill providing $4.16 billion for FY2008 and $2.87 billion for FY2009 in foreign operations funding. Congress will likely play a key role in foreign aid reform by authorizing new aid infrastructure and appropriating funds for refocused programs. Challenges include justifying foreign aid programs in relation to benefits for the United States and domestic needs. A review of the current organization of departments and agencies providing international assistance is needed for better coordination. This may involve re-evaluating the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and other legislation provide the statutory framework for potential organizational reforms in U.S. foreign assistance policy. Congress faces criticisms and challenges in reforming aid programs, with proposals for policy options and organizational changes. The rationale for foreign aid has historically focused on security concerns, often related to anti-communism or anti-terrorism. The rationale for U.S. foreign aid has historically been focused on security concerns, anti-communism, anti-terrorism, humanitarian efforts, promoting exports, reducing illegal immigration, and narcotics flow. Policy makers may consider tying aid to the political and economic performance of recipients in any redesign of foreign aid policy. Critics argue that tying aid to the political and economic performance of recipients may neglect countries in dire need of assistance. Some suggest U.S. aid should prioritize poverty alleviation regardless of recipient government nature, as aid to repressive regimes may perpetuate exploitation. However, there is a moral obligation to help those in need, even if they are victims of repressive regimes. The debate on U.S. assistance focuses on whether aid should prioritize countries with the best chance of development or those in dire need, regardless of their government's nature. Some argue for a humanitarian approach to development separate from diplomacy, while others believe aid should align with strategic foreign policy objectives. The latest reform effort began in January 2006 under the Secretary of State. The latest reform effort in foreign aid began in January 2006 under the Secretary of State, focusing on coordinating aid programs to align with strategic foreign policy objectives. This included creating a new position, Director of Foreign Assistance (DFA), and a new Bureau of Foreign Assistance (F) to oversee assistance programs managed by the State Department and USAID. The DFA, who also serves as Administrator of USAID, provides guidance for foreign assistance delivered through other government agencies. The DFA has limited input on aid from other agencies, with no statutory authority. In 2006, a new Strategic Framework for Foreign Assistance was presented, categorizing countries based on development challenges. Rebuilding, transforming, developing, and sustaining partnership countries are identified for aid programs aligned with U.S. strategic objectives. The Strategic Framework for Foreign Assistance categorizes countries based on development challenges. Countries are classified into Rebuilding, Transforming, Developing, Sustaining Partnership, Restrictive, and Global/Regional programs. Each category represents common development challenges and is linked to strategic objectives such as peace, security, and economic growth. Graduation from one category to another and eventually from aid entirely is expected. The Strategic Framework for Foreign Assistance categorizes countries based on development challenges, with objectives including peace, security, economic growth, and humanitarian assistance. Reception to the Framework is mixed, with some praising it as a step towards coherence in assistance programs but others noting concerns about USAID's technical expertise and operating budgets. The DFA's new Framework for Foreign Assistance has received mixed reviews, with critics arguing that without authority over all U.S. assistance programs, coordination issues will persist. In 2006, DFA programs accounted for 58% of U.S. aid, but there are concerns about the exclusion of certain programs like PEPFAR. International forums have emphasized the needs of developing countries and the role of wealthy nations in addressing them. International events like the G-8 summits and meetings on development have led to increased aid pledges, raising questions about appropriate assistance levels for sustainable development. Goals range from the ambitious U.N. Millennium Development Goals to doubling aid to Africa by 2010. The U.N. Millennium Project set eight development goals to be partially achieved by 2015, requiring global aid levels to reach $195 billion by then, more than double the 2004 levels of $79 billion. The United Nations has a goal for donor countries to provide 0.7% of national income as foreign aid, but as of 2006, only five countries had reached that goal. Advocates call for the United States to increase aid to reach specific goals, while critics believe large increases are unnecessary. The United Nations has a goal for donor countries to provide 0.7% of national income as foreign aid. The United States has not committed to this target, with aid levels at 0.17% in 2006. The European Union aims to reach 0.7% by 2015. Historically, U.S. foreign aid as a percentage of national income has been higher. The historical trend of U.S. foreign aid as a percentage of national income shows varying levels over the decades, with the 0.7% target not firmly established. A U.S. foreign aid budget at 0.7% of GNI in 2008 would total $98 billion, a significant increase from previous levels. Current U.S. foreign aid in FY2008 comprises 1.2% of the budget, a decrease from previous decades. Advocates propose increasing foreign aid spending by an additional one percent of total budget authority. The proposed increase in foreign aid spending by an additional one percent of the total budget authority would amount to approximately 2.2%. This would result in an additional $29 billion for a total foreign aid budget of $53 billion, nearly doubling assistance. Critics argue that the measurement of foreign aid excludes certain U.S. government and private sector activities, such as State Department's Foreign Military Financing and International Military Education and Training. Critics argue that foreign aid measurements exclude certain U.S. government and private sector activities, such as State Department's Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and International Military Education and Training (IMET). Funding for FMF and IMET programs alone has totaled roughly $4.6 billion in each of the last three fiscal years. Other critics point out that ODA data also exclude private giving, with charitable contributions totaling $8.6 billion in 2005. The Hudson Institute's Index of Global Philanthropy estimates that contributions from individuals and organizations amounted to $33.5 billion in 2005, not including remittances. If included, U.S. aid levels would reach 0.98% of GNI. Some observers question the inclusion of private assistance in U.S. aid levels, as it can fluctuate and occur in more advanced economies. There is disagreement within the development community on the impact of remittances. Critics argue that the U.S. aid should not be measured in terms of GNI or annual budgets, as the U.S. is the largest provider of foreign assistance in monetary terms. They believe that many developing countries lack the capacity to absorb large amounts of aid. Some USAID missions are concerned about the ability of health care systems in PEPFAR countries to handle the increasing HIV/AIDS funds. Large aid increases may lead to recipient country dependency, contradicting the goal of countries eventually graduating from assistance. U.S. aid agencies should focus on quality programs that encourage countries to promote their own development. Foreign aid reform and reorganization has been a topic of discussion for a long time, with the creation of USAID in the Kennedy Administration aimed at coordinating aid programs. Various studies have been conducted to improve the organization of foreign aid for increased effectiveness and to support U.S. interests. Congress has three policy options to consider, including maintaining the status quo. One policy option is to maintain the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 but amend it to address 21st-century challenges. Another option is to reorganize the aid infrastructure, potentially rewriting the Act. Structural reform options include elevating USAID to a cabinet-level department, merging it with the State Department, creating a new aid agency, or improving interagency coordination. Some reform proponents suggest refocusing donor countries' aid programs on specific sectors, regions, or objectives. Sweden plans to reduce recipient countries from 70 to 33 while maintaining funding levels, focusing on long-term development, conflict/post-conflict situations, and eastern European countries for cooperation. France's new government aims to link aid to good governance practices in recipient nations, streamlining programs with clear priorities. A refocused U.S. aid program could identify limited objectives, potentially reducing aid activities that do not align with chosen focus. This approach could lead to a scaling back of aid in countries not supporting the chosen objectives. The U.S. aid program could refocus by linking assistance to strategic objectives, similar to the 2006 Strategic Framework for Foreign Assistance. The Department of Defense's role in foreign aid has increased, with activities including humanitarian assistance, disaster response training, and capacity building for foreign militaries. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) manages much of the assistance in foreign aid. The increased role of the Department of Defense (DOD) in foreign assistance has been debated, with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates emphasizing the need to strengthen civilian development agencies. Advocates argue that DOD is well-positioned to provide timely assistance in conflict and post-conflict situations, natural disasters, and has more flexibility in allocation. Critics warn that the increased DOD profile may result in a loss of expertise at USAID and State. Critics are concerned that the increased role of the Department of Defense in foreign aid may lead to a diminution of expertise at USAID and State. They argue that DOD is supplanting the traditional roles of civilian agencies and may lack coordination necessary for achieving foreign policy objectives. Some suggest involving the Secretary of State in decision-making to address these concerns. Others believe DOD programs could be duplicative and are better suited for civilian agencies. Many feel that aid programs detract from DOD's military focus, and any redesign of foreign aid programs should consider the Defense Department's role. The United States provides foreign aid through various channels, including bilateral assistance and contributions to international organizations and multilateral banks. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency's role in foreign aid could be restructured by making it a co-managed entity between the Department of Defense and the Department of State, moving it to a new aid agency, or placing it under an interagency coordinating mechanism. The U.S. has contributed an average of less than 8% of funds for development activities since FY2000. The United States has contributed an average of less than 8% of funds for development activities since FY2000. The ratio of multilateral aid to total foreign aid has decreased since 2003 due to an increase in bilateral assistance. There have been disagreements between the Administration and Congress on the use of multilateral institutions, such as funding levels for the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Proponents argue that multilateral institutions are better suited for development activities due to pooling resources, funding large projects, and having better credibility in recipient countries. They also suggest that multilateral assistance offers greater flexibility without as many statutory restrictions. Critics, however, question the effectiveness of multilateral institutions. Critics of multilateral institutions argue that they lack accountability and transparency in fund allocation and policy decisions, potentially leading to U.S. funds supporting governments at odds with U.S. policies. Some believe increased use of multilateral institutions may result in less recognition for U.S. foreign aid contributions. International affairs spending (Function 150) is appropriated through the State Department bill, while defense spending (Function 050) is largely through the Defense budget. Critics argue that U.S. foreign aid lacks coordination and transparency, with funds for various sectors like health, education, and environment coming from different agencies. There are proposals to unify foreign assistance spending under Function 150 for better oversight. One proposal is to include all foreign assistance spending in Function 150 with the budgeting process coordinated by the lead aid agency. The budget request would be unified and presented by the head of the aid agency, providing Congress with a fuller picture of foreign aid programs. Critics argue that reorganizing budget functions would be time-consuming. One option is to combine Functions 050 and 150 into a national security budget to coordinate programs and funding levels among agencies. Proponents believe this would increase transparency and reduce duplication. Critics argue that including foreign assistance in a national security budget would present the wrong image for USAID as an independent civilian agency. The proposal aims to create a cabinet-level department for foreign assistance to elevate its importance in national security. This move is inspired by other donor countries like the UK, which have integrated aid agencies with foreign and defense ministries. A Secretary for Development would coordinate aid programs government-wide and emphasize global development. Some critics oppose the idea of creating a cabinet-level department for foreign assistance, arguing that other important agencies are not in the cabinet and that USAID should remain under the foreign policy direction of the Secretary of State. They also believe that even as a cabinet agency, USAID would not be as powerful as the Departments of State and Defense. Additionally, USAID controls only 20% of foreign assistance, with the rest managed by the State Department and other independent aid agencies. The proposal does not provide for better government-wide coordination, as USAID currently takes foreign policy guidance from the Secretary of State. In 1998, USAID took foreign policy guidance from the Secretary of State, leading to concerns about its subordinate status within the State Department. Some viewed this as a stealth merger, following a failed attempt to merge USAID into the State Department in 1998. Proponents argued that better coordination could not be achieved with USAID as an independent agency, citing conflicting agendas and duplicative functions between the two entities. They believed that having foreign assistance managed by the State Department would align programs more closely with national priorities. Proponents argue that having foreign assistance managed by the State Department would lead to better resource utilization. The State Department's aid budget already surpasses that of USAID, controlling 64% of foreign operations appropriations for FY2007. Supporters believe that placing the Secretary of State in charge of foreign assistance would enhance its visibility and improve program coordination across agencies. Merger proposals suggest elevating the official in charge of aid at the State Department and merging the two foreign services for better integration. Opponents maintain that the State Department and USAID have different missions, with the former focusing on short-term crisis resolution through diplomacy and the latter on long-term development. Critics argue that merging USAID into the State Department may diminish aid policy within the State Department, as it lacks interest and expertise in managing aid programs. A recent GAO report confirmed this view. Critics also point out that a merger does not address the coordination of aid programs government-wide effectively. Another suggestion is to create a separate aid agency to oversee all U.S. foreign assistance, including that provided by the State Department and domestic agencies. A new agency is proposed to oversee all U.S. foreign assistance, including programs from USAID, State Department, and other agencies. It would encompass various aid programs and have bureaus for different functions like humanitarian assistance, development, health, security, trade, and innovative programs. Moving domestic agency programs into this new entity may be politically challenging. A proposal suggests creating a new agency to oversee all U.S. foreign assistance programs, including those from USAID and the State Department. The agency would have liaison offices for coordination, program formation, and monitoring effectiveness. Critics argue it may create a large bureaucracy. The proposal to create a new agency for overseeing U.S. foreign assistance programs is criticized for potentially creating a large bureaucracy without a clear strategy. Some argue that independent agencies with specific missions could be downgraded in a larger organization. Previous attempts at interagency coordination have been unsuccessful. The need for coordination in U.S. foreign assistance programs is evident due to the lack of joint policy development among agencies and departments administering aid. The fragmented nature of aid programs leaves them vulnerable to working at cross-purposes. Various interagency coordinating mechanisms exist, but previous attempts have been unsuccessful. The creation of new independent agencies with specific mandates, such as the Millennium Challenge Corporation in 2004, highlights the ongoing challenges in coordinating U.S. aid programs. The U.S. report to the OECD in 2004 highlighted the contributions of 28 government entities providing aid in 2006. Excluding the Department of State and USAID, these entities accounted for 42% of ODA. The DAC report listed various departments and agencies involved in aid, including Agriculture, Defense, Commerce, Energy, Health and Human Services, Interior, Justice, Labor, Treasury, CDC, NIST, PTO, NOAA, USFWS, USFS, and independent agencies like the Millennium Challenge Corporation and Peace Corps. The U.S. report to the OECD in 2004 highlighted the contributions of 28 government entities providing aid in 2006, excluding the Department of State and USAID. These entities accounted for 42% of ODA. The DAC report listed various departments and agencies involved in aid, including Agriculture, Defense, Commerce, Energy, Health and Human Services, Interior, Justice, Labor, Treasury, CDC, NIST, PTO, NOAA, USFWS, USFS, and independent agencies like the Millennium Challenge Corporation and Peace Corps. Other agencies involved in aid include the Environmental Protection Agency, African Development Foundation, Inter-American Development Foundation, Trade and Development Agency, Export-Import Bank, Overseas Private Investment Corporation, U.S. Institute of Peace, and National Science Foundation. Military assistance programs are not included in ODA, and there are options available to improve interagency coordination. Policy makers have various options to enhance interagency coordination, such as maintaining the current foreign aid structure with modifications, establishing a coordinating entity, or elevating USAID within the National Security Council. The Development Coordination Committee (DCC) and International Development Cooperation Agency (IDCA) are examples of past coordination efforts, but the DCC faced challenges and was eventually revoked in 1999 due to a lack of White House commitment. The International Development Cooperation Agency (IDCA) was created in 1979 by President Carter to coordinate government foreign assistance programs, but it was considered weak and understaffed. The agency ceased to function in the Reagan Administration due to a lack of White House commitment. Any new coordinating entity would require strong leadership with authority to coordinate across department jurisdictions and foreign aid budgets. The National Security Council (NSC) was established in 1947 to coordinate national security and foreign policy issues among government agencies. Members include the President, Vice President, Secretary of State, and Secretary of Defense. USAID participates through the Policy Coordination Committee (PCC) at the NSC. The proposal to elevate a U.S. aid agency within the NSC structure is based on the importance of global development in national security strategy. Past attempts failed due to lack of interest from the White House and USAID's low rank. Ways to raise development's status within NSC include statutory designation by Congress. Congress could elevate a U.S. aid agency within the NSC structure by designating its head or an aid coordinator to participate in national security debates. Creating a committee on foreign assistance within the NSC could improve aid policy coordination, although some policymakers are concerned about adding bureaucracy. Coordination currently occurs at the field level among agencies at U.S. embassies. At the policy planning level, interagency coordination has improved among Defense, State, and USAID, with combatant commands integrating civilian agencies for better aid coordination. Africom plans to have a senior State Department officer as deputy for civil-military activities. State Department and USAID have created offices to manage the relationship as DOD increases aid provision. Other agencies' aid levels are small compared to USAID, State, and DOD combined, which accounted for 76% of ODA in 2006. The debate on foreign aid reform includes the possibility of expanding the DFA's mandate to cover all U.S. foreign assistance. There is a question of whether to replace the current law governing aid programs, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The act has not been fully reauthorized since 1985, with Congress enacting single-issue foreign aid legislation instead. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 has been amended with single-issue foreign aid legislation, including assistance to the former Soviet Union, eastern Europe, and new funding platforms like PEPFAR and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. Supporters argue for a comprehensive rewrite, stating the current law is outdated and lacks policy direction for 21st-century foreign assistance. The Act contains numerous objectives, priorities, and directives without clear prioritization, leading to program restrictions and outdated requirements. Some argue for a comprehensive rewrite of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 due to outdated and conflicting program restrictions, conditions, and reporting requirements. Others believe that political challenges may hinder needed aid reforms and suggest focusing on policy development and coordination of existing programs. The existing statutory framework allows for ambitious reforms in foreign aid programs, with the creation of a new assistance entity. Various studies have been conducted to improve aid effectiveness and coordination, resulting in recommendations from three organizations on budget, structure, and policy options. The HELP Commission was established by the HELP Commission Act to study and report on U.S. foreign development assistance programs. It began operations in 2005 and issued its report, Beyond Assistance, in December 2007. The Commission had 21 members appointed by various government officials and was tasked with identifying past and present foreign aid programs. The HELP Commission, established by the HELP Commission Act, analyzed U.S. development assistance programs to achieve foreign policy objectives. It recommended recognizing the link between security and development, updating the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, and promoting vibrant private sectors. The HELP Commission recommended updating the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to reflect current world conditions and promote vibrant private sectors. This includes increasing technical assistance and funding for small and medium businesses, improving agricultural productivity in developing countries, increasing local purchase of food aid, forming partnerships with local entities, and aligning trade and development policies. Suggestions include duty-free provisions for MCC-eligible countries and establishing a Quadrennial Development and Humanitarian strategy.

Suggestions include duty-free provisions for MCC-eligible countries and establishing a Quadrennial Development and Humanitarian strategy. The report proposes creating a new combined USAID and Department of State called the International Affairs Department with four sub-cabinet agencies to ensure coordinated functions. Establish an entity similar to DARPA for research and development to benefit developing countries, coordinate aid policy within the National Security Council, strengthen the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization, propose a Civilian Response Corps, recommend budget increases for foreign assistance, create a unified national security budget with a portion allocated for international affairs activities. Increase funding for international affairs activities, including doubling current foreign aid levels by allocating 10% of the budget. Enhance monitoring, evaluation, human resources, and procurement capabilities. Establish a permanent Humanitarian Crisis Response Facility and Transitional Security Crisis Fund. Clarify DOD's role in development assistance. Senate Foreign Relations Committee issued reports on U.S. foreign assistance programs. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee issued reports on U.S. foreign assistance programs, focusing on the Department of Defense's role and the implementation of the Strategic Framework for Foreign Assistance. Recommendations include integrating national security and humanitarian needs, expediting ambassadorial nominations and funding decisions, overhauling the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, and implementing a two-year reauthorization schedule. The Senate report recommends overhauling the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to implement a two-year reauthorization schedule, give ambassadors more decision-making authority over military-related assistance programs, and separate the DFA and USAID Administrator's positions. The Secretary of State should have enhanced authority over aid programs to ensure they align with U.S. foreign policy interests, provide strategic direction, transparency, and accountability. The F process should be redesigned for clearer decision-making, and the DFA should have authority to prepare a unified aid budget and referee funding disputes. The Senate report recommends overhauling the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to implement a two-year reauthorization schedule, give ambassadors more decision-making authority over military-related assistance programs, and separate the DFA and USAID Administrator's positions. It also suggests creating a unified aid budget managed by the DFA, strengthening USAID's expertise, and increasing resources for aid programs and USAID operations. Additionally, it proposes training Ambassadors and Deputy Chiefs of Mission in foreign assistance. The CSIS Commission on Smart Power, chaired by Richard L. Armitage and Joseph S. Nye Jr., issued a report in November 2007 advocating for the integration of hard power and soft power to achieve \"smart power.\" Recommendations include strengthening USAID's resources, improving executive-legislative relations, and preventing aid program migration to the Department of Defense. The CSIS report recommends a more engaged U.S. foreign policy that includes all aspects of international relations, emphasizes the inter-relation between security and development, and suggests greater investments in multilateral institutions like the United Nations, World Bank, and IMF. It also proposes using U.N. vehicles for peacekeeping, counter-terrorism, global health, and energy and climate issues, strengthening the G-8 summit process, and collaborating with local civil society and the private sector for more efficient aid delivery systems. The report does not endorse a cabinet-level agency but recommends giving it a cabinet-level voice. The CSIS report recommends elevating development within the U.S. government by creating a cabinet-level voice on global development, unifying government assistance programs, establishing a U.S. Global Health Corporation, and improving inter-agency coordination. It also suggests creating a smart power deputy under the national security advisor and increasing funding for foreign assistance programs. Many organizations and think tanks are working on studies to offer viable options to the new Administration and Congress for increasing the size and effectiveness of development and humanitarian budgets. There is support for increased resources and visibility for assistance programs, but there is disagreement on the need for a new structure and what it would entail."
