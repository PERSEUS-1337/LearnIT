Congress finds that the Weyerhaeuser Company has proposed an exchange of lands with the United States Government, involving approximately 50,000 acres of Federal land in Arkansas and Oklahoma for about 165,000 acres of forested wetlands and other forest land owned by Weyerhaeuser in the same states. The United States will acquire Arkansas Cossatot lands, Arkansas Ouachita lands, and Oklahoma lands from Weyerhaeuser Company, removing critical wetland ecosystems from timber production and enhancing ecosystem management of National Forest System lands. The United States will convey mineral and oil/gas interests to Weyerhaeuser on designated surface acres in the exchange, ensuring private use of the lands will not conflict with adjacent Federal lands' management objectives. In an exchange agreement, Weyerhaeuser will transfer all mineral and oil/gas interests on designated surface acres to the United States. Both parties have agreed on the values and boundaries of the lands and interests to be exchanged, ensuring approximate equality in value. The exchange agreement between Weyerhaeuser and the United States involves transferring lands, mineral interests, and oil/gas interests for environmental, recreational, and economic benefits to Arkansas, Oklahoma, and the United States. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"land\" refers to the surface estate and other interests excluding mineral and oil and gas interests. \"Mineral interests\" include geothermal steam, metals, ores, and minerals except oil and gas. \"Oil and gas interests\" encompass all oil, gas, carbon dioxide, helium, and gas from coal seams, with rights for exploration and drilling on lands. The term \"Secretaries\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture. The term \"Weyerhaeuser\" refers to Weyerhaeuser Company, incorporated in Washington state. SEC. 3. EXCHANGE. The Secretary of Agriculture will convey approximately 20,000 acres of Federal lands and mineral interests in Arkansas and 30,000 acres in Oklahoma to Weyerhaeuser within 120 days of the enactment of the Act, subject to valid existing rights. Weyerhaeuser must offer deeds of title for the exchange to proceed. Weyerhaeuser offers deeds of title conveying approximately 110,000 acres of lands and mineral interests in Oklahoma and 30,000 acres in Arkansas to the United States, subject to limitations and reservations. Approximately 25,000 acres of Weyerhaeuser lands and mineral interests in Arkansas are proposed for transfer to the United States as part of the Arkansas-Oklahoma Land Exchange. Additionally, there is a provision for the exchange of oil and gas interests as part of the overall land exchange process. The Secretary of Agriculture will exchange Federal oil and gas interests for equivalent interests owned by Weyerhaeuser to address acreage imbalances. This exchange can bypass state limitations under the Federal Lands Policy and Management Act of 1976. The text chunk discusses the reservation of oil and gas interests by Weyerhaeuser until December 31, 2041, and beyond if production continues. After 2042, a reduced overriding royalty interest is reserved by Weyerhaeuser in adjacent governmental sections. The text chunk outlines that the overriding royalty will persist until the producing well stops production or all federally leased wells cease production. General provisions include equal valuation of exchanged lands and the importance of maps for accuracy. The text outlines the exchange of lands, mineral interests, and oil/gas interests, with maps controlling the depiction of such interests. Final maps must be transmitted within 180 days after the exchange, accurately depicting the conveyed lands and mineral interests. The text outlines the exchange of lands, mineral interests, and oil/gas interests, with final maps required to accurately depict the conveyed interests. If Weyerhaeuser cancels the exchange before completion, the interests will revert to their pre-Act status and be managed accordingly. The lands, mineral interests, and oil/gas interests for conveyance to Weyerhaeuser are withdrawn from public land laws and leasing laws upon enactment of the Act. The withdrawal will end 45 days after the exchange completion or if Weyerhaeuser decides not to proceed. The United States designates and determines the use of acquired lands. The Secretary of Agriculture will administer 140,000 acres of land in the National Forest System. Within 36 months, land and resource management plans will be amended. The 25,000 acres of Cossatot lands will be managed by the Secretary of the Interior as part of the Cossatot National Wildlife Refuge. A management plan will be prepared within 24 months to recognize nonconsumptive activities and wildlife-related public use. The management plan for the Cossatot National Wildlife Refuge will allow recreational activities like hunting, fishing, and trapping, while ensuring compatibility with wildlife management laws. The Secretary of the Interior will consult with the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission in preparing regulations. During the transition period after the land exchange, the Secretary of the Interior will manage the new lands in Cossatot National Wildlife Refuge according to wildlife refuge laws. Hunting seasons will align with State regulations. SEC. 5. OUACHITA NATIONAL FOREST BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT. Upon acceptance of title by the Secretary of Agriculture, the boundaries of the Ouachita National Forest will be adjusted to encompass lands conveyed to the United States. The Secretary shall prepare a boundary description of the lands depicted on the maps within 180 days of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Agriculture will prepare a boundary description of lands depicted on maps referenced in section 3(a)(2) (A) and (B), with the same legal effect as if included in the Act, allowing for correction of errors."
