The Manhattan Project was a top-secret program during WWII to create an atomic bomb before Nazi Germany. Experts recommended establishing nationally significant sites associated with the project for preservation and public interpretation. The Manhattan Project National Historical Park Study Act directed the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study of historically significant sites associated with the Manhattan Project. The National Park Service study found that including these sites in the national park system would enhance protection, preservation, and public understanding of this significant story in American history. The Department of the Interior, with the Department of Energy's approval, recommended creating a Manhattan Project National Historical Park at Oak Ridge, Los Alamos, and Hanford. This designation would improve preservation, interpretation, and access to the historically significant resources related to the Manhattan Project for future generations to understand its complex legacy. The Manhattan Project has a significant, far-reaching, and complex legacy. The purposes of this Act are to preserve and protect the historically significant resources associated with the Manhattan Project, improve public understanding of its legacy, enhance public access to the Historical Park, and assist in preservation efforts. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"Historical Park\" as the Manhattan Project National Historical Park, \"Manhattan Project\" as the program to develop an atomic bomb until December 31, 1946, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior. The Manhattan Project National Historical Park was established as a unit of the National Park System within a year of the Act's enactment. The park includes specific facilities and areas determined by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, such as the B Reactor National Historic Landmark. Eligible areas for the park are outlined, including Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Facilities and land in various locations including Buildings 9204-3 and 9731 at the Y-12 National Security Complex, the X-10 Graphite Reactor at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the K-25 Building site at the East Tennessee Technology Park, and the former Guest House at 210 East Madison Road. In Los Alamos, New Mexico, facilities in the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory National Historic Landmark District are included. In Los Alamos, facilities include the former East Cafeteria and dormitory. In Hanford, Washington, sites include the B Reactor National Historic Landmark, Hanford High School, White Bluffs Bank building, warehouse at Bruggemann's Agricultural Complex, Hanford Irrigation District Pump House, and T Plant (221-T Process Building). The T Plant (221-T Process Building) can be included in the Historical Park only with the owner's written consent. SEC. 6. AGREEMENT. The Secretary and the Secretary of Energy will enter into an agreement within a year to govern their roles in administering facilities for the Historical Park, including provisions for public access, management, interpretation, and preservation of historic sites related to the Manhattan Project. The Secretary will have decision-making authority for historic interpretation. The agreement between the Secretary and the Secretary of Energy for administering facilities for the Historical Park will ensure an advisory role for the National Park Service in preserving historic resources. The Secretary of Energy will be responsible for protecting public safety, national security, and the ongoing mission of the Department of Energy at specific sites, consulting on the Manhattan Project, and environmental remediation as needed. The agreement between the Secretary and the Secretary of Energy for administering facilities for the Historical Park includes retaining authority for historic preservation and maintenance. Amendments can be made to add facilities or land within eligible areas under the Secretary of Energy's jurisdiction. SEC. 7. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. The Secretary must consult with relevant officials and the public before executing agreements or developing management plans. Within 30 days of an agreement, the Secretary must publish a notice in the Federal Register establishing the Historical Park with an official boundary map available for public inspection.

Additionally, interpretive tours of Manhattan Project sites in Tennessee, New Mexico, and Washington can be provided by the Secretary. The Secretary may enter agreements with Federal agencies for public access to Manhattan Project resources. Donations and cooperative agreements with various entities can further the purpose of these agreements. The Secretary may provide technical assistance for the management and preservation of historically significant Manhattan Project resources. The Secretary of Energy may accept gifts and donations for the purpose of preserving these resources. SEC. 9. CLARIFICATION.
