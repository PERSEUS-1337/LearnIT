Upon receipt of an agreement related to Iran's nuclear program, Congress must reconvene within two days. The Speaker notifies the House of Representatives, and the Senate convenes after consultation with leaders. During the 15-calendar day period after receiving the agreement, a joint resolution of disapproval can be introduced in the House of Representatives by the Speaker or minority leader, and in the Senate by the majority leader or minority leader. Resolutions introduced in the Senate go to the Committee on Foreign Relations, while those in the House go to the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
