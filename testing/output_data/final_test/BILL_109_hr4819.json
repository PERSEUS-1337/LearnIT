    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a concise summary of the section's title and its purpose. The \"PAC Elimination Act\" aims to address public confidence issues in Congress by highlighting concerns about enrichment, influence, and lack of ties to constituents by political action committees. Campaign finance reform is crucial as PAC contributions mainly benefit powerful incumbents in Congress, creating a political class that is disconnected from average Americans. Without appropriate action, Congress risks becoming a body where everyday citizens are poorly represented. SEC. 2. BAN ON ACTIVITIES OF POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEES IN FEDERAL ELECTIONS. This section introduces a ban on political action committees in federal elections under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. Sec. 325 prohibits contributions, solicitations, and expenditures by entities other than individuals or political committees to influence federal elections. The definition of a political committee is revised to include candidate campaign committees, party committees, and local committees meeting specific criteria. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 prohibits contributions and expenditures exceeding certain limits during a calendar year. Joint fundraising committees are also subject to these regulations. If the contribution limitation is not in effect, the amendments made by the Act will not apply. The contribution limitation under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 will not be in effect, and the limitation amount for joint fundraising committees will be $1,000. SEC. 3. ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON CONTRIBUTIONS BY POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEES. Amendment to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 limits the aggregate amount of contributions made by multicandidate committees to any candidate. Candidates must return excess contributions received from multicandidate political committees. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 limits contributions from multicandidate committees to candidates to $500,000 every two years. Candidates must return any excess contributions received. SEC. 4. REQUIRING NOT LESS THAN 80 PERCENT OF CANDIDATE FUNDS TO COME FROM IN-STATE INDIVIDUALS. An amendment to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 mandates that at least 80 percent of a candidate's contributions must come from in-state individuals. This applies to candidates for various offices at the state and federal levels. SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE. The amendments made by this Act will be effective for elections after December 2006."
