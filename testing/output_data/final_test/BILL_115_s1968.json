    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Code Like a Girl Act\". The Congress finds that growth in the STEM workforce is dominated by new computing jobs, with nearly 2/3 of new STEM occupations being in computing. There is a need to ensure women are equally represented in the computer science workforce, as in 2016, women held only 26 percent of computing-related occupations despite making up more than 51 percent of all professional occupations in the United States. The gender disparity in computer science is evident at all levels of education, with only 23 percent of AP. Gender disparities in computer science are evident at all levels of education. In 2016, only 23 percent of AP Computer Science exam takers were female. The number of computer science degrees awarded to women has declined, from 29 percent in 1995 to 18 percent in 2014. A study funded by the National Science Foundation in 2010 found that both women and men scientists became interested in science before middle school, with women more likely to credit teachers for sparking their interest. Studies show that girls as young as 6 believe that brilliance is a male trait. Research shows that girls as young as 6 develop the belief that brilliance is a male trait, leading to a loss of interest in activities perceived as requiring brilliance. Implicit biases held by teachers negatively impact girls' academic achievement in math and science, affecting their future enrollment in advanced courses. Limited attention is given to expanding research funding opportunities exclusively focused on girls in early childhood education. Interventions with girls at an early age can reduce the negative impact of gendered stereotypes. Positive experiences with robotics and computing increase interest and self-confidence in girls, even after adopting gender stereotypes about computing. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as Director, institution of higher education, local educational agency, STEM, and young girls. SEC. 4. RESEARCH GRANTS. The Director will award grants to institutions, agencies, or organizations to research factors influencing young girls' participation in STEM activities, including teacher training, bias in the classroom, and incentives for teachers. The Director will award grants to research factors influencing young girls' participation in STEM activities, including perceptions, learning environment, parental influence, types of activities, and other relevant factors. The grant recipient must report to the Director on activities and materials developed using grant funds. SEC. 5. DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF SCALABLE MODELS FOR INCREASED ENGAGEMENT. The Director awards grants to institutions or organizations to develop interventions in pre-K and elementary classrooms to increase girls' participation in computer science. Partnerships with local educational agencies are required. Funds are used for training and professional development. The Director awards grants for programs to strengthen teachers' capabilities, promote gender-inclusive practices in computing education, develop distance learning resources, and train master teachers. The curr_chunk focuses on reform and adoption of gender-inclusive practices in teaching computer science concepts in early childhood education. It includes developing tools to evaluate activities, adapting curricular materials, offering enrichment programs, providing mentors for girls, and educating parents about the difficulties faced by girls in maintaining interest in computer science. The curr_chunk discusses the grant recipient's reporting requirements and the evaluation process for the gender-inclusive practices in teaching computer science. The Director requires reports on activities and materials developed using grant funds, and evaluations are to be conducted every 3 years using common benchmarks and assessment tools. The Director mandates the use of common benchmarks and assessment tools to identify best practices and materials developed by partnerships. Evaluation results are to be publicly available online and submitted to Congress. Effective materials developed under the grant program must be disseminated. The Director convenes an annual meeting for partnerships funded by grants to promote national collaboration. Technical assistance is provided to partnerships upon request to meet grant requirements. The Director must submit an annual report to Congress on grant programs established by sections 4 and 5. Additionally, a report on program expansion must be submitted to Congress within 4 years of the first grant award, including recommendations based on grant recipient reports."
