The EPA is developing regulations to control GHG emissions, proposing standards for CO2 emissions from new fossil fuel-burning units. The use of carbon capture and storage is suggested for compliance, as higher efficiency alone may not meet the new plant standards. EPA's proposed standards focus on new sources like power plants. The EPA's proposed standards for controlling GHG emissions do not apply to existing power plants, focusing instead on new sources like power plants. Options for reducing GHGs are being considered, with potential state or plant-specific targets. Increasing coal-fired power plant efficiency could lead to significant CO2 emission reductions, but modifications must also reduce pollutant emissions to avoid triggering new source review requirements. Expenditures for efficiency improvements would likely be assessed. Expenditures to increase efficiency in power plants would be evaluated based on cost vs. benefits, considering factors like fuel type and plant condition. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies are not currently viable for existing coal-fired power plants. The focus is on efficiency improvements to reduce CO2 emissions, through retrofits and modifications to facility operations. Some in Congress are concerned about the impact on electricity reliability and fuel diversity from plant retirements. Coal has historically been the dominant fuel for electricity generation in the United States, accounting for about 38% of power generation in 2012. Efforts to increase efficiency in coal plants could help address concerns about electricity reliability and fuel diversity amidst pending environmental regulations. Accelerating efficiency improvements through a focused program may be beneficial. Coal's low-priced, high energy content enabled the building of power plants for steam-electric production. In a steam power plant, coal is burned to produce heat for turning water into steam, which then drives a turbine generator to produce electricity. The U.S. coal-powered generation fleet in 2012 consisted of 1,337 units with a capacity of almost 313 GW. Coal is mainly composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, with varying amounts of sulfur, ash, and moisture. Bituminous and subbituminous coal dominate electric power generation in the U.S. Bituminous coal is the most abundant type used for electricity generation in the United States, with a carbon content of 45% to 86% and a heat value of 10,500 to 15,500 BTUs per pound. Subbituminous coal, found mainly in six western states and Alaska, has a carbon content of 35% to 45% and a heat value of 8,300 to 13,000 BTUs. Lignite, with the lowest carbon content of 25% to 35%, has a heat value of 4,000 to 8,300 BTUs. Anthracite, with the highest carbon content of 86% to 98%, has a heat value of about 15,000 BTUs. Anthracite coal, primarily found in Pennsylvania, emits the largest amount of CO2 per million BTUs when burned in coal-fired power plants. The combustion of coal releases CO2 emissions, water, and other byproducts. To reduce CO2 emissions, burning a better grade of coal or increasing power plant efficiency can be effective. Steam turbines are essential components of coal-fired power plants, where coal is crushed and burned in a boiler to heat water into steam. The steam then powers a turbine connected to a generator, producing electricity. The process involves a Rankine Cycle, with steam returning to the boiler after passing through the turbine. Fuel switching may be necessary for greater CO2 emissions reduction without completely repowering the plant. The Rankine Cycle is the basis for most electric power generation in the United States, with coal being pulverized and burned in a boiler to produce steam. Steam pressure and temperature are crucial, with advancements leading to ultra-super critical units. Subcritical units boil water first before converting it to superheated steam, while supercritical units heat water directly to produce steam. Ultra-supercritical steam (USC) generation is the most efficient technology for producing electricity fueled by pulverized coal. Operating at supercritical pressure and advanced steam temperatures, USC units increase efficiency, reduce fuel consumption, emissions, solid waste, water use, and operating costs. Coal-fired power plants in the United States use various technologies to burn coal, including cyclone-fired boilers and fluidized bed combustion. Coal-fired power plants in the United States use different technologies to burn coal, such as cyclone-fired boilers, fluidized bed combustion, and integrated coal gasification/combined cycle technologies. The majority of U.S. coal-fired power plants are over 30 years old, with a typical service life of 35 to 50 years. The efficiency of these plants decreases with age, contrasting with the younger wind power and natural gas-fired capacity additions. Most coal-fired capacity was built between 1950 and 1990, while newer technologies have mostly been added in the last decade. As power plants age, their performance and efficiency decline, requiring substantial maintenance to operate efficiently. Older power plants may be upgraded or retired, with operations and maintenance costs becoming a major expense. Fuel costs are a significant component of these ongoing expenses. The costs of modernizing older power plants to meet new regulatory requirements can be high, leading to decisions on whether to retire or upgrade. Improving efficiency can reduce CO2 emissions and operational expenses, especially for older coal power plants facing retirement decisions. The efficiency of a power plant can be measured by its heat rate and thermal efficiency. Heat rate is the amount of fuel energy input needed to produce electrical energy output, while thermal efficiency is the percentage of energy output compared to the energy input. Lower heat rates indicate higher efficiency, with coal-fired power plants in 2011 having an average efficiency of 33%. Improving efficiency can reduce operational expenses and CO2 emissions, especially for older coal power plants facing retirement decisions. Improving the efficiency of a generating unit can reduce fuel usage and CO2 emissions. Heat rate improvement is directly related to emission rate reduction due to lower fuel consumption. Variations in heat rates among coal-fired units are influenced by factors like size, age, and technology used. Higher efficiency is linked to more frequent usage and cost-effective operation. The relationship between heat rate and utilization is non-linear. The efficiency of a power plant's boiler is affected by various factors such as heat rate, utilization, and maintenance. Plant managers can improve efficiency by controlling oxygen, temperature, and pressure levels. Deviations in these areas can lead to decreased efficiency. Additionally, maintenance and performance testing are crucial for identifying and preventing losses. Overall, a power plant's heat rate can be influenced by multiple factors and systems. When considering power plant efficiency and emissions, measuring carbon dioxide emissions per unit of energy output is crucial. Each power plant offers a unique opportunity to increase efficiency and reduce emissions. Upgrading to supercritical steam conditions can extend a plant's service life by at least 20 years. Supercritical steam plants have the potential to achieve higher efficiency compared to subcritical plants. Advancing technology from supercritical to ultra-supercritical CFPP could increase efficiency to 46% to 48%, resulting in 18% to 22% less CO2 emissions per MWh generated compared to subcritical PC units. Plant upgrading to supercritical or ultra-supercritical levels is costly and rarely progresses beyond studies. Power plant efficiency depends on unique components within each generating unit, with potential improvements outlined in various U.S. and international studies. Several U.S. and international studies suggest improvements to increase power plant efficiency and reduce GHG emissions, focusing on coal-fired plants. Aging plants lose efficiency due to mechanical wear, leading to heat losses and increased CO2 emissions. Plant efficiency is influenced by operation mode and upgrading to supercritical or ultra-supercritical levels can significantly reduce emissions. In 1999, the APEC region accounted for 59% of global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, with 94% of coal-fired capacity using pulverized coal technologies. Projects to improve combustion, steam cycle, and O&M in CFPPs were found to have low to medium costs and could lead to a 3.5% net overall efficiency improvement. The APWG study in 1999 found that improvements in combustion, steam cycle, and O&M in CFPPs could lead to a 3.5% net overall efficiency improvement. Switching CFPPs to biomass ranked highest for reducing carbon intensity, followed by natural gas. Replacing older power plants with new ones was not practical due to cost, so efficiency and operational improvements were seen as a viable alternative. The NETL study in 2008 identified methods to improve CFPP heat rate efficiency, showing that plant attributes like location and emissions controls did not affect efficiency variations. The top 10% of CFPPs had an efficiency of 37.4%, 5 points higher than the average of 32% in 2007. Improving heat rate efficiency could help reduce CO2 emissions while maintaining electricity generation levels. The 2010 NETL study analyzed U.S. CFPP efficiency, finding that the top 10% of generating units showed potential for fleet improvement. These units had diverse characteristics, including varying capacities, steam pressures, and coal types. Even smaller plants in the top decile demonstrated high efficiency, indicating opportunities for reducing CO2 emissions. The 2010 NETL study found that even small coal-fired power plants can achieve high efficiencies, with the top performing decile showing potential for fleet improvement. By increasing the average efficiency from 32.5% to 36%, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced by 175 MMmt/year or 2.5% of total emissions in 2008. Retirements of low efficiency units and improvements in operation and maintenance are key to reaching this goal. The key to increasing fleet efficiency beyond best-in-class units is through advanced refurbishments. Low pressure subcritical and 0-200 MW subbituminous units had significantly lower efficiencies. Retiring these units and relying on more efficient segments could achieve a fleet efficiency target of 35.6%. Installing scrubbers on 165-250 GW of the fleet could reduce the efficiency target by 0.5 to 1 percentage points. Achieving efficiencies approaching best-in-class will require a combination of efficiency upgrades and scrubber installations. The report suggests improving coal generating unit efficiency through operational practices, maintenance, capital investments, and advanced technologies. Recommendations include verifying efficiency data, estimating upgrade costs, providing unit-specific data for heat rate estimation, and analyzing scenarios of unit retirements, refurbishments, and emission controls. The U.S. EPA's 2010 report confirmed the link between coal plant efficiency and CO2 emissions, emphasizing the importance of using high-rank coal to lower GHG emissions. The type of coal burned, efficiency of the power generation process, and use of air pollution control devices all impact CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants. Switching from low-rank to high-rank coal can reduce GHG emissions from utility stacks. Increasing the thermal efficiency of a coal-fired power plant reduces CO2 and other air emissions by burning less coal per kWh of electricity generated. Higher efficiency in electric generation processes results in lower heat rates and decreased emissions. The EPA acknowledges the relationship between coal-fired EGU efficiency and CO2 emissions but notes that other factors must be considered when evaluating GHG control technologies. The overall efficiency of a coal-fired EGU is influenced by various site-specific factors. The efficiency of an EGU is influenced by factors such as thermodynamic cycle, coal rank and quality, plant size, and pollution control systems. Larger EGUs tend to be more efficient due to lower losses in boiler and steam turbine, but the differences in losses taper off beyond a certain point. EGU efficiency can be affected by pollution control systems, operating practices, cooling systems, and geographic location. Factors such as air pressure at higher elevations can impact combustion efficiency. At higher elevations, air pressure is lower, affecting combustion efficiency. Cooler temperatures can increase EGU efficiency by boosting draft pressure and condenser performance. EGU efficiency is influenced by load generation flexibility, equipment specifications, and plant components. The EPA recognizes that coal-fired power plants may have different efficiencies based on factors like speed drives and heat exchangers. Different utility companies operating identical plants in different locations may not see the same efficiency improvements with GHG control technology. Various technologies can be applied to improve power plant efficiency, as shown in a 2008 report by NETL. The International Energy Agency also highlighted opportunities to reduce CO2 emissions through upgrades and efficiency improvements. The IEA conducted a study in 2013 on reducing CO2 emissions at coal-fired power plants through retrofits and upgrades. Retrofits, such as turbine upgrades and condenser optimization, can be cost-effective by restoring plant efficiency and reducing specific emissions of pollutants. Major plant retrofits, like converting subcritical units to super- or ultra-supercritical units, can significantly raise efficiencies. Converting subcritical coal-fired power plants to super- or ultra-supercritical units can significantly increase efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions. For example, upgrading a 500 MW unit in the UK raised net generation efficiency from 38% to 44% and cut emissions by 500,000 tonnes per year. Hybrid coal-solar power plants, like the one at Xcel Cameo Generating Station in the US, can further improve efficiency and reduce coal usage by 2-3%, with potential to scale up to 10%. The system at Xcel Cameo Generating Station in the US uses parabolic trough solar collectors to concentrate solar radiation onto receiver tubes filled with heat transfer fluid. This heats the oil to 300\u00b0C before transferring the heat to water, reducing the need for coal in the boiler. Biomass can also be used alongside coal for environmental benefits, although there may be limitations. Combining coal and biomass through gasification can capitalize on their advantages and minimize drawbacks. This process has been successful in large-scale plants and can be integrated with other renewable energy technologies for clean and efficient energy production. Various hybrid energy concepts, including coal/biomass gasification, are being developed to incorporate intermittent renewables like wind or solar power. Biomass can be used in combination with coal for electric power generation, with potential advantages due to its carbon neutrality. However, using biomass on a large scale poses challenges such as lower heating value and bulk density compared to coal. The availability and type of biomass materials vary by location, with potential sources including forest product industry waste in the United States. Various factors like government regulations and industry growth influence the motivation for improvement projects in this area. External forces such as the New Source Review program, established by Congress in 1977, can hinder efficiency improvement projects at coal-fired power plants by requiring operators to undergo environmental reviews and implement Best Available Control Technology for new power generating units. These forces add to the internal evaluation of costs vs. benefits for improvements. The New Source Review program, established in 1977, can impede efficiency improvements at coal-fired power plants by requiring environmental reviews and implementing Best Available Control Technology for new units. Power plants built before 1971 are exempt from limits on pollutant emissions but may lose that exemption if non-routine maintenance increases emissions, leading to NSR requirements. The industry sees the NSR process as a barrier to efficiency projects. The NSR process is seen as an obstacle to power plant efficiency improvement projects. The EPA and NETL have identified issues with the NSR related to defining maintenance projects and determining emission increases. These issues have made efficiency improvements risky and less appealing to plant operators. Higher efficiency may help meet GHG emissions limits in the future. The NSR process may hinder capital investments for improving power plant efficiency. The increase in natural gas production has led to a shift in electric power production decisions, with natural gas and coal each representing about 32% of the market. However, coal has regained market share as natural gas prices have risen since May 2013. Since May 2013, higher natural gas prices and increased electricity demand led to more coal-fired units being used. Despite low growth in electricity demand, factors like lower natural gas prices, higher coal prices, slower economic growth, and new environmental regulations will impact decisions on coal plant retirements. The EPA is expected to propose guidelines for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. The EPA is expected to propose guidelines for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. The proposal will establish emissions targets on a state or plant-by-plant basis, allowing companies to choose how to achieve reductions through efficiency improvements, fuel switching, and other methods. Emissions averaging, banking, and trading of credits will also play a role in the system. The proposal may consider factors like the remaining useful life of existing sources and could be less stringent than regulations for new power plants. Power plant efficiency may be a factor considered by the EPA in its guidelines for existing sources. Increasing average efficiency from 32.5% to 36% could potentially reduce U.S. GHG emissions. Increasing power plant efficiency from 32.5% to 36% could reduce U.S. GHG emissions by 175 MMmt per year. Barriers to achieving higher efficiency levels include industry focus on profitability, cost pass through possibilities, and uncertainty about GHG regulations. One approach to improving fleet-wide efficiency could be using the top decile of CFPP efficiency as a benchmark for the U.S. NETL suggests using the top decile of CFPP efficiency as a benchmark for U.S. fleet efficiency to improve efficiency through various methods, some relatively inexpensive like improved O&M, and others very expensive like new equipment. If each plant achieved maximum efficiency, a 5% reduction in CFPP carbon dioxide emissions could be achieved. Retiring lower efficiency units and increasing generation from higher efficiency units, along with advanced refurbishments, are key to increasing average fleet efficiency. Efficiency improvements for CFPP owners could be incentivized using an efficiency frontier, with possible tax rate reductions or accelerated book depreciation rates. Penalties may also be used to prompt retirement of lower efficiency units. Incentives would be in place over a defined period, gradually reduced to encourage action sooner. The effective period would need to allow for equipment orders and work progress at multiple CFPP sites. The benchmark for efficiency improvements in coal-fired power plants could be periodically revised to allow newer plants to operate at their most efficient level. This would benefit companies that have invested in pollution controls. However, the EPA's upcoming proposal on GHG emissions standards will impact the cost-effectiveness of these improvements. Older power plants naturally lose efficiency over time, and while good maintenance practices can help, they will never be as efficient as newer, technologically advanced plants. Improving the efficiency of coal-fired power plants can significantly reduce CO2 emissions. Major retrofits in technology or converting to natural gas could lead to substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. However, detailed cost information on efficiency-enhancing improvements is limited due to confidentiality concerns. Studies suggest that newer, more technologically advanced plants are more efficient and emit less CO2 per unit of electricity produced. The studies referenced in this report largely show relative information on cost effectiveness of improvements for coal-fired power plants. Actual cost information would require a technical evaluation and cost vs. benefit analysis to obtain reliable estimates for options under consideration. Legislation could use tax incentives to encourage energy efficient upgrades for newer units. One approach to incentivize energy efficient upgrades for newer coal-fired power plants is to implement federal energy efficiency standards that increase over time. States could design programs based on local resources and plant age, with non-compliant plants facing retirement. Deference to state authorities and regional compliance strategies have been suggested for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from existing plants. Federal legislation could tie incentives for efficiency improvements to book depreciation studies conducted by utilities on power plants. States may be directed to meet GHG reduction goals based on the results of these studies."
