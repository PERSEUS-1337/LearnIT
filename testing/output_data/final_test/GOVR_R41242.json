    "content": "Social Security benefits received before full retirement age are subject to reductions for early retirement and the Retirement Earnings Test (RET) if earnings exceed certain thresholds. The RET imposes a $1 reduction in benefits for each $2 of earnings above $14,640 annually for those below FRA, and a $1 reduction for each $3 of earnings above $38,880 annually for those attaining FRA. This report explains how the RET works under current law and provides examples of how it affects both the worker beneficiary and any family members receiving benefits. The report discusses the Retirement Earnings Test (RET) and its impact on Social Security benefits for both worker beneficiaries and auxiliary beneficiaries. It highlights key features of the RET, including benefit recomputation at Full Retirement Age (FRA) and potential reductions in benefits for exceeding earnings thresholds. Policy issues related to the RET and recent research on its effects on work effort and benefit claiming decisions are also addressed. The Retirement Earnings Test (RET) can result in benefit reductions for worker beneficiaries and auxiliary beneficiaries. The reduction is pro-rated among family members, and benefits lost can be recouped. Once a beneficiary reaches Full Retirement Age (FRA) and is no longer subject to the RET, benefits are adjusted upward to account for previous reductions. The Social Security Administration (SSA) estimates that eliminating the RET would have an impact. The Social Security Administration estimates that eliminating the Retirement Earnings Test (RET) for individuals aged 62 or older would not significantly impact Social Security's long-term financial outlook. However, in the short term, eliminating the RET would negatively affect the Social Security trust fund by $81 billion from 2012 to 2018. The RET raises policy issues related to labor supply and the timing of claiming Social Security benefits. The original rationale for the RET was to ensure benefits were only paid after retirement from gainful employment. The original Social Security Act barred payment of benefits for any month in which a beneficiary received wages from \"regular employment.\" The provision was never implemented due to difficulties in defining \"regular\" employment. Instead, a specific monetary amount was recommended for simplicity. Congress incorporated these recommendations in 1939 amendments, withholding benefits for months with earnings over $15. The RET has evolved from a monthly to an annual test, affecting beneficiaries below the FRA. The Retirement Earnings Test (RET) was changed in 2000 under the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act, eliminating the RET for beneficiaries at Full Retirement Age (FRA). Social Security benefits are based on a worker's highest 35 years of earnings, with the benefit formula providing higher percentages for workers with low career-average earnings. Initial monthly benefits are equal to the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) at FRA. Social Security benefits are calculated based on a worker's highest 35 years of earnings, with initial monthly benefits equal to the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) at Full Retirement Age (FRA). Benefits can be lower if claimed before FRA and higher if claimed after FRA. Auxiliary benefits are provided to eligible family members, such as spouses and widows(er)s, capped by the maximum family benefit amount. The Retirement Earnings Test (RET) applies to beneficiaries below the Social Security Full Retirement Age (FRA) with earnings exceeding a specified amount. It does not apply to those at or above FRA, disabled individuals, or beneficiaries living outside the U.S. Self-employed individuals are subject to the RET based on the nature of services performed. For individuals below the Social Security Full Retirement Age (FRA) with earnings exceeding a specified amount, benefits are reduced by $1 for each $2 earned above the exempt amount. For those reaching FRA during the year, benefits are reduced by $1 for each $3 earned above the exempt amount. The reduction applies to wage and salary income only, not to other types of income like pensions or interest. The Retirement Earnings Test (RET) applies to income from pensions, rents, dividends, interest, and other types of unearned income. The annual exempt amounts in 2012 are $14,640 for beneficiaries below FRA and $38,880 for those reaching FRA. The exempt amounts increase yearly based on average wages. A grace year allows full benefits if earnings stay below one-twelfth of the annual exempt amount. A 62-year-old worker with $60,000 in earnings from January to June 2012 starts claiming Social Security retirement benefits on July 1, with no additional earnings for the rest of the year. Despite total earnings exceeding the annual exempt amount, full benefits are paid each month in the second half of the year. Social Security auxiliary benefits can be affected by the Retirement Earnings Test (RET) if based on a worker beneficiary subject to the RET. Benefits paid to spouses and dependents can be affected by the Retirement Earnings Test (RET) if the auxiliary beneficiary is below Full Retirement Age (FRA) and has earnings above the exempt amount. This also applies to divorced spouses, except if divorced for at least two years. The same annual exempt amounts and benefit reduction rates apply to both worker beneficiaries and auxiliary beneficiaries. A dually entitled beneficiary may receive their own retired-worker benefit first, followed by any remaining spousal benefit. The total benefit is capped at the higher of the two. Earnings above the exempt amount affect both benefits. When the beneficiary reaches Full Retirement Age, the benefits are adjusted to account for months without payment. When a beneficiary has benefits withheld under the Retirement Earnings Test (RET), the benefits are adjusted at Full Retirement Age (FRA) to account for months without payment. The worker's benefits are recomputed and increased at FRA, with the actuarial reduction for early retirement lessened based on the number of months affected by the RET. The actuarial reduction for early retirement is adjusted based on the number of months affected by the Retirement Earnings Test (RET). Retirement benefits are reduced for early retirement by a fraction of the worker's Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) for each month of entitlement before Full Retirement Age (FRA). The reduction is about 6.7% per year for the first three years of entitlement before FRA, and 5% per year for each additional month of entitlement before FRA. The actuarial reduction for early retirement is adjusted based on the number of months affected by the Retirement Earnings Test (RET). If a worker's benefits are reduced in the initial benefit computation to reflect early retirement, and benefits are withheld under the RET, the benefit recomputation at Full Retirement Age (FRA) will result in a higher monthly benefit amount. For example, a worker who claims benefits at 62 with earnings above the RET threshold will be subject to both the actuarial reduction and benefit withholding. The actuarial reduction for early retirement is adjusted based on the number of months affected by the Retirement Earnings Test (RET). If benefits are reduced in the initial computation for early retirement and withheld under the RET, the benefit recomputation at Full Retirement Age (FRA) will result in a higher monthly benefit amount. For example, if benefits are withheld for 24 months due to the RET, the reduction factor for benefit entitlement before FRA will be adjusted accordingly. The actuarial reduction for benefit entitlement before FRA will be increased to reflect a reduction of about 13.4% instead of 25%. Benefits withheld under the Retirement Earnings Test (RET) are restored at FRA, resulting in a higher monthly benefit. Spousal benefits withheld under the RET will be adjusted upward when the spouse reaches FRA. There is no subsequent adjustment for spouses who have already attained FRA. About 1.3 million worker beneficiaries below FRA in 2006 had earnings. In 2006, worker beneficiaries below FRA had earnings. Not all beneficiaries with earnings are affected by the RET, such as those with earnings below the exempt amount or in the first year of entitlement. Table 2 shows the application of the RET to single worker beneficiaries in different age groups. Worker beneficiaries below FRA are subject to the Retirement Earnings Test (RET) if they have earnings above the annual exempt amount. The RET results in a $1 reduction in benefits for each $2 of earnings above the exempt amount. This applies to beneficiaries who will remain below FRA throughout the year and those who will attain FRA during the year. The Retirement Earnings Test (RET) applies to worker beneficiaries below Full Retirement Age (FRA) with earnings above the annual exempt amount. There is a $1 reduction in benefits for each $2 of earnings above the exempt amount. For those who will attain FRA during the year, the reduction is $1 for each $3 of earnings above the exempt amount. Earnings above the exempt amount are charged against the total family benefit, including benefits for auxiliary beneficiaries. The Retirement Earnings Test (RET) applies to worker beneficiaries below Full Retirement Age (FRA) with earnings above the annual exempt amount. If the worker beneficiary is below FRA and has earnings above the exempt amount, reductions under the RET are pro-rated among family members. The total family benefit may be reduced if earnings exceed the exempt amount, with no benefits payable for those months. The Retirement Earnings Test (RET) applies to worker beneficiaries below Full Retirement Age (FRA) with earnings above the annual exempt amount. If the worker beneficiary has earnings above the exempt amount, reductions under the RET are pro-rated among family members. Benefits for the family are shown under two cases of the RET, with examples illustrating benefit reductions for worker beneficiaries with earnings above the exempt amount. Table 4 illustrates a scenario where both the worker beneficiary and an auxiliary beneficiary have earnings above the exempt amount under the Retirement Earnings Test (RET). Benefit reductions are pro-rated among family members, with the worker beneficiary's RET charge applied to both their own benefit and the auxiliary beneficiary's spousal benefit. The Retirement Earnings Test (RET) applies benefit reductions to family members with earnings above the exempt amount. For dually entitled beneficiaries, earnings affect both their own retired-worker benefit and the spousal benefit they receive. The Retirement Earnings Test (RET) applies benefit reductions to family members with earnings above the exempt amount. Policymakers are concerned about the RET's impact on labor supply, work hours, retirement, and the timing of Social Security benefit claims. Studies have shown mixed evidence on how the RET affects these factors, which could have significant implications for the retirement security of workers and their families. Studies have found mixed evidence on the impact of the Retirement Earnings Test (RET) on work hours, retirement, and Social Security benefit claims. The RET affects the labor supply of workers near the threshold, causing some to work fewer hours to stay below the limit. Workers with higher earnings levels show more ambiguous effects on work hours. Some workers delay claiming Social Security benefits due to the RET. The impact of the Retirement Earnings Test (RET) on work hours is ambiguous. Some workers see it as a tax on work effort, leading them to reduce hours or retire early. However, others may work more to reach income goals. Eliminating the RET could benefit higher earners by increasing total income. The Retirement Earnings Test (RET) has varying effects on work hours and earnings. Studies show little impact on men aged 62 and older, but some impact on women's earnings. Removing the RET for beneficiaries at or above FRA in 2000 had significant effects on earnings, especially near the threshold. However, research suggests the RET has a minimal effect on labor force participation and retirement decisions. The Retirement Earnings Test (RET) may discourage individuals below the Full Retirement Age (FRA) from claiming Social Security benefits early. Some workers see the RET as a \"tax\" on early benefits, but benefits can be recouped through higher monthly payments at FRA. Quantitative evidence suggests the RET influences the decision of when to claim benefits more than its impact on work and earnings. The Gruber and Orszag study found that increasing the RET threshold could impact the share of men aged 62 and older receiving Social Security benefits. Another study showed an increase in benefit claims among men and women aged 65 to 69 after the elimination of the RET. Some argue that delaying claiming benefits can be beneficial for workers and their spouses. The Retirement Earnings Test (RET) affects Social Security benefits in two ways: 1) benefits are recomputed and increased when the worker reaches Full Retirement Age (FRA), and 2) there is a permanent reduction for early retirement. Spousal benefits reduced by RET are restored at FRA, except for spouses already at or above FRA. Survivors' benefits may also be impacted by the worker beneficiary's choices. Survivors' benefits may be permanently affected by the worker beneficiary's decision to claim benefits before Full Retirement Age (FRA). The widow(er)'s benefit may be reduced if it exceeds the benefit the worker was receiving before their death. Elderly widows may face reduced living standards if their spouses claim benefits early. Some argue that eliminating the RET would have positive budget and economic effects because people would work more and pay more Social Security payroll and other taxes. The effect of the RET on labor supply is probably modest. Beneficiaries affected by the RET feel denied a benefit they have \"bought and paid for,\" resembling a form of needs testing for earned benefits. Supporters of the Retirement Earnings Test (RET) argue that Social Security benefits should be contingent on demonstrating \"need\" for the earned benefit. The recomputation of benefits at Full Retirement Age (FRA) to restore benefits withheld under the RET is not widely known. Recomputation results in a higher monthly benefit amount at FRA, allowing the worker to recoup any benefits \"lost\" under the RET. Some argue that the RET should not be seen as a \"tax.\" Some argue that the Retirement Earnings Test (RET) may be regressive on a lifetime basis due to its link to life expectancy and income. Critics claim it discriminates against claimants who must work to supplement benefits, while supporters believe it provides a bonus to those who can continue working after retirement. Eliminating the RET could benefit claimants with other forms of income, such as pensions or investments, who can receive full Social Security benefits. The Retirement Earnings Test (RET) allows individuals to continue working after retirement and may encourage some to reduce work hours. Eliminating the RET for individuals aged 62 or older would not significantly impact Social Security's long-term financial outlook. However, in the short run, it could result in a negative effect on the Social Security trust fund, with an estimated deficit of $81 billion from 2012 to 2018. The Office of the Chief Actuary (OCACT) projects a deficit of $10.4 billion in 2018 due to the elimination of the Retirement Earnings Test (RET). OCACT notes that benefits will increase as some individuals will no longer have benefits withheld, others will apply for benefits earlier, and there will be a small net increase in earnings for those currently subject to the earnings test. To qualify for Social Security retired-worker benefits, a person generally needs 40 earnings credits or 10 years of Social Security-covered employment. A worker's initial monthly benefit is based on their 35 highest years of earnings indexed to historical wage growth. The 35 highest years of indexed earnings are divided by 35 to determine the worker's career-average annual earnings, which is then divided by 12 to determine the average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). The basic benefit amount is the primary insurance amount (PIA), calculated using a formula applied to the AIME. The AIME is divided into three brackets with progressive factors of 90%, 32%, and 15% applied. The PIA for retirement benefits is determined based on the AIME brackets. Initial monthly benefits are equal to PIA at full retirement age (FRA), less if claimed before FRA, and greater if claimed after FRA. FRA ranges from 65 to 67 depending on the individual's year of birth. Retirement benefits are based on the Full Retirement Age (FRA), which ranges from 65 to 67 depending on the individual's year of birth. Benefits are reduced for each month claimed before FRA, with a maximum reduction of about 6.7% per year. Delaying benefits past FRA results in a delayed retirement credit (DRC) of up to 8% per year until age 70. Social Security provides benefits to eligible family members of a retired, disabled, or deceased worker. Benefits for spouses, divorced spouses, and surviving spouses are based on a percentage of the worker's PIA, with a maximum family benefit amount. Spouses receive 50% of the worker's PIA, while surviving spouses receive 100% of the deceased worker's PIA. These benefits are reduced if claimed before FRA and may be offset if the beneficiary receives their own Social Security benefit or a non-Social Security pension. Social Security provides auxiliary benefits for family members of retired, disabled, or deceased workers. Children can receive 50% to 75% of the worker's PIA, while surviving parents caring for a child under 16 or disabled can receive 75% of the worker's PIA. The maximum family benefit amount varies from 150% to 188% of the worker's PIA. Eligibility requirements are outlined in Table B-1. The maximum family benefit for a worker who attains age 62 in 2012 or dies before age 62 is limited to 150% of the first $980 of PIA, plus 272% of PIA over $980 and through $1,415, plus 134% of PIA over $1,415 and through $1,845, plus 175% of PIA over $1,845. The dollar amounts are indexed to average wage growth. The family benefit formula applies to the family of a worker entitled to disability benefits. The annual exempt amount under the Social Security Retirement Earnings Test is indexed to average wage growth, except in years without a Social Security cost-of-living adjustment. The RET only applies to wage and salary income, not to unearned income like pensions or dividends."
