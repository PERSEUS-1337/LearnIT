    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2012\". It includes findings related to strategic and critical minerals. The Act titled the \"National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2012\" finds that the industrialization of China and India has increased demand for nonfuel mineral commodities, highlighting resource nationalism. The availability of minerals is crucial for economic growth, national security, and technological innovation. The exploration, production, and use of minerals significantly contribute to the nation's economic well-being and security. The United States possesses vast mineral resources. The United States is increasingly reliant on foreign sources for mineral materials, with import dependence doubling from 30 to 67 commodities by 2011. The United States' share of global mineral exploration dollars decreased from 19% in the early 1990s to 8% in 2011. In the 2012 Ranking of Countries for Mining Investment, the United States ranked last in permitting delays and poorly in government take and social issues affecting mining. The curr_chunk is a section titled \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" In this Act, \"strategic and critical minerals\" are defined as minerals essential for national defense, energy infrastructure, domestic manufacturing, and economic security. The term \"agency\" refers to any government entity at the federal, state, local, or tribal level. The term \"mineral exploration or mine permit\" includes plans issued by the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service under specific regulations. TITLE I--DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SOURCES OF STRATEGIC AND CRITICAL MINERALS\n\nSEC. 101. IMPROVING DEVELOPMENT OF STRATEGIC AND CRITICAL MINERALS.\n\nDomestic mines providing strategic and critical minerals are classified as \"infrastructure projects\" under a Presidential Order dated March 22, 2012.\n\nSEC. 102. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LEAD AGENCY. The lead agency appoints a project lead to coordinate and consult with various stakeholders to minimize delays and adhere to timelines for mineral exploration or mine permits. The agency must determine if the permitting process alone or in combination with state processes adequately safeguards the environment. The lead agency for mineral exploration or mine permits should enhance government coordination, avoid duplicative reviews, and engage stakeholders early in the process. Best practices include deferring to state agencies' baseline data and conducting concurrent reviews when possible to expedite decisions. The agency responsible for issuing mineral exploration or mine permits must establish time limits for each step of the permit review process, including deciding on document preparation, determining scope, conducting baseline studies, drafting documents, and finalizing documents under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 outlines consultations, submission and review of comments, publication of public notices, and final decisions. The review process should not exceed 30 months unless agreed upon. The lead agency is not obligated to address comments not submitted during public comment periods. The agency determines financial assurance for reclamation of mining sites. The lead agency must work with a third party to reclaim operations as per the reclamation plan, including costs for treatment facilities to meet environmental standards. This section applies to mineral exploration permits submitted before the Act's enactment date upon written request from the applicant. For strategic materials in National Forests, identified mineral resource areas are exempt from certain land use designations. Designations exempt from regulations under part 294 of title 36, Code for Federal Regulations, apply to additional routes and areas necessary for mineral resource construction, operation, maintenance, and restoration. Exemptions continue after Minerals Plan of Operations approval for National Forest units. SEC. 103 prioritizes maximizing mineral resource development while minimizing environmental impacts in permit development. SEC. 104 outlines the Federal Register process for mineral exploration and mining projects. The preparation of Federal Register notices for mineral exploration and mine development projects will be delegated to the organization level within the agency responsible for issuing permits. All notices regarding document availability, meetings, or intent to take action will be originated from the office where the documents are held. Federal Register notices described in subsection (a) must undergo required reviews within the Department of the Interior or Agriculture and be published in final form in the Federal Register within 30 days of preparation. TITLE II--JUDICIAL REVIEW OF AGENCY ACTIONS RELATING TO EXPLORATION AND MINE PERMITS\n\nDefinitions for Title: \"Covered civil action\" refers to a civil action with a claim under section 702 of title 5, US Code, regarding agency action on mineral exploration or mine permits.\n\nTimely Filings: A covered civil action must be filed within 60 days of the final Federal agency action.\n\nExpedition in Hearing: The court will aim to hear and determine covered civil actions promptly.\n\nLimitation on Relief: There are limits on prospective relief for covered civil actions. SEC. 204. LIMITATION ON PROSPECTIVE RELIEF. The court in a covered civil action can only grant relief that is narrowly drawn, corrects the legal violation, and is the least intrusive means necessary. SEC. 205. LIMITATION ON ATTORNEYS' FEES. The Equal Access to Justice Act does not apply to covered civil actions, and no party can receive payment from the Federal Government for attorneys' fees and expenses."
