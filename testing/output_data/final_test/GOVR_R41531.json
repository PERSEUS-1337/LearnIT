This incident resulted in the largest oil spill in U.S. waters, surpassing the Exxon Valdez spill. The spill lasted approximately 84 days, with over 200 million gallons of crude oil released. Control of the oil discharge was gained on July 15, 2010. Following the containment of the well, satellite data showed decreasing daily amounts of oil on the ocean's surface. On August 20, 2010, no oil was observed on the surface for the first time since the spill began. Despite this, oil was still found in other areas, prompting the question of where it went. This report aims to assess the fate of the oil itself, separate from its impacts on the Gulf ecosystems. The assessment of the 2010 Gulf spill's impact is ongoing, with perceptions of the oil's fate influencing congressional interest and action. Factors such as oil spill assessments, biases, and presentation methods can shape these perceptions. Policymakers' beliefs about the oil's degradation and environmental impacts can impact attention to the spill's consequences and pressure on Gulf industries. The fate of oil released into a marine environment is influenced by various factors such as its chemical composition, natural processes, location of the spill, and human intervention. The 2010 Gulf spill involved crude oil, which is a complex mixture of chemical compounds that react differently in the environment. Evaporation can remove about one-third of the volume of a medium crude oil slick. This information is crucial for policymakers to assess oil spill response performance and the government's capability to monitor oil spills in the environment. The fate of oil released into a marine environment is influenced by various factors such as its chemical composition, natural processes, location of the spill, and human intervention. Evaporation can remove about one-third of the volume of a medium crude oil slick within the first day of a release. Water-soluble components of crude oil can persist for weeks to years, while tar balls formed from spilled crude oil can be transported great distances. The lighter crude oil released during the 2010 spill may evaporate more readily, undergoing physical and chemical changes known as \"weathering\" as it interacts with the environment. The fate of oil released into a marine environment is influenced by various factors such as its chemical composition, natural processes, location of the spill, and human intervention. The time involved in these changes can range from minutes to years. The location of an oil release plays a significant role in determining the oil's fate, with warmer water temperatures expediting natural processes like evaporation and biodegradation. Severe weather events, like storms, can transport oil to sensitive locations or resuspend settled oil in the water column. In the Deepwater Horizon incident, severe weather events impeded human response. The Deepwater Horizon incident involved a deepwater oil release at a depth of 5,000 feet, leading to complications compared to surface spills. The oil well blowout was a multi-day event discharging oil into the Gulf waters at a rapid rate. The 2010 Gulf spill involved a high-speed discharge of oil into the Gulf waters. Responders used mechanical removal, in situ burning, and chemical dispersants to remove the oil, each with different consequences for the oil's fate. During the 2010 Gulf spill, responders used in situ burning and chemical dispersants to address the oil discharge. In situ burning produces particulate matter (PM), a main combustion product of concern. Chemical dispersants break up oil slicks into small droplets, altering oil's properties and its impact on the environment. Dispersants aim to reduce surface oil reaching shorelines, but they can affect water column organisms. During the 2010 Gulf spill, responders used in situ burning and chemical dispersants to address the oil discharge. Dispersants increase water column organisms' exposure to oil, with approximately 1.8 million gallons authorized for use in the Gulf. 42% of dispersants were applied at the wellhead, with dispersant use halting when the well was sealed. The impacts of chemically dispersed oil and dispersants remain unknown. On August 4, 2010, the National Incident Command released an estimate of the oil spill budget for the Deepwater Horizon incident, which received media attention. Key Administration personnel attended a press conference to address the estimates, but questions were raised due to limited detail. On November 23, 2010, a peer-reviewed \"Technical Document\" was released to explain how the estimates were derived. The November Technical Document provided further details on the oil budget estimates, emphasizing their use for operational and response purposes rather than tracking the final fate of the spilled oil. The estimates categorized the oil into human intervention, natural processes, and other groups. The Oil Budget estimates the quantity of oil burned, skimmed, and collected from the discharging well and its pipeline transport to surface level vessels. Direct measurement accounted for 17% of the total estimated release, with 820,000 barrels burned and 260,000 barrels skimmed. The estimate of skimmed oil is a rough calculation due to uncertainty in oil-water mixtures collected. The oil budget authors estimated that 160,000 barrels of oil were recovered through skimming, representing 3% of the total release. Additionally, 770,000 barrels of oil were chemically dispersed, accounting for 16% of the total release. This estimate was significantly higher than the initial conservative estimate, with a range of uncertainty much larger than other categories. The Technical Document highlights the challenges in estimating the effectiveness of chemically dispersed oil operations, with uncertainties larger than other categories. The budget estimates 630,000 barrels of oil were naturally dispersed, based on assumptions and defined as droplets smaller than 100 microns. The uncertainty ranges for naturally dispersed oil were not provided in the data. The Technical Document discusses uncertainty factors for natural subsurface and surface dispersion. 1.2 million barrels of oil evaporated or dissolved, accounting for 24% of the total estimated release. Evaporation dominates over dissolution in oil loss processes. The Oil Budget Technical Document indicates that dissolution likely played a larger role in the Gulf spill than typical surface spills, accounting for 22% of the total estimated release. The \"other\" category includes oil on or just below the surface, weathered tar balls, and buried oil, totaling 1.1 million barrels. The November Technical Document highlights uncertainties in the oil spill estimates, emphasizing that the final mass balance calculation is still pending. Uncertainty ranges are provided for different categories, as shown in Figure 5. The uncertainty bars in the estimates represent the range between best and worst case scenarios. There is debate over releasing the estimates to the public due to uncertainty and potential misapplication. Despite efforts to remove oil from the Gulf, over 100 million gallons still remained as of the Oil Budget. A substantial portion of oil\u2014over 100 million gallons\u2014remained in the Gulf as of the Oil Budget estimate. The OSAT report released in December 2010 provides results from samples collected from May through October 2010 in different areas of the Gulf. Response activities aimed to prevent oil from reaching shorelines, but oil eventually contaminated hundreds of miles of Gulf state. The oil spill contaminated hundreds of miles of Gulf state shorelines, with 1,100 miles initially affected. By October 2011, this decreased to 481 miles. Despite a decline in oiled shoreline miles, a significant amount remains compared to the previous year. The exact volume of oil on the shorelines is not quantified by an authoritative source. The November Technical Document states that no estimates were made of the percentage of oil in oiled shoreline debris, making it impossible to give a reliable estimate of the amount. Independent researchers initially reported potential underwater plumes of oil near the spill source, which was met with skepticism. However, subsequent research confirmed the existence of undersea plumes linked to the Deepwater Horizon incident. In August, a team from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution reported a 35-kilometer-long subsea plume at a depth of 3,300 feet southwest of the well site. The Joint Analysis Group (JAG) was established by the Administration to coordinate subsea monitoring in the Gulf, issuing reports on collected data. The most recent JAG report documented decreased dissolved oxygen levels as a proxy for subsurface dispersed oil in areas where plumes have been observed. The OSAT report provided water column sampling results showing elevated PAH levels in June and July 2010, exceeding EPA benchmarks by at least ten times. Samples after August 3, 2010, did not exceed the benchmarks. The report's limitations include limited insights on the fate of the oil. The OSAT report highlighted elevated PAH levels in water samples in June and July 2010, exceeding EPA benchmarks by ten times. However, the report lacks pre-spill data to determine the extent of PAH levels typically found in the Gulf. Studies suggest that a significant portion of spilled oil could sink to the bottom of the Gulf. Some oil from the 2010 Gulf spill may have settled on the ocean floor, as indicated by sediment samples showing an oil layer. However, ongoing sampling programs have not confirmed extensive oil presence on the Gulf bottom. The OSAT report suggests that a portion of the oil may have settled in various sea floor locations. The OSAT report provided sediment sampling results for nearshore, offshore, and deepwater zones after the 2010 Gulf spill. Elevated PAH levels were found in nearshore sediment samples in the early weeks of the spill, but levels returned to normal by October. Qualitative sampling also detected oil in tar mat formations on the ocean floor. The OSAT report found oil in locations with \"tar mat formations\" previously observed by SCAT teams. Sampling data gap in nearshore waters under 10 feet, OSAT team established to evaluate. Offshore samples collected from August to October showed no PAH concentrations above benchmarks, most at or below pre-spill levels. Deepwater sediment samples had ~6% exceeding PAH benchmarks, within three kilometers of the wellhead. Microbial organisms likely played a role. The Gulf of Mexico has natural oil seeps that release large volumes of oil each year, supporting a community of oil-eating bacteria. Well-known seeps are found in the Gulf and off the coast of southern California. Studies have shown that these organisms played a role in the Gulf spill, with some scientists questioning their impact. In August 2010, conflicting research papers from Woods Hole and Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory debated the role of microbes in biodegrading oil in the Gulf of Mexico. While Woods Hole suggested limited biodegradation, Berkley's study indicated the presence of oil-degrading populations adapting rapidly to contamination, potentially aiding in bioremediation. Another study in August 2011 from Woods Hole supported the idea of microbial communities playing a significant role in controlling the fate of hydrocarbons in the deep-sea. The Woods Hole research team analyzed data from surface waters during the Gulf oil spill in June 2010. They found that microbes digested the oil at an unprecedented rate, potentially keeping pace with the oil reaching the surface. The exact amount of remaining oil is still unknown, with estimates from the November Oil Budget document based on calculations made in July 2010. At the time of calculations in July 2010, a significant amount of oil had been removed from the Gulf through human efforts. However, a considerable portion still remained in some form. The fate of this remaining oil is uncertain and may never be conclusively determined due to challenges such as the complexity of the Gulf system and limited resources for data collection. Researchers are studying damages to natural resources in the Gulf, which may provide insights into the fate of the oil."
