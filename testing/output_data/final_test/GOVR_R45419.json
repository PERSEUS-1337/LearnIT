    "content": "Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) provides monthly cash benefits to disabled workers and their dependents if they are unable to work due to a qualifying disability. The number of disabled-worker beneficiaries increased from 2.7 million in 1985 to 9.0 million in 2014, then declined to around 8.7 million in December 2017. The size of the beneficiary population impacts SSDI expenditures and the program's trust fund solvency. Various factors influence the number of SSDI beneficiaries over time, affecting predictions of solvency and related legislation. The report analyzes factors affecting SSDI benefit receipts and terminations over the past 30 years. The number of disabled-worker beneficiaries has fluctuated, with growth rates varying in different periods. The proportion of female beneficiaries has increased over time. The number of beneficiaries in current payment status changes with new disability awards and benefit terminations. The number of SSDI beneficiaries fluctuates based on new disability awards and benefit terminations. To qualify for SSDI, workers must be insured, disabled, and younger than Social Security's full retirement age. Benefits are terminated upon death, reaching FRA, medical improvement, or returning to work. The decline in beneficiaries is mainly due to a decrease in disability benefit awards since 2014. The number of disabled-worker beneficiaries on SSDI fluctuated over the years, peaking at over 1 million in 2010 but declining to around 716,000 in 2017. The termination of benefits also increased from 340,000 to 859,000 from 1985 to 2017. Various factors like demographic changes, employment trends, and program rules influenced these trends. The number of SSDI disabled-worker beneficiaries fluctuated over the years, peaking in 2010 but declining by 2017. Factors like increased eligibility among female workers and the aging workforce contributed to the growth in the insured population from 1985 to 2007. However, growth slowed after 2007 due to the stabilization of women in the workforce and the aging out of the baby boom generation. The growth in the insured population slowed after 2007, attributed to factors like increased eligibility for SSDI among women and the aging workforce. Between 1985 and 2005, the proportion of women insured for disability increased, leading to more women becoming potentially eligible for SSDI. The female proportion of disabled worker beneficiaries also increased during this period. The SSDI incidence rate for women increased significantly from 1985 to 2005, while the rate for men remained relatively steady. The gender gap in SSDI enrollment decreased over time, with the ratio of male to female beneficiaries approaching parity by 2008. Female labor force participation had less impact on SSDI enrollment growth after 2010, as the rate started to decline after 2010. The SSDI enrollment for women remained stable between 2000 and 2010, with a peak in 2010 and a decline to 4.7 in 2017. Factors influencing SSDI trends include the aging workforce, particularly the baby boom generation. Baby boomers reaching peak disability-claiming years contributed to a rise in disability beneficiaries, but as they transition to retirement benefits, enrollment growth has slowed. The disability enrollment rates are expected to fall as the baby boom generation transitions from disability benefits to retirement benefits. Between 2000 and 2017, the number of disabled worker terminations increased by 87%, with a growing proportion terminating benefits due to reaching full retirement age. Between 2000 and 2017, disabled worker terminations increased by 87%, with a rising proportion terminating benefits due to reaching full retirement age (FRA). The share of new disability insurance awardees aged 50 to FRA declined in 2017. Terminations also decreased due to death, medical improvement, or returning to work, with death accounting for about one-third of terminations. The aging population impacted the SSDI program's incidence rate, with the age-sex-adjusted rate higher than the gross rate before 2000 due to the baby boom generation. After 2000, the age-sex-adjusted rate was lower as the baby boom generation aged. The gross disability incidence rate is projected to decline as the baby boom generation ages, with the age-sex-unemployment-adjusted rate remaining relatively stable after 1992. The impact of business cycles on disability incidence will be discussed further. The Full Retirement Age (FRA) under the Social Security Amendments of 1983 gradually increased from 65 to 67 for workers born in 1938 or later. This led to a significant increase in the number of new awards for workers aged 65-FRA in the SSDI program. By 2017, there were about 495,600 disabled workers between ages 65 and FRA. Additionally, the rise in FRA increased the value of SSDI cash benefits compared to early retirement benefits due to an actuarial reduction in monthly benefits for those claiming benefits before FRA. When claiming retirement benefits before the Full Retirement Age (FRA), there is a reduction in monthly benefits. The earliest age to claim benefits is 62, with reductions of 20%, 25%, or 30% depending on the FRA. SSDI benefits have become more attractive for later birth cohorts with larger FRAs. Some studies suggest an increase in disability benefits relative to early retirement benefits leads to more SSDI applications, but researchers are divided on the approval rate. Demographic changes are a significant factor in the growth of the SSDI program. The growth of the SSDI program before 2014 was mainly due to factors such as a growing share of working women eligible for DI, an aging population, and the increase in Social Security's full retirement age. Employment opportunities and the value of compensation over disability benefits also influenced SSDI enrollment decisions. Workers compare the value of SSDI benefits with their opportunities for work and compensation when deciding to apply. Figure 6 shows the number of SSDI applications and the national unemployment rate. The number of SSDI applications and the national unemployment rate for each year between 1985 and 2017 are shown in Figure 6. SSDI applications increased during economic recessions and peaked after the recession ended. Conditional disability applicants, who would apply for SSDI benefits if they lost their jobs, contribute to this trend. During recessions, some individuals find applying for SSDI more attractive than seeking employment. During economic recessions, SSDI applications increase, with higher past earnings and recent work experience. Claims allowed drop with high unemployment, leading to more denials. Incidence rates rise during and after recessions, stabilizing after 1990. Business cycles likely explain trends in SSDI enrollment. Some studies suggest that the declining average preapplication earnings of disability insurance applicants compared to nonapplicants may be due to more low-wage earners applying for SSDI. The value of disability insurance benefits relative to earnings has been increasing for low-wage workers, possibly incentivizing more applications. SSDI benefits are tied to the growth in average national earnings, which are outpacing earnings for low-wage workers. Additionally, the availability of Medicare after a two-year waiting period may be a factor driving people to apply for the disability insurance program. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provided more options for people with disabilities to obtain insurance, potentially altering disability claiming decisions. Some researchers suggest that those with alternative health insurance coverage are more likely to apply for SSDI benefits, as the two-year waiting period for Medicare may deter applications from workers with job-based coverage. The ACA may impact disability applications by improving coverage options for those with disabilities, potentially leading to an increase in applications. It may also make it easier for people to prove their disability, resulting in more applications or higher acceptance rates. Some suggest that the ACA could lower the value of the disability program, reducing applications and encouraging SSDI beneficiaries to return to work. Studies using state-level data show mixed effects on disability applications since the ACA's implementation. Some studies suggest that the ACA may decrease disability applications by offering reasonable health care costs and encouraging disabled workers to return to work. Analytical results indicate that the ACA could make SSDI recipients healthier, reducing the likelihood of becoming disabled at work. Changes in eligibility criteria and disability reviews have affected SSDI benefit awards and terminations. Continuing disability reviews (CDRs) impacted SSDI benefit awards and terminations under the Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984. The legislation expanded medical qualification criteria, leading to easier qualification for benefits based on multiple medical conditions. Some studies suggest that eligibility standards increased significantly post-1984 but have remained stable since the early 1990s. The age-sex-unemployment-adjusted incidence rate increased from 4.1% in 1985 to approximately 5.6% in the early 1990s, with no further increase since then. The 1984 legislative reform contributed significantly to this rise, leading to compositional changes in the SSDI beneficiary population, including a shift in the types of disabilities for which beneficiaries qualify. The percentage of disabled workers receiving benefits increased from 52% in 2004 to 2016. Researchers suggest that new program rules led to this rise, particularly for low-wage workers. The mortality rate among SSDI beneficiaries decreased from 4.9% in 1983 to 2.9% in 2017, possibly due to changes in the beneficiary population. The increase in disabled workers receiving benefits is attributed to changes in the beneficiary population. Incidence rates at younger ages have risen compared to older ages, possibly due to mental disorders with early onset. Successive birth cohorts are entering SSDI at younger ages, leading to longer benefit receipt durations and increased program spending. Continuing disability reviews are conducted to assess ongoing eligibility for SSDI beneficiaries. The Social Security Administration has faced a backlog of full medical Continuing Disability Reviews (CDRs) since 2002, which increased to 1.5 million cases by 2009. With increased funding from 2014 to 2018, the backlog decreased to 64,000 cases by the end of 2017 and was eliminated by the end of 2018. This led to a significant increase in the number of disabled workers no longer meeting the medical requirements, with a recovery rate of over 150% higher in 2017 compared to 2014. The recovery rate for disabled workers in 2017 was 18.2 per 1,000 beneficiaries, projected to decrease to 11.0 per 1,000 beneficiaries with the backlog elimination. The allowance rate is the proportion of SSDI claimants ultimately receiving benefits, determined through a multi-level appeals process. Figure 7 illustrates the final outcome of disabled-worker applications from 1992 to 2016. The allowance rate for disabled-worker applications peaked at 62% in 2001 and declined to 48% in 2016. The allowance rates at different adjudicative levels also decreased during this period. Researchers are unsure about the causes of this decline, with some suggesting it may be related to economic factors. The decline in SSDI enrollment rates since 2001, particularly after 2009, is attributed to fluctuations in the unemployment rate. Some believe there has been a \"regime shift\" in the determination process, with newer ALJs having lower allowance rates. The decrease in new disability awards since 2011 and the increase in termination of benefits have led to a reversal in the trend of SSDI beneficiaries growth. The recent decline in SSDI enrollment is attributed to factors such as the availability of jobs and the aging of lower-birth-rate cohorts. Unemployment rates have decreased, making employment more attractive than disability benefits. Additionally, the lower-birth-rate cohorts entering peak age for disability have impacted the number of new disability awards. The availability of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2014 expanded health insurance opportunities, potentially reducing the incentive to use SSDI for access to Medicare and lowering the number of disability applications. The nationwide effect of the ACA on disability benefit receipt is still unclear. The total allowance rate for disability applications declined from 62% in 2001 to 48% in 2016, possibly due to changes in the SSDI adjudication process. Factors like the increase in the FRA, growth in applications from low-wage workers, and higher incidence rates among young applicants may push disability benefit receipt upward, but their impact is smaller compared to other factors. The increase in disability terminations among disabled workers from 2001 to 2017 is attributed to factors like baby boomers reaching Full Retirement Age (FRA), leading to a higher proportion of terminations due to FRA attainment. The share of disabled-worker beneficiaries terminating benefits also rose from 8% to almost 10% during this period. The potential increase in disability terminations may slow down due to the scheduled increase in the Full Retirement Age (FRA) from 66 to 67 between 2020 and 2027. Efforts in Continuing Disability Reviews (CDRs) have increased, reducing the backlog to about 64,000 cases by the end of FY2017. About 147,000 benefits were terminated after CDRs between 2013 and 2017. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) after 2014 may lead some SSDI recipients to return to work due to reduced reliance on SSDI for Medicare access and improved health conditions. The ACA may improve the health conditions of disabled-worker beneficiaries, potentially decreasing disability terminations. Factors like the increase in Full Retirement Age and declining mortality rates among beneficiaries could also impact disability terminations."
