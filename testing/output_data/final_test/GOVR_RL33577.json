    "content": "International trade in goods and services significantly impacts the United States, with the country being one of the top exporters globally. However, the U.S. has been facing merchandise trade deficits since 1976, with fluctuations in the deficit over the years. In 2009, there was a significant decline in the trade deficit due to a decrease in imports during the recession, but it started increasing again as the economy recovered in 2010 and 2011. The trade deficit increased by 28% in 2010 and 15% in 2011. Trade deficits impact U.S. economic growth, interest rates, and the debt load. Trade ties can lead to bilateral relations and free trade agreements. Trade agreements and strategic objectives can impact trade flows. Imports can create friction and pressure to protect U.S. producers. Rising trade deficits and free trade agreements raise concerns about job loss. This report provides an overview of U.S. import and export trends and balances. The report provides current data on trade flows, trends, and policy issues. Merchandise exports increased by 6% and imports by 5% from January-July 2012, resulting in a 2% increase in the U.S. trade deficit with the world. These changes are lower than the same period in 2011. More detailed information on specific commodities, countries, or time periods can be obtained from the Department of Commerce or the U.S. International Trade Commission. In 2011, U.S. merchandise exports rose by 16%, imports also rose by 16%, and the trade deficit increased by 15% to $738 billion. The U.S. economy continued to recover from the financial crisis, with merchandise exports and imports surpassing their 2008 peaks. The fuel deficit increased by 18%, and the top export commodity changed to refined petroleum products, up 70%. In 2011, U.S. imports increased by 11.4%, with refined petroleum products up 70%. The top import commodity was crude oil and mineral fuels, up 29%. Trade with China grew, with U.S. exports rising by 13% and imports by 9%. The U.S. trade deficit with China also increased by 8%. The declining U.S. trade deficit in 2009 helped the U.S. economy during the global financial crisis, but it also led to a decrease in demand for U.S. domestic goods and services. The global financial crisis in 2009 caused a decline in demand for U.S. domestic goods and services, leading to increased pressures to protect domestic industry from imports. Countries are competing to capture the increase in global trade by keeping their currencies low, particularly China. Trade in both goods and services fell dramatically in 2009, contrasting with the general trend of large increases in U.S. and world trade in recent decades. In 2009, U.S. goods trade saw significant fluctuations with merchandise exports declining by 18% and imports by 26%. The U.S. deficit in merchandise trade dropped by over one-third to $506 billion due to the recession. However, in 2010, exports increased by 21% and imports by 23%, leading to a more negative deficit. By 2011, exports of goods increased by 16% to $1,497 billion, aligning with the President's National Export Initiative goal of doubling exports by 2015. In the period 2010-2015, U.S. goods trade saw increases in major export sectors such as refined petroleum products, civilian aircraft, and motor cars. Imports also increased, with major sectors being crude oil, motor cars, and refined petroleum products. The impact of the global financial crisis on U.S. goods trade can be seen in the decline and subsequent recovery of exports and imports. In 2011, total annual imports of services of $427 billion and exports of $606 billion yielded a surplus in U.S. services trade of $179 billion. U.S. service industries, including financial services, tourism, shipping, and insurance, compete well in international markets. Monthly services exports have mostly increased since the end of the recession, but fell in the last months of 2011. U.S. services imports have consistently increased since the end of the recession, remaining around $53 billion since May 2012. U.S. services imports have been consistently increasing since the recession, resulting in a trade deficit of $560 billion in 2011. Trade in goods and services has become more important in the U.S. economy over the past two decades, with total trade growing from 20% to over 30% of GDP by 2011. While total trade has increased, imports have outpaced exports, leading to a rise in the trade deficit, which has slightly decreased in recent years due to the U.S. recession. The U.S. trade deficit has slightly decreased in recent years, amounting to approximately 3.7% of U.S. GDP in 2011. Despite concerns about the level of deficit, foreign investors continue to buy U.S. Treasury securities due to the \"safe haven\" effect, keeping U.S. interest rates low. This deficit does, however, weaken the exchange value of the dollar. The weakening of the dollar's exchange value is due to the U.S. trade deficits, reflecting a savings shortage and reliance on capital imports. This shortfall is like excessive spending financed by borrowing, with foreign capital flowing into the U.S. to cover the trade deficit. The impact of this borrowing depends on how the capital imports are used - for investments that raise future output and productivity or for current consumption. The U.S. trade deficits are causing a weakening of the dollar due to a savings shortage and reliance on capital imports. The impact of borrowing to cover the deficit depends on how the capital imports are used - for investments or current consumption. Trade balances are influenced by macroeconomic factors like growth rates, savings, investment behavior, and exchange rates, and changes in the trade balance affect the nation's GDP. The trade balance reflects changes in the economy's components, contributing positively or negatively to GDP growth. For example, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, exports boosted growth during weak consumer and business spending. In 2008, exports accounted for 9% of GDP growth, compared to 5.9% in 1990. In 2009, exports helped offset a 3.5% decline in GDP, mainly due to a 30% drop in imports. The effects of exports, imports, and trade balance on the domestic economy are complex. A large trade deficit typically follows a booming economy, as increased domestic demand leads to more imports. Economists are concerned that the rising U.S. trade and current account deficits could devalue the U.S. dollar. The current account deficit has put pressure on the dollar, but a weaker dollar can boost exports by making them cheaper, narrowing the trade deficit. The dollar has lost nearly one-third of its value since 2002 but has been rising in 2012. The U.S. dollar fell to parity with the Canadian dollar in September 2007 for the first time in 30 years. Between July and November 2008, the U.S. dollar strengthened due to the global financial crisis. The dollar lost value since November 2009, partly due to the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts. However, during the Eurozone debt crisis in 2010, global investors sought safety in U.S. Treasury securities, boosting the dollar's price. A weakened dollar can reduce trade imbalances but may deter foreign investors. If foreign investors stop buying dollar-denominated assets, the dollar's value could drop, leading to a need for higher interest rates to attract more foreign investment. Since January 2008, the dollar has weakened against the Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi but strengthened against the euro and South Korean won. Foreign investment in dollar assets and purchases of securities have boosted the dollar's value. China's central bank intervenes to keep its exchange rate stable. Some governments are creating sovereign wealth funds invested in various financial instruments. Sovereign wealth funds are owned by governments and invested in various financial instruments denominated in hard currency. China, Japan, South Korea, Russia, and oil-exporting nations fund these investments through foreign exchange reserves. China and Japan traditionally invest in low-risk government bonds to diversify and earn higher returns. China established the China Investment Corporation in 2007 with $200 billion. These funds, depending on management and leverage, could impact U.S. interest rates. The United States trade deficit is financed by foreign investors buying U.S. assets like government securities. The sustainability of trade deficits depends on various factors such as perception of the U.S. as a safe haven, interest rates, and actions by foreign central banks. These factors are influenced by policy levers. The trade deficit in the United States is influenced by policy levers such as interest rates set by the Federal Reserve, government budget deficits, and trade policies. Legislation in the 112th Congress has targeted trade barriers, particularly with China, and manipulation of exchange rates. The merchandise trade balance and total merchandise trade are key indicators of U.S. international economic activity, with total merchandise trade reaching $3,688 billion in 2011, a 16% increase from 2010. In 2011, U.S. merchandise trade reached $3,688 billion, with exports totaling $1,480 billion and imports reaching $2,208 billion. The trade deficit increased to $727 billion. Export and import growth has been steady, with some fluctuations in certain years. In 2007, exports rose by 12.3% and imports by 5.7%. In 2008, exports grew faster than imports (12.4% versus 7.3%), but the trade deficit increased. In 2009, exports decreased more slowly than imports (-17.9% versus -25.9%), before both took a sharp upward turn in 2010. The current account includes services, investment income, and unilateral transfers in addition to merchandise trade. The current account includes services, investment income, and unilateral transfers. Services account has registered surpluses, while the United States traditionally has a surplus in its investment income. Data on the current account are announced later than trade in goods and services. The United States had a surplus in investment income of $184 billion in 2010 and $227 billion in 2011, but a deficit in unilateral transfers of $131 billion in 2010 and $133 billion in 2011. The deficit on the current account rose to $466 billion in 2011 from $442 billion in 2010, but was down from $801 billion in 2006. The deficit on the current account in 2011 was 3.1% of GDP, following closely behind the 3.0% in 2010, both below the 5% caution level set by the IMF. The US can run trade deficits without the same pressure on the dollar due to its status as an international reserve currency. The US current account deficit fluctuated over the years, reaching a surplus in 1991 but increasing significantly from 1995 to 2006. It decreased from 2007 to 2009 due to the financial crisis, then increased in 2010 and remained flat in 2011. Forecasted to rise from 2012 to 2017, mainly due to outgoing investment income payments. The US current account deficit is projected to increase, driven by outgoing investment income payments. The merchandise trade deficit is expected to remain stable. In 2012, the goods trade deficit is forecasted to reach $742 billion, decreasing to $687 billion in 2013 before rising again to $724 billion in 2014. The current account deficit is predicted to be $514 billion in 2012, decreasing to $446 billion in 2013, and then increasing to $503 billion in 2014. The overall US merchandise trade balance includes deficits or surpluses with each trading partner. The US trade deficit is influenced by various factors such as market access, industry competitiveness, currency misalignment, and macroeconomic adjustments. The deficit is mainly with China, Mexico, Japan, Germany, Ireland, and Canada, while surpluses are seen with Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Australia, and the United Arab Emirates. Trade with oil exporting countries like Venezuela, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia also contributes to the deficit. The deficit with China has significantly increased over the past decade. The U.S. trade deficit with China has grown significantly over the past decade, reaching $295 billion in 2011. This negative net balance now accounts for about 40% of the total U.S. trade deficit. China's trade data differs from U.S. data due to the treatment of Hong Kong as an entrepot, leading to discrepancies in export figures. The U.S. trade deficit with China reached $295 billion in 2011, comprising 40% of the total U.S. trade deficit. Discrepancies in export figures arise from how Hong Kong is treated as an entrepot, affecting the reported trade surplus and deficit between the United States and China. In 2011, the U.S. trade deficit with China increased by 8%, surpassing Japan as the top deficit trading partner. The deficit also grew with Japan by 5% and decreased with Mexico by 3%. Canada remained the largest total merchandise trading partner for the United States, followed by China, Mexico, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Brazil, and France. In 2007, China surpassed Canada as the largest supplier of U.S. imports. Canada is the top purchaser of U.S. exports, followed by Mexico. Free trade agreements do not always lead to U.S. deficits in trade, as shown by surpluses with certain FTA partners like Australia and Singapore. In 2010 and 2011, the United States had trade deficits with NAFTA partners, Israel, and Oman. The U.S. merchandise trade balance with new FTA partners Colombia, Peru, and South Korea was not in effect during those years. NAFTA accounted for over 80% of all U.S. trade with FTA partners, with total goods trade with Canada and Mexico exceeding $1 trillion in 2011. U.S. FTA partners represented 35% of U.S. trade in 2011. The U.S. economy has become more globalized and service-oriented, making trade in services, income from investments, and remittances by foreign workers more important. Bilateral current account balances differ from merchandise trade balances, with examples like the U.S. surplus in services and investment income with Canada offsetting a deficit in goods trade. Investment income varies by country, with the U.S. having surpluses with the EU and Canada but deficits with China and Japan, due to Japan's investments in the U.S. The United States ran a deficit of $32 billion in investment income with Japan in 2011, offsetting the surplus of $18 billion in trade in services. The current account deficit with Japan exceeded the bilateral merchandise trade deficit. Similarly, with China, the U.S. deficit on investment income of $33 billion overshadowed the surplus in services. This reflects the accumulating debt of the United States relative to various countries. Inflows of capital help maintain the value of the dollar, but interest paid is often repatriated to home countries. In 2011, the United States had an overall surplus of $227 billion in investment income with the rest of the world, along with a surplus of $179 billion in services. The deficit of $133 billion in unilateral transfers reflects funds remitted by workers back to their home countries. The U.S. trade in advanced technology products shifted from a surplus to a deficit in 2002. The U.S. trade balance in high technology products shifted from surplus to deficit in 2002. The deficit grew to $100 billion in 2011, raising concerns about policy scrutiny despite many imports being from U.S. companies or affiliates. The growing deficit in high technology products may require closer policy scrutiny. Data on U.S. trade in vehicles show significant deficits with Japan, Mexico, Germany, and South Korea. Vehicle trade is a crucial segment in U.S. trade, with exports valued at $139 billion and imports at $256 billion in 2011, representing a 20% increase in exports and 13% increase in imports compared to 2010. In 2011, the United States saw a 20% increase in exports and a 13% increase in imports of vehicles. The U.S. had a surplus in automotive trade with various partner nations, with major car export partners being Canada, Germany, China, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico. The U.S. trade balance in automobiles improved from a $76 billion deficit in 2010 to a $75 billion deficit in 2011. U.S. motor truck exports reached a record $24 billion in sales in 2011. In 2011, U.S. motor truck exports hit a record $24 billion, with a 25% increase in sales and a trade surplus of $4.5 billion. The U.S. imported $20 billion in trucks, with Mexico being the major supplier. Energy trade is a significant concern for Congress due to its magnitude and implications, with the U.S. being the world's top energy importer. In 2011, the U.S. had a trade surplus in motor truck exports, reaching a record $24 billion. Energy trade is a major concern for Congress, with the U.S. being the world's top energy importer. The U.S. energy balance is significantly impacted by trade deficits in energy products, with coal being the only energy product with a trade surplus. Table 13 displays U.S. exports, imports, and trade balance for primary energy forms. Energy deficit is a key topic in policy discussions, with both imports and exports playing a crucial role in U.S. trade. Major sectors in U.S. energy exports include refined petroleum products, coal, and natural gas. Refined petroleum products were the top U.S. export in 2011, with major markets being Mexico, the Netherlands, Canada, Singapore, and Chile. Refined petroleum products accounted for 70% of total U.S. energy exports in 2011, followed by coal at 12% and natural gas at 8%. Crude oil remains the primary driver of U.S. energy trade, representing 74% of U.S. energy imports in 2011. Crude oil is a major driver of U.S. energy trade, accounting for 74% of energy imports in 2011. The U.S. trade deficit in crude oil was $335 billion, making up 46% of the overall trade deficit. Canada surpassed Saudi Arabia as the primary crude oil supplier to the U.S. in 2006. Imports from OPEC nations, including Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Nigeria, make up roughly half of U.S. crude oil imports. Iraq's imports are recovering, reaching $17 billion in 2011. The most authoritative source for international trade statistics is the monthly \"FT900\" report, issued by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.
