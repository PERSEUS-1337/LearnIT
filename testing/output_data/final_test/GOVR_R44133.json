    "content": "The Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill funds various agencies including the Department of the Treasury, Executive Office of the President, judiciary, District of Columbia, and independent agencies. The bill also includes provisions for mandatory retirement accounts and general provisions for agencies funded through the FSGG bill. The House and Senate FSGG bills fund the same agencies, except for the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) which is funded through the Agriculture appropriations bill in the House. This funding structure has been in place since 2007. The FSGG appropriations bill funds various agencies, excluding financial regulatory agencies. President Obama's FY2016 budget requested $46.8 billion for FSGG agencies, including $322 million for the CFTC. The House Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 2995, providing $41.6 billion for FSGG agencies. The House FY2016 Agriculture appropriations bill would have allocated $245 million for the CFTC. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported the Financial Services and General Government Act, 2016 (S. 1910, S.Rept. 114-97) with an appropriation of $42.1 billion for FY2016, $4.7 billion below the President's request. H.R. 719, a continuing resolution for FY2016, was signed into law, providing budget authority for ongoing projects at a slight decrease. The FSGG section of the CR included anomalies for specific funding purposes. These anomalies allowed the District of Columbia to use local funds for programs, excluded funding for the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, which oversaw ARRA funds. The Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board was funded by ARRA appropriations until FY2012. It received $20 million for FY2014 and $18 million for FY2015 but was set to sunset in September 2015. The Small Business Administration was authorized to apportion appropriations to continue issuing general business loans under the 7(a) loan guaranty program if demand exceeded the program's authorization ceiling. The Small Business Administration resumed issuing 7(a) loans in July 2015 after the Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015 increased the program's authorization ceiling to $23.5 billion. Previous legislation had also raised the ceiling to prevent demand from exceeding the limit. The Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) was enacted in 1998 to prevent state and local governments from taxing Internet access or imposing discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. The moratorium was extended multiple times by the 113th Congress and further extended through September 30, 2015. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 made the ITFA moratorium permanent. Additional continuing resolutions were enacted to avoid a lapse in annual appropriations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113/H.R. 2029) was passed on December 18, 2015, providing funding for FSGG agencies for FY2016, including the CFTC, at $44.8 billion, $2 billion below the President's request. Division O of the Act also included provisions related to financial regulators. The FSGG bill focuses on financial services but does not include funding for regulating the industry. Banking, insurance, and securities are key sectors within financial services, regulated by various agencies like the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC, CFPB, and NCUA. These agencies do not primarily rely on appropriations for funding. The FSGG bill does not provide funding for regulating financial services agencies like the FDIC, NCUA, SEC, and CFTC. The Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the Treasury is funded through the Departmental Offices account but has no regulatory authority. Funding for the SEC is provided by the FSGG bill but offset through fees collected by the SEC. Legislative provisions affecting financial regulatory agencies are often included in the bill. The House and Senate bills proposed changes to the funding procedure for the CFPB, shifting to congressional appropriations instead of funds from the Federal Reserve. The Senate bill also included provisions from a financial regulatory reform bill. P.L. 114-113 did not include CFPB funding provisions but included some financial regulation provisions from S. 1484/S. 1910. In early 2007, both the House and Senate restructured their subcommittees, creating a new Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee. The House FSGG Subcommittee's jurisdiction included agencies previously under the TTHUD Subcommittee and four independent agencies from the Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. The Senate FSGG Subcommittee combined agencies from three existing subcommittees. The House and Senate restructured their subcommittees in early 2007, creating the Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee. The FSGG Subcommittee now has jurisdiction over agencies previously under the TTHUD Subcommittee and four independent agencies from the Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. The reorganization resulted in similar jurisdictions for both House and Senate FSGG Subcommittees, with a few exceptions."
