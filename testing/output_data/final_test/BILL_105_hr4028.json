According to findings by Congress, 1-2 million American women have received silicone breast implants over the last 35 years primarily for breast augmentation or reconstruction surgery. Women with breast cancer seek access to silicone implants for treatment options and need accurate information on risks and benefits for informed decisions. The rate of implant rupture and silicone leakage remains uncertain. According to studies, up to 70 percent of silicone breast implants may leak. A 1997 Mayo Clinic study found that 1 in 4 women needed additional surgery within 5 years of receiving implants. Local changes in breast tissue and potential complications like hardening, scar tissue contraction, blood clots, severe pain, and inflammation have been reported. Concerns persist about exposure to silicone leading to connective tissue or autoimmune diseases. A group of scientists and clinicians in 1997 addressed concerns about a possible link between atypical connective tissue disease and silicone breast implants, calling for more research on silicone components and biological responses. Reports suggest that silicone implants can make mammograms difficult, and there are concerns about potential harm if the implants leak silicone. Some studies suggest a link between breast feeding with implants and problems with the child's esophagus. The purpose of this Act is to promote research on the health effects of silicone breast implants and ensure accurate information for women and their doctors. SEC. 3. Expansion and intensification of activities regarding silicone breast implants at the National Institutes of Health by adding a new section for silicone breast implant research. The Director of NIH appoints a coordinator for silicone breast implant research to involve various Institutes in the study. The Director of NIH appoints a coordinator for silicone breast implant research and establishes study sections to review grant applications and ensure research quality. Additionally, the Director conducts or supports clinical research to understand health implications, including a study on women with implants for at least 8 years. The Director of NIH conducts research on women with silicone breast implants for at least 8 years, focusing on atypical disease presentation, neurological dysfunction, and immune system irregularities. An annual report on the study results is submitted to Congress. Expansion and intensification of activities related to silicone breast implants at the FDA. The FDA will ensure accurate information on silicone breast implants is available to the public, including updates on reported problems and data transparency. Reporting procedures for issues with implants or studies will be clarified. The FDA will require manufacturers of silicone breast implants to update package inserts and informed consent documents regularly to reflect accurate information, including rupture rates. Manufacturers conducting adjunct studies must provide patients with informed consent documents at the initial consultation and inform women on how to obtain a Medwatch form. The FDA requires manufacturers of silicone breast implants to update package inserts and informed consent documents regularly. Manufacturers conducting adjunct studies must provide patients with informed consent documents and inform women on how to obtain a Medwatch form for reporting problems or concerns with the study. SEC. 5. PRESIDENT'S INTERAGENCY COMMITTEE ON SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. The President's Interagency Committee on Silicone Breast Implants is established to oversee policy formation, research, and activities related to silicone breast implants. The Committee is composed of representatives from various government agencies appointed by the President and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The President's Interagency Committee on Silicone Breast Implants includes representatives from government agencies, the Department of Defense, CDC, and individuals with expertise in silicone breast implants. The chairperson is appointed from the committee members. The chairperson of the Committee convenes meetings at least twice a year and compiles information for consideration. Meetings are open to the public, allowing witnesses to speak. Each member presents their activities related to silicone breast implants. Members serve rotating terms of 2 or 4 years. Members of the Committee serve for 2 or 4 years with a maximum of 8 years. Vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment. They do not receive compensation but can be reimbursed for expenses. The Secretary of Health and Human Services provides staff support on a reimbursable basis. The Committee receives staff support from the Secretary of Health and Human Services on a reimbursable basis to carry out their duties. Members must comply with Federal conflict of interest laws. Appropriations are authorized as needed for this section."
