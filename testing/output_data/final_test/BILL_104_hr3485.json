    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Colville National Forest Adaptive Management of Timber Resources Act.\" Congress finds that forest vegetation on Federal lands in the intermountain West, including the Colville National Forest in Washington, is overstocked and unhealthy due to fire exclusion and nonmanagement. The current regulatory structure hinders effective management for healthy ecosystems and community benefits. The current regulatory structure and policy direction hinder the Forest Service's flexibility in planning projects that consider local conditions and market opportunities. Federal budget limitations have reduced the trained workforce needed for maintaining healthy ecosystems, leading to a disproportionate focus on planning rather than implementation. Adaptive management techniques in selected areas of the Colville National Forest aim to promote a healthy ecosystem and meet long-term national fiber needs. The adaptive management techniques required under this Act aim to promote a healthy ecosystem, meet long-term national fiber needs, and stimulate local economies. Scientific and economic knowledge gained from these projects will benefit forest stands in the intermountain West and all timber management projects. The purposes of this Act are to combat adverse consequences of catastrophic wildfires, manage forest stands for improved health and environmental needs, and demonstrate cost-effective use of private contractors for Forest Service tasks. The Secretary of Agriculture must submit a research plan to Congress within a year of this Act's enactment for controlled silvicultural treatment in designated areas of the Colville National Forest in Washington. The plan will focus on testing adaptive management techniques in fire-generated, overstocked, small-diameter forest stands. This includes approximately 110,000 acres identified for adaptive management in a Forest Service study from 1989-1994. The Forest Service study from 1989-1994 identified management techniques for creating opportunities in the Colville National Forest. The Secretary will implement a research plan within two field seasons and may use private contractors for the project. The Secretary will establish the \"Ecosystem Adaptive Management Demonstration Account\" to fund the research plan for the Colville National Forest. Private contractors from affected communities will assist in the preparation and implementation of the research plan. The Secretary will establish the \"Ecosystem Adaptive Management Demonstration Account\" to fund the research plan for the Colville National Forest. Amounts deposited, borrowed, and used under the plan will be based on specific provisions. The Secretary may borrow funds from salvage sale accounts or the Knutson-Vandenberg Act to cover startup costs, which will be repaid using funds from the account. The Secretary will establish an account for research projects and vegetative management activities within the areas covered by the research plan. Receipts from forest product sales will be deposited as specified. 25 percent of funds will go to the general fund of the Treasury, 25 percent to the State of Washington, and 50 percent to a special account. Silvicultural treatments will be conducted over a 10-year period as part of the research plan. The research plan includes silvicultural treatments over a 10-year period. Monitoring activities will last for at least 15 years, with reports submitted to Congress every 5 years detailing findings and costs associated with the plan."
