    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering Establishment Act\". It includes findings related to the establishment of the institute. The Congress finds that basic research in imaging, bioengineering, computer science, and informatics is crucial for improving healthcare. These disciplines need a separate research home at the NIH to develop new technologies for the 21st century. Additionally, advancements in medical research require noninvasive imaging techniques for early disease detection and treatment effectiveness. Advances in genetic and molecular imaging techniques are crucial for the rapid pace of discovery in molecular biology. Telemedicine, especially teleradiology, plays a vital role in providing high-quality medical care to rural and underserved populations. A central coordinating body at the NIH is needed to support research in imaging and engineering with medical applications. The NIH needs to coordinate various imaging technologies developed abroad, like MRI and CT, due to the lack of a central focus for imaging research. Establishing this focus at the NIH would advance science and boost US economic development. With plans to increase NIH resources, restructuring is necessary for more efficient research spending in medical science. Establishing a National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering at the NIH would accelerate the development of new technologies in medical science, improve coordination and efficiency, reduce duplication, promote economic development, and train young researchers for future discoveries. Establishment of National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering under Part C of the Public Health Service Act to promote technological advancements in medical science, enhance coordination, reduce duplication, spur economic development, and train young researchers. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering conducts research, training, and dissemination of health information in biomedical imaging and bioengineering. The Director establishes a Program for research and development of new techniques and devices in this field. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering conducts research and development in various disciplines such as physics, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. This includes technology assessments, outcomes studies, screening for diseases, advancing imaging and bioengineering modalities, developing target-specific agents, and creating new techniques and devices for interventional procedures. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering conducts research in various disciplines to enhance support for activities related to biomedical imaging and bioengineering. The Director prepares a plan to coordinate these activities and periodically reviews and revises it, including recommendations for program consolidation within the National Institutes of Health. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering supports activities in basic biomedical imaging and bioengineering research. It coordinates its activities with other agencies within the National Institutes of Health and other Federal agencies. An advisory council for the Institute is established with 12 members appointed by the Secretary, including scientists, engineers, physicians, and health professionals representing disciplines in biomedical imaging and bioengineering. The advisory council for the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering includes ex officio members from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Science Foundation, and National Institute of Standards and Technology. Funding for the Institute is authorized annually. The National Institutes of Health authorized appropriations for biomedical imaging and bioengineering for fiscal years 2000, 2002, and 2003, adjusted for inflation. The establishment of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering will utilize existing resources. The Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) can transfer personnel, utilize facilities, and obtain administrative support for the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering. The Act does not authorize the construction of facilities or land acquisition for the Institute's establishment or operation. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering will have an advisory council established within 90 days of the Act's effective date. A conforming amendment to the Public Health Service Act will include the Institute. The Act takes effect on October 1, 2000, or upon enactment, whichever is later."
