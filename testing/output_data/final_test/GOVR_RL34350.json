    "content": "Section 7 of the NLRA outlines collective bargaining rights for most private sector employees, including the right to self-organization, join labor organizations, and refrain from such activities. The definition of a supervisor under the act is based on specific functions requiring independent judgment, not job titles. The NLRA defines a supervisor as someone with authority to make key decisions regarding other employees, requiring independent judgment. The NLRB and Supreme Court have interpreted this definition in cases like NLRB v. Kentucky River Community Care, Inc. where professional or technical judgment was considered. River Community Care, a care facility operator, sought to exclude six registered nurses from a bargaining unit, claiming they were supervisors. The NLRB ruled they were not supervisors as they lacked independent judgment. The Sixth Circuit Court and Supreme Court upheld this decision, applying a three-part test from Section 2(11) of the NLRA to determine supervisory status. The Supreme Court in Kentucky River case addressed the issue of defining \"independent judgment\" for determining supervisory status under the NLRA. The Court criticized the NLRB's exclusion of judgment based on \"ordinary professional or technical judgment,\" stating it was not supported by the statutory text. The Court questioned the validity of excluding judgment based on professional or technical skill, highlighting the flaw in the NLRB's approach. The Supreme Court criticized the NLRB's exclusion of judgment based on professional or technical skill for determining supervisory status under the NLRA. The Court found that such exclusion would eliminate supervisors from the Act and disagreed with the notion that a supervisor's judgment is not independent if it relies on technical training or experience. The dissenting opinion supported the NLRB's interpretation of independent judgment as rational and consistent with the NLRA. In September 2006, the NLRB revisited the issue of supervisory status in Oakwood Healthcare, Inc. They sought to exclude permanent and rotating charge nurses from a proposed bargaining unit, arguing that they were supervisors due to using independent judgment in assigning and directing employees. The NLRB revisited the issue of supervisory status in Oakwood Healthcare, Inc. in 2006. They aimed to define terms like \"assign,\" \"responsibly to direct,\" and \"independent judgment\" as used in the NLRA. The NLRB concluded that \"assign\" refers to designating employees to a place, time, or giving significant duties. In the healthcare setting, it includes charge nurses assigning nurses and aides to patients. The NLRB interpreted \"responsibly to direct\" as overseeing work and being held accountable for its outcome, consistent with post-Kentucky River Board decisions. Accountability is key for responsible direction. The NLRB requires that a putative supervisor must have the authority to direct work, take corrective action, and exercise independent judgment free from control by others. This judgment must not be dictated by company policies, higher authorities, or collective bargaining agreements. The term \"independent judgment\" is interpreted in relation to work that is not merely routine or clerical in nature. The NLRB concluded that 12 permanent charge nurses at Oakwood Healthcare were supervisors under the NLRA based on their ability to assign tasks and responsibilities, but not for responsibly directing other employees. The Board found that the 12 charge nurses at Oakwood Healthcare exercised independent judgment in assigning staff based on skills and nursing needs. They had considerable latitude in making these decisions, which involved equalizing workloads and considering patient care requirements. The Board found that the 12 charge nurses at Oakwood Healthcare exercised independent judgment in assigning staff based on skills and nursing needs, spending a substantial portion of their time on supervisory functions. However, charge nurses in the emergency room were not considered supervisors, and rotating charge nurses were also not classified as supervisors. The dissent raised concerns that the NLRB's definitions could impact collective bargaining rights for employees with minor supervisory responsibilities. The dissent criticized the majority's broad interpretation of the NLRA, particularly regarding the definition of the term \"assign.\" The dissent argued that the term should refer to employees, not tasks, as stated in Section 2(11). This disagreement could impact collective bargaining rights for employees with minor supervisory responsibilities. The dissent challenged the majority's definition of \"responsibly to direct\" in the context of the NLRA, arguing that it should refer to general supervisory authority rather than task direction. Legislation like the RESPECT Act has been introduced in Congress to address these issues. The RESPECT Act, introduced in the 111th and 112th Congress, aims to redefine the supervisor's role under the NLRA. It would narrow the definition of supervisor by removing two functions and adding a limiting phrase. Supporters argue it would ensure only true supervisors are excluded from protection, while opponents claim it would change a long-standing definition. The RESPECT Act aims to redefine the supervisor's role under the NLRA by requiring an employee to be engaged in supervisory activities at least 50% of the time to be classified as a supervisor. This is in response to the NLRB's decision in Oakwood Healthcare, Inc., which established that individuals must spend a regular and substantial portion of their work time performing supervisory functions to be considered supervisors. The RESPECT Act aims to redefine the supervisor's role under the NLRA by requiring employees to be engaged in supervisory activities at least 50% of the time. This legislation would create a more restrictive definition of supervisor, reducing the number of supervisory functions from 12 to 10. It would also eliminate \"responsibility to direct\" as a supervisory function, potentially affecting the classification of foremen and employees with similar duties. The RESPECT Act proposes to redefine the supervisor's role under the NLRA by increasing the threshold for supervisory functions from 10%-15% to over 50% of the employee's worktime. This change would reduce the number of employees classified as supervisors, potentially impacting foremen and employees with similar duties. In 1947, Congress amended the NLRA to exclude supervisors from the definition of employee under the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 (P.L. 80-101), also known as the Taft-Hartley Act. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 excluded \"foremen and other supervisory personnel\" from the definition of 'employee.' Senator Flanders proposed an amendment to add \"responsibly to direct\" to the list of supervisory functions in the Senate bill, stating that the definition of \"supervisor\" in the act did not adequately cover the basic act of supervising. The RESPECT Act amends the definition of supervisor to distinguish between different levels of supervisory employees. It aims to protect the undivided loyalty of foremen by increasing the number of employees covered by the NLRA. The impact of the Oakwood Healthcare, Inc. decision on this remains uncertain. The RESPECT Act aims to protect foremen by amending the definition of supervisor to increase the number of employees covered by the NLRA. It is difficult to estimate the potential impact of the Oakwood Healthcare, Inc. decision on how many employees may be affected, as household and employer surveys may not provide enough information to determine supervisor classification. Removing the phrase \"responsibly to direct\" from the definition of supervisor could result in many foremen and similar workers being reclassified as employees. The RESPECT Act aims to protect foremen by amending the definition of supervisor to increase the number of employees covered by the NLRA. A 2002 report estimated that there were 8.6 million full-time foremen in the private sector not covered by the NLRA. In 2011, there were an estimated 6.8 million full-time, first-line supervisors in the private sector. The slow economic recovery post-recession led to a decrease in private sector jobs in 2011 compared to 2001. Oakwood Healthcare's interpretation of the definition of supervisor could result in many foremen being reclassified as employees. In the Oakwood Healthcare, Inc. decision, the NLRB found that 12 permanent charge nurses were supervisors, while none of the rotating charge nurses were considered supervisors. In two other cases, the Board also determined that lead persons in Croft Metals and nurses in Golden Crest Healthcare were not supervisors. This decision could impact the protection of 8 million workers under the NLRA."
