Congress found that during the summer of 2007, flight delays and cancellations reached record levels at major airports nationwide. This included a 20% increase in affected passengers, nearly 621,000 delayed flights (a 15% increase from the previous summer), average delays of 60 minutes (a 7% increase), 48,000 flight cancellations affecting 3,200,000 passengers, and tarmac delays lasting at least 1 hour. During the summer of 2007, tarmac delays lasting at least 1 hour increased by 25 percent, affecting over 2,000,000 passengers. The New York area was identified as a major congestion point, with the 3 major airports and surrounding airspace causing over 1/3 of nationwide flight delays. The significant increase in peak travel schedule at LaGuardia Airport in summer 2008 could worsen delay conditions. The 3 New York airports, JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark, are among the worst in on-time arrivals, with only 59% of flights arriving on time at JFK and LaGuardia. These airports are expected to face massive delays in the summer of 2008, impacting the national airspace system. JFK saw a 23% increase in daily operations and arrival delays between October 2006 and July 2007. The Federal Aviation Administration predicts a 36 percent increase in passengers on commercial aircraft by 2015. Next generation air traffic control technology, delayed until 2025, could alleviate congestion issues. Military operations during Thanksgiving in 2007 also contributed to delays. During Thanksgiving in 2007, military airspace off the East Coast was opened for commercial use, reducing holiday delays and congestion. Empowering a director to oversee operations in congested airspace in South Florida has significantly reduced delays for air carriers. The Federal Aviation Administration, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of Defense, will develop a plan to open special use airspace for additional air traffic lanes and create a corridor for commercial flights off the eastern coast of the United States. This plan includes immediate reclamation of airspace by the Department of Defense in case of a national emergency. The Director of the New York Integration Office of the Federal Aviation Administration can transfer funds for flight delay reduction projects in the New York-New Jersey region. Appropriations are authorized for hiring support staff. Additionally, an Aviation Traveler Task Force will be established. Congress finds that aircraft safety is crucial, but compliance with safety regulations should not inconvenience passengers. Customers were upset by lack of flight status notifications during massive cancellations in April 2008. Cancellations were announced last minute, leaving travelers stranded at airports. Air carriers reducing flights have made it difficult for consumers to find alternative options. The Federal Aviation Administration will establish an Aviation Traveler Task Force with employees and industry representatives. The Task Force will clarify safety directives, develop contingency plans for non-compliant aircraft, notify passengers of flight cancellations, and design a system for service disruption alerts. The Federal Aviation Administration will ensure that standardized inspection plans for commercial aircraft include measures to reduce service disruptions and groundings."
