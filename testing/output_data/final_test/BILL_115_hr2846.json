    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Agency Customer Experience Act of 2018\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 includes findings and the sense of Congress. Congress finds that the Federal Government should improve public services based on customer feedback, provide efficient and high-quality services, and enhance the customer service experience to meet private sector standards. The Federal Government ranks low in customer satisfaction compared to other industries in the United States. The sense of Congress is that all agencies should strive to provide high-quality, courteous, effective, and efficient services to the people of the United States. Agencies should measure, collect, report, and utilize metrics to continually improve services for individuals interacting with them. This includes working across organizational boundaries, leveraging technology, collecting standardized data, and developing customer-centered mindsets and service strategies. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of General Services. The term \"agency\" is defined as in section 3502 of title 44, United States Code. A \"covered agency\" is an agency designated as such under section 5(a). The \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. \"Voluntary customer service feedback\" is a response to information collection by a covered agency.\n\nSEC. 4. APPLICATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT TO COLLECTION OF VOLUNTARY CUSTOMER SERVICE FEEDBACK. Sections 3506(c) and 3507 of title 44, United States Code, known as the \"Paperwork Reduction Act,\" do not apply to voluntary customer service feedback collections. Guidelines for voluntary customer service feedback are outlined in Section 5. The Director assesses agencies, components, and programs to designate covered agencies. Guidance requires covered agencies to ensure anonymous customer feedback and respect for non-participation. The agency must follow specific guidelines when soliciting voluntary customer service feedback, including limiting the questions to 10, ensuring the voluntary nature is clear, using the feedback only to improve services, and limiting solicitations to one per interaction. Feedback should ideally be collected at the point of service. (8) Customer service feedback instruments must be accessible to individuals with disabilities as per the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. (9) Agency data governance policies apply to the collection of voluntary feedback. SEC. 6. CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE DATA COLLECTION. The head of each covered agency shall collect voluntary customer service feedback with standardized questions developed by the Director and Administrator to assess overall satisfaction with specific interactions or services. The Director, in consultation with the Administrator, will develop standardized questions to assess customer satisfaction with specific interactions or services, including accomplishment of tasks, respect, timeliness, and additional metrics. Additionally, the Director will work with the Performance Improvement Council to create relevant questions for covered agencies' operations or programs. Each covered agency must collect voluntary customer service feedback tied to specific transactions or interactions. They are required to publish annual reports on their website and submit them to the Director. The Director requires covered agencies to submit a report with voluntary customer service feedback and plans for its use, along with a machine-readable dataset containing standardized questions and response rates. The Director mandates covered agencies to collect voluntary customer service feedback and publish aggregated reports on their use. The Director mandates covered agencies to collect voluntary customer service feedback, including the purpose, point of contact, survey questions, and how feedback is used to improve customer service. SEC. 7. CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE SCORECARD REPORT. The Comptroller General of the United States will produce a scorecard report every 2 years assessing data collected by covered agencies on customer service feedback. The report will be submitted to the Senate and House committees, including a summary of information published by agencies and their plans for using the data. The Comptroller General will produce a scorecard report every 2 years assessing customer service feedback data collected by covered agencies. The report will include agency plans for using the data and an evaluation of compliance with the Act. Congress believes that adequate Federal funding is necessary to maintain agency staffing levels for proper customer service."
