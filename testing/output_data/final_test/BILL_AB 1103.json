    "title": "AB 1103",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 41821.5 of the Public Resources Code is amended to require disposal facility operators to submit information on disposal tonnages by jurisdiction or region of origin. Solid waste handlers and transfer station operators must provide information on the origin of solid waste delivered to disposal facilities. Recycling and composting operations must also submit periodic information on types and quantities of materials disposed of, sold, or transferred to other facilities or end users. Exporters, brokers, self-haulers, and transporters of recyclables or compost must report information on materials disposed of, sold, or transferred. Regulations will define \"self-hauler\" as a person or entity that generates and transports more than one cubic yard per week of its own food waste using its own employees and equipment. Exporters, brokers, self-haulers, and transporters of recyclables or compost must report information on materials disposed of, sold, or transferred. The reports may be provided to the department on an aggregated facility-wide basis, excluding financial data and origin information. Aggregated information, other than that by company, is public. The department will adopt regulations to implement practices for handling solid wastes and recyclable materials, ensuring compliance before enforcement and determining penalty amounts. Any person who fails to provide required information under regulations faces a civil penalty ranging from $500 to $5,000 per violation or per day for continuing violations. Any person who knowingly files a false report, refuses inspection of records, fails to keep records, or alters entries is subject to a civil penalty of $500 to $10,000 per violation. Liability can be imposed through civil action or administratively. All records required for verifying reports must be available for inspection by the department, but will remain confidential and not subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act. An employee of a government entity can inspect and copy records related to tonnage received at a disposal facility after July 1, 2015, within the entity's jurisdiction. The records include weight tags with hauler, vehicle, quantity, date, type, and origin of waste, for enforcing local fees, but remain confidential and not subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act. Names of haulers using specific landfills shall not be disclosed by a government entity unless necessary for enforcement purposes or to fund local programs. A government entity can seek court intervention to enforce its authority regarding waste disposal facilities. The definition of a government entity is specified, and the terms \"disposal\" and \"disposal facility\" are clarified. The authority of a government entity is not limited or expanded beyond regulations in place as of December 31, 2015. The operator can redact confidential pricing information from records before inspection. Reports required by this section must be submitted electronically. All records provided must adhere to Section 40062."
