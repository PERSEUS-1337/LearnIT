    "content": "The U.S. Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) designations of metropolitan areas, known as \"core-based statistical areas\" (CBSAs), can attract congressional attention due to their importance to constituents. CBSA designations influence public planning, business decisions, and can generate interest among various stakeholders. This interest can be heightened when the standards are used in unintended ways, such as in formulas for allocating federal grant program funds. The report discusses the history and impact of OMB's standards for designating metropolitan areas, specifically focusing on the 2010 standards and the difficulty in determining how these designations affect federal funds allocation. The OMB's standards for designating metropolitan areas originated in the 1940s to enhance the value of metropolitan data produced by Federal agencies. The U.S. Bureau of the Budget led the effort to develop standard metropolitan areas for use in the 1950 census publications, ensuring comparable data products for metropolitan areas have been available since then. The standards for designating metropolitan areas have been revised multiple times since their inception in 1949. Responsibility for the standards passed to OMB in 1970, except for a brief period from 1977 to 1981. The standards were reviewed in preparation for the 2010 census, with revisions considered by the Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Area Standards Review Committee. The Area Standards Review Committee, chaired by the Census Bureau, made recommendations for limited revisions of metropolitan area standards in 2009. These recommendations were adopted by OMB in 2010. In 2010, OMB announced new standards for delineating core-based statistical areas, including metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas. The terms were first used in the 2000 standards. The concept of a metropolitan statistical area includes a large population nucleus and adjacent integrated communities, while a micropolitan statistical area features a smaller nucleus. The standards also apply to New England city and town areas (NECTAs), which are similar to CBSAs. These new standards supersede those from 2000 to 2010. The 2010 standards for delineating core-based statistical areas, including metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas, were announced by OMB. The changes recommended by the Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Area Standards Review Committee were incorporated, with one recommendation being to use \"delineate\" instead of \"define\" for the boundaries of an area. OMB declared the notice effective immediately but did not issue lists of the actual delineations until February 28, 2013. Newly delineated NECTAs and their components were also issued. The 2010 standards for delineating core-based statistical areas, including metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas, were announced by OMB on February 28, 2013. Census Bureau data are used to generate specific areas based on population, employment, and commuting data. CBSAs consist of counties with at least one core of 10,000 population and adjacent counties with social and economic integration. Counties not qualifying for CBSAs are classified separately. The 2010 standards for delineating core-based statistical areas, including metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas, were announced by OMB on February 28, 2013. CBSAs consist of counties with at least one core of 10,000 population and adjacent counties with social and economic integration. OMB's standards also include delineating New England city and town areas, known as NECTAs, which are not county-based and are important for the six-state census division. CBSAs must contain urbanized areas of at least 50,000 population or urban clusters of at least 10,000 population, categorized as metropolitan or micropolitan areas. According to the criteria, metropolitan statistical areas have urbanized areas of 50,000 or more people, while micropolitan statistical areas have urban clusters of at least 10,000 but fewer than 50,000 people. New England city and town areas, like CBSAs, contain urbanized areas or urban clusters and are classified as either \"metropolitan\" or \"micropolitan.\" CBSAs have principal cities with a population of at least 10,000 people, or the most populous place with a population of at least 250,000 people. The criteria for designating metropolitan statistical areas include urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more, while micropolitan statistical areas have urban clusters with populations of 10,000 to 50,000. CBSAs have principal cities with populations of at least 10,000 or the most populous place with a population of at least 250,000. Central counties in CBSAs have specific criteria for designation based on population size and urban areas. To qualify as an outlying county of a CBSA, a county must meet criteria related to commuting patterns, such as a percentage of employed residents working in the central county or vice versa. Counties within a CBSA must be contiguous, and a county can only be included in one CBSA. If a county qualifies as central in one CBSA and outlying in another, it is assigned to the central CBSA. If a county qualifies as outlying in multiple CBSAs, it is assigned to the CBSA with the strongest commuting tie. The 2010 standards interpret the terms \"merge\" and \"combine\" similar to the 2000 standards. The 2010 standards interpret the terms \"merge\" and \"combine\" differently. Two merged CBSAs form a single entity, while combined CBSAs remain individual entities within a combined statistical area. CBSAs are merged if the central counties of one qualify as outlying to the central counties of the other based on commuting criteria. Adjacent CBSAs may form a combined statistical area based on the \"employment interchange measure,\" which combines percentages of employed residents working in each other's CBSAs. The 2010 standards require automatic combination of two CBSAs under certain conditions. The 2010 standards for combining CBSAs lower the threshold for automatic combination if the employment interchange measure is 15 or higher. Unlike the 2000 standards, local opinion is no longer considered in the decision-making process. This change was made to achieve a consistent national approach and enhance the value of data produced by Federal agencies. The 2000 standards for metropolitan statistical areas allow for subdivision into metropolitan divisions based on population size and employment criteria. Main counties have at least 65% of employed residents working within the county, while secondary counties have 50-65% employment within the county. The standards for metropolitan statistical areas include criteria for main and secondary counties based on employment percentages. Secondary counties must have a high employment interchange measure with a contiguous main county to qualify. NECTA divisions are formed within NECTAs with a single urbanized area of at least 2.5 million people, with specific population size requirements for each division. The title of each CBSA, NECTA, metropolitan division, and NECTA division includes the name of its principal city with the largest 2010 census population. If the area or division has several principal cities, the name of the most populous appears first, followed by the second and third largest. Exceptions are noted below. If the most populous principal city of a CBSA is a census designated place, the title lists, first, the name of the largest incorporated place with 10,000 or more people that is a principal city and, second, the name of the CDP. If a metropolitan division does not have any principal cities, the title lists the names of no more than three of the division's most populous counties, from largest to smallest. If a NECTA division does not have any principal cities, the title lists the names of no more than three of its most populous cities or towns, from largest to smallest. The title of a combined statistical area includes the names of its two most populous. The 2010 standards for naming combined statistical areas do not consider local opinion, ensuring national consistency. OMB released lists of CBSAs and NECTAs delineated according to the 2010 standards in February 2013. Future designations will be based on updated population figures from special censuses conducted since the 2010 census. Special censuses have been conducted for specific localities since the 2010 census and from the Census Bureau's annual population estimates, and on five-year employment and commuting data from the American Community Survey. OMB plans to review, in 2018, \"the delineations of all existing CBSAs and related statistical areas,\" taking into account five-year, 2011 through 2015, ACS employment and commuting data, and designating any new areas indicated by this review. OMB commented in 2000 that the success of metropolitan area designations was evident from their widespread application, including \"to inform the debate and development of public policies and ... to implement and administer a variety of nonstatistical Federal programs.\" As OMB stated then and reiterated in issuing the 2010 standards, however, the purpose of the standards always has been strictly statistical. \"The classification provides a nationally consistent set of delineations for collecting, tabulating, and publishing. The OMB provides consistent delineations for collecting Federal statistics for geographic areas, without considering nonstatistical uses. Agencies and policymakers are urged to carefully review nonstatistical programs to ensure appropriate geographic entities are used for Federal fund allocation. Beneficiary eligibility for federal grant programs is determined based on specific criteria, such as population size in rural areas or job loss in defense industries. Examples include Rural Housing Preservation Grants for non-Metropolitan Statistical Areas with populations below 10,000 and Community Economic Adjustment Assistance for areas experiencing significant employee job reductions. Eligibility for federal grant programs is based on specific criteria related to job loss in different areas. For example, to qualify for assistance, a local action must result in the loss of a certain number of employee positions based on the area's classification as a Metropolitan Statistical Area or a rural census tract within an MSA. Determining the exact amount of money distributed through federal grant programs using metropolitan area designations is challenging due to the lack of a straightforward method to identify all programs that use these designations. The CFDA's program descriptions do not provide enough detail to determine eligibility factors for applicants or beneficiaries accurately. Determining the amount of money distributed through federal grant programs using metropolitan area designations is challenging. The CFDA search results do not accurately reflect the reliance on metropolitan area designations in program funding distribution. Federal transportation and housing funds, such as HUD's Community Development Block Grants, are examples of programs affected by MSA designations. The CFDA program descriptions lack detail in determining eligibility for applicants or beneficiaries. The difficulty of determining federal grant program reliance on MSA data is illustrated through examples provided. CFDA program descriptions may use \"Metropolitan Areas\" interchangeably with \"metropolitan statistical areas.\" Highway program descriptions in the CFDA may not include these exact phrases. An example is the Community Development Block Grant Program for Entitlement Communities, where recipients are states and cities in Metropolitan Areas designated by OMB. The CFDA program 20.205, Highway Planning and Construction, requires projects in urban areas with a population of 50,000 or more to be based on transportation planning by a Metropolitan Planning Organization. Determining which programs use metropolitan area designations would involve reviewing statutes, regulations, and formulas. The Government Accountability Office conducted a partial review using terms like \"metropolitan statistical area\" and \"MSA\" in 2004. The Government Accountability Office conducted a partial review in 2004 to search the U.S. Code for programs using metropolitan area designations. GAO identified 32 programs in the Code that use these terms and mentioned how new standards could impact program funds. GAO suggested consulting the CFR for a longer list of programs and contacting program staff for more information. CFDA provides contact information for listed programs. The Government Accountability Office identified 32 programs in the U.S. Code that use metropolitan area designations. Determining the impact of inclusion or exclusion from these areas on federal grant funds would require a program-by-program investigation. GAO's 2004 report detailed the effects of new standards on programs such as HUD's Community Development Block Grants and HHS's Medicare payment system. The Government Accountability Office identified 32 programs in the U.S. Code that use metropolitan area designations. To determine the impact of new standards on these programs, GAO reviewed relevant documentation, attended public hearings, and interviewed agency officials. Replicating this effort for all programs would be challenging due to resource constraints and potential incomplete results."
