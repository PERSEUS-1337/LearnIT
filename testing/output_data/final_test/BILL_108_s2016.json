    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Infant Crib Safety Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. The Infant Crib Safety Act highlights the serious threat of infant injuries and deaths in cribs. Over 11,500 children under 2 are injured annually, with at least 26 deaths in children under 4. The design and construction of cribs must ensure safety for unattended infants. The cost to society from crib-related deaths is estimated at $150,000,000 per year. Secondhand, hand-me-down, and heirloom cribs are a concern as many infants are placed in them, leading to most crib deaths. Current legislation is insufficient to address the hazards posed by these types of cribs. Prohibiting the sale of unsafe secondhand cribs can prevent injuries and deaths. The Act aims to prevent injuries and deaths to infants by prohibiting the sale of unsafe cribs, including secondhand, hand-me-down, and heirloom cribs. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"commercial user\" in this Act refers to individuals involved in manufacturing, selling, or dealing with full-size or nonfull-size cribs, including those in child care facilities or family child care homes. The term \"commercial user\" refers to individuals involved in selling or reselling full-size or nonfull-size cribs, excluding private one-time sales. A crib is defined as a full-size or nonfull-size baby crib, with specific regulations for full-size cribs. An infant is defined as a person under 35 inches tall or under 2 years old. A nonfull-size crib is defined as a nonfull-size baby crib according to specific regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIBS. Manufacture and Sale of Cribs: It is illegal for commercial users to sell unsafe cribs for infants. Lodging facilities cannot offer or provide unsafe cribs. All cribs must adhere to safety standards. Unsafe cribs, including size crib, portable crib, playpen, or play yard, are presumed unsafe if they do not conform to specific safety standards outlined in federal regulations and ASTM consumer safety specifications. The regulations and standards for baby cribs include ASTM F966, Part 1303 of title 16 CFR, and any amendments or additional regulations. Exceptions apply to cribs not intended for infant use, such as toys or display items. The Consumer Product Safety Commission enforces regulations regarding baby cribs, declaring them dangerous for infants if not intended for infant use. Violations are subject to penalties under the Consumer Product Safety Act. The Act will be effective 90 days after its enactment."
