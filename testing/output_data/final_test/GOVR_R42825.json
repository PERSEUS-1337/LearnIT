    "content": "Public health stakeholders have successfully advocated for state and local policies on restaurant menu nutrition labeling due to rising obesity rates and increased food consumption outside the home. Businesses are now in support of a consistent national policy on menu labeling requirements. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act amended FDA nutrition labeling requirements to include chain restaurants and vending machines, previously exempt from such regulations. The report discusses the FDA's authority over nutrition labeling, the ACA's provision for restaurant menu labeling, and issues surrounding the interpretation of this provision. Obesity rates have increased significantly, with excess energy intake being a primary cause. The rise in obesity rates is linked to increased calorie consumption and decreased physical activity, leading to health issues like diabetes and high blood pressure, especially affecting low-income individuals and minorities. The government has implemented programs and legislation to promote nutrition and physical activity, while states and local lawmakers have proposed measures like taxation and calorie labeling to address the issue. Studies show a correlation between rising obesity rates and increased calorie intake in the United States. The rise in obesity rates in the United States is linked to increased calorie consumption, with 32% of calories coming from foods consumed outside the home. Consumers tend to underestimate calorie content in restaurant meals, leading to the adoption of calorie labeling on menus to raise awareness. This labeling has been shown to change consumer behavior by reducing the selection of higher-calorie items. Menu labeling on restaurant menus has gained support as a policy option for obesity prevention. It has been endorsed by public health organizations and implemented in various jurisdictions, such as New York City and California. The approach aims to inform consumers about calorie content and has been shown to influence their food choices. The New Jersey and New York City menu labeling laws require chain restaurants with 20 or more locations to display calorie content. The restaurant industry finds complying with varying local laws burdensome. Research suggests menu labeling helps consumers lower calorie intake. In New York City, one in six fast food consumers used posted calorie information and purchased 106 fewer calories. In King County, Washington, nutrition labeling laws led to lower calorie, saturated fat, and sodium content in chain restaurant entrees. The long-term impact of state and local menu labeling regulations on obesity rates is not widely studied. Variable regulations have prompted industry support for a national menu labeling policy. Major industry groups like the National Restaurant Association backed the menu labeling provision in the ACA. McDonald's announced calorie information on all menu boards. FDA and USDA oversee food safety and labeling. FDA regulates food products under the 1938 FFDCA and Nutrition Labeling Act. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA) amended the FFDCA to give FDA authority over nutrition labeling. The ACA further expanded FDA's authority to regulate nutrition labeling for restaurants, SRFEs, and vending machines in chains of 20 or more. FDA can create nutrition labeling requirements for most foods and regulate health claims on food labels under the FFDCA. The FDA has the authority to regulate nutrition labeling and health claims on food labels under the FFDCA. Foods may be deemed misbranded if health and nutrition claims are not made according to FDA regulations. The agency can take enforcement actions against companies that fail to comply, including warning letters, seizures, injunctions, civil monetary penalties, and prosecution. The FFDCA grants the FDA authority to regulate nutrition labeling on food labels, including total calories per serving and nutrient information. It also allows the Secretary to modify nutrient information requirements. The FFDCA has provisions for preemption of state and local nutrition labeling laws and exemptions for certain foods, such as infant formula and foods with packaging too small to comply with labeling requirements. Prior to the passage of the ACA, certain categories of food were exempt from nutrition labeling requirements, including food served in restaurants for immediate consumption and food processed primarily in retail establishments. Food sales under $50,000 annually are also exempt unless a health or nutrition claim is made. Foods with insignificant amounts of required nutrients may use a simplified labeling format. The ACA amended FDA authorities to require restaurants, SRFE, and vending machine operators to provide calorie and nutrient information. It applies to chain restaurants or SRFE with 20 or more locations offering standard menu items. The ACA amended FDA authorities to require chain restaurants and SRFE with 20 or more locations to disclose calorie and nutrient information on menus and menu boards. This includes providing calorie information for self-service food and other specified nutrition information upon request. The law also mandates that nutrient content disclosures have a \"reasonable basis.\" The ACA amended FDA authorities to require chain restaurants and SRFE with 20 or more locations to disclose calorie and nutrient information on menus and menu boards. This includes providing calorie information for self-service food and other specified nutrition information upon request. The law also mandates that nutrient content disclosures have a \"reasonable basis,\" such as nutrient databases, cookbooks, or laboratory analyses. HHS must establish standards for determining and disclosing nutrient content for standard menu items, including combo meals. Exemptions include items not listed on menus, daily specials, custom orders, and food items being market-tested. The provision also addresses federal preemption of state and local laws on nutrition labeling in restaurants and SRFE. The FDA was required to promulgate regulations within one year of enactment and provide quarterly reports to congressional committees on progress. The FDA was required by the ACA to promulgate regulations for disclosing nutrient content on menus for chain restaurants and similar retail food establishments with 20 or more locations. This included standards for disclosing nutrient content for menu items, registration rules for establishments voluntarily providing nutrition information, and the format for nutrient content disclosure. Factors to consider included recipe standardization, ingredient variation, menu space, and preparation methods. The FDA published preliminary regulatory impact analyses (PRIA) for restaurant menu nutrition labeling and vending machine calorie labeling in 2011. The proposed rules for restaurant nutrition labeling and calorie labeling of food in vending machines generated numerous comments from industry, Members of Congress, and the public. The FDA published preliminary regulatory impact analyses for restaurant menu nutrition labeling and vending machine calorie labeling in 2011. The proposed rule set requirements for covered restaurants and SRFE to implement the rule, provided detail for voluntary registration of establishments, and outlined enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance. Public comments were invited until July 5, 2011, with a final rule expected by the end of 2012. The proposed rule for restaurant menu nutrition labeling and vending machine calorie labeling under the ACA raised concerns about definitions, scope of covered establishments, cost implications, and accessibility of information to consumers. Industry and congressional responses to these concerns were also discussed. The FDA has proposed two options for defining \"restaurants or similar retail food establishments\" under the ACA's nutrition labeling requirements. Option 1 would exempt movie theaters, amusement parks, hotels, and transportation carriers. Option 2 would also exempt grocery and convenience stores. The debate over the inclusion of supermarkets and convenience stores in the definition of covered establishments under the proposed FDA regulations has sparked controversy. Some argue for a narrow interpretation to exclude retail entities, citing the perceived burden outweighing the benefits. Others believe the proposed options are either too broad or too narrow, leading to differing opinions on the scope of covered establishments. Some argue for a broader definition of covered establishments, including grocery and convenience stores, movie theaters, bowling alleys, and bookstore cafes. Legislation has been introduced to define establishments that derive more than 50% of their revenue from restaurant-type food. Congress intended the law to apply to all retail food establishments selling food to consumers, regardless of floor space or percentage of food sales. Some argue for a broader definition of covered establishments, including grocery and convenience stores, movie theaters, and entertainment venues. Industry groups feel that the FDA has overstepped its authority by including grocery stores in the rule, citing disproportionate burden and questioning the agency's regulatory scope. State and local menu labeling regulations generally do not apply to grocery stores. The congressional intent behind the provision in the ACA was debated, with some arguing for a broader scope to include supermarkets and convenience stores in menu labeling laws. Some establishments have already started implementing menu labeling, such as McDonald's announcing calorie information on all menu boards. The ACA requires covered establishments to provide calorie and nutrition information on all restaurant and drive-thru menu boards. Certain foods, such as custom orders, daily specials, temporary menu items, part of a customary market test, and condiments, are exempt from labeling requirements. The proposed rule for menu labeling specifies foods that require labeling, exempts certain foods, defines restaurant-type food, and excludes alcoholic beverages. The grocery industry disagrees with the definition of restaurant-type food, especially regarding grab-and-go items. Grocers are concerned about the interpretation of \"variable menu items\" due to seasonal variations in composition. The FDA estimates that grocery stores would have about half the number of menu items requiring nutrition labeling compared to restaurants. The grocery industry argues that more items would be affected by the rule due to self-service and display food. The proposed rule clarifies concepts from the ACA, requiring calorie information on menus and menu boards, with other nutrition information available upon request. Calorie information must be placed next to the menu item name, either in a separate column or listed next to each item. The rule aims to provide clear association between the menu item and its calorie content. The FDA proposes that menu boards must display calorie information next to each item and provide written nutrition information for menu items. The term \"primary writing\" should be interpreted from a customer's perspective, including drive-through menus, take-out menus, and online information used for ordering. There is concern about the FDA's interpretation of \"primary writing.\" The FDA's interpretation of \"primary writing\" has raised concerns, with varying opinions on its application based on the type of establishment. Pizza companies argue against in-store menu labeling, while grocery stores suggest making online nutrition information voluntary. There is a discrepancy between the FDA and industry on the cost burden of providing menu board information, with estimates ranging from $550 to $1,500 per board. The ACA requires covered establishments to disclose calorie information on menus and menu boards, with costs ranging up to $1,500 per board. The FDA proposes a statement on daily recommended calorie intake to be displayed alongside menu items. The FDA proposed rule requires covered establishments to declare calories on menus and menu boards to the nearest 5 or 10-calorie increment. They also requested feedback on different options for disclosing calorie and nutrient content for standard menu items. All nutrient content disclosures must have a reasonable basis. Estimates of per item cost for determining nutrition information vary widely, with FDA proposing a cost of $269 per item while industry groups estimate $500 to $1,000. The FDA suggests using the \"80-120 rule\" for calorie disclosure, allowing a narrow deviation between posted and actual calorie content. In restaurant food preparation, adherence to calorie disclosure rules is challenging due to human variability and individual order preparation. The FDA exempted restaurant food from NLEA regulations in 1993, citing wide variation as a reason. The restaurant industry argues that a stricter standard may deter smaller operators from participating in menu labeling voluntarily. Calorie counts are also difficult to determine in grocery stores for items not pre-portioned. Certain items in restaurants, SRFE, and other establishments are not always pre-portioned, leading to non-standardized servings. Some argue that items like pizza and buckets of fried chicken should be labeled per portion rather than as a whole. The FDA lacks mandatory recall authority for misbranded food due to nutrition labeling, and enforcement of certain provisions has been delayed. The FDA can deem foods misbranded if health and nutrition claims are not made according to regulations. The FDA lacks mandatory recall authority for misbranded food unless it is deemed misbranded under allergen labeling regulations. Food companies are relied upon to voluntarily recall unsafe products. The FDA provides a six-month compliance window for restaurants and SRFE in the proposed rule, with industry representatives requesting a one-year timeline. Failure to comply will result in food being deemed misbranded. The accuracy of restaurant calorie information may be determined using the same standards as packaged foods if the 80-120 rule is included in the final rule. The FDA's final determination on compliance timelines and enforcement activities for calorie and nutrition information regulations will impact costs and scope. Concerns about implementation costs have been raised, including the burden on businesses. The potential public health benefits of the rule may also be considered, though quantifying these benefits is challenging. The FDA's PRIA identifies three main cost elements for the rule. The FDA estimates the initial cost of compliance with the proposed rule at $315 million, with ongoing annual costs of $44 million. Industry estimates the cost to exceed $1 billion in the first year. FDA notes that 27% of chain restaurants have already obtained nutrition information to comply with state and local regulations. The Office of Management is to review the regulations to ensure consistency with Executive Orders 12866. The economic burden of obesity is projected to rise, with over half of Americans expected to be obese by 2030. Obesity is linked to increased risks of various health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. It also leads to decreased productivity at work. The societal cost of obesity has been estimated in multiple studies. The societal cost of obesity is estimated to be significant, with obesity accounting for 1% to 10% of a country's total healthcare costs. Obese individuals have medical costs that are 30% higher than those of normal weight. A study by AHRQ and CDC estimated the annual medical cost of obesity to be as high as $78.5 billion in 1998, with half of the cost financed by Medicare and Medicaid. The true cost and savings from obesity prevention policies are challenging to determine due to the complexity of factors contributing to obesity. The effectiveness of interventions like menu labeling in reducing obesity rates is difficult to isolate due to the complexity of factors contributing to obesity. Researchers and policymakers need to monitor changes in individuals' behavior and obesity rates over time, considering other factors like the time needed for weight loss programs to show an effect on chronic disease costs."
