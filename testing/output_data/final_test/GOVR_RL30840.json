It is the highest coordinative and advisory body in national security matters, with a statutory role unlike the President's Cabinet. This study reviews the NSC's organizational history and its changing role in national security policy. The National Security Council (NSC) plays a crucial role in U.S. national security policymaking. The NSC's work is highly sensitive and classified, limiting available sources. It is important to distinguish between the NSC's statutory membership and its staff. Successful national security policymaking involves careful analysis of various factors to achieve goals through military, diplomatic, economic, or intelligence means. The National Security Council (NSC) was established in the early 1940s to support U.S. Presidents in making national security decisions during wartime and postwar periods. This organizational entity ensured coordination between the State, War, and Navy Departments to address military and diplomatic challenges. The United States established organizational mechanisms to analyze the international environment, identify priorities, and recommend appropriate policy options in the postwar years. This included active diplomacy, sizable military forces, sophisticated intelligence agencies, and economic assistance. The end of the Cold War brought new international concerns like international terrorism and drug trafficking, requiring coordination of various departments and agencies for national security policies. These coordinative mechanisms largely influence Congress in supporting and funding policy choices. Throughout most of US history, policy coordination was centered on the President, who had broad powers in foreign affairs and as Commander-in-Chief. Effective coordination of national security policy is crucial to achieving policy goals with minimal losses of human lives and resources. Congress takes interest in these processes as poor coordination can lead to costly actions without successful outcomes. The President historically had broad powers in foreign affairs and as Commander-in-Chief. However, with the increasing complexity of modern military efforts, the Council of National Defense was established in 1916 to provide additional coordination in national security policy. The Council of National Defense, established in 1916, was a coordinating group for economic mobilization. It excluded the Secretary of State and focused on economic issues. Disbanded in 1921, it set a precedent for future coordinative efforts in World War II. The President was the sole national security coordinator until 1938 when the prewar crisis intensified. The State Department proposed interdepartmental conferences in response to Axis activities in Latin America. In 1938, Secretary of State Cordell Hull proposed the creation of a Standing Liaison Committee with representatives from the War and Navy Departments. This committee, consisting of the Under Secretary of State, Chief of Staff of the Army, and Chief of Naval Operations, focused on coordinating efforts, particularly in Latin America. Despite its limited and irregular meetings, the committee conducted valuable studies during the crisis after the fall of France. The Standing Liaison Committee, proposed by Secretary of State Cordell Hull in 1938, focused on coordinating efforts, particularly in Latin America. It conducted valuable studies during the crisis after the fall of France. However, it was soon replaced by other coordinating mechanisms. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson established informal weekly meetings with his Navy counterpart, Frank Knox, which did not fully meet the growing coordinative needs of the wartime government. In May 1940, President Roosevelt established the National Defense Advisory Council (NDAC) composed of private citizens with expertise in specific economic sectors to handle problems of economic mobilization. During World War II, various interdepartmental committees were formed to address issues, but they lacked direct access to advising the President. Instead, they advised his advisers, leading to a fragmented approach to coordination. President Roosevelt primarily ran the war through the Joint Chiefs of Staff and key advisers, such as Harry Hopkins and James F. Byrnes. The State, War, Navy Coordinating Committee (SWNCC) was formed in 1945 to coordinate politico-military matters among the State, War, and Navy departments. It had regional and topical subcommittees and improved civilian-military liaison during World War II. SWNCC operated through the end of the war but did not address fundamental national policy questions in the early Cold War months. The State, War, Navy Coordinating Committee (SWNCC) was formed in 1945 to coordinate politico-military matters among the State, War, and Navy departments during the early Cold War. It operated through the end of the war and beyond, becoming SANACC after the National Security Act of 1947. SWNCC's creation and continued existence reflected the need for better coordination within the federal government due to the complex demands of global war and the post-war world. The National Security Council (NSC) was created as part of a larger restructuring of the national security apparatus after World War II. General George C. Marshall proposed a unified military establishment in 1943, leading to the creation of the NSC in the National Security Act of 1947. The NSC was less controversial than military unification and attracted less attention. Congress began considering the idea in 1944, with the Army in favor and the Navy opposed. President Truman and Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal were involved in the process. In 1945, Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal realized President Truman favored reorganization of the national security apparatus. He tasked Ferdinand Eberstadt to investigate the problem, focusing on the formation of the NSC and how to effectively protect national security. Eberstadt's recommendations for national security included the formation of the National Security Council (NSC) and the National Security Resources Board (NSRB), as well as the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) under the NSC. These suggestions laid the groundwork for the eventual national security apparatus, with the exception of a unified Department of Defense. The National Security Council (NSC) was created as part of the reorganization desired by the Navy, involving the State Department and aiming to avoid the need for military services' coalescence. It served as a negotiating point for Forrestal with the Army, building public support for foreign and military policies. War-Navy negotiations on reorganization took place in 1946 and 1947, with the NSC being one of the least controversial sections agreed upon by the end of the year. The National Security Council (NSC) was created as part of the reorganization desired by the Navy to coordinate national security policy. The NSC was one of the least controversial sections of the National Security Act, focusing on its mechanics, membership, and civilian nature. It was established by the Act signed on July 26, 1947, with a purpose outlined in Section 101 of Title I. The National Security Council (NSC) was created to advise the President on integrating domestic, foreign, and military policies for national security coordination. It assesses US objectives, commitments, and risks related to military power to make recommendations to the President. The National Security Council (NSC) advises the President on national security matters and makes recommendations. Members include the President, Secretaries of State and Defense, and other designated officers. Senate approval is required for further expansion. The National Security Act established the National Security Council (NSC) to advise the President on national security matters. The NSC was given a staff headed by a civilian executive secretary and oversaw the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency. It also set up the National Military Establishment under a Secretary of Defense. The act implied that the NSC would play a role in ensuring the U.S. industrial base could support national security strategies. However, over time, issues with defense mobilization and civil matters arose. The National Security Council (NSC) was initially focused on economic mobilization during World War I but evolved to address national security policy. It brought together top diplomatic, military, and resource personnel with the President, and the addition of the CIA provided necessary intelligence. The NSC was an improvement over past coordination methods and served as an advisory body to the President. The NSC, as an advisory body to the President, was designed to be flexible and adaptable to each President's style and preferences. President Truman initially attended NSC meetings but later delegated the Secretary of State as chairman, reflecting his belief in the State Department's importance. The NSC focused on studying problems and making recommendations rather than setting policy or coordinating implementation. Meetings became more regular in May 1948, with a schedule of twice a month. In May 1948, NSC meetings became more regular, with a schedule of twice a month. The Hoover Commission's review in January 1949 found that the NSC was not fully meeting coordination needs. Recommendations included better liaison between NSC and JCS, the Secretary of Defense becoming an NSC member, and clarifying roles and liaison. President Truman directed the Secretary of the Treasury to attend all NSC meetings in January 1949. Amendments to the National Security Act were passed in August 1949. In August 1949, amendments to the National Security Act (P.L. 81-216) changed the NSC membership to include the President, Vice President, Secretaries of State and Defense, and Chairman of the National Security Resources Board. The JCS were designated as the principal military advisers to the President. The NSC became part of the Executive Office of the President by Reorganization Plan No. 4. The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 led to increased reliance on the NSC system, with Truman chairing most meetings between June 1950 and January 1953. Truman chaired the majority of NSC meetings between June 1950 and January 1953, making it the focal point of national security decision making. Despite its limited role, Truman continued to seek advice from other sources. Eisenhower later revitalized the NSC, expanding its staff and establishing clear lines of responsibility and authority. Eisenhower revitalized the NSC by establishing clear lines of responsibility and authority, resembling Eberstadt's original conception. Meetings were held weekly with key participants including the Secretary of the Treasury, Budget Director, Chairman of the JCS, and Director of Central Intelligence. Eisenhower created the position of Special Assistant for National Security Affairs to supervise the NSC and provide advice to the President. Eisenhower established the NSC Planning Board and the Operations Coordinating Board to coordinate national security policy implementation. The NSC membership changed during his administration, with the establishment of the Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities in response to recommendations. The Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities was established by Executive Order 10656 to provide independent evaluations of U.S. foreign intelligence efforts. It lapsed at the end of the Eisenhower Administration but was replaced by the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) by President Kennedy after the Bay of Pigs failure. PFIAB was abolished in 1977 but resurrected during the Reagan Administration in 1981. Members are selected by the President and serve at his discretion. The NSC under Eisenhower handled an increasing volume of matters, including comprehensive assessments of national security strategy for military planning and foreign policymaking. The NSC under Eisenhower faced criticism for prioritizing quantity over quality, being too large and inflexible, and lacking innovative national security ideas. Despite these issues, it established policies that shaped U.S. national security for decades. Towards the end of Eisenhower's term, the NSC process became bureaucratic, possibly due to the President's declining health. Senate hearings in 1960-1961 led to proposals for reform. The Operations Committee in 1960-1961, led by Senator Henry Jackson, proposed reorienting the NSC to a smaller, less formal structure to offer the President clear alternatives on major issues. Eisenhower found NSC procedures burdensome, but believed in consensus-building for effective policy implementation. NSC meetings sharpened Eisenhower's thinking by presenting alternative viewpoints for consideration. President John Kennedy accepted many recommendations from the Jackson Committee and dismantled much of the NSC structure, reducing it to its statutory base. Staff work was carried out by various departments and agencies, with personal contacts and ad hoc task forces becoming the main vehicles for policy discussion. Kennedy's National Security Adviser, McGeorge Bundy, played a significant policy role directly under the President, marking a shift from the traditional role of a neutral keeper of the machinery. Kennedy's National Security Adviser, McGeorge Bundy, took on an active policymaking role due to the absence of a defined NSC process. Kennedy met regularly with NSC members and the DCI, but not in formal sessions. The Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, was initially considered the second most important national security official, but the State Department fell short in fulfilling this role. The NSC was reduced in size at the beginning of the Kennedy Administration. During the Kennedy Administration, the NSC underwent organizational changes, with a focus on current operations and crisis management. Special ad hoc bodies like the Executive Committee (ExCom) were formed, notably during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. Kennedy added the Director of the Office of Emergency Planning to the NSC, emphasizing the coordination of emergency management resources. The new approach prioritized action over planning, with National Security Action Memoranda (NSAMs) replacing weighty policy papers. The NSC underwent organizational changes during the Kennedy Administration, focusing on current operations and crisis management. Special ad hoc bodies like the Executive Committee (ExCom) were formed, notably during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Planning Board and Operations Control Board were abolished to avoid the distinction between planning and operations. The NSC staff was reduced, and outside policy experts were brought in to assist the President without superseding high officials in executive departments. Responsibilities for operation, coordination, and diplomatic relations were delegated to the Department of State. The Kennedy Administration made organizational changes to the NSC, focusing on current operations and crisis management. Critics argued that the system lacked form, direction, coordination, and control. Kennedy's approach to the presidency depended on a staff under his oversight to handle tasks he couldn't do himself. In retrospect, Kennedy's system relied on his active involvement and interest in the presidency. Critics suggest that the informal methods led to failures like the Bay of Pigs and confusion in U.S. policy. Johnson, who succeeded Kennedy, initially continued to rely on Kennedy's system and personnel due to his limited knowledge of national security. Johnson sought advice from various sources, including the Secretaries of State and Defense. Under Johnson, the institutional system heavily relied on Secretaries of State and Defense, Dean Rusk and Robert McNamara. A study led by General Maxwell Taylor in 1966 resulted in NSAM 341, enhancing the State Department's role in policy planning. This led to the formation of interagency committees, with the Senior Interdepartmental Group (SIG) being the most important, consisting of key members from various departments. Under Johnson, the NSC system saw changes with the role of the NSC staff becoming more restricted, budget and personnel declining, and key decisions, especially regarding the Vietnam War, being made during Tuesday lunches attended by the President, Secretaries of State and Defense. Walt W. Rostow replaced Bundy as Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs in 1966. The NSC system under Johnson saw changes with the role of the NSC staff becoming more restricted. The SIG/IRG system, dominated by the State Department, did not fulfill its objectives and lacked decisive leadership. Vagueness in authority and insufficient resources hampered its effectiveness, leading to the NSC existing largely in name by 1969. Johnson relied on a wide range of advisers within and outside government for constant consultation. President Richard Nixon's approach to national security organization was influenced by his experience in the Eisenhower Administration. He revived the NSC with a focus on long-range planning and clear policy options. Nixon preferred distinct options over consensus opinions, similar to Eisenhower's framework but with a goal of effective implementation. President Richard Nixon's national security organization approach was influenced by Eisenhower, focusing on long-range planning and clear policy options. Nixon streamlined the NSC procedures, revived the position of Assistant for National Security Affairs filled by Henry Kissinger, limited NSC meetings to statutory members, and reduced the influence of the State Department, with Kissinger's influence predominating. Six interdepartmental groups supported the NSC, preparing studies and policy options. Four major new bodies were created under Kissinger's influence: Washington Special Action Group (WASAG) for contingency planning, NSC Intelligence Committee for national intelligence guidance, Defense Program Review Committee for defense and domestic resource allocation integration, and Senior Policy Review Group for policy studies. During Nixon's administration, Kissinger played a dominant role in the NSC, leading to criticism of over centralization and domination. He competed with the State Department for control of foreign policy and stifled dissent within the national security apparatus. Kissinger's involvement in shuttle diplomacy and the Watergate scandal further highlighted his significant influence. Kissinger's dominance in the NSC during Nixon's administration led to criticism for centralization and stifling dissent. His involvement in shuttle diplomacy and the Watergate scandal emphasized his significant influence, despite criticism for undercutting State Department responsibilities and bypassing congressional oversight. Kissinger's power stemmed from his intellectual abilities, bureaucratic skills, and support from a President eager to act boldly in international affairs. During President Nixon's administration, the NSC regained a central role in national security policy formation. President Ford made no major changes to the system, with Kissinger being replaced as National Security Adviser by Scowcroft. Kissinger continued to dominate the policy process, reflecting his preeminence and Ford's limited foreign policy experience. The Murphy Commission issued a report in June 1975 on improving foreign policy formulation and implementation. The Murphy Commission report in 1975 recommended changes to the NSC structure, including limiting the role of NSC staff, giving the President line responsibility, expanding the NSC's scope to include international economic policy, and inviting domestic policy officials to meetings when relevant. The Commission also discussed alternative structures and their pros and cons. The Murphy Commission report in 1975 recommended changes to the NSC structure, including limiting the role of NSC staff, expanding its scope, and inviting domestic policy officials to meetings. President Ford issued Executive Order 11905 in February 1976, reorganizing the intelligence community and reaffirming NSC's policy control. Some changes were made in the NSC sub-structure, including the abolition of the NSC Intelligence Committee. The NSC underwent reorganization under Executive Order 11905 in February 1976, which included abolishing the NSC Intelligence Committee and replacing the 40 Committee with the Operations Advisory Group. Additionally, the Intelligence Oversight Board was created to review the legality of intelligence operations. President Ford vetoed a bill in December 1975 that would have made the Treasury Secretary a statutory member of the NSC. The NSC underwent reorganization under Executive Order 11905 in February 1976, which included abolishing the NSC Intelligence Committee and replacing the 40 Committee with the Operations Advisory Group. President Ford vetoed a bill in December 1975 that would have made the Treasury Secretary a statutory member of the NSC. Kissinger's loss of his dual position did not lessen his influence over the policy process, leading critics to charge that this change was largely cosmetic. Brent Scowcroft, the new National Security Adviser, was unlikely to challenge Kissinger's pre-eminence. Critics continued to maintain that the Ford Administration decision making was secretive, impervious to congressional input, and out of touch with public opinion. Under President Jimmy Carter, steps were taken to end the dominant role of the NSC staff and make it a more coequal and cooperating partner with the Departments of State and Defense. The NSC underwent reorganization in the new Administration under President Carter to make it a more coequal partner with the Departments of State and Defense. The number of NSC staff committees was reduced from seven to two, the Policy Review Committee (PRC) and the Special Coordination Committee (SCC), with specific responsibilities assigned to each. The NSC underwent reorganization under President Carter to become a more equal partner with the Departments of State and Defense. The Policy Review Committee (PRC) was responsible for issues with international implications, including defense policy, intelligence budget, and foreign intelligence requirements. Executive Order 12036 added the responsibility for establishing national foreign intelligence priorities and evaluations. The PRC included the Vice President, Secretaries of State and Defense, and the Assistant for National Security Affairs. The Policy Review Committee (PRC) included key officials like the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. The Special Coordination Committee (SCC) handled cross-cutting issues and replaced WASAG and the Operations Advisory Group. The SCC was responsible for sensitive foreign intelligence collection operations and counterintelligence. The Special Coordination Committee (SCC) replaced WASAG and the Operations Advisory Group, chaired by the Assistant for National Security Affairs with key members including the Vice President, Secretaries of State and Defense, and the DCI. The NSC's role shifted to policy coordination and a \"think tank\" under the Carter Administration, with a reduced staff and a more collegial approach to procedures established by National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. The SCC replaced previous committees on the NSC staff, focusing on crisis management functions and reducing PRC meetings. Rivalry between Brzezinski and Secretary of State Vance increased over differences in responses to international issues, contributing to weak policies in the Carter Administration. Carter's NSC staff faced internal conflicts between Brzezinski and Vance, leading to policy stalemates. Vance resigned due to disagreements, and Brzezinski's outspoken role raised calls for closer congressional oversight. Infighting among Carter loyalists and Mondale's staff also occurred. After internal conflicts in Carter's NSC staff, Reagan criticized the Carter Administration's divisions and promised Cabinet leadership. Reagan's NSC faced challenges in implementing this change, leading to delays and bureaucratic infighting. A Presidential Directive (NSDD-2) enhanced the State Department's role in national security policymaking and reduced the National Security Adviser's influence. NSC sub-committees were now chaired by State, Defense, and CIA officials, not NSC staff. Reagan's NSC included three Senior Interagency Groups (SIGs) for foreign policy, chaired by the Deputy Secretary of State. The NSC under Reagan included Senior Interagency Groups (SIGs) for foreign policy, defense, and intelligence, with regional and functional interagency groups chaired by Cabinet representatives. However, the structure had limitations with disorderly decision-making and unclear lines of responsibility, as noted by the Tower Board. The President must provide guidelines for the NSC system to be effective. The Reagan Administration had six National Security Advisers, each with their own history. The first adviser, Richard Allen, reported to the President through Edwin Meese. After Allen's brief tenure, he was replaced by Judge William Clark, who later resigned to become Secretary of the Interior. Subsequently, Robert McFarlane, Vice Admiral John Poindexter, and others took on the role of National Security Adviser. The Reagan Administration faced challenges with its National Security Advisers, leading to a lack of effective leadership and administrative structure. Vice Admiral John Poindexter replaced Richard Allen but was later relieved in the Iran-Contra scandal. Frank Carlucci and Colin Powell also took on the role, trying to restore NSC effectiveness. Critics believe the absence of strong advisers and administrative machinery contributed to the Iran-Contra misadventures. The Iran-Contra misadventures were partly attributed to the lack of effective leadership and administrative structure within the Reagan Administration. The Tower Board recommended that NSC committees be chaired by individuals with the greatest stake in making the NSC system work, rather than Cabinet officials. This would ensure all sides of an issue are presented to the full NSC or the President. The Tower Board recommended that the National Security Adviser chair the senior-level committees of the NSC system to avoid bureaucratic intrigues and ensure effective leadership. The involvement of NSC staff in covert actions, especially by Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, was criticized for operating outside traditional intelligence channels. Oliver North's operations outside traditional intelligence channels, including efforts to release hostages and support Nicaraguan insurgents, have faced criticism for undermining accountable agencies and neglecting professional expertise. The Iran-Contra Committee advised against NSC involvement in covert actions. Carlucci and Powell brought stability to NSC operations and avoided such actions. Carlucci later chaired a Senior Review Group composed of NSC members to oversee operations. President Reagan's role in national security policymaking remains unclear. His policies on U.S.-Soviet relations, anti-communism, and military strength set the goals for his Administration. However, he did not closely monitor policy implementation, leading to bureaucratic gridlock and NSC staff involvement in covert actions. Some criticize his NSC structure for this. The Reagan Administration's NSC staff was involved in covert actions, leading to criticism of Reagan's lack of close monitoring of policy implementation. The importance of a strong National Security Adviser and staff in national security policymaking was highlighted, with some historians giving Reagan credit for his overall policies despite staff turnover. The Bush Administration saw Brent Scowcroft return as National Security Adviser, focusing on a harmonious relationship with the President and establishing NSC sub-groups. The Bush Administration's NSC structure, similar to Nixon and Ford Administrations, had key committees chaired by the National Security Adviser. Secretary of State James Baker played a significant role in the Administration. The Bush Administration's NSC, led by Secretary of State James Baker and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, was generally effective in policymaking and avoided heavy criticisms. The NSC organization was considered standard, and the Administration successfully addressed most issues. President Clinton's Administration focused on domestic issues, emphasizing connections between international concerns and the domestic economy. Anthony Lake and Samuel R. Berger served as National Security Advisers during this time, with a need for closer integration of national security policy and international economic policy being widely acknowledged after the Cold War. The Clinton Administration established the National Economic Council (NEC) to coordinate international economic policy, aiming to integrate it closely with the National Security Council (NSC). This initiative, led by Robert Rubin, aimed to enhance policy coordination at senior White House levels, although it faced challenges due to political disputes over international economic and trade policies. The National Security Council (NSC) was expanded to include additional members like the Secretary of the Treasury and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, as outlined in Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 2. Some observers wanted a stronger international economic component within the NSC, but others disagreed, stating that economic issues are better handled by different groups. The National Security Council (NSC) was expanded to include additional members such as the Secretary of the Treasury and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy. The Attorney General attended meetings discussing covert actions, while the National Security Adviser determined NSC meeting agendas and chaired the Principals Committee. A Deputies Committee, chaired by the Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, managed day-to-day crisis situations and established Interagency Working Groups as needed. The Clinton NSC established Interagency Working Groups (IWGs) chaired by relevant department representatives to review and coordinate presidential decisions. Lake initially aimed to be a consensus builder but later opted to work behind the scenes to avoid bureaucratic infighting. Lake decided to change his approach, staying behind the scenes but voicing his own views more confidently, even if it led to disagreements with colleagues. In 1999, the Clinton NSC staff, under Berger's leadership, played a significant role in shaping policy on Kosovo, focusing on the political dimension and avoiding options that could cause debate within NATO states. During the Kosovo campaign, Berger maintained unity by balancing opinions on a ground campaign against Serbia. President George W. Bush issued NSPD-1 in 2001 to organize the NSC system for advising on national security policies. The Attorney General was to be invited to NSC meetings. The National Security Adviser was responsible for organizing NSC meetings, with the Attorney General attending meetings related to Justice Department matters. The Principals Committee consisted of department heads and advisory officials, chaired by the National Security Adviser. The NSC Deputies Committee included deputy department heads and advisory officials, chaired by the Deputy National Security Adviser. The NSC, chaired by the Deputy National Security Adviser, coordinated with Policy Coordinating Committees chaired by high-level officials. Post-9/11, the Intelligence Reform Act established the Director of National Intelligence, replacing the Director of Central Intelligence in NSC deliberations. The NSC played a key role in reviewing U.S. options in Iraq in 2006, leading to the Surge strategy. President Bush adopted the approach of increasing troop levels in Iraq despite skepticism from the State Department. Condoleezza Rice, as National Security Adviser, had a good working relationship with the President and was effective in public communication. Hadley emphasized the importance of NSC staff monitoring decisions and organized a review of Iraq policy resulting in major changes. President Obama designated... President Obama designated retired Marine General James L. Jones as National Security Adviser, signing a directive outlining NSC participation and committee duties. The National Security Adviser and Deputy National Security Adviser will chair the Principals Committee and Deputies Committee, respectively. These committees will serve as key forums for policy consideration and crisis management within the National Security Council. The integration of the National Security Council and Homeland Security Council staff into the National Security Staff aims to streamline decision-making and implementation processes. The National Security Staff was restructured to eliminate the divide between White House staff dealing with national security and homeland security issues. New directorates and positions were created to address cybersecurity, terrorism, border security, and information sharing. General Jones focused on agency collaboration but was criticized for his crisis management. He resigned in 2010 and was replaced by Tom Donilon. In 2010, Jones resigned as National Security Adviser and was succeeded by Tom Donilon. The integration of NSC and Homeland Security Council staffs aimed to improve cooperation among Federal agencies and state, local, and tribal entities in addressing homeland security issues. However, establishing new organizational entities may not fully determine the ability of different agencies to share information and cooperate on operational planning and programs. The National Security Adviser's role remains crucial in policymaking, with some concerns about influence on intelligence activities. Suggestions have been made for Senate confirmation and congressional testimony for the National Security Adviser. Kissinger and Brzezinski's influence has elevated the position, with Brzezinski being the only one accorded Cabinet status. Some argue for Senate confirmation of the National Security Adviser to avoid confusion on national security policy. Recent advisers have appeared on TV, coming from various professions. The Iran-Contra report recommended against a military officer as adviser. Most NSC staff are career military, foreign service, or civil servants. The NSC staff consists of career military officers, foreign service officers, and civil servants with backgrounds in foreign policy and defense issues. Some staff members are detailed from other federal agencies, with their salaries being paid by their original agencies. The practice of bringing outside experts into the NSC staff began during the Kennedy Administration to bring fresh perspectives into policymaking. Henry Kissinger made efforts to hire academic experts, but some eventually resigned and became critics. The Reagan NSC was criticized for its staff appointments. The NSC staff should consist of career officials with expertise in foreign policy and defense issues. Anthony Lake argues for a staff composed of career officials with carryover between administrations. He warns against political appointees with partisan backgrounds influencing national security decisions. The NSC staff includes members from various departments like State, Defense, CIA, Treasury, and others. The Director of National Intelligence coordinates foreign intelligence efforts with agencies like CIA, DIA, NSA, and INR. The NSC staff includes members from various departments like State, Defense, CIA, Treasury, and others. The National Security Adviser is not subject to Senate confirmation and most briefings on intelligence, diplomatic, and military matters come from CIA, DIA, DNI, State, and Defense Departments. Congressional hearings and reports on NSC have covered various topics over the years. The NSC staff includes members from various departments like State, Defense, CIA, Treasury, and others. The National Security Adviser is not subject to Senate confirmation. Congressional hearings and reports on NSC have covered various topics over the years, including unauthorized transfer of NSC documents to officials in the Joint Chiefs of Staff and information on Al Qaeda prior to 9/11. Congress has limited authority over NSC matters and its relationship with the NSC. The National Security Council (NSC) is primarily focused on policy analysis and coordination within the executive branch regarding national security. Congress has limited oversight and legislative control over the NSC, with little direct influence on its organization or procedures. The NSC does not regularly provide national security information to Congress, as this is mainly done by the departments and agencies represented on the NSC. Congressional hearings have been held on NSC matters, but the NSC itself rarely testifies or briefs Congress on substantive issues. The National Security Council (NSC) operates with limited oversight from Congress and is tailored to each President's preferences. There is a general pattern in NSC structure that is likely to endure, with a focus on foreign and defense policy issues. The NSC's policymaking role has drawn criticism for overshadowing the Secretary of State. In the aftermath of the Cold War, national security concerns in the US may shift towards international economic, banking, environmental, and health issues. Suggestions have been made to expand the NSC's responsibilities to include these areas, as they are currently not its primary focus. Calls have been made in the past to replace the NSC with a National Policy Council to address broader policy issues. In 1980, it was argued that the NSC system lacks a way to address international economic issues, despite the involvement of key economic agencies like Treasury, OMB, and others. Attempts to involve these agencies in foreign policy matters often lead to friction and ad hoc policy-making. In the early 1980s, the threat of default by Mexico and Brazil posed a significant risk to the American banking system. Despite CIA analysis and NSC efforts, challenges persisted. The NSC system lacked a way to address international economic issues in 1980, leading to friction and ad hoc policy-making involving key economic agencies. In the early 1980s, the threat of default by Mexico and Brazil posed a risk to the American banking system. Despite CIA analysis and NSC efforts, the question did not get on the NSC agenda for over two years, and policy issues were not discussed. The agencies involved in money and banking had no natural connection with the NSC or the intelligence community. In the George H. W. Bush Administration, there was a strong belief that defense and foreign policy issues should remain separate and be addressed in the NSC. Brent Scowcroft expressed reluctance to widen the NSC's scope. The National Economic Council was established by the Clinton Administration to coordinate economic policy-making with the NSC. The goal was to ensure that economic dimensions of national security policy were properly weighed in White House decision-making. Cooperation between the NSC and the NEC was considered productive. The NSC and NEC cooperation enhanced national security and economic policymaking. The post-Cold War era saw closer ties between security and law enforcement issues, posing challenges for NSC staff. The Justice Department may be wary of encroachment on the Attorney General's responsibilities. During the Clinton Administration, the Attorney General's representatives have been included in NSC staff deliberations when law enforcement concerns were involved, despite public disagreements between Justice Department and State Department. Observers note public disagreements between Justice Department and State Department regarding cooperation from Saudi Arabia or Yemen. The President has constitutional responsibilities for national security and law enforcement, but the status of other officials to make necessary trade-offs is unclear. In the future, a single U.S. position may require integrating national security and law enforcement concerns. The Obama Administration established a single National Security Staff combining the National Security Council and Homeland Security Council. Today's international terrorist threat includes physical and cyber-attacks on critical infrastructures. The National Security Council (NSC) plays a crucial role in addressing cyber-attacks on critical infrastructures. The NSC's role is limited as these systems are mostly owned by private entities. The Clinton Administration created the National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counterterrorism position. The Obama Administration saw the influential role of the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism. The National Security Adviser deals with policies related to protecting critical infrastructures. The National Security Adviser plays a key role in coordinating responses to threats to critical infrastructures, involving the federal government, states, and the private sector. Concerns exist about potential overreach into law enforcement matters. The NSC's structure and membership are defined by statute, with the entity being a presidential one. The National Security Adviser's role has evolved over the years, with statutory responsibilities granted by Congress and formal responsibilities outlined in Executive Orders. The position has become institutionalized and integral to national security policy in recent administrations. The National Security Adviser's role has evolved with established duties beyond advice to the President, leading to a proposal for Senate advice and consent in appointments. Proponents argue for increased accountability and formalization, while opponents fear rigidity and political influence in appointments. The National Security Adviser's role may be influenced by political considerations and could become irrelevant if trust is lost or procedures become too formalized. Senate confirmation could compromise the President's prerogative to choose staff, and routine appearances before oversight committees could undermine the adviser's primary purpose of providing candid advice. The National Security Adviser must present alternate views fairly, be honest in presenting decisions, and ensure ethical behavior within the staff. Responsibilities include staffing the president's foreign policy activities, managing decision-making processes, driving policymaking, and overseeing decision implementation. The increasing difficulties in separating national security issues from law enforcement and international economic concerns have led to calls for creating a more comprehensive policymaking entity at the White House. President Obama combined the staffs of the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council in May 2009, raising questions about congressional oversight in national security matters. The Project for National Security Reform (PNSR) was established with congressional support to study the government's organization for national security issues. The November 2008 report, Forging a New Shield, addressed the functions of the NSC and other parts of the national security system. PNSR argued for a reevaluation of the current organizational structure. The Project for National Security Reform (PNSR) recommended replacing the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council with a President's Security Council and a Senate-confirmed Director of National Security. The Director would oversee national security missions and have a staff of 500 people. Several PNSR members joined the Obama Administration, but some initiatives would require legislative action. The PNSR recommended changes to the National Security Council and Homeland Security Council, but consensus on organizational realignments has not been reached. Valuable sources for understanding the NSC's history include Senator Henry M. Jackson's collection of hearings and presidential memoirs. Other useful sources include articles by Anderson and Bock on national security. In 1966, Joseph G. Bock discussed the National Security Assistant and White House Staff's role in decision-making from 1947-1984.
