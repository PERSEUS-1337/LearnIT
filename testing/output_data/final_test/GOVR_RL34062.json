    "content": "The report examines the Department of Defense's use of aviation fuel and options to reduce consumption. DOD is the largest energy consumer in the US and has been making progress in decreasing fossil fuel use. Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, DOD intensified its focus on fuel use in weapon systems, with aviation fuel being the largest portion. Reducing DOD's aviation fuel consumption could significantly decrease its overall reliance on fossil fuels. In Fiscal Year 2005, DOD consumed roughly 125 million barrels of oil\u2014approximately 1.2% of the nation's total, with 74% of energy used for mobility vehicles. About 52% of DOD's energy is aviation fuel, and options to reduce fossil-based aviation fuel use include advanced technologies like synthetic fuels. Upgrading aircraft engines and modifying operational procedures are possible measures to decrease fuel use, but they are costly and compete for funding with other priorities. The Department of Defense has a unique fuel-use pattern, with approximately 74% of its energy used for mobility vehicles and over half\u2014roughly 52%\u2014comprised of aviation fuel. Fuel costs, although less than 3% of the total DOD budget, have a significant impact on operating costs. Every $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil results in a $1.3 billion increase in operating costs for DOD. The Air Force, which operates most of DOD's fixed-wing aircraft, spends the largest share of DOD's fuel budget. The Air Force spends the largest share of DOD's fuel budget. A $10 increase in oil prices adds $600 million to the Air Force's annual fuel costs. Different aircraft have varying fuel consumption rates, with the B-52H burning 3500 gallons per flight hour, the C-5B burning the same amount but with a higher weight-to-gallon ratio, and the T-38 burning only 395 gallons per flight hour. The T-38 burns 395 gallons per flight hour, much less than the B-52H or C-5B. The lower fuel efficiency is due to its aerodynamic design, afterburning engines, and shorter sortie length. The fully burdened cost of fuel includes delivery costs, ranging between $2 and $3 per gallon. The fully burdened cost of fuel for aircraft ranges between $2 and $3 per gallon, but when delivered in flight, it can be as high as $20 per gallon. The Department of Defense (DOD) faces challenges in measuring fuel use and costs, prompting studies to understand heavy usage and find ways to decrease it. Various government studies suggest that there is no single ideal alternative fuel to replace fossil fuels for aircraft. The DOD has various methods to decrease fuel consumption, as highlighted in studies conducted by the Defense Science Board and the JASON report. These studies emphasize the importance of optimizing energy efficiency in weapon systems over pursuing alternative fuels at this time. The Task Force on Energy Security presented three recommendations to increase energy efficiency in weapon systems and facilities, and establish alternative fuels programs. A recent report by LMI Government Consulting identified areas where DOD's energy goals are not aligned with current practices. In 2000, the Defense Science Board formed a task force to improve fuel efficiency in DOD's weapon systems and address institutional barriers. The task force identified five significant findings related to the Department of Defense's lack of emphasis on fuel efficiency in weapon systems. One key finding was that DOD prioritizes performance over fuel efficiency when acquiring new weapons, leading to missed benefits. Additionally, the department does not consider the long-term effects of fuel use on the total force. The DOD currently prices fuel based on wholesale refinery prices, excluding delivery costs. This hinders a comprehensive view of fuel utilization, distorts platform design choices, and overlooks the true benefits of fuel efficiency. As a result, fuel efficiency is not considered in weapon system acquisitions or logistics decisions. For example, the Air Force deemed re-engining the B-52H as not cost-effective based on outdated fuel cost calculations. DSB reworked the equation using an average fuel cost of $1.50 per gallon and calculated a savings of $1.7 billion. DOD resource allocation processes do not incentivize fuel efficiency. Operational wargaming involving fuel requirements is not linked to Service requirements development. The DSB task force found that fuel requirements are not integrated into DOD's acquisition processes, leading to a lack of awareness of fuel efficiency's impact on combat operations. They also highlighted the availability of high payoff, fuel-efficient technologies that could improve warfighting effectiveness in current and new weapon systems. The JASON report, commissioned by the Director of Defense Research and Engineering, assessed ways for DOD to reduce fossil fuel demand using advanced technology. It highlighted that DOD fuel costs, while significant, should not be the primary decision driver currently, with other factors like life-cycle costs and supply chain being more crucial. The JASON report emphasized that DOD fuel costs should not be the main decision driver currently, with other factors like life-cycle costs being more crucial. They noted that Air Force aircraft fuel consumption is expected to decline, leading to a decrease in fuel use. Revolutionary options in weapon system design are in early stages, with light-weighting and modernizing diesel engines showing the most promise for fuel savings. Alternative ground vehicle designs like hybrids, all-electric, and fuel-cell vehicles were not seen as optimal due to military use patterns and technology maturity issues. JASON recommended light-weighting vehicles to reduce fuel consumption. JASON recommended light-weighting vehicles and upgrading gas turbine engines in Army tanks to modern diesel for fuel efficiency. The Department of Defense uses less than 2% of the oil consumed in the United States, suggesting a national effort to find substitutes for fossil fuels. DOD agrees that it plays a significant role in fuel consumption. The Department of Defense (DOD) plays a significant role in testing synthetic jet fuel but is not a major consumer to drive the market. JASON recommends using Fischer-Tropsch technology to produce liquid fuel from \"stranded\" natural gas. Ethanol is deemed unsuitable for DOD use due to low energy density and high flammability. In 2006, former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld formed a task force to address energy security, lower fossil fuel requirements, and explore alternate energy sources. The DOD task force, led by DDR&E, included a variety of skills from military departments and defense agencies. Their recommendations focused on increasing weapon platform fuel efficiency, accelerating energy efficiency initiatives for military installations, and utilizing simulators for efficient operations. The DOD task force, led by DDR&E, focused on increasing weapon platform fuel efficiency and accelerating energy efficiency initiatives for military installations. LMI identified areas where DOD's practices were not aligned with its energy goals and recommended actions to address the misalignments, including establishing an alternate fuels program and developing incentives for the alternate fuel industry. LMI identified strategic, operational, and fiscal limitations in DOD's energy practices. DOD's dependence on foreign fuel limits flexibility, energy requirements hinder mobility, and rising energy costs increase operating expenses. LMI recommended incorporating energy considerations in key decisions to address these issues. LMI recommended incorporating energy considerations in key decisions to address DOD's strategic, operational, and fiscal limitations. This includes integrating energy use and logistics support requirements in strategic planning, governance structure establishment, and promoting energy efficiency in high fuel-consuming areas like aviation forces. The government-sponsored reports suggest that the Department of Defense (DOD) should reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, with a focus on decreasing the use of petroleum-based aviation fuel. This can be achieved by increasing the use of alternative fuels and decreasing the demand for petroleum-based fuel. The Department of Defense (DOD) is exploring options to reduce reliance on fossil fuels by increasing the use of alternative fuels like synthetic fuel and hydrogen fuel cells. There is a debate on whether to aggressively pursue alternative fuels or focus on decreasing fuel demand through efficiency measures. Some suggest developing a domestic Coal-To-Liquid industry, while others argue it may contribute to carbon emissions and divert funds from renewable fuel sources. The Department of Defense (DOD) is considering alternative fuels to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, including synthetic fuels and biofuels. DOD aims for a \"Single Battlespace Fuel\" to streamline fuel types used in theater and reduce risks. While exploring synthetic fuel for aircraft, DOD is not actively pursuing alternative fuels for other systems. The Department of Defense (DOD) is exploring alternative fuels like synthetic fuels and biofuels to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. While focusing on synthetic fuel for aircraft, DOD is not actively pursuing alternative fuels for battlefield ground vehicles. Research and development in alternative ground fuel are still in early stages, with technology dating back to the 1920s for producing synthetic liquid fuel from coal, natural gas, or other carbon-containing feedstocks. Synthetic fuel can also be extracted from oil shale and tar sands. The advantages of Coal-To-Liquid (CTL) and Gas-To-Liquid (GTL) fuels produced via the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) process include cleaner burning with lower carbon emissions, reduced particulate matter and sulfur emissions, improved low temperature properties for high altitude operations, and superior thermal stability for fuel efficient engines. These fuels can be produced using abundant resources within the United States like coal and natural gas. The Energy Information Administration estimated in a 1995 report that the United States has a 250 year supply of coal, but increased demand for coal from the F-T industry may impact this estimate. The Air Force successfully tested a 50/50 mix of F-T synthetic fuel and JP-8 in a B-52 Stratofortress with no detrimental effects noted. Further tests on all eight engines showed no issues, with cold weather engine starting tests conducted in January 2007 at Minot Air Force Base. Challenges remain for large-scale production of F-T fuels. Challenges persist in the large-scale production of F-T fuel for aircraft engines. Despite lower carbon emissions when burned, total emissions from production and use are double that of petroleum-based fuel. Carbon sequestration for F-T fuel production emissions is not yet feasible, posing a significant concern for the Air Force and DOD as they explore F-T fuels. Collaboration with DOE and other agencies is ongoing to address this issue. Legislation proposed in January 2007 calls for a report on emissions from F-T products used as transportation fuel, highlighting issues with F-T fuel's lack of sulphur affecting aircraft engines. Critics of F-T fuel point to environmental hazards from increased coal mining, questioning the worth of a small dent in oil imports against a predicted 40% increase in coal production. Efforts to construct F-T plants in the US have faced challenges, with one company closing its demonstration plant in 2006 after supplying synthetic fuel for testing. In 2007, a company closed its demonstration plant in Tulsa, Oklahoma due to falling revenue after completing contracts with DOD and the Department of Transportation. Secretary of Energy questioned the financial viability of a CTL diesel fuel plant in Pennsylvania, with cost estimates increasing from $612 million to $800 million. Despite challenges, DOD's interest in synthetic fuels was evident when companies submitted proposals for F-T fuel production for testing by the Air Force and Navy. The Air Force and Navy received over 20 responses for using domestically produced synthetic fuel blend. The Air Force aims to use this blend for 50% of its aviation fuel by 2016, requiring approximately 325 million gallons of mixed fuel annually. Estimates for constructing plants range from $1 billion to $10 billion, with a timeline of 5-6 years. DOD faces challenges due to high construction costs and restrictions on long-term fuel contracts. Proposed legislation aims to alleviate restrictions on DOD's ability to enter long-term fuel contracts, which currently are limited to five years. The bills propose allowing the Department to sign multiyear contracts for synthetic fuel production. The proposed legislation aims to allow the Department of Defense to enter into long-term contracts for synthetic fuel production for up to 25 years. Critics are concerned that increasing coal-to-liquid fuel production without carbon sequestration will raise carbon emissions. Biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, are renewable and potentially carbon neutral, offsetting emissions with carbon dioxide consumed during feedstock growth. In its current state, biofuel production methods involve carbon emitting sources, making claims of carbon neutrality questionable. The energy density of biofuels like ethanol is too low for jet fuel use, as it is 25% lower than conventional aviation fuel. Ethanol also cannot operate at the extreme temperatures required for military aviation fuel. However, DARPA awarded a contract in 2006 for the development of a synthetic fuel from oil-rich crops as a potential alternative to petroleum-derived JP-8. Hydrogen fuel cells are an affordable alternative to petroleum-derived JP-8. Delivery for government testing is expected in 2008. Fuel cells generate electricity through an electrochemical process combining hydrogen and oxygen, producing water and heat as waste. They are more efficient than combustion engines, do not produce carbon emissions, and can continue operating with more fuel. For the military, they offer near silent operation and reduced infrared exposure. Hydrogen fuel cells are being explored by the DOD for various applications, including ground vehicles and portable uses. Cost, durability, and the transport of hydrogen fuel are key obstacles to widespread adoption. Fuel cells offer benefits such as silent operation and reduced infrared exposure. The Department of Energy aims to reduce the cost of fuel cells to $30 per kilowatt hour and extend their lifespan to 5000 hours by 2015. Currently, there is no comprehensive system for transporting, storing, or delivering hydrogen fuel. A report by DESC in 2004 suggested that hydrogen could be a viable fuel source for small-scale power generation and portable devices within the next 10-30 years, but using hydrogen fuel cells in weapons systems may not be feasible for another 30-40 years. The volume of liquid hydrogen required to power a Navy ship is four times that of conventional fuel, posing challenges in terms of storage and refueling. Due to hydrogen's flammability, carrying it aboard a ship is currently impractical. Research is being conducted on converting solid waste at military base-camps into fuel to meet the rising power demands. Various technologies exist for this purpose, with efficiency rates varying. Various technologies for converting solid waste at military base-camps into fuel vary in efficiency rates, with pyrolysis being the most efficient at 70-90%. This process could benefit the DOD by reducing the need to transport fuel and waste. A study by the Army found that 79% of waste generated in the field could be a potential energy source, with Meals Ready to Eat being a significant contributor. Challenges include making \"trash-to-gas\" technologies user-friendly for service members. While plastic waste could theoretically be converted into aviation fuel, the amount generated in-theater is insufficient for on-site production. DOD is exploring other options for \"trash-to-gas\" conversion. DOD is exploring various technologies for converting solid waste into fuel, including pyrolysis which is the most efficient at 70-90%. In early 2007, DARPA awarded a contract for technology that produces plastics from plant oils, which can be turned into biodiesel. Solar power has been used successfully to fly unmanned aerial vehicles like the Helios Prototype, which achieved high-altitude, long-duration solar-powered flight in 2001. Solar power has been successfully used in aircraft, with sunlight powering the plane during the day and excess energy stored in a fuel cell for night operations. Despite some setbacks, other solar-powered aircraft have flown successfully, with potential for long-duration flights and no emissions. Pilots are working on a manned solar-powered aircraft to fly around the world by 2010, with advantages including quiet operation and the ability to carry small payloads for surveillance purposes. Solar powered aircraft can carry small payloads like cameras or surveillance equipment and may eventually be equipped with armaments. The MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Predator B can carry light-weight armaments such as laser-guided missiles and bombs. However, solar aircraft must be light-weight with a specialized design to maximize wing-span and minimize drag, limiting their payload capacity. Solar cell and fuel cell technology for night operations are expensive. DARPA is involved in advancing solar aircraft technology. DARPA is seeking improved, cost-effective solar cell technology for high altitude solar aircraft to reduce reliance on petroleum-based fuel. The Air Force is exploring ways to increase energy efficiency in operations and weapon systems, including using light-weight composite materials to improve fuel efficiency. DOD is working on developing a low-cost titanium alloy to replace heavy steel in weapon systems for increased fuel efficiency. DARPA is sponsoring a program to produce a titanium alloy under $4 per pound. Using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can also reduce fuel consumption as they are lighter and do not require additional weight for operator-related equipment. The DOD is increasingly using UAVs for surveillance activities due to their cost-effectiveness and safety benefits. However, human operators are still needed for certain operations that require judgement and flexibility. DOD policy sets weight limits for aircraft, with the KC-135 tanker having one of the most restrictive landing weight requirements in the Air Force fleet. Excess fuel must be released if the aircraft approaches a landing too heavy. The Air Force recently increased the safe landing weight of a KC-135, allowing it to keep more fuel onboard when it lands. This policy change eliminates the need to discard excess fuel weight, saving time and resources. However, this decision comes with increased risk to the aircraft and crew, as the long-term effects of the added wear and tear are unknown. The Air Force is reviewing flight paths to use more direct routes, saving fuel and money. This method of cost-saving requires no aircraft modification and can be implemented regardless of the weapon system. Routing aircraft on more direct flights may seem simple in theory but other factors may complicate shortening routes. The Air Force is reviewing flight paths to use more direct routes, saving fuel and money. Circuitous routes may use more fuel than direct ones but may have other efficiencies. Factors like weather and diplomatic relations can affect the possibility of direct routes. Aircraft stationed closer to the front lines require less fuel. The Air Force repositioned B-1 Bombers from Diego Garcia to Saudi Arabia, saving approximately 2400 nautical miles. Moving aircraft closer to the front lines can save over 40,000 gallons of fuel per sortie by reducing flying distance and eliminating the need for refueling. However, relocating aircraft may incur costs for infrastructure changes and leasing space, and other factors like diplomatic and strategic value should also be considered. The Air Force re-assessed the rotation frequency of certain Wings to conserve fuel and aircraft flying hours. Keeping aircraft in theater longer while rotating personnel helps save fuel. Aircraft are rotated back to the United States for scheduled maintenance due to the aging fleet and intense wear and tear in the current theater of operations. The intense wear and tear in the theater of operations increases the need for aircraft upkeep. Flights between forward bases and permanent bases in the US can be used for pilot training. The DOD is studying if flight simulators can substitute for actual aircraft training to save costs. The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 limits DOD's use of simulators due to a GAO study showing underutilization. Legislation now requires DOD to operate simulators in-house, despite concerns about effectiveness compared to contractor-run simulators. Simulators offer advantages such as fuel savings, reduced wear on aircraft, safety, and flexible scheduling. Availability of qualified operators and equipment status impact simulator effectiveness. The quality of simulator training is a concern for Air Force leaders, as the experience differs from real aircraft flying. The impact of excessive simulator training on pilot effectiveness is unknown. Winglets on aircraft wings improve fuel efficiency. The House Committee on Armed Services discussed the benefits of winglets in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007. The House Committee on Armed Services discussed the benefits of winglets in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007, directing the Air Force to study the feasibility of adding winglets to large aircraft. The study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of winglets, their impact on maintenance and operations, and potential fuel savings. Retrofitting aircraft with winglets may improve fuel efficiency but could also incur additional costs and downtime. The Air Force is exploring strategies to reduce fuel consumption, such as removing excess weight from aircraft and promoting fuel-saving practices. Commercial airlines have already taken steps to minimize aircraft weight for fuel efficiency and increased profits. The military's focus is on cost-effective measures to conserve fuel, rather than profit. The military prioritizes safety over profits by ensuring crew members' well-being through proper equipment maintenance. While efforts to promote fuel-saving awareness in DOD personnel are commendable, the impact on fuel consumption remains uncertain. DOD's initiatives to explore alternative aviation fuel face challenges like organizational structure, funding, and external expectations. The Department of Defense lacks clear organizational lines of responsibility for energy reduction efforts, hindering completion of long-term projects and implementation of new ones. Various offices within DOD handle individual energy initiatives, but the complexity has outgrown the current structure. The USD (AT&L) is tasked with implementing the President's 2007 Executive Order on energy security but lacks a designated individual to oversee a comprehensive department-wide energy strategy. The Department of Defense lacks clear organizational lines of responsibility for energy reduction efforts. Various DOD offices handle energy initiatives, with oversight from different entities. DARPA sponsors research for military applications, while the Office of DDR&E oversees research and engineering efforts. The Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations & Environment focuses on utilities and facilities, but not fuel savings in operational areas. Relevant agencies, including military services, also have projects competing for DOD resources. The Air Force is hesitant to allocate additional funds for energy-efficiency improvements, despite studies showing that upgrading engines in the B-52H could reduce fuel usage and tanker force requirements. There is reluctance to spend money on upgrading aging aircraft amidst debates over which ones to retire. The Air Force is hesitant to spend money on upgrading aging aircraft, such as the B-52H bomber's TF-33 engines, despite potential fuel savings. DOD's funding strategy for energy initiatives reflects its priorities, allocating $1.8 billion over five years for energy-related projects. Some argue this is a small portion of the overall budget, while others see it as a prudent decision in the current defense budget environment. Funding for energy efficiency and alternative fuel initiatives may fall behind other priorities without a department-wide strategy. Congress may legislate funding strategies if DOD does not allocate funds for energy research. Uncertainty about DOD's role in a government energy strategy hinders the department from outlining its own strategy and committing necessary resources. The Department of Defense (DOD) faces uncertainty about its role in developing alternative fuels. While some see DOD as a potential leader in this area due to its technological innovation, the department seems reluctant to take on a more proactive role beyond being a facilitator and test-bed for new technologies. The Department of Defense (DOD) witnesses emphasized the partnership between DOD, other government agencies, and the commercial industry in driving alternative fuel technology forward. They highlighted the synergy in research, development, and application of technologies to demonstrate viability and understand markets. The Air Force, as part of DOD, plays a key role in certifying aviation fuel. While a major fuel purchaser globally, its impact on the market is limited. The Air Force is recognized for its efforts in developing alternative aviation fuel, such as testing synthetic blends in B-52 aircraft. The Air Force is testing and certifying a synthetic fuel blend in its B-52 aircraft and aims to acquire 50% of its fuel as a synthetic blend by 2016. The commercial aviation industry's support is crucial, as acknowledged by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. Congress has at least six potential options to consider in light of these developments. Congress has at least six potential options to consider for enhancing DOD's progress in energy security, including clarifying lines of authority within the department. The current leadership role of the Director, Defense Research and Engineering may not cover all aspects of energy strategy, such as acquisitions, installations, finances, and operations. Adding another layer of bureaucracy may be unnecessary if functions are already in place. Some express concern that enthusiasm for recent energy initiatives may wane once urgency regarding energy availability and prices subsides. Without a dedicated DOD focal point for energy activities, funding for initiatives may be discontinued. Today's energy crisis differs from past ones due to concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and oil reserves. The current focus is on improving energy efficiency in weapons and alternative energy due to concerns about peak oil reserves. Congress could mandate energy efficiency improvements for existing DOD aircraft, following precedent set for DOD facilities. The Senate's FY2007 defense authorization bill calls for a DOD policy to improve fuel efficiency of weapons systems, with discretion given to DOD on implementation. The DOD has discretion to implement language for energy efficiency improvements in weapons systems. There are debates over the most cost-effective way to upgrade aircraft like the B-52 and C-5, with proposals for engine upgrades and discussions on purchasing newer aircraft models. The Air Force is considering retiring older C-5s in favor of modernizing them for reliability, not energy efficiency. Congress may mandate fuel efficiency in new DOD acquisitions, with reports of potential changes in acquisition policies. The Honorable Kenneth Krieg directed the evaluation of fuel costs in the designs of three new DOD weapon systems: the Air Force's new long-range strike aircraft, the Army and Marine Corps Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, and the Navy's CG-X cruiser. DOD will consider the \"fully burdened\" cost of fuel in the design process, potentially leading to modifications in acquisition guidelines. This could result in future evaluations of aircraft proposals based on the \"fully burdened\" cost of fuel, considering maintenance costs, weight, and engine efficiency. Option for Congress to pass legislation allowing DOD to enter into long-term fuel contracts, potentially incentivizing synthetic fuel development. DOD currently conducting solar and hydrogen fuel research, with suggestions for increased funding. The DOD could fund further research in fuel and fuel cells. Congress may mandate alternative aviation fuel purchases, with the Air Force aiming for 50% synthetic fuel by 2016. Tests with Fischer-Tropsch Gas-To-Liquid (GTL) fuel are being conducted, but DOD is also developing synthetic aviation biofuel. Opposition may arise due to carbon emissions from coal- or gas-based synthetic fuel, but renewable sources could become a viable option. The DOD is exploring alternative aviation fuels, including synthetic fuels and biofuels. Challenges include the high cost of production, carbon emissions, and compatibility with jet engines. Legislation in FY2007 supports DOD's efforts to increase fuel efficiency and explore alternative energy sources. The authorization bill (S. 2766) requires the Secretary of Defense to report on actions taken to reduce the Department of Defense's consumption of petroleum-based fuel, including compliance with various energy-related laws and directives. The Senate-passed version of S. 2766 also includes a section on energy efficiency in weapons platforms. The Senate-passed version of S. 2766 includes a policy for the Department of Defense to improve fuel efficiency in weapons platforms to enhance performance, reduce logistics systems, lower operating costs, and mitigate the impact of volatile oil prices. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report on the progress of implementing this policy within one year. The Department of Defense is required to designate a senior official to implement a policy aimed at improving fuel efficiency in weapons platforms. The official must provide a summary of recommendations from various task forces and reports, detailing steps taken to implement each recommendation, additional planned steps, and reasons for not implementing certain recommendations. The Department of Defense must designate a senior official to improve fuel efficiency in weapons platforms. The official must provide a summary of recommendations, assess the guidance for weapons platforms, and suggest any additional actions needed to implement the policy. The utilization of fuel cells as back-up power systems in Department of Defense operations is also being considered. The Department of Defense aims to enhance fuel efficiency in weapons platforms to improve performance, reduce fuel logistics systems, lower operating costs, and mitigate the impact of volatile oil prices. This includes considering the use of fuel cells as back-up power systems in various operations and activities. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress on the progress of implementing the fuel efficiency policy within one year of the Act's enactment. The report will assess the feasibility of appointing a senior official for this policy and summarize recommendations from various Defense boards and teams. The report to Congress on improving fuel efficiency of weapons platforms will include steps taken to implement recommendations, additional planned steps, reasons for not implementing certain recommendations, assessment of guidance effectiveness, evaluation of program implementation, and potential additional actions needed to implement the policy. The Secretary of Defense is required to report on actions taken to reduce Department of Defense consumption of petroleum-based fuel by submitting a report to Congress by September 1, 2007. This report will detail the status of implementation of requirements from the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The conferees direct the Secretary to include in the report an analysis of the reduction of petroleum-based fuels since the introduction of Flexible Fuel Vehicles (FFVs) into the Department's inventory and an assessment of how to increase the consumption of E85 or M85 in FFVs. The House Committee on Armed Services commends the Air Force for efforts to increase aircraft fuel efficiency through initiatives like re-engining aircraft and using winglet technology, which can improve fuel efficiency by five to seven percent. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration released the KC-135 Winglet Program Review on incorporating winglets for KC-135 aerial refueling aircraft. The Air Force concluded that adding winglets did not provide sufficient payback in fuel savings or increased range. However, the committee believes that incorporating winglets on military aircraft could increase fuel efficiency and directs the Air Force to provide a report on the feasibility of modifying aircraft with winglets by March 1, 2007. The Air Force is examining the feasibility of modifying aircraft with winglets to increase fuel efficiency. The report will include a cost comparison analysis, market price of aviation fuel, impacts on maintenance and operations, and investment strategies. The Senate Appropriations Committee notes developments in converting coal to liquid fuels. The Committee encourages the Department of Defense to explore Fischer-Tropsch fuels for fuel requirements and requests a report on the assessment and plans for synthetic fuels. The House Appropriations Committee recommends funding for C-32 winglet modifications. The Committee recommends $5,198,000 for C-32 modifications to install Blended Winglets on 4 aircraft for potential fuel savings. The Secretary of the Air Force must report on the utility of the winglets within one year. The Coal-to-Liquid Fuel Energy Act of 2007 addresses the location of manufacturing facilities. The Coal-to-Liquid Fuel Energy Act of 2007 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to develop coal-to-liquid manufacturing facilities on Federal land, including military bases, for the production of synthetic fuels for aviation use. $10,000,000 is allocated for research and testing of these fuels by the Air Force Research Laboratory.
