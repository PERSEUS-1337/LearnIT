    "content": "On March 11, 2004, bombs exploded on four trains in Madrid during the morning rush hour, killing 191 people and injuring over 1800. The Spanish government initially blamed the Basque terrorist group ETA for the attacks, downplaying any involvement of Islamic extremists. Spanish officials initially blamed ETA for the bombings in Madrid, citing previous incidents involving the group. However, skeptics pointed out the scale and precision of the attacks, suggesting the involvement of Islamic extremists like Al Qaeda. The government's credibility wavered as evidence of possible extremist involvement emerged, including detonators and a Koran verse tape found in an abandoned van. Police found a Koran in an abandoned van in Alcala de Henares, where the bombed trains passed. A cellphone from an unexploded bomb led them to Jamal Zougam, a Moroccan immigrant with suspected links to Al Qaeda. Despite evidence linking Zougam to the attacks, the government initially blamed ETA. This mishandling of the crisis caused outrage among Spaniards, who accused the government of trying to shift blame to ETA for political gain. Spanish police suspect Al Qaeda-linked Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group in Madrid attacks, also involved in 2003 Casablanca bombings. Progress made in breaking up terrorist cell responsible for the attack. Seven suspects blew themselves up. Unexploded bomb found on railroad tracks. Seven men suspected of involvement in the Madrid attacks were killed when they blew themselves up after being surrounded by police. The group was led by Serhane ben Abdelmajid Farkhet, known as \"the Tunisian,\" and was found to be ready for more attacks. Italian police arrested Rabei Osman Sayed Ahmed, also known as \"Mohammed the Egyptian,\" who was a key planner of the attacks. By September 2004, nearly two dozen individuals charged in connection with the attacks were in custody. A parliamentary commission started investigating the attacks and the government's response in June 2004. The terrorist attacks in Spain before the March 14 elections were believed to influence the vote. Public concern over terrorism was high, with many linking it to the war in Iraq. The ruling PP party, led by Mariano Rajoy, was expected to win despite opposition from the Socialist Party. However, the PP's lead in polls was shrinking leading up to the election. The final opinion polls before the election showed the PP expected to win 42% of the vote and the PSOE 38%. The actual results saw the PSOE winning with 42.5% of the vote, while the PP received 37.6%. The Socialists gained 164 seats in parliament, while the PP lost seats, falling short of an absolute majority. The PSOE won 148 seats, down from 183, and will need to form a coalition. The PP maintained control of the Senate. Voter turnout was 77.2%, higher than in previous elections. The PSOE's success was attributed to young, first-time voters. After the March 13 elections in Spain, there was speculation about whether Al Qaeda influenced the outcome. Some believed the election reflected public anger towards the government's decisions on Iraq, rather than appeasing terrorists. Public opinion polls showed strong opposition to the government's support for the war in Iraq. The March 11 bombing in Spain led to speculation about Al Qaeda's influence on the election outcome. Supporters of Zapatero point to a post-election poll showing only 8.8% felt the attacks affected their vote. Critics argue the attack swayed the election in favor of Zapatero, with some in the US criticizing the election as appeasement of terrorists. The Spanish election results were seen as a victory for Al Qaeda by Representative Henry Hyde. Administration officials refrained from criticizing the outcome, fearing its impact on relations with the new government. Spanish conservatives rejected claims of cowardice, citing Spain's history of fighting terrorism. Some believe Spaniards may be under the illusion of opting out of globalization's risks while enjoying its benefits. According to some observers, Spain's historical decline from great power status may contribute to a belief among Spaniards that their country should not involve itself in global politics. This attitude could be reinforced by a perception that the United States is unaware of Spanish concerns. Zapatero's sudden decision to withdraw Spanish troops from Iraq in 2004 surprised many, as he had previously suggested they could stay under certain conditions. President Bush expressed regret to Zapatero for the Spanish troop withdrawal from Iraq, warning against actions that could benefit terrorists. The withdrawal was criticized by U.S. officials for lack of coordination, potentially impacting operations. Despite Spain's small troop contribution, concerns arise about declining European support for the Iraq mission. Zapatero emphasizes fighting terrorism as a priority. Zapatero prioritizes fighting terrorism and calls for closer cooperation among EU police and intelligence services. Spain expands its contribution to ISAF in Afghanistan but plans to withdraw troops after the elections. Military force is seen as a last resort in the war against terrorism. Spain plans to withdraw 500 troops after the elections, affecting U.S.-Spanish relations. Aznar's close relationship with the U.S. was driven by a desire for international prestige, while Zapatero appears unconcerned about initial remarks. Zapatero's remarks, including calling President Bush's Iraq policy \"lies\" and advocating for troop withdrawals, have strained U.S.-Spanish relations. Spain's foreign policy now focuses on closer ties with EU partners while maintaining relations with the U.S. Zapatero's supporters see this as a continuation of Spain's post-Franco era foreign policy. In the post-Franco era, Spain's foreign policy under Zapatero focuses on closer ties with EU partners while maintaining relations with the U.S. Plans for closer international cooperation in fighting terrorism include sharing information about Islamic militants between Spain and the United States. The use of U.S. military bases in Spain is a question for the future. The Administration easily secured the use of U.S. bases in Spain for the Iraq operation, playing a significant role in delivering men and materiel to the Iraqi theater. Future use of the bases may be more difficult to secure due to criticisms by Spain's new leaders of U.S. policy on \"preventive war.\" The curr_chunk discusses various sources and articles related to the Spanish elections and the country's stance on the Iraq war.
