To qualify as an Economically Distressed Central City, a metropolitan city must meet specific criteria including eligibility for funding under the Housing and Community Development Act, a population of at least 30,000, and a need adjusted per capita income below 1.25. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines the Need Adjusted Per Capita Income for qualifying cities. The formula for determining the need index for qualifying cities is based on the ratio of funds allotted to the city in the fiscal year under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The formula for determining the need index for qualifying cities under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 is based on the total population of the city. The need adjusted per capita income factor is determined for eligible cities based on changes in data and total population, as defined by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The need adjusted per capita income factor is determined for eligible cities based on changes in data and total population. The term \"I\" in subparagraph (A) refers to the per capita income of the city, while the term \"Q\" is the product of the city's need index and the per capita income of the United States. The quotient of \"I\" divided by \"Q\" is calculated for eligible cities based on changes in data and total population. If the quotient of per capita income divided by the product of the city's need index and the per capita income of the United States is less than 0.2, it will be considered as 0.2 for the city in the formula."
