The \"Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative Improvement Act of 2008\" emphasizes the importance of treating all claims of United States citizenship with respect and care to prevent citizens from being deprived of their rights. It also highlights the right to travel abroad and return home as a fundamental aspect of citizenship that should not be denied based on race or arbitrary reasons. Millions of US citizens living in border communities regularly cross the border for various reasons. The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) requires US citizens to have a passport or WHTI-compliant document to cross borders. Some citizens near Mexico have faced challenges in obtaining passports. The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) mandates US citizens to possess a passport or WHTI-compliant document for border crossings. Some individuals near Mexico encounter difficulties in acquiring passports due to a flawed process with heightened burden of proof and insufficient evidentiary support for decisions. The definitions include \"applicant\" as someone submitting a US passport application and \"Secretary\" as the official overseeing passport adjudication. SEC. 3. CONFIRMATION AND CLARIFICATION OF STANDARDS FOR ADJUDICATION OF UNITED STATES PASSPORT APPLICATIONS BY SECRETARY OF STATE. The Secretary must adjudicate US passport applications based on individual circumstances and evidence, without considering race, ethnicity, or ancestry. Applicants must prove their case with evidence throughout the process. The Secretary must evaluate passport applications based on evidence without bias. A preponderance of evidence standard must be applied uniformly, without any heightened burden of proof. Any decision that an applicant has not proven citizenship must be in writing with reasons stated. (c) Acceptance of Certain Evidence.--A birth certificate signed by a midwife, doctor, or other authorized person, or a previously-issued US passport, serves as prima facie evidence of citizenship. This evidence satisfies the preponderance of the evidence standard for proving citizenship unless there is individualized evidence showing the birth did not occur in the US."
