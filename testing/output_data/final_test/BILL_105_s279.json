The Trust Fund Tax Reinstatement Act of 1997 specifies tax rates for aviation fuel for transportation starting after certain dates and ending on September 30, 1997. Refunds will be given if taxes were paid for transportation that would not have been taxed if paid on the start date. Transfers to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund are also outlined in the amendment to section 9502. The curr_chunk discusses taxes received in the Treasury related to aviation fuels, transportation by air, gasoline, and aviation fuel. It also mentions civil penalties collected under section 47107(n) of title 49, United States Code. The curr_chunk discusses the termination of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund financing rate when the tax rate is 4.3 cents per gallon. Additionally, it imposes a floor stocks tax of 15 cents per gallon on aviation gasoline held before the tax effective date. The curr_chunk imposes a tax of 15 cents per gallon on aviation gasoline and 17.5 cents per gallon on aviation fuel. Liability for the tax lies with the person holding the aviation liquid, and payment must be made as prescribed by the Secretary on or before the first day of the 5th month after the tax effective date. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to the taxation of aviation liquids, such as the tax effective date, aviation gasoline, and aviation fuel. Aviation liquid is considered \"held by a person\" if title has passed to them. The curr_chunk explains exceptions to the tax imposed on aviation liquids, including exemptions for specific uses and certain amounts of fuel. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Treasury or delegate. On the tax effective date, no tax is imposed on aviation liquid held by a person if the amount does not exceed 2,000 gallons. Liquid exempt from tax under specific conditions is not considered in the calculation. Controlled groups are also considered for tax purposes. Controlled groups for tax purposes are defined as persons treated as a single entity, with the threshold of control set at more than 50 percent instead of at least 80 percent as per the tax code. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, principles similar to those for controlled groups apply to a group of persons under common control where one or more are not corporations. All provisions of law applicable to taxes imposed by sections 4081 or 4091 apply to floor stocks taxes imposed here. The amendments made by subsection (a) and (b) of the Act apply to fuel and ticket taxes starting on the 7th day after enactment. Exceptions exist for certain payments and property transportation tax within controlled groups. The amendments to fuel and ticket taxes apply starting on the 7th day after enactment, with exceptions for transportation payments within controlled groups. The look-back safe harbor for deposits does not apply to taxes unless imposed throughout the look-back period."
