    "content": "The \"Localism in Broadcasting Reform Act of 2005\" shortens broadcast license terms to 3 years, requires full Commission review for 5% of applications, and mandates reports on issues, programs, and children's television. The Commission will require broadcasters to electronically file public interest issues and children's programming reports every quarter. Waivers may be granted for good cause. Broadcast stations with websites must also make their public interest issues and programs list available. The Commission mandates broadcasters to file public interest issues and children's programming reports electronically every quarter. Broadcast stations with websites must provide access to this information or link to the Commission's website. The Commission must amend regulations within 180 days of the Act's enactment to implement these requirements. SEC. 5 amends the Communications Act of 1934 to include a review of all stations operated by a licensee for broadcast station renewal. SEC. 6 introduces a party in interest requirement for petitions opposing license grants or renewals. Section 309(d) of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include a definition of 'party in interest' for license renewal applications, encompassing listeners, individuals advocating for public interest, and those meeting specific requirements. The Commission must complete action on specific matters related to television broadcast licensee public interest obligations within 9 months of this Act's enactment. This includes considering standardized forms for electronically filed reports and potentially requiring their use. Additionally, definitions are provided for 'party in interest' in license renewal applications. In this Act, definitions are provided for key terms such as \"broadcaster,\" \"children's programming reports,\" \"Commission,\" and \"public interest issues and programs list.\" These definitions clarify the information that broadcasters are required to provide for public inspection. Non-commercial broadcast stations must provide certain information for public inspection as outlined in specific sections of the Code of Federal Regulations."
