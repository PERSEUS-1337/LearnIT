    "content": "The \"Healthy Kids Outdoors Act of 2011\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. Key findings are outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that children today are spending less time outdoors, leading to health risks such as the growing obesity crisis and impacting military readiness. Research has shown that military children and families are facing increased stress and mental strain due to extended deployments. Military family service organizations lack resources to meet the increasing demand for programs that connect them with positive outdoor experiences. Additionally, childhood obesity has negative economic impacts and affects revenue generation for the outdoor retail industry and local communities. Urbanization is also a factor in the decrease in outdoor activities. Over the past years, urbanization, changing land use patterns, and inadequate solutions have made it difficult for Americans to walk or bike to schools, parks, and play areas. Visitation to public lands has declined, impacting the connection with nature critical for fostering outdoor enthusiasts. Dedicated individuals work to preserve America's natural resources. Spending time outdoors in nature is beneficial for children's physical, mental, and emotional health, decreasing symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, stimulating brain development, improving motor skills, sleep, reducing stress, increasing creativity, improving mood, and lowering the risk of myopia. Outdoor play helps children take risks, seek adventure, build self-confidence, and appreciate nature's value. Green spaces like parks and gardens can enhance these benefits. Spending time outdoors in nature, including parks, play areas, and gardens, can improve concentration, self-discipline, and reduce stress. Exposure to greener environments has been linked to lower aggression and stress in children. Conservation education and outdoor activities like camping, hiking, hunting, and fishing are crucial for engaging young people in nature. Hunters and anglers play a vital role in reconnecting youth with the natural world. Research shows that early exposure to hunting leads to continued interest in the activity. Children introduced to hunting between ages 10 and 12 are more likely to become active hunters as adults. Direct childhood experiences with nature before age 11 foster long-term connections to the natural world. Various organizations and facilities play a crucial role in connecting children and families with nature. States nationwide and their community-based partners have programs connecting children and families with nature, but most lack resources and a comprehensive strategy. Engaging in cross-sector agency collaboration is essential for effective engagement across multiple fields. States need to engage in cross-sector agency and nonprofit collaboration involving public health, parks and recreation, transportation, and city planning to provide healthy outdoor opportunities for children and families. The text chunk discusses the definitions related to the topic at hand. The Act defines terms such as \"eligible entity\" as a State or consortium, \"local partners\" as various entities, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, and \"State\" as any of the several states. The term \"State\" in the Act refers to any of the several States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other territories or Indian tribes. SEC. 4. Cooperative agreements for development or implementation of Healthy Kids Outdoors state strategies. The Secretary can issue one cooperative agreement per State to develop a 5-year State strategy called \"Healthy Kids Outdoors State Strategy\" to promote outdoor physical activity, especially for children. Applications must be submitted within 120 days of guidelines publication, including a strategy meeting specific requirements. Approval of the strategy and peer review must occur within 90 days. The Healthy Kids Outdoors State Strategy must be updated every 5 years, with continued funding dependent on submission of updated strategies and impact evaluation reports. The strategy should include ways to encourage outdoor physical activity for children. The eligible entity must describe how they will promote outdoor physical activity for Americans, especially children, youth, and families, through various public systems and partnerships with NGOs, state agencies, and tribal agencies. Collaboration among state agencies is also required for strategy implementation. The eligible entity must describe how funding will be spent through local planning and implementation subgrants, evaluate the strategy's effectiveness, involve the public in its development, increase visitation to Federal public lands, and leverage private funds for implementation. A Healthy Kids Outdoors State Strategy involves providing subgrants to local partners for implementing outdoor recreation and youth mentoring programs, connecting communities, and promoting lifelong participation in outdoor activities such as fishing, hunting, hiking, and wildlife watching. Implementing programs to connect communities with safe parks, green spaces, and outdoor recreation areas through affordable public transportation and trail systems that encourage physical activity; school-based programs using outdoor learning environments and service learning to restore natural areas; education programs for parents about the health benefits of outdoor time to combat obesity and improve quality of life for Americans, especially children, youth, and families. The Secretary and recipients must prioritize entities serving individuals with limited access to nature, such as those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, disabled, or facing health stressors. Guidelines for implementing the Act, including strategies, evaluation methods, technical assistance, and dissemination of best practices, will be published within 180 days. The eligible entity receiving funds must report on the implementation of the Healthy Kids Outdoors State Strategy, allocate funds with a maximum of 5% for administrative expenses, provide a 25% match through contributions, and use at least 95% of the funding for subgrants to local partners. The National Strategy for Encouraging Americans to be Active Outdoors is outlined in Section 5. The President, with federal departments, must develop a national strategy by September 30, 2012, to promote outdoor physical activity for Americans, especially children. This strategy includes identifying barriers, forming partnerships, and coordinating efforts to address health impacts like childhood obesity and stress. The national strategy aims to promote outdoor physical activity for Americans, focusing on children and youth. It includes addressing barriers, forming partnerships, and coordinating efforts to combat health issues like childhood obesity and stress. Ongoing research needs to document health, conservation, and economic outcomes, along with coordination with Healthy Kids Outdoors State Strategies and an action plan for federal implementation. The national strategy promotes outdoor physical activity for Americans, focusing on children and youth. It includes forming partnerships and coordinating efforts to combat health issues like childhood obesity and stress. The President shall update the strategy every 5 years and incorporate evaluation results. The Secretary will develop recommendations for a national study on health impacts and provide technical assistance and best practices for promoting outdoor physical activity. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the Secretary to carry out the Act, with specific amounts allocated for fiscal years 2013 to 2017. A limitation of 5% is set for funds used for section 7, and the funds are meant to supplement existing federal, state, or local funds for promoting outdoor physical activity."
