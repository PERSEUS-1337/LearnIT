    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Methamphetamine Prevention Campaign Grant Program Act of 2010\". It includes findings and purpose. Congress finds that methamphetamine is a significant drug threat in the United States, leading to increased crime, identity theft, and environmental damage from methamphetamine laboratories. This places a strain on law enforcement and local resources. Methamphetamine poses a significant threat in the United States, with 24% of teens believing it is easy to obtain. Additionally, 33% of teens perceive little risk in trying methamphetamines, and 16% have a friend or family member with a history of use. The economic burden of methamphetamine use is estimated to be between $16.2 billion and $48.3 billion annually, leading to increased government and individual expenditures on treatment and social services. The purpose of this Act is to provide resources for the Department of Justice to implement a methamphetamine prevention campaign in States with a critical methamphetamine problem. This campaign will involve community outreach programs to raise awareness and educate youth on the risks of methamphetamine use. The Act establishes a Methamphetamine Prevention Campaign Grant Program to address the methamphetamine problem in States through community outreach programs. The Attorney General may grant up to $2,000,000 per year to eligible entities for a 1-year methamphetamine prevention campaign aimed at teenagers. Funds can be used for producing advertisements, acquiring ad placements, and community outreach. The eligible entities receiving grants for methamphetamine prevention campaigns must conduct a benchmark study and periodic surveys to capture attitudes and behaviors related to methamphetamine. Qualitative research is also required to assist in developing and testing messaging and effectiveness of education campaigns. The eligible entities receiving grants for methamphetamine prevention campaigns must conduct periodic follow-up studies to track changes in attitudes and behaviors related to methamphetamine. Applications for grants must be submitted to the Attorney General as per their requirements. Each application for methamphetamine prevention grants must include a plan for a prevention campaign targeting youth, consultation with relevant agencies, a private fundraising strategy, and any information required by the Attorney General. The Attorney General prioritizes grants for entities addressing methamphetamine use, with dedicated personnel for prevention campaigns and ability to provide quality-tested media content. The Federal share of grant costs is determined by the application submitted.
