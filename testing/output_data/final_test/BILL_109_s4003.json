    "content": "The \"Ethanol Infrastructure Expansion Act of 2006\" may be cited as such. Key findings are outlined in the Act. The \"Ethanol Infrastructure Expansion Act of 2006\" emphasizes the national interest in increasing ethanol use in transportation fuels. Ethanol is recognized as a clean, renewable fuel that offers public health benefits by reducing emissions, including greenhouse gases. Additionally, ethanol provides economic advantages to agricultural and biofuels producers, benefits national security by reducing reliance on imported petroleum, and can lower fuel prices for consumers. Ethanol faces challenges in transportation through pipelines. Ethanol faces challenges in transportation due to competing demands for rail tanker cars, barges, and trucks. As the US ethanol market expands, dedicated ethanol pipelines may be needed to transport ethanol from the Midwest to the Eastern and Western United States. Currently, dedicated ethanol pipelines do not exist in the US, but Brazil has shown that ethanol can be effectively shipped via pipeline. The construction of dedicated ethanol pipelines in the US is crucial due to challenges in transportation. Brazil has proven that ethanol can be effectively transported via pipeline, and a study on ethanol pipelines is needed soon as construction would take several years to complete. The term \"Secretary\" in this Act refers to the Secretary of Energy. Feasibility studies are required for ethanol pipelines due to transportation challenges, as seen in Brazil's successful pipeline system for ethanol. The Secretary of Energy, in collaboration with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Transportation, will allocate up to $1,000,000 for feasibility studies on dedicated ethanol pipelines. These studies will be conducted by firms with expertise in pipeline planning, development, and construction, selected through a competitive process. Funding will be awarded promptly to chosen firms for the studies. The Secretary shall award funding within 120 days of enactment. Recipients must submit a feasibility study within 360 days. Studies will consider barriers to ethanol pipelines, market risks, and options to mitigate risks. The Secretary will award funding within 120 days of enactment for the construction of dedicated ethanol pipelines. Recipients must submit a feasibility study within 360 days, considering barriers, market risks, and other relevant factors. If confidentiality is requested for critical energy infrastructure information, the Secretary can enter into a confidentiality agreement. The Secretary will review feasibility studies on dedicated ethanol pipelines and submit a report to Congress within 15 months of the Act's enactment, including potential benefits and legislative recommendations for construction. SEC. 5. FUNDING. $1,000,000 authorized for fiscal year 2008 for the Secretary to carry out the Act."
