    "content": "The Act titled \"20/20 Biofuels Challenge Act of 2005\" includes definitions for key terms. The \"20/20 Biofuels Challenge Act of 2005\" defines key terms, including the Administrator as the head of the EPA, alternative fuel as defined in the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and cellulosic biomass ethanol as liquid fuels derived from cellulosic biomass feedstocks. The \"20/20 Biofuels Challenge Act of 2005\" defines cellulosic biomass feedstock as fuel derived from lignocellulosic or hemicellulosic matter of plants grown for energy production, excluding plants grown on conservation reserve program land. The program defines cellulosic biomass feedstock as nonhazardous lignocellulosic or hemicellulosic matter derived from trees, plant matter near structures, precommercial thinning, agricultural crops, or crop residues. The conservation reserve program prohibits harvesting plants inconsistent with its goals, excluding recyclable paper, treated wood, and contaminated wood. Renewable fuel is defined as motor vehicle fuel. Renewable fuel is motor vehicle fuel produced from biomass or natural gas from biogas sources, used to replace fossil fuel in fuel mixtures. It includes biodiesel and cellulosic biomass ethanol. The term \"waste derived ethanol\" refers to ethanol derived from animal wastes, poultry fats, poultry wastes, other waste materials, or municipal solid waste. The Renewable Fuel Standard is defined as ethanol derived from various waste materials or municipal solid waste. The Renewable Fuel Program requires regulations to ensure motor vehicle fuel in the US contains a specified volume of renewable fuel. Compliance provisions are included for refiners, blenders, and importers. The Renewable Fuel Program mandates specified volumes of renewable fuel in US motor vehicle fuel from 2006 to 2020 as per the provided table. Compliance rules apply to refiners, blenders, and importers. The Renewable Fuel Program mandates increasing volumes of renewable fuel in US motor vehicle fuel from 2006 to 2020. For calendar year 2020 and beyond, the required volume is set at 20 billion gallons annually, with 1 gallon of cellulosic biomass ethanol equivalent to 3.5 gallons of renewable fuel. Additionally, there is a provision to stimulate biodiesel production. SEC. 4 amends sections of the Internal Revenue Code to extend the deadline to 2010. SEC. 5 introduces a requirement for gasoline and diesel vehicles to use alternative biofuels. In this section, a flexible fuel mixture is defined as a blend of ethanol with gasoline for gasoline vehicles or biodiesel with fossil-based diesel fuel for diesel vehicles. The term \"vehicle\" includes passenger automobiles, off-highway capable automobiles, light trucks, and heavy vehicles used for shipping. The term 'water transportation' includes vehicles used for transporting people, goods, and services over long distances, such as public and commercial waterborne ferrys and barges for interstate and international commerce. Requirement for vehicles and vessels manufactured after 2010 to be capable of operating on flexible fuel mixtures. The Secretary of Transportation must regulate manufacturers to display badges indicating this capability and include information in owner's manuals. The text chunk discusses the benefits of using a flexible fuel mixture, including renewable nature, increased fuel efficiency, and environmental benefits. It also mentions a conforming amendment to the chapter analysis for chapter 329 of title 49, United States Code. SEC. 6. FEEDSTOCK DIVERSIFICATION. 32902A. Requirement to equip gasoline and diesel powered vehicles to use alternative biofuels. The Secretary of Agriculture is directed to support the development of cellulosic feedstock by growing erosion-preventing, renewable fuel producing crops on arable land in the conservation reserve program. A study will be conducted to assess the impact of producing crops for biofuel production on land use and food, forest products, and livestock feed. The Secretary of Agriculture is mandated to conduct a 10-year research program to enhance crop productivity and reduce costs for cellulosic-based ethanol feedstock. By September 30, 2006, a technology roadmap and 5-year research plan must be submitted to Congress, outlining ongoing work within the Department of Agriculture. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to submit an annual report to Congress summarizing the accomplishments and progress made in the 5-year research plan for enhancing crop productivity and reducing costs for cellulosic-based ethanol feedstock. The report should also include recommendations for accelerating current work and describing new work needed to achieve plan goals and objectives. The Secretary of Agriculture is mandated to submit an annual report to Congress detailing the progress in the 5-year research plan for improving crop productivity and reducing costs for cellulosic-based ethanol feedstock. Additionally, a 10-year research program for enhancing crop diversity, productivity, and cost for biodiesel feedstock is to be carried out, with a technology roadmap and research plan to be submitted to Congress by September 30, 2006. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to submit an annual report to Congress outlining progress in the 5-year research plan for improving crop productivity and reducing costs for cellulosic-based ethanol feedstock. The report should also include a 10-year research program for enhancing crop diversity, productivity, and cost for biodiesel feedstock, with recommendations for accelerating current work and describing new work necessary to achieve plan goals and objectives. The Secretary of Energy will submit a report to Congress summarizing accomplishments and progress in a 5-year plan, as well as any revisions to the plan or technology roadmap. Additionally, the Secretary will implement an 8-year research and development plan to improve processes for converting cellulosic feedstock into ethanol production. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress detailing the 8-year plan's accomplishments and any revisions to the technology roadmap. Additionally, a research and development plan will be carried out for biodiesel feedstock. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress outlining an 8-year research and development plan to improve biodiesel feedstock conversion processes. Annual reports will be provided to Congress summarizing progress and any plan revisions. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2006 through 2010 is set at $50,000,000 for each subparagraph in the technology roadmap plan."
