Congress acknowledges the contract between the Forest Service and the purchaser for harvesting timber from the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, emphasizing the need for a pulp mill or similar facility for permanent operation. A pulp mill in southeast Alaska is essential for creating year-round, high-paying jobs, utilizing low-grade wood, and maintaining a stable economy.

The management planning process for forest resources in southeast Alaska aims to ensure sustainable timber production while protecting other forest uses like tourism, fishing, and recreation. Compliance with environmental laws and commitment to exploring new technologies for timber utilization are key priorities. The national interest in southeast Alaska is served by maximizing timber use, ensuring proper stewardship of publicly owned assets in the Tongass National Forest, and balancing multiple use interests to enhance forest health and economic growth.
