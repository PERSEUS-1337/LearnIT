    "content": "States and localities have implemented fair share laws, also known as \"pay or play\" statutes, to address the challenges of healthcare financing and access due to the rise in uninsured individuals and the decline in employer-provided insurance. These laws require employers to either contribute to health expenditures or coverage for their employees or pay into a fund to support uninsured residents. Legal debates have arisen over whether ERISA's preemption provision hinders the enforcement of fair share laws, leading to varying court decisions in Maryland, San Francisco, and Suffolk County, New York. This report discusses ERISA preemption and legal challenges against fair share laws, focusing on the fair share requirements of the Massachusetts Health Care Reform Act. ERISA regulates employee pension and welfare benefit plans, while fair share laws aim to address healthcare financing and access issues. Varying court decisions have been made in Maryland, San Francisco, and Suffolk County, New York regarding the enforcement of fair share laws. ERISA mandates compliance with its provisions for pension and welfare benefits, preempting state laws related to employee benefit plans. The U.S. Supreme Court interprets ERISA to apply to any state law connected to such plans, considering ERISA's objectives as a guide. The U.S. Supreme Court interprets ERISA to apply to state laws that have a direct impact on ERISA plans. State laws can be saved from preemption if they regulate insurance, banking, or securities. However, laws that attempt to regulate insurance cannot deem an employee benefit plan as an insurance company. The Court's decisions on ERISA preemption were previously seen as unlimited until 1995. The U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of ERISA preemption has evolved over time. In the case of New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., the Court showed a greater willingness to uphold various state laws. The Court considered Congress's intent and the structure of ERISA in determining preemption, ultimately concluding that Congress did not intend to supplant state law. The U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of ERISA preemption has evolved over time. In the case of Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, the Court determined that a Washington state law was preempted by ERISA despite giving plans an option to avoid its requirements. The law in question automatically revoked the designation of a spouse as the beneficiary of a nonprobate asset upon divorce, leading the Court to find an impermissible connection with ERISA. The U.S. Supreme Court found that a Washington state law interfered with ERISA plans' uniform administration, leading to preemption. The Court emphasized ERISA's goal of standard procedures and uniformity, stating that plans cannot be subject to different legal obligations in various states. The \"opt out\" option in the law was not sufficient to avoid preemption, as plan administrators would need to comply with laws from all 50 states to tailor their plans accordingly. The Fair Share laws in different jurisdictions raise questions about preemption and compliance options for employers. Maryland, Suffolk County, New York, and San Francisco have implemented such laws with varying outcomes. Maryland's Fair Share Health Care Fund Act required large employers to spend a minimum percentage of payroll on employee health insurance or pay the shortfall to the state. Retail Industry Leaders Association challenged this law shortly after its enactment. The Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), including Wal-Mart, challenged Maryland's Fair Share Act, claiming it was preempted by ERISA. The U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the decision, stating the Act was indeed preempted. The Act aimed to address rising healthcare costs for low-income residents by requiring large employers like Wal-Mart to provide adequate health benefits to employees. Wal-Mart's failure to do so led to employees enrolling in Medicaid and other state programs. Maryland's Fair Share Act required large employers to provide health benefits to employees. The Secretary argued that the Act was a revenue statute to fund the Fair Share Health Care Fund. He also claimed that the Act did not necessarily involve employee benefit plans. The Fourth Circuit rejected the Secretary's arguments regarding Maryland's Fair Share Act, stating that the Act was not intended to function as a revenue statute but rather required large employers like Wal-Mart to increase healthcare spending for employees. The Fourth Circuit rejected the Secretary's arguments regarding Maryland's Fair Share Act, stating that the Act was not intended as a revenue statute but rather incentivized large employers to provide greater health benefits to employees. The court found that the Act directly regulates employers' structuring of their employee health benefit plans, giving them no choice but to comply. The Fourth Circuit rejected the Secretary's arguments on Maryland's Fair Share Act, stating it incentivized large employers to provide greater health benefits. The court found the Act directly regulates employers' health benefit plans, giving them no choice but to comply. The court noted that decisions regarding ERISA and non-ERISA health care spending would affect each other, violating ERISA's preemption provision. The dissent argued that the Act was not preempted by ERISA as it offered compliance options that do not impact ERISA plans. The Fourth Circuit rejected the Secretary's arguments on Maryland's Fair Share Act, stating it incentivized large employers to provide greater health benefits. The dissent suggested that preemption would be more likely if the Act dictated a plan's system for processing claims, paying benefits, or determining beneficiaries. However, any burden imposed on ERISA plans by the Act was \"simply too slight to trigger ERISA preemption.\" The Maryland Attorney General announced that his office would not seek review of the Fourth Circuit's decision by the Supreme Court. Under the Suffolk County Act, covered employers would have been required to make specified minimum employee health care expenditures, with penalties for those below the specified level. The Suffolk County Act defined a \"covered employer\" as any person operating a retail store in Suffolk County selling groceries or foods for off-site consumption, meeting specific requirements based on store size or revenue. The Suffolk County Act defines a \"covered employer\" as a retail store in Suffolk County selling groceries, making up over 20% of revenue. RILA argued that the Act was preempted by ERISA due to mandated health care benefits, interference with national benefit plans, and additional reporting requirements. The court found the Act similar to the Fair Share Act and in line with the Fourth Circuit's analysis. The court rejected the county's claim that a state law is not preempted by ERISA where the existence of a plan is not necessary to be in compliance with the state law. The Suffolk County Act required covered employers to structure their ERISA health care benefit plans to meet a minimum spending threshold, leading to a conclusion that the Act had an \"obvious connection with employee benefit plans\" and was preempted by ERISA. The San Francisco Health Care Security Ordinance, like the Suffolk County Act, mandates covered employers to make minimum health care expenditures for eligible employees. Covered employers are those with a minimum number of employees, while covered employees must meet specific criteria to qualify for benefits under the Ordinance. Various health care expenditures are outlined, including contributions to health savings accounts and payments to third parties for health care services. The San Francisco Health Care Security Ordinance requires covered employers to make minimum health care expenditures for eligible employees, which can include contributions to health savings accounts or payments to third parties for health care services. Employers have discretion in choosing the type of health care expenditure. However, a California federal district court ruled that the Ordinance was preempted by ERISA as it interfered with employer autonomy over employee benefit plans. The San Francisco Health Care Security Ordinance's requirements interfere with employer autonomy and national regulation of employee health coverage. The court found the Ordinance impermissibly connected to employee benefit plans by mandating specific benefits and affecting existing plan structures. Employers had to adjust plans or make additional payments to comply. The Ordinance unlawfully referenced ERISA plans and determined liability based on employer-sponsored health benefits. The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's decision regarding the San Francisco Ordinance, stating that ERISA does not preempt it. The Golden Gate Restaurant Association argued that the city-payment option creates an ERISA plan or that the Ordinance unfairly requires employers to make payments. The Ninth Circuit ruled that the San Francisco Ordinance does not create an ERISA plan, as it only imposes minimal administrative duties on employers. The court stated that employers are only required to make payments for covered employees and retain records, without the need to meet specific ERISA criteria for plan creation. The Ninth Circuit determined that the San Francisco Ordinance does not relate to an ERISA plan, as it only imposes minimal administrative duties on employers. The court concluded that the Ordinance does not create an ERISA plan and is not preempted by the statute. The Ninth Circuit found that the San Francisco Ordinance does not bind plan administrators to specific rules or structure employee benefit plans in a particular manner. The Ordinance does not have an unlawful reference to an ERISA plan and can operate independently of the existence of ERISA plans. The Ninth Circuit ruled that employers in San Francisco with ERISA plans can fulfill their obligations under the Ordinance by making healthcare expenditures to the City based on employees' hours worked. The court clarified that the Ordinance does not require specific benefits levels in employee health plans, unlike the Maryland Fair Share Act. Massachusetts enacted comprehensive health care reform legislation in 2006, requiring residents to have health coverage or face tax consequences. The act establishes a \"Connector\" for obtaining health coverage and imposes requirements on private insurers and employers, including a fair share requirement for employers with more than 11 full-time equivalent employees. There is speculation on whether this requirement could be preempted by ERISA. Employers in Massachusetts must make a \"fair and reasonable\" contribution to a group health plan for their employees' coverage or pay into a state trust fund to help cover costs for uninsured residents. Two tests determine if the contribution is fair: the \"primary test\" requires 25% of Massachusetts employees to be enrolled in the health plan, while the \"secondary test\" allows for a 33% premium payment for full-time employees. If these tests are not met, a fair-share contribution is required annually. The Massachusetts Act requires employers to make a fair-share contribution annually, taking into account factors like state-funded care costs for employees. The contribution amount cannot exceed $295 per employee. Despite speculation of a preemption challenge under ERISA, no actions have been taken. If challenged, a court may refer to the Travelers case and ERISA objectives to determine the law's connection with ERISA plans. A reviewing court may consider the \"nature of the law's effect on ERISA plans\" when determining preemption, looking at whether the Massachusetts fair share requirements directly impact plan structure or administration. The court could also analyze if the law has a \"reference to\" an employee benefit plan, which could result in preemption. Additionally, the court may distinguish the fair share requirements from previous cases like Egelhoff, where laws regulating plan structure were not saved from preemption. The Massachusetts fair share requirements could face preemption if a court determines they interfere with ERISA's goal of uniform nationwide administration of employee health plans, similar to the reasoning used in the Fielder case regarding Maryland's Fair Share Act. The court may find that providing an opt-out option does not protect the law from preemption if it effectively forces employers to restructure their health plans. The Massachusetts Act, like Maryland's fair share law, requires employers to contribute to employee health benefits or a state fund. The relatively small penalty of $295 per employee may not bind employers' choices, but could still be seen as coercive by a court, potentially leading to ERISA preemption concerns. The Massachusetts fair share requirements may be more susceptible to preemption than the Fielder and Suffolk County cases. Employers are required to pay fair and reasonable premium contributions to a group health plan to avoid making a fair-share contribution to the state, potentially impacting ERISA plans. The Massachusetts fair share requirements may be challenged for potentially creating impermissible references to ERISA plans by requiring employers to contribute to a group health plan instead of the state. However, a court could uphold these requirements by following the Ninth Circuit's reasoning in a similar case, which found that a similar ordinance did not interfere with ERISA's regulatory regime as it allowed employers to fulfill their obligations through different means. The Massachusetts fair share requirement does not mandate employers to establish an ERISA health plan or provide health benefits to employees. The Ninth Circuit determined that the Ordinance does not impact ERISA plans directly and can function independently without them. It could be argued that the Massachusetts Act does not exclusively apply to ERISA plans and does not require the formation of a plan to meet its requirements."
