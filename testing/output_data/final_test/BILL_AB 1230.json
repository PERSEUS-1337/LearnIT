    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 44559.13 of the Health and Safety Code establishes the California Americans with Disabilities Small Business Capital Access Loan Program to help small businesses comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The program will be administered by the California Pollution Control Financing Authority and will have specific requirements outlined in this section. The \"Americans with Disabilities Act\" refers to the federal law and its amendments. The \"California Americans with Disabilities Act Small Business Capital Access Loan Program Fund\" is a fund established for this program. Eligible cost includes construction, purchase price of property, demolition, machinery, equipment, financing charges, insurance, reserves, services, and other necessary expenses for the project. Eligible costs for the project include expenses necessary for compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. An \"eligible project\" refers to necessary alterations to a small business facility under 10,000 square feet to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, along with the financing for the project. A \"qualified loan\" is a loan limited to eligible project costs, not exceeding $50,000. A \"small business\" must have 15 or fewer full-time employees, less than $1,000,000 in annual income, and not provide overnight accommodations. The California Americans with Disabilities Act Small Business Capital Access Loan Program Fund is established in the State Treasury and administered by the authority for program purposes. All money in the fund is continuously appropriated to the authority for carrying out the program. The authority may divide the fund into separate accounts, and all moneys accruing to the authority from any source shall be deposited into the fund. Program expenditures include contributions paid by the authority in support of qualified loans. The California Americans with Disabilities Act Small Business Capital Access Loan Program Fund is administered by the authority for program purposes. Administrative expenditures are limited to 5 percent of the initial appropriation and include personnel costs, service contracts, and other administrative costs. The authority can direct the Treasurer to invest excess funds in eligible securities or interest-bearing accounts in state banks. Alternatively, funds can be transferred to the Surplus Money Investment Fund for investment. Interest earned is deposited back into the fund, and the funds are not transferable to other accounts. The authority can direct the Treasurer to invest excess funds in eligible securities or interest-bearing accounts in state banks, excluding the Surplus Money Investment Fund. The authority will adopt regulations to implement the program, including establishing a new loss reserve account for each participating lender, obtaining certification from lenders and small businesses, providing additional incentives for businesses in severely affected communities, restricting enrollment in other loan programs, and limiting the term of loss coverage to five years. The California Americans with Disabilities Act Small Business Capital Access Loan Program limits loss coverage for each loan to five years and recaptures contributions upon loan maturation or after five years. $10 million is transferred to the program fund for administering and funding loss reserve accounts."
