    "content": "The United States Constitution grants Congress exclusive authority over legislative affairs in the District of Columbia. Congress imposed height limitations on buildings in 1910 and granted limited home rule to the city's residents in 1973 through the Home Rule Act. This allowed for the popular election of a mayor and city council, but Congress still plays an active role in governance. In 1995, Congress passed legislation encouraging charter schools, authorizing the takeover of city services by a financial control board, and creating the Office of the Chief Financial Officer. In 1997, the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act transferred state-like functions to the federal government to address a fiscal crisis, including funding for prisons, courts, and unfunded pension liabilities. Additionally, the federal government increased its share of the District's Medicaid costs from 50% to 70%. Congress has increased the federal government's share of the District's Medicaid costs from 50% to 70%. Additionally, Congress has imposed restrictions on the District's use of public funds for voting representation, initiatives, and referenda. Congress also has authority over the District's legislative affairs through various means. The District of Columbia operates under the Home Rule Act, which includes provisions for congressional oversight. The chairman of the District of Columbia Council must transmit all passed acts to Congress for review. The District of Columbia operates under the Home Rule Act, which includes provisions for congressional oversight. The chairman of the District of Columbia Council must transmit all passed acts to Congress for review. The law in question will take effect upon the expiration of a specified \"layover\" period following the date it was transmitted to Congress unless overturned by a joint resolution of disapproval. Different layover periods apply based on the type of law enacted in the District. Laws in Title 22, 23, or 24 of the District of Columbia Code must lie over for 60 days, while all other laws have a layover period of 30 days before going into force. Under the Home Rule Act, any Member of the House or Senate may introduce a joint resolution disapproving a law of the District of Columbia within 30 calendar days. Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and days when Congress is not in session are excluded from this period. Joint resolutions are referred to specific committees for review, and amendments cannot be made once a resolution is referred. Committees can mark up resolutions but not report amendments to them. A discharge mechanism is available for joint resolutions concerning District of Columbia laws in the criminal code. If a committee does not report a disapproval resolution within 20 days, a motion to discharge the committee can be made. The motion is debatable for one hour and can only be made by a supporter of the legislation. Once a disapproval resolution is reported, the motion to discharge is no longer available. For other enactments, committees would need to report a joint resolution for it to proceed. In both the House and Senate, once a committee has reported or been discharged from further consideration of a joint resolution, a non-debatable motion to proceed to consider the measure is in order. The joint disapproval resolution may not be amended or recommitted, and a vote thereon may not be reconsidered. Passage of a joint resolution is by simple majority vote, and any appeals from decisions of the chair are to be decided without debate. The joint resolution must be passed and presented to the President before the layover period expires to invalidate a District law. If a joint resolution is vetoed by the President, attempts to override the veto would follow normal House and Senate procedures. The Home Rule Act disapproval procedure allows Congress to invalidate a proposed District law through an expedited parliamentary method. It is not the only way Congress can disapprove of a law, but if a joint resolution is vetoed by the President, the veto override process would follow normal House and Senate procedures. Congress has used the special parliamentary disapproval mechanisms of the Home Rule Act to nullify proposed District of Columbia laws on three occasions since the act's passage in the 1970s. However, more frequently, Congress influences DC through the regular lawmaking process, including appropriations. The disapproval procedure is just one method Congress can use to stop DC laws, with the appropriations process being used more often for this purpose. The District of Columbia appropriations acts have provisions that nullify legislative acts, and Congress can also influence DC through regular lawmaking processes. Examples include the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act and the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Act. These acts aimed to address fiscal and management crises in the District by creating financial control boards and the Office of the Chief Financial Officer. The District of Columbia has faced financial and management crises, leading to congressional efforts to improve its finances. P.L. 105-33 transferred state-related functions to the federal government and increased the federal contribution to Medicare. Congress also enacted education reform legislation without input from DC citizens, including a public charter school initiative and a private school voucher program. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced the District of Columbia Paperwork Reduction Act to amend the home rule charter. The bill aims to reduce Congress's role in the District's legislative affairs by eliminating the 30-60 day congressional review period for legislation passed by the District of Columbia Council. It also seeks to change procedures for amending the District's home rule charter, removing the 35-day charter review period for Congress. This would significantly diminish Congress's involvement in the District's legislative process, despite its constitutional power over the District's affairs. Under the District's home rule charter, all spending must be reviewed and approved by Congress through the federal appropriations process. Delays in the appropriations process hinder District officials' ability to manage the city's budget effectively. Delays in the approval of the District's appropriations act have become routine, hindering the city's financial management and public service delivery. Congress has included language in budget resolutions to allow the District to use local funds to mitigate the impact of delays. District officials are also in a dispute over the legality of a voter-approved referendum that aims to amend the home rule charter by eliminating congressional review mandates. The mayor's FY2016 budget request, approved by the Council, aims to give the District more autonomy over locally raised revenues by decoupling its fiscal year from the federal fiscal year and allowing officials to spend local funds without congressional approval. Additionally, legislation has been introduced to eliminate congressional review mandates in the District's home rule charter. The District Delegate to Congress introduced legislation, H.R. 552, for budget autonomy over locally raised revenues by eliminating the need for congressional approval. This bill is part of a series of budget autonomy bills dating back to 1981. Additionally, in 2014, the District Council had a legal dispute with the Mayor and Chief Financial Officer over a budget autonomy amendment. The Local Budget Autonomy Act of 2012 was passed by the Council on December 19, 2012, and signed by the Mayor on January 18, 2013. The mayor signed the measure A19-0632 on January 18, 2013, amending the District's home rule charter to eliminate the requirement for congressional approval of the District of Columbia budget. Despite objections from the District's Attorney General, the charter amendment was placed on a ballot and approved by voters with 83% support. The mayor later informed the Council of his intent not to enforce the law. The District's Attorney General raised legal objections to a charter amendment eliminating the need for congressional approval of the DC budget. The Mayor, citing the Attorney General's opinion, expressed his intent not to enforce the law. The Attorney General questioned the legality of the amendment and the Board of Elections' authority to place it on the ballot. The District's Attorney General raised legal objections to a charter amendment that would eliminate the need for congressional approval of the DC budget. The amendment is precluded by law from going on the ballot if it would enact or affect any law that the Council may not enact under specified limitations. These limitations reserve the authority to change laws governing the role of Congress and the President in the District's budget. The District's Attorney General raised legal objections to a charter amendment that would eliminate the need for congressional approval of the DC budget. The amendment is precluded by law from going on the ballot if it would enact or affect any law that the Council may not enact under specified limitations, including changes to laws governing the role of Congress and the President in the District's budget. The objections were reiterated in a legal analysis by the Office of Attorney General, stating that the proposed amendment exceeds the Council's authority and violates federal law. The District's Attorney General raised legal objections to a charter amendment that would eliminate the need for congressional approval of the DC budget. The Act violates various limitations, including changing the functions of the United States and the District, altering roles and procedures of federal entities, and using the ratification process for local budget autonomy. Legal arguments in support of the Act are deemed unpersuasive, with a GAO legal analysis also raising objections. The District of Columbia Council filed a suit to compel the mayor to execute the charter amendment changes. Judge Emmet G. Sullivan deemed the Local Budget Autonomy Act unlawful, enjoining District officials from enforcing it. The Council appealed the decision, presenting its case before a three-judge panel. A new mayor, Muriel Bowser, reversed the previous decision not to enforce the Act. A motion to dismiss was filed, claiming no dispute between the Council and the new mayor. The District Court judgment in April 2014 was vacated, the appeal dismissed, and the case remanded to the D.C. Superior Court. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted the motion for dismissal on May 27, 2015, sending the case back to the Superior Court. The issue of budget autonomy remains unresolved, with a dispute between the Council and the District's Chief Financial Officer. The CFO and AG stated on May 27, 2015, that the D.C. Circuit's decision did not validate the Budget Autonomy Act. They are exploring legal options for clarity on the Act's legality. Delegate Norton introduced H.R. 552 to grant the District autonomy in its budget process. The District of Columbia may soon have the power to develop its own budget process and rules governing financial management. The Appropriations Committee could address the issue in the FY2016 appropriations bill. Despite support for budget autonomy, Congress has not provided a permanent solution. During recent appropriations cycles, Congress approved the District's local budget before the fiscal year began. The voter-approved referendum on budget autonomy was not overturned during the 35-day congressional review in 2013. Congress's deliberation on the issue may be complicated by a court decision regarding a citizen-approved referendum amending the District's home rule charter. The case was remanded to the District's Superior Court, raising the question of whether the District should pursue a remedy through the courts or if Congress should take action to settle the matter. Voting representation in Congress for residents of the District of Columbia has been a longstanding issue dating back to the creation of the federal district in 1790. Despite being able to elect a non-voting Delegate to the House of Representatives since 1971, full voting representation has been unsuccessfully sought. The debate revolves around balancing constitutional dictates on the District's political status with principles of representative democracy. The U.S. Constitution grants Congress exclusive legislative control over the federal government's seat, creating a challenge in achieving full voting rights for District residents. The debate over voting representation for District of Columbia residents revolves around balancing constitutional provisions with principles of democracy. Strict readers of the Constitution argue against granting voting rights, citing exclusive legislative control over the federal district by Congress. Proponents of voting representation emphasize the principle of governance with the consent of the governed. The debate over voting representation for District of Columbia residents centers on the principle of governance with the consent of the governed. Efforts have been made by citizens to gain voting rights in the national legislature, with the Supreme Court affirming a lower court ruling on the issue in 2000. The question of voting rights for District residents is seen as a legislative issue that only Congress can address. Since 1978, legislation has been introduced in Congress to convey voting rights to District of Columbia citizens. Proposals include retroceding the nonfederal portion back to Maryland, granting statehood, providing full voting representation in Congress, and allowing city residents to vote for Maryland candidates. Congress's stance on using public funds for lobbying on voting representation has evolved over the past 10 years. Since FY2010, Congress has allowed the use of District funds to advocate for voting representation in Congress and cover court challenges. H.R. 317, the New Columbia Admissions Act, aims to establish the 51st state of New Columbia while the federal enclave remains under congressional control. Senator Carper introduced a measure for the admission of a new state, New Columbia, created from portions of the federal district. Several bills were introduced in support of voting representation in Congress for District of Columbia residents, including a semi-retrocession bill allowing them to vote in Maryland. The District of Columbia House Equal Representation Act of 2013 and the District of Columbia-Maryland Reunion Act were introduced to give voting representation to District residents in Maryland and create a National Capital Service Area under congressional control. The bill proposed temporary increase in Representatives for District residents, with the Delegate serving as a member of the House of Representatives from Maryland. The U.S. Supreme Court deemed a judicial response inappropriate, suggesting a legislative remedy. Congress has been hesitant to address the issue due to political implications, requiring focus on the political process. Specific policy and constitutional questions would need addressing if legislation granting voting representation to District citizens is considered. The curr_chunk discusses the potential options for granting voting representation to District citizens, including constitutional amendments, statehood, and the implications of each. It also raises questions about the constitutionality of such representation and the potential repeal of the 23rd Amendment. Additionally, it mentions the conflicting federal and state laws regarding marijuana use in the District of Columbia. In 1998, District of Columbia voters approved Initiative 59 for medical marijuana use, delayed by Congress until 2010 due to the \"Barr Amendment.\" This allowed the law to go into effect, permitting possession of marijuana without a valid prescription. In 2014, the D.C. Council passed the \"Marijuana Possession Decriminalization Amendment Act of 2014\" decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana. Initiative 71 was approved by voters, allowing adults 21 and older to possess up to two ounces of marijuana and grow up to six plants at home. Initiative 71 in DC allows adults over 21 to possess and grow marijuana at home, but does not permit public consumption or establish regulations for selling. Possession is still a federal offense, but enforcement priorities are uncertain. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2015 includes a provision related to marijuana decriminalization or legalization in DC. Section 809 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act prohibits the use of federal funds in DC to legalize or reduce penalties for marijuana possession, use, or distribution. This includes both recreational and medical purposes. Some Members of Congress believe that Section 809 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act nullifies Initiative 71 in DC by preventing marijuana legalization. They argue that DC employees could face criminal liability for violating the appropriations restriction, but the Justice Department has prosecutorial discretion. There is no clear indication in the legislative history that Congress intended to block Initiative 71. The implementation of Initiative 71 in DC is questioned by some Representatives who argue that Section 809 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act could hinder marijuana legalization. Omitting the words \"carry out\" in 809(b) suggests using local funds for Initiative 71, but the appropriations restriction may prevent new marijuana laws. The legal status of marijuana in DC remains uncertain until further clarification from Congress. The District of Columbia Council is restricted by the Consolidated Appropriations Act from enacting new laws to regulate marijuana possession and establish a licensing system. This restriction is only valid for fiscal year 2015 and may change if not repeated in future legislation. The Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller reviewed the constitutionality of a law banning handguns for 32 years. The Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975 in the District of Columbia required firearm registration and licensing, but banned handgun registration after September 24, 1976. The Supreme Court ruled the handgun ban unconstitutional under the Second Amendment for self-defense. In Palmer v. District of Columbia, a law prohibiting carrying firearms in public was declared unconstitutional. The District of Columbia issued a 90-day stay to implement measures for concealed carry pistol licenses. Temporary acts were passed in 2014 and 2015, with expiration dates set. The District of Columbia issued temporary emergency measures in 2014 (D.C. Act 20-564) regarding concealed carry pistol licenses. Mayor Muriel Bowser signed the bill into law, clarifying due process provisions and alcohol consumption restrictions. The act established a \"may issue\" permit system requiring applicants to demonstrate a good reason for carrying a concealed weapon. Applicants must also complete 15 hours of firearms safety training within 45 days of approval. The District of Columbia requires applicants for concealed carry permits to complete firearms safety training, including marksmanship, maintenance, and legal knowledge. The DC police department received 66 applications, granting 8 and rejecting 11. A court injunction in Wrenn v. District of Columbia challenged the requirement for applicants to demonstrate a good reason for carrying concealed weapons. On June 29, 2015, a court injunction in Wrenn v. District of Columbia was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals, allowing DC to enforce concealed carry provision. Some Members of Congress have introduced bills to amend DC gun laws and limit the Council's authority to regulate firearms. Representative Jim Jordan and Senator Marco Rubio introduced bills in the 114th Congress to repeal handgun registration requirements. In the 113th Congress, Representative Thomas Massie successfully offered an amendment to repeal certain District of Columbia gun laws, including handgun registration requirements, restrictions on ammunition possession, and penalties for possessing unregistered firearms. The amendment created a \"shall-issue\" permitting system for concealed carry of firearms. On July 16, 2014, an amendment was proposed but not included in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015. The question arises on how much Congress should intervene to protect Second Amendment rights in the District of Columbia. In December 2014, the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act of 2014 was approved by the District of Columbia Council and signed into law by the mayor in January 2015. This bill aims to prevent discrimination based on personal beliefs regarding reproductive health. The Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act of 2014 was approved by the District of Columbia Council in December 2014 and signed into law by the mayor in January 2015. It aims to prevent discrimination based on personal beliefs regarding reproductive health decisions, including the use of contraception or fertility control. The act was transmitted to Congress on March 6, 2015, for a 30-day review period, which ended on May 2, 2015, without any resolution of disapproval passed. The Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act of 2014, passed by the District of Columbia Council and signed by the mayor, protects employees, spouses, and dependents from discrimination based on reproductive health decisions. It ensures that personal beliefs do not override access to healthcare choices. Bill 20-790 emphasizes that workplace standing should be based on performance, not personal health decisions. Controversy surrounds whether it is a response to the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby decision, allowing employers to restrict reproductive health choices based on religious beliefs. Critics argue it infringes on religious freedom protections. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act prevents religious institutions and pro-life organizations from making employment decisions based on their beliefs. It was subject to a congressional review period and a resolution of disapproval was approved by the House Committee on Government Oversight and Reform. The House later approved the resolution, but it left insufficient support. The House approved H.J.Res. 43 by a vote of 228 to 192, but the Senate did not have enough time to consider it before the review period expired. President Obama was likely to veto the bill. Congress could still block the RHNDAA through the appropriations process. There are concerns about the bill violating constitutional protections of freedom of religion and association. District of Columbia Councilman Tommy Wells introduced the Human Rights Amendment Act of 2014. The Human Rights Amendment Act of 2014, B20-803, approved by the District of Columbia Council on December 2, 2014, removes a nondiscrimination exemption for religious and religiously affiliated education institutions from the District's Human Rights Act. This exemption, known as the Armstrong Amendment, granted these institutions the power to deny recognition or access to individuals and organizations promoting or condoning homosexuality based on their religious beliefs. Senator Armstrong introduced an amendment on behalf of Georgetown University two years after a 1987 court ruling that found the university violated the District's Human Rights Act by refusing to recognize a gay student organization. Supporters of the amendment argued that religious institutions should not be forced to go against their beliefs. Those against the District's Human Rights Amendment Act of 2014, including the Archdiocese of Washington and the Heritage Foundation, believe it removes important protections. The Heritage Foundation criticized the HRAA for removing religious liberty protections related to human sexuality. The HRAA was transmitted to Congress on March 6, 2015, and a joint resolution of disapproval was introduced in the Senate on March 18, 2015. The Human Rights Amendment Act (HRAA) was criticized for removing religious liberty protections. A resolution was introduced in Congress but not advanced within the review period. Congress may still overturn the act through the appropriations process. The act raises questions about equal protection and conflicts with previous Supreme Court decisions."
