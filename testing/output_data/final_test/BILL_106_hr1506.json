    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1999\". Congress finds that Federal holdings in Nevada constitute over 87 percent of the state's area, impacting economic development negatively. Less than 3 percent of Federal land has moved to private ownership in the last 130 years. The Bureau of Land Management has identified land for disposal in resource management plans. Management has identified land for disposal that is difficult and costly to manage, lacking necessary funding for improvements and land management programs. The lack of a private land tax base hinders local governments from providing infrastructure for community expansion and economic growth. The Act aims to orderly dispose of certain Federal land in Nevada to address these issues. The State of Nevada is seeking to address land management issues by acquiring environmentally sensitive land and implementing projects to protect important environmental and cultural resources. The State of Nevada is acquiring environmentally sensitive land to protect environmental and cultural resources. SEC. 3 defines key terms. The Act defines \"current land use plan\" as the most recently approved management framework plan for a Bureau of Land Management unit, and \"environmentally sensitive land\" as land that promotes preservation of natural, scientific, aesthetic, historical, cultural, watershed, wildlife, or recreational values. The Act defines key terms such as \"Secretary,\" \"Special Account,\" \"State,\" and \"unit of local government\" for the purpose of managing public land in Nevada. These definitions aim to facilitate better management, enhance recreational opportunities, and serve the public interest. SEC. 4. DISPOSAL AND EXCHANGE.

In a land exchange under this section, the non-Federal party must provide a direct payment to the local government equal to 15% of the fair market value of the Federal land conveyed. This payment is considered a cost incurred by the non-Federal party and will be compensated by the Secretary.
