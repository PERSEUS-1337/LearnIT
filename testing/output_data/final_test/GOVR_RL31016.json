The Andean Counterdrug Initiative focuses on economic and social programs as well as counter-narcotics efforts. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative aims to reduce coca production in Colombia by 30% in 2000-2002, eliminate illicit coca production in Bolivia by 2002, negotiate revised control goals with Peru, and set goals with other regional countries by mid-August 2001. President Bush emphasized the need to address drug demand in the US and support democratic institutions in producer and transit countries during the Summit of the Americas III in Quebec City. The United States is committed to promoting sustainable development and fighting drug supply at the source in Andean countries. A requested ARI funding of $882.29 million for FY2002 is allocated to Colombia and Peru for socio-economic and counter-narcotics aid programs. Colombia will receive $399 million for various programs, while Peru will receive $206.15 million for similar initiatives. The United States is providing significant aid to Andean countries for counter-narcotics and socio-economic programs. Bolivia will receive $143.48 million for counter-narcotics aid and $88.48 million for socio-economic programs. Ecuador will receive $76.48 million for counter-narcotics aid and $56.48 million for socio-economic programs. Brazil will receive $26.18 million for counter-narcotics aid and $11.18 million for socio-economic programs. The United States is providing aid to Andean countries for counter-narcotics and socio-economic programs. In Panama, $20.5 million is allocated for various aid programs including judicial reform and economic growth opportunities. Venezuela will receive $10.5 million for counter-narcotics aid. The Andean Trade Preferences Act (ATPA) is being extended with U.S. support. Colombian President Pastrana appealed to President Bush for extension of the Andean Trade Preferences Act (ATPA) during their meeting in mid-April 2001. President Bush expressed support for broadening the coverage of the Act, especially for textiles and apparel in Colombia and tuna in Ecuador. The Andean countries seek parity with Central American and Caribbean preferences to prevent trade diversion. Administration spokesmen highlighted the challenges of democracy, economic development, and national security in the Andean region during a briefing on the Andean Regional Initiative in mid-May 2001. The Andean countries are seen as a national security threat due to their production of cocaine and heroin. Policy makers have outlined three goals for the region - democracy, development, and drugs. These goals include promoting democracy, supporting economic development, and reducing the supply of illegal drugs to the United States. The Andean Regional Initiative aims to increase funding to Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia for counter-drug efforts. Critics argue that the initiative focuses too much on military assistance and not enough on human rights and the peace process in Colombia. They are concerned about the environmental damage caused by forced crop eradication. The Andean Regional Initiative aims to provide assistance to seven countries in the Andean region, including Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. Critics argue that forced eradication of crops through aerial spraying will cause environmental damage and internal displacement, and may ultimately fail as new sources of supply emerge elsewhere. Supporters believe the initiative is necessary to support Colombia and its neighbors, while also providing assistance for social and economic programs. The Andean region includes countries like Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador, which are heavily populated and major drug and oil producers. These countries have diverse trading relationships, with the United States being their major trading partner. The Andean countries, including Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, are linked through the Andean Community economic integration pact. Colombia, with a population of 42.8 million, is known for its mixed-race population and history of democracy, but also faces challenges such as guerrilla insurgency and drug trafficking. President Andres Pastrana, elected in 1998, aimed to bring peace to Colombia by negotiating with guerrillas, strengthening the military and counter-narcotics forces, and seeking international support. With U.S. assistance, he developed Plan Colombia, a $7.5 billion plan to combat drug trafficking. The Clinton Administration approved a $1.3 billion assistance package in 2000 for Plan Colombia, with $860.2 million allocated for programs in Colombia. The assistance included support for military and counter-narcotics activities, as well as funding for alternative development, governance, and human rights programs. President Pastrana's term ends in August 2002. President Pastrana's term ends in August 2002, and the selection process for his successor is ongoing. Despite efforts to reinvigorate peace talks with FARC leader Manuel Marulanda, the situation remains uncertain. Cocaine production in Colombia increased by 11% in 2000, despite the implementation of elements of Plan Colombia. In October 2001, President Pastrana extended the demilitarized zone after the FARC agreed to cease random highway kidnappings, but tensions escalated when the FARC was accused of further kidnappings and attacks. The international community pledged an additional $580 million at the third meeting of the International Support Group for the Peace Process in Colombia on April 30, 2001. The European Union, United States, Andean Development Corporation, and other countries pledged various amounts. Colombia would have received $399 million under the FY2002 Andean Regional Initiative request, with a focus on socio-economic aid programs. Colombia received $380.50 million in FY2002, with $146.5 million in socio-economic aid and $252.5 million in counter-narcotics aid. Peru, with a population of 25.7 million, has been in flux since President Fujimori's controversial third term re-election in June 2000. President Fujimori of Peru faced criticism for corruption, human rights violations, and authoritarian tendencies while in power. He resigned and fled into exile in December 2000 due to corruption allegations. Acting President Valentin Paniagua governed during the transition period until President Alejandro Toledo was inaugurated in July 2001 after winning the two-round presidential elections. Toledo, an anti-Fujimori opposition leader, promised to end corruption and stabilize the economy. Representatives of Peru and the United States investigated a military plane shooting down a small plane in 2001, killing an American missionary woman and her daughter. U.S. surveillance of drug-related flights in Peru and Colombia was suspended due to the incident. The investigation concluded that communication system overload and cumbersome procedures contributed to the accident. Peru's success in counter-narcotics efforts includes a 70% reduction in coca production through joint operations with the U.S. Concerns about drug activities spilling over from Colombia have led to increased security measures, including the relocation of helicopters. Peru received funding for helicopters and regional interdiction efforts as part of the Plan Colombia emergency supplemental funding. Peru benefitted from regional interdiction funding under the FY2002 Andean Regional Initiative, receiving $194.87 million in assistance for socio-economic and counter-narcotics aid. Bolivia, with a population of 7.9 million, is governed by President Hugo Banzer, who was democratically elected in 1997 after a period of military rule in the 1970s. President Banzer, elected in 1997 after military rule, resigned in August 2001 due to cancer. Vice President Quiroga took over, continuing economic reforms and anti-cocaine efforts. Bolivia, with a large indigenous population, underwent significant social changes in the 1950s, followed by military control until the mid-1980s. Reformist governments in the mid-1990s focused on privatization and economic stability. President Banzer continued economic reforms and aimed to eliminate illegal cocacultivation and narco-trafficking during his term. Bolivia is involved with the Andean Community and an associate member of Mercosur. The US supported Bolivia's counter-narcotics efforts with interdiction and development assistance, forgiving all debt for development projects. Joint operations and effective programs reduced coca cultivation by approximately 70%. Bolivia saw a significant decrease in coca cultivation, with a 70% reduction in five years. Concerns arise that successful counter-narcotics efforts in Colombia could lead to a resurgence of drug trafficking in Bolivia. Critics argue that eradication efforts have negatively impacted the economy. Bolivia received substantial funding for interdiction and alternative development assistance under the Plan Colombia and Andean Regional Initiative. Ecuador, with a population of 12.6 million, is the eighth most populous country in Latin America. President Gustavo Noboa leads the country, which is heavily impacted by drug trafficking due to its proximity to Colombian guerrilla strongholds. In FY2002, Bolivia received $122.96 million in aid, including economic and social assistance, and counter-narcotics aid. Ecuador's Vice President took office in January 2000 after an uprising. The country has faced hyperinflation and economic struggles since dollarization. Colombian guerrillas cross into Ecuador for various activities, including drug cultivation. Ecuador has uncovered cocaine labs and faces a constant flow of Colombian refugees. Colombian paramilitary fighters have been arrested for running extortion rings in Ecuador. Colombian paramilitary organizations arrested for extortion in Ecuadorian border regions. FARC accused of kidnappings in Ecuador, denies allegations. Ecuador received $20 million in US assistance for drug interdiction and development. $61.3 million allocated for Forward Operating Location in Manta for counter-narcotics surveillance. Ecuador requesting increased US assistance. FY2002 Andean Regional Initiative request includes $76.48 million for socio-economic aid. Ecuador received $46.86 million in US assistance in FY2002, with $31.85 million for economic and social programs and $15 million for counter-narcotics aid. Brazil, with a population of 170 million, is the largest country in Latin America led by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. He is credited with leading the country into a period of growth after ending years of inflation with his Real Plan and weathering the international financial crisis with IMF assistance. Brazil is preparing for presidential elections in 2002 amidst doubts about the governing coalition's ability to implement necessary reforms. Concerns about the sparsely populated Amazon region have led to the construction of the $1.4 billion Amazon Vigilance System, aimed at controlling the vast territory. A military base at Tabatinga with 25,000 soldiers and policemen has been established to address spillover effects from Colombia, where there are reports of drug traffickers influencing indigenous communities to grow coca. Brazil faces threats from Colombian drug traffickers encouraging coca cultivation in indigenous communities and FARC incursions along the border. Despite not being a drug-producing country, Brazil serves as a transit area for cocaine. In 1998, FARC captured a city on the Colombian border, leading Colombian troops to withdraw into Brazilian territory. Additionally, a plane from Suriname carrying arms for FARC guerrillas made an emergency landing in Brazil. Brazil was not included in Plan Colombia assistance but would have received $26.18 million under the FY2002 Andean Regional Initiative for socio-economic and counter-narcotics aid. Brazil and Venezuela receive aid for training and equipping bordercounter-narcotics forces, drug awareness programs, and demand reduction programs. Venezuela, with a population of 23.5 million, is led by President Hugo Chavez, a former military leader elected in 1998 on a platform of fighting corruption and meeting people's needs. In 1999, voters approved a new constitution expanding presidential powers, and in 2000, Chavez won a new six-year term. President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, re-elected in 2000, has been criticized for authoritarian tendencies similar to those of former President Fujimori of Peru. He has close ties with leftist leaders like Fidel Castro, denounces U.S. policies, and has friendly relations with Colombian guerrillas. Chavez has expressed alternative views on U.S. policy and Plan Colombia, and Venezuela serves as a transit route for cocaine and heroin. Venezuela serves as a transit route for cocaine and heroin from Colombia to the United States and Europe. Despite policy disagreements with the United States, the Chavez government has cooperated in counter-narcotics efforts. Venezuela was allocated $5.5 million in FY2002 for law enforcement, interdiction reforms, money-laundering countermeasures, and demand reduction. Panama, with a population of 2.8 million, is the twentieth most populous country in Latin America. Panama, the twentieth most populous country in Latin America, is led by Mireya Moscoso since 1999. Economic difficulties and responsibilities for the Panama Canal have been key issues. Panama refused to allow the U.S. to retain a military presence post-withdrawal in 1999, leading to the development of substitute locations for counter-narcotics activities. Cross-border incursions by Colombian guerrillas and paramilitary groups have been reported in Panama. Panama is a major transshipment point for illicit drugs, especially cocaine, from South America. The country has cooperated with the United States in counter-narcotics efforts, seizing drugs and passing anti-money laundering legislation. While not receiving Plan Colombia assistance, Panama would have received $20.5 million under the FY2002 Andean Regional Initiative for socio-economic aid and counter-narcotics efforts. Panama is set to receive $13.50 million in counter-narcotics aid for upgrading interdiction and law enforcement forces, and for modernizing criminal justice institutions. The House approved a bill reducing counter-drug assistance by an additional $1 million, with a total of $826 million allocated for the Andean Regional Initiative. The House Appropriations Committee's Foreign Operations Subcommittee passed a $15.2 billion FY2002 foreign operations funding bill, reducing funding for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative portion of the Andean Regional Initiative. The subcommittee funded the bill at the President's requested level but allocated $55 million less for the State Department's International Narcotics Control \"Andean Counterdrug Initiative\" portion. This would decrease total funding for the ARI from $882 million to $827 million. The House Appropriations Committee passed H.R. 2506 with $827 million funding for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. Amendments by Pelosi and Rothman were withdrawn during the subcommittee mark-up. Pelosi's amendment aimed to limit funding for Colombia's military to $52 million and transfer the rest to a Child Survival account. Rothman's amendment called for a moratorium on fumigation efforts until viable alternative development plans were implemented in 75% of communities with pacts. The House Appropriations Committee passed H.R. 2506 with $827 million funding for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. The Committee recommended a $55 million reduction to be evenly distributed among all programs. The bill also recommends a limit of $14.24 million for administrative expenses and exempts programs supported by ACI funds from certain restrictions on civilian contractors and procurement of weapons and ammunition. The House Appropriations Committee passed H.R. 2506 with $827 million funding for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative, with exceptions for counternarcotics activities. The full committee rejected two Colombia-related amendments, including transferring funds from the Colombian military to the Child Survival account and shifting Andean counter-drug funding to domestic drug treatment and prevention programs. The House Appropriations Committee passed H.R. 2506 with $827 million funding for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. The Committee adopted language requiring the Secretary of State to report on the human health and environmental effects of aerial eradication of coca and opium poppy in Colombia. Reports should include areas sprayed, materials used, compliance with guidelines, and impacts of spraying. Semi-annual reports were also requested on equipment transferred to military and police forces under the ACI, as well as the number of U.S. military personnel deployed in the Andean region. The House Appropriations Committee passed H.R. 2506 with $827 million funding for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. The Committee adopted language requiring reports on the effects of aerial eradication of coca and opium poppy in Colombia, equipment transfers, and U.S. military personnel deployment in the Andean region. Another report is to detail efforts to deliver non-cash assistance to Colombian communities eradicating coca crops. The Committee believes a negotiated settlement is necessary for resolving the conflict in Colombia. The Committee urges the Secretary of State to work towards a lasting peace in Colombia and renew the Andean Trade Preference Act. It also calls for the strict application of U.S. laws on human rights in Colombia and the Andean region. Special note is made of Bolivia's progress in counternarcotics efforts. The House adopted H.R. 2506, reducing the ACI account by $1 million to $675 million. Amendments related to the ARI were approved, defeated, or withdrawn in floor action on July 24. The U.S. Government's support was credited for Bolivia's success in counternarcotics efforts. Three approved amendments: Rep. Conyers' amendment allowing the President to waive the 300 person cap on civilian contractors under Plan Colombia, Rep. Hoekstra's amendment withholding $65 million of ACI funds until a report on the aircraft shootdown is submitted, and a substitute Kolbe amendment transferring $1.0 million. A substitute Kolbe amendment transferred $1.0 million from the ACI to the International Disaster Assistance account. Two defeated amendments included one to transfer $60 million to Child Survival and Health Programs fund, and another to reduce ACI funding by $100 million for infectious diseases and maternal health. Two amendments were withdrawn during the consideration of H.R. 2506, one to transfer $100 million from the ACI to the Child Survival and Health Programs Fund and another to prohibit the use of funds for aerial fumigation in Colombia. Additionally, an amendment to earmark funds for aircraft and helicopters for the Colombian National Police and Navy was offered and withdrawn. The House Appropriations Committee considered funding for drug interdiction in Colombia, with Rep. Delahunt withdrawing an amendment regarding Colombian national security legislation. The Senate Appropriations Committee reduced ACI funding by $164 million and imposed conditions on safety. On September 4, 2001, the Senate reduced ACI funding by $164 million and imposed conditions on aerial fumigation programs in Colombia. The Senate passed H.R. 2506 on October 24, 2001, with a reduced budget for the ARI and conditions on safety measures. The Senate Appropriations Committee also cut $164 million from the President's requested ACI funding. The committee bill would condition the release of funds for the aerial coca fumigation program on a report to Congress on the human health and safety effects of the chemicals used. The total ARI funding would be reduced to $718 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill includes provisions for aerial coca fumigation program oversight, limiting the number of U.S. military personnel and civilian contractors in Colombia, and a human rights restriction on helicopter use. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill includes provisions for oversight of aerial coca fumigation programs in Colombia, limiting the number of U.S. military personnel and civilian contractors, and imposing a human rights restriction on helicopter use purchased with ACI funds. The Committee expressed concerns about paramilitary violence, cooperation between the military and paramilitaries, and the impunity of military officers involved in atrocities in Colombia. They urged for more aggressive action by the Colombian Government and military to address these issues. The Senate Appropriations Committee urged for more aggressive action by the Colombian Government and military to address ongoing abuses by the FARC. They called on other nations to exert influence on the FARC and participate in negotiations for a settlement of the conflict. The Committee also requested reports from the Secretary of State on human rights issues every 60 days after enactment. The Colombian armed forces are urged to cooperate with civilian authorities in prosecuting members accused of human rights violations and links with paramilitary groups. The extent of investigations into attacks on human rights defenders and the execution of arrest warrants for paramilitary members are also key topics. The report is expected to provide information on actions taken by the United States and Colombia to support peace negotiations and financial support for Plan Colombia. A second report may be required if national security legislation is enacted, focusing on incidents of arbitrary detention by Colombian armed forces and police. The Senate approved H.R. 2506, retaining key features related to the ARI, with amendments reducing ACI funding by $20 million.

The defeated Senate Amendment 1950 aimed to increase funding for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative to $731 million, matching the President's request. Proponents argued for full support to assist Colombia and combat drug flow to the US, while opponents cited existing assistance to the region and the need for resources elsewhere. Senator Leahy raised a point of order for violating the Congressional Budget Act by not identifying offsets for the proposed $164 million increase. The conference version of H.R. 2506 (H.Rept. 107-345) was passed by the House and Senate in December 2002, signed into law as P.L. 107-115 in January 2002. It includes $625 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative, with $215 million earmarked for USAID programs. Administrative expenses are limited for the Department of State and USAID. The conference version of H.R. 2506 includes conditions on the use of funds, such as no funds for aerial coca fumigation programs until the Secretary of State reports to the Appropriations Committees. Transfers up to $35 million to the Andean Counterdrug Initiative from other funds are allowed, with a focus on interdiction, alternative development, or economic assistance to Andean countries. The conference version of H.R. 2506 includes conditions on the use of funds, such as no funds for aerial coca fumigation programs until the Secretary of State reports to the Appropriations Committees on specific matters related to program compliance and safety measures. Funds for aerial coca fumigation programs are on hold pending the Secretary's report. No funds can be used for Peruvian air interdiction until enhanced safeguards are in place. Limits on U.S. personnel in Colombia are modified with a cap of 400. The funding for Colombia includes a cap of 400 on U.S. military personnel and civilian contractors. Helicopters purchased with this funding must be returned if used by illegal groups.

The chart includes direct U.S. foreign assistance and costs of goods and services provided to Colombia from other U.S. government programs. The United States provides various forms of assistance to Colombia for counternarcotics efforts, including funding from different government programs and the provision of DOD Excess Defense Articles. Additionally, the Drug Enforcement Administration conducts joint operations in Colombia using its own funds. Funding details for FY2000 and FY2001 are available, with allocations from DOD Sections 1004, 124, 1004/124, and 1033 that can be adjusted based on evolving needs. Section 124 covers U.S. operated radar systems for detecting drug flights. The U.S. provides assistance to Colombia for counternarcotics efforts through various programs and DOD Excess Defense Articles. Funding details for FY2000 and FY2001 show allocations from different programs. The controversy over spray eradication of illegal coca crops in southern Colombia involves the use of the herbicide glyphosate. The U.S. provides assistance to Colombia for counternarcotics efforts through various programs and DOD Excess Defense Articles. Funding details for FY2000 and FY2001 show allocations from different programs. The controversy over spray eradication of illegal coca crops in southern Colombia involves the use of the herbicide glyphosate, manufactured by U.S. company Monsanto and marketed as \"Roundup,\" along with two additives. The State Department reports that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved the use of glyphosate and the additives on food crops when label instructions are followed. The EPA has approved the use of glyphosate on food crops when label instructions are followed. Adequate scientific studies show that glyphosate does not cause adverse effects in humans, birth defects, mutagenic effects, neurotoxic effects, reproductive problems, or cancer. However, splashes of glyphosate can cause transient irritation to skin and eyes. The State Department cited a study concluding that there are no concerns for human health from the spray mixture used in Colombia. Despite this, allegations have been made that the spray mixture has caused harm to humans, crops, and livestock in Colombia's Putumayo province. The spray mixture in Colombia's Putumayo province has caused extensive harm to humans, crops, and livestock. Effects include fever, eye and gastrointestinal irritation, skin and bronchial infections, and allegations of increased brain damage in children. Livestock have suffered hair loss, abortion in pregnant cows, and fowl deaths from spraying or contaminated water. Supporters of aerial fumigation claim negative health and environmental effects are due to drug producers themselves, who use Roundup to suppress weeds around coca bushes and pollute rivers with chemicals. Some U.S. officials suggest complaints come from those with an interest in coca production. The article from January 7, 2001, discusses the shift in spraying focus in Putumayo from remote plantations to more populated farming areas where coca is grown alongside other crops. Critics blame crop damage on the proximity of legal and illegal crops, as well as the high altitude and wind conditions under which the spray planes operate. Some analysts argue that complaints of illness are exaggerated. Some analysts suggest that complaints of ill effects from spray in Colombia may be related to the specific formulation, application, and conditions of Roundup use. Critics argue that Roundup is not being applied according to U.S. standards and manufacturer recommendations, with concerns about unexplored ingredients in the mixture. The World Wildlife Fund questions the adequacy of existing studies to assess the impacts of glyphosate use in Plan Colombia. In Colombia, concerns have been raised about the high concentrations of herbicides being applied, including Roundup Ultra. There are also worries about the effects of mixing surfactants with pesticides, as well as the presence of other ingredients in Roundup Ultra. The World Wildlife Fund questions the adequacy of studies on the impacts of glyphosate use in Colombia. The World Wildlife Fund raised concerns about the effects of inert ingredients in Roundup, stating that they can be more toxic than the pesticide itself. The specific \"new\" ingredients in Roundup Ultra are not disclosed, and there are differences in the aerial fumigation of illegal crops in Colombia compared to recommended agricultural use in the United States. The concentration of Roundup used in aerial fumigation of illegal crops in Colombia is 26 times greater than recommended for agricultural use in the United States. The negative effects are intensified by the use of Cosmoflux 411F. Higher concentrations or applications of glyphosate could explain the severe ill effects reported in fumigated areas. The State Department is funding a study on the health effects of aerial eradication in Putumayo Department, with results expected by late 2001. The ARI for FY2002 did not include International Military Education and Training (IMET) funds, ranging from $170,000 for Panama to $1,180,000 for Colombia. Foreign Military Finance Funding (FMF) was also not included in the ARI for FY2002. The FY2003 budget request includes FMF for Andean Regional Initiative countries, with a breakdown by purpose not available for Brazil, Panama, and Venezuela. The ARI totals do not include International Military Education and Training funds. Prepared by [author name scrubbed], Specialist in International Security Affairs, February 12, 2002."
