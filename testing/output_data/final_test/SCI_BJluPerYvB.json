A new regularization method is proposed to penalize the predictive distribution between similar samples, improving generalization ability and calibration accuracy in image classification tasks. This technique involves distilling the predictive distribution between different samples of the same label and augmented samples of the same source during training, leading to more meaningful predictions. Regularization strategies like early stopping, L1/L2 regularization, dropout, batch normalization, and data augmentation have been explored to address overfitting in deep neural networks with millions of parameters. Regularizing the output distribution of DNNs can be effective in improving generalization. Techniques such as entropy maximization and angular-margin based methods have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, a new output regularizer for deep models is developed using the concept of dark knowledge, focusing on wrong predictions made by DNN. The importance of this knowledge has been demonstrated through knowledge distillation and explored in various works. In this paper, a new regularization technique called class-wise self-knowledge distillation (CS-KD) is proposed to transfer dark knowledge from a teacher network to a student network. This method matches predictive distributions of DNNs for samples of the same label and source, forcing similar wrong predictions for samples of the same class. The effectiveness of this technique is demonstrated using deep convolutional neural networks like ResNet.

The method involves matching predictive distributions of deep convolutional neural networks like ResNet for samples of the same label and source, resulting in improved performance. The effectiveness of this technique is demonstrated through experiments comparing it with prior regularization methods. In this study, a new regularization technique named class-wise self-knowledge distillation (CS-KD) is introduced to improve performance in deep convolutional neural networks like ResNet. By combining it with other regularization methods, such as mixup and original KD, significant error rate reductions are achieved. The method is simple to use and shows promise for broader usage in the future. The class-wise self-knowledge distillation (CS-KD) technique is proposed to enhance deep convolutional neural networks like ResNet. By enforcing consistent predictive distributions within the same class, dark knowledge is distilled into the model. This regularization method, combined with mixup and original KD, leads to significant error rate reductions. The approach is straightforward and holds promise for wider application. The proposed class-wise self-knowledge distillation (CS-KD) technique enhances deep convolutional neural networks like ResNet by enforcing consistent predictive distributions within the same class. This regularization method, combined with mixup and original KD, leads to significant error rate reductions. The approach involves generating augmented samples using data augmentation methods and performing self-knowledge distillation within a single network. In experiments, standard augmentation methods are used for ImageNet training to ensure stability. The total training loss is a weighted sum of regularization terms with cross-entropy loss. The method involves training true labels and regularizing wrong labels. The training procedure with the proposed loss is outlined. Various image classification tasks are considered, including CIFAR-100 for data diversity demonstration. The curr_chunk discusses the datasets used for conventional and fine-grained classification tasks, including CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and MIT67. It mentions the validation set sampling method and network architectures ResNet and DenseNet. In 2017, standard ResNet-18 and DenseNet-121 were used for image classification tasks. Modifications were made for CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet datasets. Evaluation metrics included top-1/5 error rates, Expected Calibration Error (ECE), and Recall at k (R@k). The text discusses the evaluation metrics used for image classification tasks, including Recall at k (R@k) to measure intra-class variations of learned features. Hyper-parameters for training the networks are also detailed, such as using stochastic gradient descent with specific momentum, weight decay, and learning rate adjustments. Additionally, batch sizes and data augmentation techniques are specified for different classification tasks. In experiments, T = 4, \u03bb cls = 1 for all tasks, and \u03bb sam = 1 for fine-grained tasks and 0 for conventional tasks. Expected calibration error (ECE) is computed with 20 bins. Compared with prior regularization methods like AdaCos and Virtual-softmax for maximizing angular-margin, and Maximum-entropy for entropy regularization. The proposed method CS-KD outperforms other regularization methods like Virtual-softmax, AdaCos, and Maximum-entropy in various image classification tasks, consistently reducing the top-1 error rates. For example, in the CUB-200-2011 dataset, CS-KD improves the top-1 error rate from 46.00% to 33.50%, surpassing the performance of other baselines. Our method CS-KD outperforms other regularization methods like Virtual-softmax, AdaCos, and Maximum-entropy in image classification tasks. It is more effective and stable than other baselines, showing compatibility with mixup regularization. Combining our method with mixup significantly improves fine-grained classification tasks, reducing the top-1 error rate from 37.09% to 31.95%. Our method CS-KD improves top-1 error rates in image classification tasks, showing compatibility with mixup regularization. Combining our method with KD enhances performance further, reducing error rates from 39.32% to 35.36% in the CUB-200-2011 dataset. The results demonstrate the wide applicability of our method and its ability to improve DNN predictions by reducing intra-class variations. Our method, demonstrated in Figure 2, reduces intra-class variations in feature embeddings of ResNet-18 trained with various regularization techniques. R@1 values show significant improvement with our method, reaching 59.22% in the CUB-200-2011 dataset compared to Virtualsoftmax and AdaCos at 55.56% and 54.86% respectively. Table 4 displays the top-5 error rates of the proposed method, showing significant improvement over other regularization techniques. The results indicate enhanced model calibration and more meaningful predictions from DNNs. The evaluation metrics for ResNet-18 on CIFAR-100 are reported with mean and standard deviation over 3 runs, with the best results highlighted.

Regularization techniques like early stopping, weight decay, dropout, and batch normalization have been used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. Other methods such as label-smoothing, penalizing low entropy output distributions, and data augmentation with mixup have also been explored to improve generalization and exploration in machine learning tasks. These methods can be combined with our proposed method, CS-KD, to further enhance model performance. Knowledge distillation is an effective method to transfer knowledge from a teacher model to a student model. Various techniques like FitNets, attention map matching, and maximizing mutual information between layers have been explored to improve performance in the teacher-student framework. Margin-based softmax losses have been utilized to enhance recognition performance by enlarging inter-class margins and reducing intra-class variation. Metric-based methods like triplet and contrastive loss have been used to measure similarities between features using Euclidean distances. Center loss and range loss are employed to extract discriminative features in the model. Margin-based softmax losses have been used to improve recognition performance by increasing inter-class margins and decreasing intra-class variation. Various methods such as center loss, range loss, COCO loss, NormFace, ring loss, Lsoftmax, A-softmax, CosFace, AM-softmax, and ArcFace have been introduced to optimize features and encourage the model to generate more discriminative features. In contrast to L-Softmax and A-Softmax, Virtual-softmax introduces a virtual negative class to promote a large margin between classes. The proposed regularization method enhances generalization in deep neural networks by penalizing the predictive distribution differences between samples of the same label and augmented samples from the same source. This regularization technique focuses on regulating dark knowledge and improving the model's predictions, showing potential for generalization and calibration in neural networks.
