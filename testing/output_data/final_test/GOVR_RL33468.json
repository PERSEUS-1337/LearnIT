    "content": "President Bush signed P.L. 109-449 (S. 362) on December 22, 2006, establishing NOAA and Coast Guard programs to manage marine debris and its impact on endangered species. The Senate and House passed related bills on December 9, 2006, and December 7, 2006, respectively, incorporating measures for sea turtle protection and the Alaska-Chukotka Polar Bear Population. The Senate also passed H.R. 4075 on December 6, 2006, with similar provisions. The 1973 ESA (P.L. 93-205) aims to protect species at risk of extinction and their habitats. Species can be listed as endangered or threatened, with more flexible management for threatened species. Some populations of salmon in certain states are protected under the ESA. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides protection for species at risk of extinction and their habitats. The ESA is administered by the Department of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Legal tools are available to aid species recovery and protect habitat, leading to conflicts over their use. As of September 20, 2006, a total of 1,132 animal species and 747 plant species were listed as endangered or threatened, with the majority in the United States. There are 1,311 U.S. species, with 1,070 covered in recovery plans and 475 having critical habitat designated. Efforts to protect these species can be controversial, highlighting larger issues of resource scarcity and ecosystem changes. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) addresses larger issues involving listed species, such as conflicts over Tennessee's Tellico Dam, Pacific northwest timber harvest, and Texas's Edwards Aquifer. Species can be listed by the Secretary or through petitions, based on scientific and commercial information. Public participation and scientific data collection are key in determining if a species needs ESA protections. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) considers scientific and economic factors when deciding on species protection. FWS and NMFS may list species as \"candidate species\" if they are at risk but protection is hindered by listed species. Critical habitat must be designated for listed species, unless it's not prudent to do so. The Secretary may decide not to designate critical habitat (CH) for listed species if resources are allocated to listing new species instead. However, FWS consistently loses legal challenges for failure to designate CH, as it does not consider the duty to avoid adverse modification of CH. Scientists have asserted the value of CH for species recovery. The Center for Biological Diversity study in April 2005 found that critical habitat (CH) designation enhances species recovery. The Keystone Center's ESA Working Group on Habitat released a report on habitat protection and the ESA in April 2006, emphasizing the importance of identifying species' required habitat for recovery during recovery planning. CH is often misunderstood as restricting private landowners' authority, but it mainly involves additional procedures and possible restrictions due to ESA-listed species presence. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits the \"take\" of endangered species, which includes actions that may harm or harass them. There is controversy over whether habitat modification is considered harmful under the ESA. Violations of the ESA can result in civil and criminal penalties. Proposed actions with adverse impacts on listed species may be permitted under \u00a77 of the ESA, ensuring actions do not jeopardize species existence or modify critical habitat. Federal agencies must consult with the Secretary to review effects and suggest alternatives if harm is identified. Agencies cannot commit resources until consultation is complete. The Secretary issues a biological opinion allowing incidental take of species under certain conditions. For actions without federal involvement, permits may be issued for incidental take under the ESA. Applicants must submit a habitat conservation plan showing impact, mitigation steps, funding, and rejected alternatives. The Endangered Species Act allows for exemptions from jeopardy for federal actions, decided by the Endangered Species Committee. Only one exemption has been granted so far for the Grayrocks Dam in Wyoming. The committee must accept the President's determination in declared disaster areas and grant exemptions for national security reasons as determined by the Secretary of Defense. The Endangered Species Act allows for exemptions from jeopardy for federal actions, decided by the Endangered Species Committee. The Secretary of Defense can determine exemptions for national security reasons. Other statutes may also provide waivers of ESA provisions, such as the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. In the 109th Congress, there were proposed waivers of ESA provisions related to border security and federal land management actions. The Restoration Act of 2003 exempted certain federal land management actions from ESA consultation and required a study of its impacts. H.R. 5678 proposed waiving ESA review for pipeline repair activities with established best practices. Emergency ESA procedures allow for informal consultations during emergencies, with more thorough consultations afterward. FWS stated that hurricane-related activities in disaster areas trigger emergency ESA consultations, and restoring infrastructure after hurricanes may not require ESA consultation. In the 109th Congress, H.R. 4200 authorized emergency procedures to comply with ESA \u00a77 for federal land damaged by catastrophes. Recovery plans for endangered species are developed by the appropriate Secretary but are not binding. The Endangered Species Act recovery plans are guidelines, not binding on federal agencies. The federal government can acquire land to conserve listed species and cooperate with states through cooperative agreements. State grants are provided through the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. The Endangered Species Act authorizes state grants and requires annual appropriations for spending. It also includes provisions for exemptions, regulation of subsistence activities, and controls on trade in endangered species. The ESA serves as domestic legislation for international agreements on wildlife preservation. CITES, signed by the United States in 1940, classifies species based on trade risk for survival. Violations of CITES are U.S. law violations within U.S. jurisdiction. FWS published a draft policy for permits allowing imports of endangered species for research and survival enhancement in their range country. The Multinational Species Conservation Fund (MSCF) in FWS supports conservation efforts for tigers, rhinoceroses, elephants, marine turtles, and great apes. Legislation in the 109th Congress reauthorized the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act and the Great Ape Conservation Act to provide funding and assistance for conservation projects. In the 109th Congress, various bills were considered to expand species eligible for assistance from the Multinational Species Conservation Fund, including creating funds for Flagship Species, Great Cats and Rare Canids, and Crane Conservation. Additionally, bills were proposed to address unilateral economic sanctions, coral reef conservation, and obligations under CITES. The effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act in species recovery since its enactment in 1973 is a key consideration. Since the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was enacted in 1973, 40 U.S. and foreign species have been delisted for reasons such as recovery, extinction, new taxonomy understanding, and new information. Recovered species include alligators, peregrine falcons, and kangaroos, while extinct species include the dusky seaside sparrow, Guam broadbill, and two small fish. Proving the extinction of rare species can be challenging, as demonstrated by the rediscovery of a rare shorebird thought to be extinct in Canada. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been criticized for only delisting 17 species as recovered by 2006. However, challenges in recovery are due to habitat loss and invasive species. Some species are listed only after significant depletion, making recovery difficult. Despite this, a large number of species have stabilized or increased their populations, indicating some success of the ESA. The ESA has shown success with 41% of listed species improving or stabilizing their populations. Some species like red wolves and California condors may not exist without ESA protection. Reports have been released to review recovery progress and factors affecting recovery time. The report examined federal efforts to recover a sample of 31 species, finding that recovery plans played a crucial role in the recovery of most species. Critics questioned the bias in the selection of species examined. ESA reauthorization has been on the legislative agenda since 1992, with bills introduced in each subsequent Congress to address various aspects of endangered species protection. Issues in the 109th Congress included the effects of ESA on land use, promoting species recovery, agency use of scientific information, regional resource conflicts, and other matters. Critics argue that the designation of Critical Habitat (CH) places burdens on landowners and lacks conservation benefits. There are disagreements over the value and timing of CH designation, with proposed bills in the 109th Congress aiming to repeal or modify CH designations. Proposed bills in the 109th Congress aimed to modify Critical Habitat (CH) designation, limiting it for some aquatic habitats. Disputes have arisen over the designation of CH for endangered species, with critics questioning the scientific rigor of ESA actions. Examples include controversies surrounding the Canada lynx, Florida panthers, and Klamath River Basin species. Some suggest that in instances where limited data is available for species facing extinction, considerations other than species conservation may prevail. The ESA does not provide clear guidance on this issue, but some argue that dwindling species should be given the benefit of the doubt and a margin of safety provided. The Endangered Species Consultation Handbook advises giving the benefit of the doubt to species when rendering a biological opinion based on available information. This approach allows for consultation to be reinitiated if additional information becomes available. The intention is to issue biological opinions even with incomplete information to prevent negative opinions. If an opinion is rendered with inadequate information, the proposing federal agency must demonstrate that their actions will not harm the species and make efforts to mitigate risks. Section 515 of P.L. 106-554, the Information Quality Act, directs federal agencies to ensure the quality of information they disseminate. Guidelines have been issued by OMB and additional guidelines are available from the Department of the Interior and FWS. Interested parties can seek correction of information through established processes. FWS and NMFS have also developed guidance on information quality and peer review procedures. Under the Interagency Cooperative Policy on Information Standards, FWS and NMFS receive information from various sources for listing, consultation, and recovery actions under the Endangered Species Act. Biologists review all information impartially to ensure it is reliable and credible, documenting their evaluations. The agencies aim to use the best scientific and commercial data available. The agencies aim to use primary and original sources of information for recommendations, ensuring the quality of the science used. They also solicit expert opinions and peer reviews to ensure the best biological and commercial information for listing decisions. Courts have held that agencies must not ignore available biological information, treat species differently, or wait until a species is on the brink of extinction before taking conservation measures. The \"best scientific and commercial data available\" standard does not require absolute certainty, but agencies must not base listings on speculation or disregard superior data. The best scientific data available must be utilized by agencies, not just the best possible data. Judicial review ensures agency decisions are not arbitrary, especially in cases affecting species decline. In Arizona Cattle Growers Association v. United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the court emphasized the low evidentiary bar FWS must meet when issuing Incidental Take Permits under \u00a710(a). The agency must show a species is present in an area before regulating it and establish the link between land use and harm to the species. The Endangered Species Act requires a causal connection between regulated land use and harm to species. Conservation of species and habitats is crucial as human populations grow. Congressional oversight has focused on regional conflicts related to conservation and economic interests. The House Resources Subcommittee on Water and Power held an oversight hearing in the 109th Congress regarding the impact of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) on water supplies, specifically focusing on the controversy surrounding the Klamath irrigation project in 2001. The project's operational changes were aimed at providing more water for three fish species protected under the ESA, leading to conflicts among various stakeholders in the region. Upstream farmers argue for their water rights from the Klamath Project, while others prioritize the downstream salmon fishery. The debate centers on balancing irrigation needs with fish protection, with criticism and defense of operation plans and biological assessments. The Trinity River diversion and Bureau's role in the Central Valley Project are also key points of contention. Salmon protection in the Pacific Northwest is a contentious issue, with 26 distinct population segments of Pacific salmon and steelhead trout listed as threatened or endangered. Recent controversies focus on the operation of the Federal Columbia River Power System and whether hatchery-produced salmon should be included in listed segments. Recovery measures are being implemented to address habitat restoration and other concerns. In the Pacific Northwest, salmon protection is a contentious issue with multiple population segments listed as threatened or endangered. Recent controversies include evaluating jeopardy to salmon from dam operations and the inclusion of hatchery-produced salmon in listed segments. Federal court decisions have ordered increased water spills to assist juvenile salmon transit. Legislation such as S. 232 and H.R. 1615 aim to address fish passage and screening facilities in the Columbia River Basin. Efforts to address salmon recovery include legislation authorizing partial removal of lower Snake River dams and designating restoration areas in California. Additionally, there are initiatives for the reintroduction of spring-run chinook salmon in the San Joaquin River and controversies over water allocation for the Rio Grande silvery minnow in New Mexico. Congress authorized activities related to the Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Collaborative Program (MRGESCP) to improve water management and aid in the recovery of endangered species in New Mexico. Regulations allow agencies to determine if their actions may harm listed species, avoiding consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service. The regulation allows agencies to determine if their actions may harm listed species, avoiding consultation with FWS or NMFS. New counterpart pesticide regulations were finalized for EPA actions on pesticides, allowing for alternative consultation agreements. The EPA may make determinations on potential harm to listed species without consulting FWS, with FWS oversight on consistency. Critics fear harm to species, while supporters see increased flexibility and efficiency in the new self-consultation process. On August 24, 2006, U.S. District Court Judge John Coughenour overturned EPA regulations on pesticides, ruling they did not align with the ESA \u00a77. He deemed it illegal for FWS or NMFS to allow EPA emergency consultation procedures for FIFRA \u00a718 actions. Optional formal consultation allows NMFS or FWS to adopt EPA effects determinations. Counterpart regulations were finalized in 2003 to streamline consultation on projects supporting the National Fire Plan. The counterpart regulations finalized in 2003 streamline consultation on projects supporting the National Fire Plan, eliminating the need for informal consultation with FWS or NMFS for certain actions. The presence of endangered species on private property can sometimes benefit owners, but conflicts may arise due to restrictions under the ESA. The ESA can \"take\" property, leading to conflicts with property owners despite mechanisms to soften its impact. The Fifth Amendment prohibits property takings without compensation, with the Supreme Court defining severe impacts as a \"taking.\" Factors determine if a taking occurs, with severe property impact required. The Fifth Amendment prohibits property takings without compensation, with severe property impact required for a taking to occur. Court decisions have mostly found no taking in challenges to ESA restrictions on land or property, citing insufficient economic impact or the government not being responsible for wild animal actions. In a controversial decision, the government was held responsible for ESA-related cutbacks in water delivery, leading to a $16.7 million settlement. Critics argue for amending the ESA to provide compensation for property impacts, with proposed legislation in previous Congresses. The House Committee on Resources reported H.R. 3824 on September 27, 2005, requiring federal compensation for property owners who forgo use of property due to ESA-listed species. Opponents argue against a compensation standard, citing property rights not being absolute and potential impacts on ESA implementation. In the 109th Congress, various bills proposed incentives like tax benefits to encourage landowner cooperation in ESA activities. Former Interior Secretary Babbitt also took actions to reduce conflicts, including streamlining permit procedures and promoting habitat protection for listed species. Under safe harbor agreements, landowners who increased suitable habitat could return to \"baseline conditions\" without penalty. No surprises agreements provided landowners with greater certainty regarding activities that might trigger penalties\u2014an incentive for landowners to develop Habitat Conservation Plans (HCP). Modifications to the no surprises rule required revoking an incidental take permit if the permitted taking would be inconsistent with the survival and recovery of the relevant listed species. These rules were reproposed and finalized in response to litigation. Federal managers focused on listing species as threatened rather than endangered to utilize more flexible provisions for protecting threatened species. Administrative changes have been made within existing law, with interest in codifying these changes in an amended ESA. Some groups criticize HCP agreements as difficult to enforce and lacking monitoring, locking the government into inflexible positions based on inadequate knowledge. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established a pilot project in several states to better coordinate actions among federal agencies under ESA \u00a77. In the 109th Congress, various bills were introduced to address endangered species issues, such as authorizing species recovery agreements, providing incidental take permits to public electric utilities, codifying the no surprises policy, and authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to reauthorize and amend the Endangered Species Act (ESA), including H.R. 3824 and S. 2110. These bills aimed to make the ESA more effective by redefining the relationship between private and public property uses, implementing new incentives for species conservation, and removing barriers to species protection. Both H.R. 3824 and S. 2110 aimed to encourage voluntary species conservation by states and private landowners. They proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act, including modifying critical habitat roles, making listing species more difficult, expanding permits for incidental take, and shifting towards state implementation of ESA programs. The 109th Congress considered various measures related to the Endangered Species Act, including reauthorizing fish recovery programs, expanding wildlife refuges, and establishing programs to manage marine debris. Critics raised concerns about gaps in protections, while proponents argued for a focus on species with the most urgent needs. The 109th Congress considered legislation on turtle excluder devices in shrimp trawls, polar bear population conservation, and marine debris management. Senate and House passed various bills with amendments to address these issues. In 2006, the Senate and House passed several bills amending the Endangered Species Act (ESA). These bills included provisions for mitigating highway impacts on endangered species, informing electricity consumers of ESA compliance costs, and treating distinct population segments of the Eastern oyster as separate species. In 2005, legislative actions were taken to protect endangered species including the desert tortoise, southern sea otter, ivory-billed woodpecker, and others. Bills were introduced to facilitate land acquisition, promote recovery efforts, celebrate rediscoveries, and amend the ESA for species rescue and relocation. Designations were made for \"Endangered Species Day\" on March 8, 2006, and May 11, 2006. Additionally, amendments were proposed to exempt landowner incentive programs from gross revenue under the Internal Revenue Code. In 2005, legislative actions were taken to protect endangered species, including bills authorizing programs for species recovery and habitat protection. One bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a pilot program for California endangered plant species, while another aimed to amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act to allow the taking of California sea lions to protect salmon species. Appropriations were crucial in funding listing and recovery activities for endangered and threatened species. The FY2006 appropriations provided funding for ESA activities, with $271.9 million allocated for FWS. Funding for ESA programs administered by NMFS was also included in the appropriations act. Additionally, provisions in another act rescinded unobligated balances from FWS. In FY2006, funding for ESA activities allocated $271.9 million for FWS and NMFS. The Pandemic Influenza Act rescinded unobligated balances from FWS's Landowner Incentive Program and the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. The 109th Congress did not complete action on FY2007 appropriations for FWS or NMFS. In FY1998, Congress imposed annual funding limits on FWS for ESA listing activities to prevent funds from being diverted to other programs. Despite budget constraints, courts have ruled that agencies must still comply with listing mandates. These limits were approved in succeeding fiscal year appropriations bills, with FY2006 appropriations capping listing activities at $18.13 million. The Bush Administration proposed similar limits for FY2007. The Bush Administration proposed limiting listing activities to $17.759 million for FY2007, with a portion allocated for critical habitat designation. The House and Senate Committee on Appropriations supported this proposal, with slight variations in the allocated amounts for critical habitat designation."
