    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"ANCSA Cook Inlet Region Land Conveyance Finalization Act of 2017\" and pertains to CIRI land entitlement. The \"ANCSA Cook Inlet Region Land Conveyance Finalization Act of 2017\" defines key terms and authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to convey land to CIRI to fulfill their entitlement under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. CIRI must obtain written consent from another regional ANC for selecting land within their boundaries. CIRI is entitled to select 43,000 acres of land outside Cook Inlet Region to fulfill their entitlement under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, Cook Inlet Region can select land previously chosen by other Alaska Native Corporations that was later withdrawn, land adjacent to other ANCs, land in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, and federal land outside of specific protected areas in Alaska. The Wilderness Act allows Cook Inlet Region, Inc. (CIRI) to have the right of notice and first refusal to select excess federal land or property within its region in Alaska, as identified by the Federal Government. This right is subject to certain requirements and exceptions outlined in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. The Federal Government notifies CIRI of excess land or property, and CIRI has 180 days to decide if they want it. If CIRI acquires the land, they must relinquish an equal amount of land they are entitled to under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The fair market value of excess Federal land or surplus property to be conveyed is divided by the difference between the value per acre of land determined from the most recent census of agricultural land values for the State and the value of land in specific census areas used for Federal surplus property credits. Adjusted for inflation, Federal surplus property credits are calculated based on the difference between the fair market value of excess Federal land or surplus property and the value of land in specific census areas."
