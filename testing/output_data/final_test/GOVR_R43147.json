    "content": "The Administration requested $39.028 billion for DHS in FY2014, part of a $60.0 billion overall budget. The House passed H.R. 2217 with amendments, resulting in a net discretionary appropriation of $38.991 billion for DHS. Funding for certain activities was 40% below the requested level due to offsets from management accounts. Increases were approved for Customs and Border Protection's Border Security Fencing. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported out H.R. 2217 with an amendment by a vote of 21-9, carrying a net discretionary appropriation of $39.100 billion for DHS for FY2014. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) announced an emergency shutdown furlough on September 30, 2013, due to the failure to enact appropriations legislation. DHS released procedures for a federal funding hiatus on September 27, 2013. On October 17, 2013, the Senate and the House of Representatives passed a short-term continuing resolution (CR) to fund government operations at FY2013 levels through January 15, 2014, resolving the government shutdown. More than 31,000 DHS employees were furloughed, while others worked without pay. The Senate and House passed a bill to temporarily resolve funding lapse, ending furlough for federal employees. The bill included provisions for DHS and provided flexibility for CBP and ICE. No detailed funding direction was given. On January 14, 2014, the House passed a short-term continuing resolution, followed by the Senate on January 15. On January 15, 2014, the Senate passed a bill with a vote of 86-14, which was signed into law the same day as P.L. 113-73. This prevented a funding lapse while a consolidated appropriations act for FY2014 was being finalized. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, signed on January 17, included annual appropriations legislation for the entire discretionary budget for FY2014, with Division F of P.L. 113-76 allocating $39,270 million in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS. This was $922 million more than the previous year, and an additional $5.6 billion was allocated for FEMA disaster relief funding. The FY2014 appropriations bill included $227 million for the Coast Guard for overseas operations, funded through adjustments in discretionary spending limits. Data sources include H.R. 933, P.L. 113-6, and the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013. Information on the House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the bill is also included. The FY2014 appropriations bill included $227 million for the Coast Guard for overseas operations, funded through adjustments in discretionary spending limits. Data sources include H.R. 933, P.L. 113-6, and the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013. Information on the House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the bill is also included. Details on historical funding data and the impact of sequestration on budget authority are provided. The FY2013 Post-Sequestration Operating Plan released by DHS outlined funding provided as a result of P.L. 113-6. Reprogramming and transfer activity is underway to address the impact of sequestration cuts on priority programs. The charts in the report contain information on pre-sequester funding levels for FY2013, with data from P.L. 113-6 accounting for across-the-board cuts. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the new Department of Homeland Security. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the new Department of Homeland Security. Appropriations for DHS are organized into five titles, covering various offices and agencies within the department. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the new Department of Homeland Security. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for all components and functions of the department, with additional titles sometimes added to address special issues. Comparisons between pre-sequester enacted totals for FY2013 and the FY2014 request are provided in Table 2. The FY2013 pre-sequester DHS discretionary appropriations were $46.2 billion, with $12.1 billion in supplemental appropriations. The FY2014 total request was $44.7 billion, with House-passed and Senate-reported DHS appropriations at $44.6 billion and $44.7 billion respectively. Under P.L. 113-76, DHS received $46.0 billion in discretionary appropriations, including emergency spending and disaster relief. The analysis includes the impact of fees and mandatory spending. The Administration proposed a 1% pay increase for civilian federal employees in its FY2014 budget request. The House and Senate did not prohibit the pay raise but expected it to be funded within appropriated funds for DHS. An executive order was issued for the pay increase to take effect on January 1, 2014. The executive order implementing a pay increase effective January 1, 2014 was issued on December 20, 2013. The DHS bill breakdown by title lacks transparency on resource allocation. DHS's discretionary budget authority is broken down by component, with Customs and Border Protection being the largest. Table 3 and Figure 1 display the budget breakdown, including a disaster relief adjustment under the Budget Control Act. The discretionary budget authority provided through legislation is shown in the left column, with adjustments included in the right column. This comparison focuses on new budget authority requested or provided, excluding prior-year rescissions. DHS components like TSA and USCIS rely on fee income or offsetting collections for funding, not just discretionary appropriations. The bulk of USCIS funding comes from fee income, not direct appropriations. In FY2014, 67% of the DHS budget was funded through discretionary appropriations, with the remainder coming from fees, mandatory appropriations, BCA adjustments, and other non-appropriated resources. Table 4 shows DHS discretionary appropriations from FY2004 to FY2014, with funding peaking in FY2010. The Budget Control Act allowed disaster funding to be included in regular appropriations bills, altering the downward trend in funding levels. Without disaster relief funding, annual appropriations for DHS declined each year until FY2014. Supplemental funding for DHS, addressing congressional priorities like disaster assistance and border security, varies yearly and distorts total appropriations comparisons. FY2013 had two lines in the table, one pre-sequester and one post-sequester. The history of DHS appropriations bills shows changes in timing and enactment processes. The DHS appropriations bill was enacted relatively promptly as stand-alone legislation, no longer an outlier in timing. Title I provides funding for management activities, A&O account, and OIG. The House-passed bill allocated $883 million, Senate-reported bill $1,054 million, and P.L. 113-76 included $1,037 million in Title I. Pre-sequester enacted amounts for FY2013 and requested levels for FY2014 are compared. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2014 allocated funds for management activities, A&O account, and OIG. The House-passed bill allocated $883 million, Senate-reported bill $1,054 million, and P.L. 113-76 included $1,037 million in Title I. The departmental management accounts cover general administrative expenses of DHS, including the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management (OSEM) and the Under Secretary for Management (USM) and its components. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2014 allocated funds for management activities, A&O account, and OIG. The Administration requested funding for the consolidation of DHS headquarters and provided a graphic representation of discretionary appropriations for various DHS components. The Administration requested appropriations for departmental management accounts in FY2014, including $127 million for OSEM, $203 million for USM, $49 million for OCFO, and $327 million for OCIO. Program changes included funding for the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to counter domestic violence extremism and oversight support for ICE's programs. The Office of Public Affairs received $3 million for continued expansion of a program. The Administration requested $203 million for the USM and 872 FTEs, with program changes including reductions in funding for various offices such as the Chief Readiness Support Officer and Human Resources Information Technology. Additionally, the Administration requested $49 million for the OCFO with program changes including an increase for Financial Systems Modernization. The FY2012 baseline included a $4 million increase for Financial Systems Modernization and a $2.7 million reduction in contract support. The Administration requested $327 million for the OCIO and 274 FTEs, with program changes totaling more than $80 million. H.R. 2217, as passed by the House, would have provided appropriations compared to the President's request, including reductions in funding for various offices. The House Committee on Appropriations justified reductions in funding for various offices within the department, citing the need to cover the lack of revenue from unrealized funding proposals and the department's failure to comply with statutory requirements. $5 million was allocated for enhancements to the \"If You See Something, Say Something\" campaign. Separate line items for certain offices were denied under House-passed H.R. 2217, with offices directed to remain within the Office of Policy. The House Appropriations Committee recommended reductions in funding for various offices within the department to cover unrealized funding proposals and non-compliance with statutory requirements. A floor amendment to H.R. 2217 reduced funding for the OSEM by $3 million. The USM appropriation included $171 million, with $30 million allocated for the Chief Administrative Officer, including $4 million for improvements at the Nebraska Avenue Complex. Floor amendments further reduced USM funding by $36 million. The Appropriations Committee recommended increasing funds for various programs, including Border Security, Firefighter Assistance Grants, Urban Search and Rescue, and Transportation Security Administration. The House-reported bill expressed concern about the cost of international rotations of DHS personnel. The House report directed the CFO to review costs of secondment positions in foreign countries, with funding for new positions in FY2014 being denied. An adopted floor amendment reduced OCFO funding by $10 million. $211 million for the Chief Information Officer would be allocated to salaries, expenses, and technology development through September 30, 2015. The Senate-reported bill for departmental management in Title I would have provided appropriations for equipment, software, services, and related activities through September 30, 2015. Data Center Migration would have received an appropriation of $34 million. The total funding provided would have been $633 million, representing a decrease of $72.3 million from the President's request. The Senate bill rejected the Administration's proposal to fund certain offices separately from the Office of Policy. The Senate committee report did not include the House's $2 million reduction to the Office of Policy. Proposed funding reductions were due to a constrained budget environment. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed DHS to revise the acquisition instruction manual to include information on lessons learned from canceled acquisition programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $48 million appropriation for the OCFO, including a $4 million increase for Financial Systems Modernization. This would allow the OCFO to oversee the migration of financial systems for various components. The Coast Guard was expected to migrate its financial management system in FY2014, which would benefit other agencies. The Senate report also provided guidance on budget justifications and expenditure plans for the coming years. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $263 million appropriation for the OCIO, with $115 million for salaries and expenses and $148 million for technology investments. This includes $45 million for IT equipment, software, services, and $54 million for data center migration. The committee noted that the migration will lead to operational efficiencies and annual savings. The Senate committee report recommended an increase in appropriations for implementing information sharing and safeguarding measures to protect classified national security information. The total funding provided for Departmental Management in Title I was $622 million, a decrease from the President's request of $705 million. The total funding for Departmental Management in Title I was $622 million, a decrease of $97 million, or 13.7%, from the President's request of $705 million. P.L. 113-76 included a $45,000 limit on OSEM appropriations for official reception and representation expenses, with quarterly expense reports required. Expenditure plans were mandated for various offices, but funds were not withheld for non-submission. The act funded various offices within the Department of Homeland Security, including the Office of International Affairs, the Office of State and Local Law Enforcement, and the Private Sector Office. It also allocated additional funds for the Office of Public Affairs to enhance the \"If you See Something, Say Something\" campaign. The Deputy Secretary, along with CBP and ICE, was directed to address corruption by DHS employees, and DHS was instructed to develop a hiring strategy with background investigations for new hires. The law required the USM to submit a Comprehensive Acquisition Status Report to Congress along with the President's budget. FY2014 funds were not withheld to allow new leadership to comply with reporting requirements. Reduced appropriations were due to high lapsed balances and funding needs across DHS. P.L. 113-76 directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit the Future Years Homeland Security Program to Congress. The President's FY2015 budget was submitted, and FY2014 funds were not withheld to allow new leadership to comply with reporting requirements. Almost $30 million was allocated for financial systems modernization, with $115 million for salaries and expenses and $142 million for information technology development. An additional $21 million was appropriated for information purposes. The CIO was allocated $21 million for information sharing and safeguards, and $42 million for data center migration. They were required to submit detailed expenditure and management plans to Congress. Issues identified included vacancies in leadership positions and morale of DHS employees. The House committee report expressed concerns about leadership vacancies in CBP and OIG at DHS, noting a lack of effective leadership and proactive thinking. R. Gil Kerlikowske and John Roth were confirmed as Commissioner of CBP and DHS Inspector, respectively. The House committee report expressed concerns about low morale and weak innovation at DHS, directing the department to provide a corrective action plan within 60 days. Bonuses and monetary awards were deemed important. The House committee report expressed concerns about the high number of employees receiving awards at DHS, stating that it may devalue the recognition and incentives. DHS did not grant performance awards in FY2013 due to funding reductions and was directed to include award amounts and criteria in the FY2015 budget request. The House committee report criticized the Department of Homeland Security for not effectively linking resources to results, leading to insufficient information for Congress to make allocation decisions. It emphasized the need for DHS to define its missions, strategies, and goals better, including through the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review and performance-based budgeting. The department was directed to prioritize goals and resources in future budget proposals. The Department of Homeland Security was directed to include clearly defined mission goals and multi-year plans in future budget proposals, along with performance measures to measure outcomes, outputs, and efficiency. An efficiency review in 2009 aimed to reduce costs and streamline operations, with recommendations made in 2012 for consistency in efficiency review investments. The report directed the Department of Homeland Security to brief the committee on implementing recommendations within 60 days. It also included provisions for official costs of government aircraft use, transparency in travel costs, reducing offline travel bookings, and examining department-wide travel costs for potential savings. The Department of Homeland Security's headquarters occupies over 7.5 million square feet in 40 locations in the Washington, DC area. The fragmentation of headquarters leads to inefficiencies and additional costs. A master plan was approved in 2006 to unify headquarters functions at St. Elizabeths. The Department of Homeland Security approved a master plan in 2006 to create a new headquarters at St. Elizabeths in Anacostia, which would be the largest federal office construction since the Pentagon. Funding requests for construction and campus security were included in the budget, with discrepancies in funding allocations between the House and Senate versions of the bill. The initial cost estimate for the St. Elizabeths project was $3.4 billion, with $1.4 billion funded through the DHS budget and $2 billion through the GSA. The latest cost estimates suggest a phased construction approach costing $4.5 billion to complete by FY2026, with potential savings of $532 million over 30 years. GSA estimates $532 million in savings over 30 years by comparing construction costs to lease costs. $1,368 million has been invested in the project through FY2013\u2014$460 million through DHS and $908 million through GSA. Phase 1A of the project\u2014a new Coast Guard headquarters facility\u2014has been completed and is operational. FY2014 funding was below the requested level for both DHS and GSA elements of the planned construction on the center building complex. Congress may need to decide whether to continue with the consolidation effort at St. Elizabeths, considering the existing Coast Guard presence and investment in infrastructure on the site. The Analysis and Operations account supports the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) and the Office of Operations Coordination and Planning (OPS) within DHS. I&A manages the DHS intelligence enterprise, collects, analyzes, and shares intelligence information, while OPS develops and coordinates departmental and interagency operations plans. I&A's budget partly comes from the classified National Intelligence Program. Congress may need to decide whether to proceed more quickly with the consolidation effort at St. Elizabeths to reduce costs and generate efficiencies. OPS manages the National Operations Center, a 24/7 hub for incident management and coordination. The FY2014 request for the Analysis and Operations account was $309 million, with funding for 852 FTEs. House-passed H.R. 2217 proposed $292 million for the account, citing flaws in the DHS budget request. Funding for cybersecurity analysis and counterintelligence was restored by the House Committee on Appropriations. The Senate-reported H.R. 2217 included $304 million for cybersecurity analysis and counterintelligence, slightly below the requested amount. The Senate committee required DHS's Chief Intelligence Officer to submit an FY2014 expenditure plan within 60 days of appropriations enactment, detailing areas of unique expertise and intelligence support without impairing senior DHS leadership. The plan includes fiscal year 2014 expenditures and staffing for each program compared to previous years, allocation of funding within each program, and the number of employees supporting organizations outside of I&A. $301 million was provided in funding for Analysis and Operations in Division F of P.L. 113-76. Issues for Congress include concerns about I&A's mission, with Representative Sue Myrick highlighting a lack of focus and overlapping authorities. This was discussed in a House Subcommittee hearing on DHS's role in the intelligence community. The Aspen Institute report recommended avoiding duplication of efforts in intelligence activities at DHS. The Aspen Institute report recommends that DHS focus on specific homeward-focused intelligence areas to avoid duplication of efforts by other agencies. The Senate committee's report suggests that DHS should direct its intelligence mission towards areas where it has unique strengths and value, particularly in serving state/local partners. The requirement for DHS to submit an FY2014 expenditure plan may help address these issues. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducts audits and investigations to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse within the department. It reports to Congress and the Secretary of DHS. The Administration requested $119 million in appropriations for the OIG, with an additional $24 million transfer from the Disaster Relief Fund. New funding of $2.5 million was allocated for audits mandated by the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. The House and Senate bills allocated funding for the DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) for audits and investigations. The House bill included $114 million, while the Senate bill included $117 million, both with a $24 million transfer from the Disaster Relief Fund. The funding was deemed necessary to maintain current services, including audits of key programs. Division F of P.L. 113-76 ultimately included $115 million for the DHS OIG. The House and Senate bills allocated funding for the DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) for audits and investigations, with $115 million included in P.L. 113-76. The OIG was required to conduct various reviews and provide reports to the Appropriations Committees. New oversight requirements for DHS participation in conferences were not included in the Administration's analysis. The House report directed the OIG to provide detailed expenditure plans starting in FY2015. The Senate report directs the OIG to provide detailed expenditure plans and enhance \"red team\" investigations with TSA to address evolving threats. It also calls for improved disaster recovery programs and oversight funding coordination with ICE and CBP. Division F of P.L. 113-76 instructs the OIG to examine DHS travel costs for excessive expenditures and potential savings. The OIG is tasked with reviewing travel costs for excessive expenditures and potential savings, providing input on the hiring strategy for CBP and ICE personnel, and presenting the expenditure plan as requested in House and Senate reports. They are also required to brief committees quarterly on joint OIG/FEMA efforts to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Title II of the DHS appropriations bill includes appropriations for CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and USSS, with a requested budget of $30,283 million for FY2014. The House-passed bill would have provided $30,768 million, a 1.60% increase. Title II of the DHS appropriations bill for FY2014 included $30,877 million in funding, 2.1% above the requested level. Both the Senate-reported bill and the enacted annual appropriations act also included an additional $227 million for overseas contingency operations of Coast Guard. CBP, enacted through Division F of P.L. 113-76, is responsible for security at ports of entry along the border, focusing on preventing entry of terrorists and terrorism instruments. CBP officers inspect people and goods at ports of entry to determine authorization to enter the US and enforce over 400 laws to prevent illegal entries. Major programs include Border Security Inspections, Border Security and Control, Air and Marine Operations, Automation Modernization, Border Security Fencing, and Construction. The agency responsible for border security is CBP, which manages various programs such as Border Security Inspections, Border Security and Control, Air and Marine Operations, Automation Modernization, Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology. CBP also oversees immigration and customs user Fee Accounts. The Administration requested a budget of $10,833 million for CBP in FY2014, including program changes like transferring the US-VISIT program to CBP and increasing funding by $210.1 million. Increase of $210.1 million for 1,600 additional CBP officers and 70 canine teams at Ports of Entry, along with 245 support personnel. Increase of $70.5 million for Automated Targeting System operations, targeting systems, and CBP's National Targeting Center. Increase of $10.8 million for 1,500 mobile devices and handheld readers. Increase of $8 million for 60 automated kiosks at airports and high-volume pedestrian crossings. Decrease in funding for CBP includes reductions in mission support staffing, information technology infrastructure, vehicle replacements, Border Patrol overtime hours, acquisitions of NII equipment, transportation program costs, and other administrative expenses. The transportation contract was re-competed, resulting in a $18.9 million decrease. Other reductions include $16.0 million from the CBP officer Foreign Language Awards Program, $10 million from programs to combat port running, $7.9 million from mission support staffing for the US-VISIT program, $7 million from background investigations, $6.4 million from centralizing ammunition procurement, and $6.0 million from reduced procurements for the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative Land Border Integration program. The House approved $10,617 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2014, a decrease of $216 million (2.0%) from the President's request. This includes reductions in funding for Tactical Analysis Units and Customs-Trade Partnership against Terrorism (C-TPAT) validation cycle extension. Additionally, there was a decrease in gross budget authority to $12,680 million, with an amendment adding $10 million to the Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology (BSFIT) account for emergency communication in rural areas. The House approved a decrease in funding for CBP for FY2014, including reductions in Tactical Analysis Units and C-TPAT validation cycle extension. An amendment added $10 million for emergency communication in rural areas. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported version of H.R. 2217 included a decrease in net budget authority for CBP for FY2014. The FY2014 appropriations act included changes to the \"Air and Marine Operations\u2014Salaries\" subaccount, transferring it to the Air and Marines Operations account. The budget justification recommended transferring the US-VISIT entry-exit program to CBP and allocating $254 million for the program. Congress discussed the mix of human resources and technology at ports of entry for FY2014. The FY2014 appropriations act included discussions on increasing personnel at ports of entry and improving infrastructure. CBP's front-line enforcement personnel numbers grew from 31,695 in FY2005 to 46,666 in FY2013, with Border Patrol agents accounting for the largest share of this growth. The Administration proposed hiring 3,477 additional CBP officers in FY2014. The FY2014 appropriations act proposed hiring 3,477 additional CBP officers, with 1,600 officers funded through appropriations and 1,877 officers through user fee increases. The House Appropriations Committee supported increasing CBP officers but recommended a smaller increase for a phased approach. The Senate-reported bill allocated $96 million for 876 new CBP officers and supported the user fee proposal for 974 more officers. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 included funding to increase CBP officers at ports of entry by 2,000 by the end of FY2015. CBP collects user fees to reimburse for customs functions and officer salaries. The collection and disposition of certain COBRA user fees have been controversial in recent appropriations cycles. In FY2012 and FY2013, CBP proposed using revenue from the elimination of a fee exemption to fund officer salaries and expenses, but Congress did not approve this, requiring additional appropriated funding. In FY2014, CBP did not propose using these revenues for salaries and expenses, instead including new fee increases. The FY2014 proposal included new fee increases to fund CBP officer salaries and expenses, with plans to tie fees to the Consumer Price Index in the future. House-passed H.R. 2217 did not include language for fee increases, while the Senate-reported version did include increases for Immigration User Fee and COBRA fees. The Senate committee noted that CBP's services exceed fee collections, impacting cost recovery. The Senate-reported H.R. 2217 aimed to address the significant impact of cost recovery for the Office of Field Operation's budget, which relies on user fees. The bill included a provision to make COBRA fee revenue available to CBP, with a proposed study on establishing a land border crossing fee. However, House-passed H.R. 2217 prohibited the collection of such a fee and the use of DHS funds for related studies. The Senate committee-reported version of H.R. 2217 aimed to address cost recovery for the Office of Field Operation's budget by making COBRA fee revenue available to CBP. It also included a provision prohibiting the collection or study of a land border crossing fee. Additionally, the FY2013 DHS appropriations act established a pilot program for CBP to enter into public-private partnerships to support customs and immigration services at ports of entry. However, CBP has limited authority to receive reimbursement for services or collect extra fees, hindering their ability to enter into PPPs. The Administration's FY2014 Budget Justification proposed expanding CBP's partnership authority by allowing donations from private parties and state/local entities for POE facilities. The House bill did not include this proposal, waiting for results from an initial pilot program. The Senate supported the Administration's PPP language in Section 566 of H.R. 2217. The House bill included a provision allowing CBP to accept property donations for port construction and a pilot program for reimbursement from outside sources for certain services. ICE focuses on enforcing immigration and customs laws within the United States. ICE enforces immigration and customs laws, including alien smuggling and hiring unauthorized workers. They locate and remove aliens who have overstayed visas or entered illegally. ICE also combats terrorist financing, money laundering, and enforces export laws. The FY2014 budget request for ICE included increases for legal advising, commercial trade investigations, and human trafficking investigations, as well as reductions in the 287(g) program. The FY2014 budget request for ICE included reductions in various programs, such as a $44 million reduction in the 287(g) program, a $120 million reduction in detention bed funding, and a $10 million reduction in ICE's international operations. Additionally, there was a proposed reduction of $482 million to address \"inefficiencies,\" with the largest portion coming from reduced staffing achieved through attrition. House-passed H.R. 2217 would have provided a $388 million increase in net budget authority for ICE, while Senate-reported H.R. 2217 would have provided a $58 million increase. The FY2014 budget for ICE saw increases in net budget authority, with H.R. 2217 and P.L. 113-76 providing additional funding over the Administration's request. ICE's diverse responsibilities led to debates on resource allocation to fulfill its mission. ICE's FY2014 appropriations process focused on discussions about detaining and removing aliens, including prioritizing certain aliens for removal based on enforcement priorities and prosecutorial discretion. ICE reported that in 2012, there were 11.7 million unauthorized aliens in the US, with 1.9 million aliens convicted of a crime. ICE has the capacity to remove 400,000 aliens annually. In March 2011, ICE Director John Morton established three civil immigration enforcement priorities: removing aliens posing national security risks, recent illegal entrants, and fugitives. Guidelines were further detailed in June 2011 to target criminal aliens and consider prosecutorial discretion for crime victims. DHS announced a review of pending removal cases on August 18, 2011. In December 2012, DHS announced a review of removal cases for prosecutorial discretion. The DACA program deferred enforcement for certain individuals brought to the US as children. H.R. 2217 aimed to block funding for DACA and other enforcement priorities. The House-passed H.R. 2217 aimed to prioritize the identification and removal of criminal aliens by severity of the crime, with $1,600 million allocated for this purpose. The Senate bill also emphasized the enforcement of immigration laws. ICE's Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) is responsible for providing custody. ICE's Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) manages custody of aliens in removal proceedings or ordered removed from the US. Concerns exist about insufficient detention space leading to decisions on releasing aliens based on space availability rather than individual cases. Some advocate for alternatives to detention programs for noncriminal alien detainees as a cost-effective and proportional treatment option. ICE released 2,228 detainees in FY2013 due to budgetary constraints, despite maintaining 34,000 detention beds. Critics viewed the release as politically motivated to pressure Congress. The President's FY2014 budget proposed reducing bed space to 31,800, while H.R. 2217 aimed to maintain 34,000 beds for FY2014. H.R. 2217 aimed to maintain 34,000 detention beds for FY2014, while Senate-reported H.R. 2217 increased ICE detention bed space funding by $41 million above the President's request. ICE's Alternatives to Detention program offers less restrictive options for certain aliens who do not require secure detention settings. The Administration requested $72 million for the Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program, but both House-passed and Senate-reported H.R. 2217 allocated $96 million for ATD programs. The Senate report criticized ICE for not effectively utilizing the ATD program for custody management. Additionally, Division F of P.L. 113-76 provided $91 million for ATD and $25 million for Secure Communities, an information sharing program between DHS and the Department of Justice. The President's request included a transfer of resources from Secure Communities to the Criminal Alien Program (CAP) in FY2013. The enforcement of immigration laws by state and local law enforcement agents has sparked debate about their proper role, with concerns over training, resources, civil rights violations, and community impact. Some argue that the federal government has limited resources to enforce immigration law. The federal government faces limited resources for enforcing immigration law, leading to debates on utilizing state and local law enforcement. The Administration proposed reducing funding for 287(g) agreements, favoring the more efficient Secure Communities screening process. ICE plans to end less productive 287(g) task force agreements, while House and Senate reports recommended varying funding levels for the program. The appropriated amount for 287(g) agreements in FY2013 was fully funded, with ICE urged to explore expansion and improvement for better enforcement. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was created in 2001 to protect transportation systems in the US. TSA's responsibilities include safeguarding the aviation system against terrorist threats and deploying security technologies. They also assess the risk of terrorist attacks on non-aviation transportation assets. The TSA is responsible for assessing the risk of terrorist attacks on non-aviation transportation assets, issuing regulations, and enforcing security measures. The TSA budget is complex, with airline security fees offsetting some costs, including investments in screening technology. Other fees cover transportation threat assessment and credentialing costs. These amounts are not reflected in traditional appropriations provisions. The TSA budget includes additional resources not reflected in traditional appropriations provisions. The FY2014 request specified a total of $7,398 million for TSA, with $2,562 million in offsets and direct appropriations of $4,836 million. The Congressional Budget Office differed with the Office of Management and Budget on fee estimates. The Administration's proposal for TSA's budget includes $4,857 million in appropriations, with $4,968 million for Aviation Security, $827 million for the Federal Air Marshal Service, and $250 million for the Aviation Security Capital Fund. Other allocations include $106 million for Secure Flight, $165 million for Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing, $109 million for Surface Transportation Security, and $998 million for Transportation Security Support. The House-passed bill specified funding for TSA at $7,217 million, $181 million below the request. It included additional funding for the Screening Partnership Program and maintained funding for the Federal Flight Deck Officers program. However, there were reductions in funding for Screener Personnel Compensation and Benefits, Airport Management, Information Technology, and Support. The Senate-reported bill specified $96 million less than requested for Transportation Security Support, including reductions in funding for Headquarters Administration and Information Technology. The Senate recommended $7,344 million for TSA, $54 million less than requested but $130 million more than the House-passed amount. There were also reductions in funding for Screener Personnel Compensation and Benefits, as well as Transportation Security Support and Information Technology. The FY2014 appropriations for TSA were roughly $7,365 million, $33 million less than requested. Issues included proposed changes to the airline passenger security fee structure, screener staffing levels, management efficiencies, and funding for armed pilots and crew member self-defense training. The Administration proposed changing the passenger security fee structure to a flat fee of $5.00 per passenger per one-way flight in FY2014, with annual increases of $0.50 until reaching $7.50 in FY2019. The House budget resolution generally supported the change to offset aviation security costs, but noted that changing the statutory fee was outside the appropriations committees' jurisdiction. The Senate Committee on the Budget assumed an increase to aviation security fees consistent with the President's request, but cuts to management and administrative offices across DHS functions were required due to uncertainties in revenue assumptions from the proposed change in the passenger security fee structure. The Senate Appropriations committee did not include the fee increases in its estimates, suggesting that the proposal should be channeled through a different process. The Senate Appropriations Committee believes the proposal to restructure passenger security fees should be handled by the appropriate authorizing committees. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 changed the fee to a flat rate of $5.60 per one-way trip starting July 1, 2014, and repealed air carrier fees. The repeal, effective October 1, 2014, allows TSA to collect fees from airlines until then, with a limit based on 2000 fee amounts. The repeal does not impact TSA's FY2014 budget. The FY2014 request also included a proposal to shift exit lane staffing responsibilities to airports. The proposal to shift exit lane staffing responsibilities to airports was expected to save TSA $88 million in FY2014 but faced strong opposition from airports due to associated costs. The House Appropriations Committee raised procedural and security concerns, directing TSA to assess the impact of the change and consider delaying or phasing in the shift. The Senate committee allocated $2 million for tests to evaluate cost-effective technologies for securing exit lanes. The Senate committee allocated $2 million for tests to evaluate cost-effective technologies for securing exit lanes, while the House report language continued the limit on TSA screener staffing and expressed concerns about the growth of screener staffing despite the implementation of risk-based screening strategies. The Senate and House committees allocated funds for various security measures, including evaluating technologies for exit lanes and addressing concerns about TSA screener staffing. The House report highlighted reduced staffing needs for advanced imaging technology and directed TSA to provide a briefing on behavior detection officers' impact on aviation security. The committee recommended annual standardized testing for behavior detection methods at airports and directed TSA to brief on progress in implementing recommendations to improve the SPOT program. P.L. 113-76 maintained the cap on FTE screeners, with language requiring TSA to continue monitoring exit lanes at airports where it provided such monitoring as of December 1, 2013. Additional funding of $60 million was allocated. The explanatory statement accompanying P.L. 113-76 included additional funding of $60 million for screener staffing in exit lanes. TSA was advised to evaluate cost-effective solutions for securing exit lanes. The funding for exit-lane staffing was offset by a $28 million reduction for staffing reductions in whole-body imaging systems. Various efficiency measures totaling $205 million were included in the FY2014 request. The FY2014 budget request included projected efficiencies to reduce costs, such as cutting mission support personnel, using electronic media instead of paper prints, and reducing non-essential travel. Congress raised concerns about why these efficiencies were not implemented sooner. Moving forward, TSA may face challenges in making further cost reductions despite budget pressures, especially in programs like Airport Management and Information Technology. The House bill set funding below requested levels for programs like Airport Management and Information Technology under Transportation Security Support, posing challenges for cost savings without impacting TSA core missions. The Senate committee report highlighted concerns over inventory management to address DHS Inspector General recommendations. The FY2014 budget request suggested eliminating funding for the Federal Flight Deck Officers program. The House Appropriations Committee did not support the proposal to eliminate funding for the Federal Flight Deck Officers (FFDO) program, which trains airline pilots to carry firearms for cockpit defense. The committee recommended $25 million for the program, stating that armed and trained pilots serve as a last-line-of-defense aboard aircraft. The Senate committee report specified $25 million for the FFDO and flight crew training programs, emphasizing the importance of training dedicated flight crews to protect commercial flights and passengers. The Coast Guard is the lead agency for maritime homeland security, responsible for securing U.S. ports, coastal waters, and performing various missions including search and rescue and environmental protection. The Coast Guard, under the Department of Homeland Security since 2003, is allocated funding for various operations including search and rescue, environmental protection, and fisheries enforcement. The President requested $8,050 million, with the House and Senate recommending higher amounts. P.L. 113-76 ultimately provided $8,501 million in funding, exceeding the President's request. The final bill allocated $451 million more than the President's request for the Coast Guard, with $227 million designated for overseas operations. The Coast Guard is undergoing a modernization effort to replace aging vessels and aircraft, with the President requesting a 35% reduction in funding for the ACI account. The House bill aimed to increase the order of fast response cutters to four. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees provided funding for six fast response cutters and $77 million for long lead-time materials. The Coast Guard was directed to submit a report on homeporting a National Security Cutter in Alaska and an Arctic strategy implementation plan. The President requested funding for the seventh National Security Cutter and preliminary planning for a new icebreaker, with an estimated cost of $800 million to $1 billion. The Coast Guard is directed to submit an alternatives analysis for acquisition of a heavy icebreaker. The President requested funding for long-range surveillance aircraft, but the final bill did not include it. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the Coast Guard for reducing funding for aircraft recapitalization. The bill provided $129 million for one HC-130J. The President's request would have resulted in a reduction of 931 positions in the operations account, achieved through attrition. This included 850 service members and 81 civilians, with some reductions due to newer vessels requiring fewer crew. The House-passed bill provided $84 million more than the President's request for Coast Guard operations, including funding to restore cuts to training and maintenance budgets. The President had requested the closure of two air stations for annual savings of $5 million, but the House Appropriations Committee denied this request. The Senate committee report did not address the issue, but the final agreement allowed for the closure of the two air stations and provided an additional $28 million. The President requested additional funding for training, maintenance, Interagency Operations Centers (IOCs), and WatchKeeper software to monitor harbor operations and vessel movements. $13 million was also requested for the Nationwide Automatic Identification System to track vessels along the coasts. The Coast Guard planned to complete the roll-out of a system to remaining sectors in FY2014. The U.S. Secret Service has missions in criminal investigations and protection, covering various areas including financial crimes, identity theft, and protection of high-profile individuals and locations. The USSS is responsible for security at National Special Security Events (NSSE) and has a budget request of $1,546 million for FY2014. This includes funds for protection and investigation missions, as well as personnel needs. The House-passed DHS appropriations bill recommended $1,586 million, a $40 million increase. The House recommended an appropriation of $1,586 million for the USSS in FY2014, which was $40 million higher than the Administration's request. The Senate also recommended an appropriation of $1,582 million, $35 million above the Administration's request, rejecting proposed personnel cuts and reductions in the budget for permanent change of station costs. Both the House and Senate recommended maintaining traditional funding levels for forensic and investigative support related to missing and exploited children. The Congress appropriated $1,585 million for the Secret Service in FY2014, with a reduction in funding for the protection mission compared to FY2013. One potential issue for Congress is balancing the investigative and protective missions of the Service. The protection mission employs most agents and resources, with recent congressional action focused on the USSS. Most recent congressional action on the USSS has focused on its protection mission and agent misconduct. There is a push for better threat investigation efforts to enhance protection activities. Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committee have highlighted the need to restore personnel funding for the Service. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for protection and investigation missions, with provisions for unanticipated shifts in funding requirements. The House-passed bill proposed a 10.1% increase above the requested level, while the Senate-reported bill suggested a 10.6% increase. The final bill included $5,952 million for these accounts. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was established by the Secretary of Homeland Security in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. It includes various offices such as the Office of Infrastructure Protection, Office of Cybersecurity and Communications, Federal Protective Services, and Office of Biometric Identity Management. The enacted amounts for Title III components for FY2013, FY2014 requests, and appropriations under P.L. 113-76 are listed in Table 14. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) includes offices like the Office of Infrastructure Protection, Office of Cybersecurity and Communications, Federal Protective Services, and Office of Biometric Identity Management. The report tracks funding for administrative functions and programmatic activities within these offices. The Administration requested $65 million for the Management and Administration Program in FY2014, including funding for additional staff to support public affairs, budget and finance, human resources, information technology, and privacy compliance. The Office of Infrastructure Protection and the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications are supported by the Infrastructure Protection and Information Security Program (IPIS) with a FY2014 request of $1,202 million. The IPIS program includes activities related to infrastructure protection, cybersecurity, and communications, with programmatic increases for continuous monitoring of agency networks, intrusion prevention, and information sharing. The largest reduction was $8 million for incident planning and exercises, which were absorbed into other functions. The House-passed bill reduced funding for incident planning and exercises, reallocating resources to other projects. Additionally, the bill decreased funding for the National Initiative in Cybersecurity Education by $5 million. Despite acknowledging the need for additional resources for NPPD administrative support, the bill did not provide extra funds due to shortfalls in other areas of the budget request. The bill allocated $1,177 million for the IPIS program, slightly below the request, and funded Infrastructure Protection at $260 million, just under the requested amount. Infrastructure Analysis and Planning received additional funds above the requested levels. The House bill reduced funding for incident planning and exercises, reallocating resources. It also cut funding for the National Initiative in Cybersecurity Education by $5 million. The bill allocated $916 million for cybersecurity and communications, $25 million below the request, with most of the reduction coming from Network Security Deployment. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $60 million for Management and Administration, $5 million less than requested but $9 million more than in the House-passed bill. The House bill reduced funding for incident planning and exercises, reallocating resources. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increased funding for various programs within the Directorate, including $1,209 million for the IPIS Program and additional funds for Infrastructure Analysis and Planning, Sector Management and Governance, and the Office of Bombing Prevention. They also recommended $86 million for Infrastructure Security Compliance activities. The committee recommended $86 million for Infrastructure Security Compliance activities, $936 million for cybersecurity and communications activities with reductions to Network Security Deployment, and additional funding for Global Cybersecurity Management and cybersecurity education. They also recommended $38 million for the Office of Emergency Communications and allocated $56 million for Management and Administration, and $1,187 million for the IPIS Program. The act provided $56 million for Management and Administration and $1,187 million for the IPIS program, representing a compromise between the House and Senate Appropriations Committee's recommendations for Infrastructure Protection. It allocated $5 million less for Infrastructure Security Compliance than requested and required NPPD to report on improving facility review processes, complying with Inspector General's recommendations, and implementing programs semiannually. Additionally, it directed a critical review of the Ammonium Nitrate Security Program and increased funding for Infrastructure Analysis and Planning by $5 million. The funding for Infrastructure Analysis and Planning was increased by $5 million, with a portion directed at ensuring data accessibility for rapid analysis. The explanatory statement specified allocations for the Office of Bombing Prevention and the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center. A compromise was reached on funds for Cybersecurity and Communications, supporting Network Security Deployment and Global Security Management. The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards program aims to ensure security compliance. The Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards program, aimed at ensuring security compliance for high-risk chemical facilities in the US, remains a congressional concern. An internal review in 2011 identified issues with security plan approvals and facility inspections. A 2013 GAO study noted improvements in the review process but highlighted weaknesses in DHS risk assessment methods. GAO estimated reviews could still take over 10 years. The program was criticized for non-compliance with federal internal controls and inappropriate use of overtime. Congress is also interested in the NPPD's Personnel Surety Program for chemical facilities. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees provided funding for the CFATS program, with a slight decrease from the requested amount. Cybersecurity issues, including federal funding for critical infrastructure networks, remain a significant interest in Congress. There is renewed interest in revisiting comprehensive cybersecurity legislation in the 113th Congress. In revisiting federal cybersecurity funding, the House and Senate appropriations committees differed on funding for the IPIS program. The House recommended a reduction in Network Security Deployment, while the Senate recommended additional funds for cybersecurity education. The explanatory statement adopted a compromise, following the House's recommendations on Network Security Deployment and the Senate's recommendation on Global Security Management for cybersecurity education activities. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 required the development of an automated entry-exit system to track alien arrivals and departures in the United States. The system, known as the U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) Program, has undergone organizational changes within the DHS since its inception in 2003. Despite revisions and expansions, the system has never been fully implemented. The US-VISIT Program underwent organizational changes within DHS, including being transferred to different offices such as the Screening Coordination Office and the National Protection and Programs Directorate. In FY2013, there was a proposal to divide US-VISIT's work between CBP and ICE, but it was replaced by the Office of Biometric Identity Management in FY2013. The FY2014 Budget Request suggested transferring the entry-exit program to CBP and ICE. The House and Senate proposed different funding amounts for OBIM, with the House recommending $232 million and the Senate recommending $206 million. Both chambers suggested transferring funds from US-VISIT/OBIM to CBP and ICE for data collection and overstay analysis. The Senate Appropriations Committee report proposed transferring responsibility for the Arrival Departure Information System (ADIS) from OBIM to CBP, with $227 million allocated for OBIM in P.L. 113-76. Some Members of Congress expressed frustration over delays in implementing the entry-exit system. An amendment in H.R. 2217 aimed to withhold DHS management funds until the biometric entry-exit data system was fully implemented, but it was not included in the final legislation. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) under DHS's National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) is responsible for securing federally owned and leased buildings, personnel, and property. FPS focuses on security and law enforcement activities to mitigate criminal and terrorist threats, including risk assessments, countermeasures like barriers and cameras, law enforcement response, and safety education programs. FPS also supports other federal agencies with security, such as assisting the U.S. Secret Service at National Special Security Events. Currently, FPS has around 1,007 law enforcement personnel. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) employs approximately 1,007 law enforcement officers, investigators, and administrative personnel, along with 13,000 contract security guards. The President's FY2014 budget request included 1,371 FTEs and $1,302 million for FPS, funded by security fees charged to GSA building tenants. House-passed H.R. 2217 for FY2014 supported the Administration's request without additional direction. The Senate report for FY2014 did not propose changes to the FPS budget but allocated $1,302 million for FPS. It criticized DHS's Interim Strategic Human Capital plan for not assessing resource needs based on risk. The Senate directed FPS to provide a plan and GAO to review its workforce size compared to other agencies. FPS was encouraged to improve operations, performance, and cost linking for budgeting purposes. Congress specified that security fees should be credited to the account. The revenues and collections of security fees credited to this account shall be available until expended for necessary expenses related to the protection of federally owned and leased buildings for the operations of the Federal Protective Service. Congress required in law that the DHS Secretary and OMB Director certify in writing that FPS operations will be fully funded and that FPS is to maintain not fewer than 1,371 FTEs. Congress also mandated that the FPS Director submit a strategic human capital plan aligning fee collections with personnel requirements based on a current threat assessment with the President's FY2015 budget request. Congress continues to express concern over certain aspects of the FPS mission and how FPS is funded, including improving training of contract guards, federalizing contract guards, and developing standards for checkpoint detection technologies for explosives and other dangerous items. The Federal Protective Service Improvement and Accountability Act of 2013 (H.R. 735) aims to set staffing levels in the FPS inspector force and expand the use of federal employees instead of contract guards. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) oversees programs like BioWatch and the National Biosurveillance Integration Center, as well as occupational health and safety programs. OHA also coordinates DHS programs with a public health or medical component and received $132 million in FY2013 appropriations. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) received $132 million in FY2013 appropriations and requested the same amount for FY2014. A crediting mechanism in the budget control laws eliminated the impact of sequestration for OHA due to reductions in FY2013 appropriations. The proposed allocation for FY2014 included $91 million for the BioWatch program, $8 million for NBIC, $1 million for the Chemical Defense Program, $5 million for Planning and Coordination, and $27 million for Salaries and Expenses. House-passed H.R. 2217 would have provided $123 million for OHA for FY2014, $8 million less than requested, with $80 million allocated for the BioWatch program. The proposed allocation for OHA in FY2014 included $80 million for the BioWatch program, $13 million for NBIC, $1 million for the Chemical Defense Program, $5 million for Planning and Coordination, and $25 million for Salaries and Expenses. Senate-reported H.R. 2217 would have provided $128 million for OHA, with $88 million for the BioWatch program. The Senate-reported BioWatch funding level for the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014, provided $127 million for OHA for FY2014, with allocations for various programs including BioWatch, NBIC, Chemical Defense Program, Planning and Coordination, and Salaries and Expenses. The BioWatch program, which accounts for a significant portion of OHA's budget, has faced challenges in developing more advanced sensors to detect airborne pathogens quickly. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce is investigating Gen-3 development and procurement, while OHA has paused Gen-3 activities for an Analysis of Alternatives. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended sustaining current BioWatch services for FY2014, focusing on Generations 1 and 2. The committee directed OHA to use unobligated funds for developing autonomous biodetection technology instead of waiting for Gen-3 procurement activities to resume. The Senate Committee on Appropriations urged OHA to complete the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) and conduct a separate assessment of current BioWatch capability. FEMA is responsible for leading and supporting the BioWatch program. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) leads the nation's emergency management system to reduce loss of life and property from natural disasters, accidents, and terrorism. FEMA provides assistance through programs like the Disaster Relief Fund and supports state and local governments with programs such as State and Local Programs and Assistance to Firefighters Grants. The Administration requested a total discretionary appropriation of $3,984 million for FEMA for FY2014, with an additional $5,626 million for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). House-passed H.R. 2217 would have provided $4,345 million for FEMA, including $32 million in floor amendments. The House floor amendments increased FEMA appropriations for various programs by $32 million, with additional funding for the U.S. Fire Administration, Firefighter Assistance Grants, Urban Search and Rescue Response System, National Predisaster Mitigation Fund, and State Homeland Security Grant Program. The total discretionary appropriation for FEMA in FY2014 was $4,354 million, an increase of $368 million (9.2%) from the President's request. State and local governments face fiscal challenges that may lead to reduced resources for public safety and homeland security preparedness. This could impact national preparedness levels as they fund a significant portion of public safety expenditures. Prior to 9/11, only three federal grant programs were available for state and local governments to address homeland security. Several homeland security grant programs have been added to ensure state and local preparedness, including the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP), Citizen Corps Program (CCP), Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), Driver's License Security Grants Program (REAL ID), Operation Stonegarden grant program (Stonegarden), Regional Catastrophic Preparedness Grant Program (RCPG), Public Transportation Security Assistance and Rail Security Assistance grant program (Transit Security Grants), Port Security Grants (Port Security), Over-the-Road Bus Security Assistance (Over-the-Road), and Buffer Zone Protection Program (BZPP). The federal government provides assistance to state and local governments for various homeland security grant programs, but this funding only makes up a small portion of the total public safety expenditures. The President requested $2,123 million in federal grants for state and local government homeland security preparedness for FY2014, which is just over 1% of state and local government public safety expenditures. The Administration proposed changes to FEMA's grant and training programs, including new accounts for National Preparedness Grant program and First Responder Assistance Programs. Congress generally funds EMPG, Fire Grants, and SAFER Act Grants outside State and Local Programs, with funds also covering administrative costs. The FY2014 budget proposed $2,123 million for State and Local Programs. The Administration proposed changes to FEMA's grant and training programs, including a new National Preparedness Grant program and First Responder Assistance Program. However, both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees rejected the reorganization in FY2014 due to lack of congressional authorization and necessary implementation details. The Senate-reported bill included provisions to refine the proposal and prohibit grant reform until congressional action. The House Appropriations Committee recommended funding for State and Local Programs, with allocations for various grant-making activities. Amendments during House floor action set funding levels for specific grant programs. The House-passed bill increased funding for the State Homeland Security Grant Program by $10 million, totaling $1,510 million for State and Local Programs. After set-asides, $1,070 million was left for allocation among various grant-making activities at the discretion of the DHS Secretary based on threat, vulnerability, and consequence. The Senate-reported bill allocated $1.5 billion for State and Local Programs, with specific amounts earmarked for various grant programs such as SHSGP, UASI, Public Transportation Security, Railroad Security, Port Security, and education/training. Division F of P.L. 113-76 also provided $1.5 billion for State and Local Programs. Division F of P.L. 113-76 allocated $1.5 billion for State and Local Programs, with specific amounts earmarked for SHSGP, UASI, Public Transportation Security, Railroad Security, Port Security, and education/training. The grants included provisions for administration caps and FEMA Administrator authority for property acquisition. The Administration's FY2014 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance, including $335 million for AFG and $335 million for SAFER. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $675 million for firefighter assistance, denying the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER into the State and Local Programs account. The House-passed bill recommended $680 million for firefighter assistance, with $340 million each for AFG and SAFER. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $675 million for firefighter assistance, with $337.5 million each for AFG and SAFER. Both chambers denied the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER into the State and Local Programs account. The House-passed bill and the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding for firefighter assistance at $680 million and $675 million respectively, with $340 million each for AFG and SAFER. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is the main account used to fund various emergency and disaster assistance programs. The Administration's FY2014 budget proposed $6,221 million for the DRF. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) funding request for FY2014 includes $595 million for non-catastrophic events and $5,626 million for major disasters under the Stafford Act. This structure reflects the impact of the Budget Control Act, allowing costs incurred by major disasters to be paid through an \"allowable adjustment.\" The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) funding request for FY2014 includes $595 million for non-catastrophic events and $5,626 million for major disasters under the Stafford Act. This structure allows costs incurred by major disasters to be paid through an \"allowable adjustment\" to discretionary spending caps, rather than counting against the discretionary spending allocation for the bill. The DRF is typically funded yearly through regular appropriations, but relying solely on the annual DHS appropriations bill would deplete the fund most years due to high demand. Between 2005 and 2011, the average regular appropriation for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) was $1,749 million. The average monthly expenditures were $383 million, totaling $4,596 million annually. Congress provided additional budget authority for the DRF through supplemental and continuing appropriations nine times from FY2005 to FY2010 to prevent depletion. The Budget Control Act (BCA) included provisions for an \"allowable adjustment\" for disaster relief to the discretionary spending caps. The Budget Control Act included provisions for an \"allowable adjustment\" for disaster relief to the discretionary spending caps, which could prevent sequestration due to federal spending over the allocation. The Disaster Relief Fund receives funding from various federal accounts, not just FEMA, and the allowable adjustment calculated by OMB may have led to higher appropriations for the DRF since the BCA was enacted. Higher appropriations for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) since the Budget Control Act (BCA) was enacted may have allowed for more time for Congress to debate disaster needs and target assistance more efficiently during large-scale disasters. The FY2013 DRF request was significantly larger than previous years, and when Hurricane Sandy hit in 2012, the DRF had enough funds to meet immediate needs. This shift in funding may reduce the pressure to quickly pass supplemental appropriations during disasters. The Administration proposed eliminating the PDM program, citing duplication with the HMGP program. PDM awards grants for hazard mitigation projects prior to disasters, unlike NFIP programs which only address flood hazards. The program had $174 million in unobligated balances to continue grants for several years. The PDM program was proposed to be phased out, but the House and Senate bills did not include language to end it. The House increased funding to $30 million, while the Senate allocated $25 million. The program was noted as crucial for funding mitigation planning and projects. Despite the House's attempt to increase funding for FY2014, the enacted level remained at $25 million. This funding level presented challenges for the program's administration, such as difficulty in funding state minimum awards and reduced award amounts. FEMA may use existing, unfunded applications for the EFS program due to challenges in funding state minimum awards and reduced award amounts. The program's funding has been proposed to be reduced to $100 million in FY2014, but was ultimately funded at $120 million. The EFS program faced reduced funding levels in FY2013, with concerns over delayed distribution of funds. Funding announcements for FY2013 awards were not made until FY2014. Title IV of the DHS appropriations bill includes appropriations for USCIS, FLETC, S&T, and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, with a requested amount of $2,214 million for FY2014. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills for FY2014 allocated $1,890 million and $1,885 million, respectively, for USCIS, which is 14.7% and 15.0% below the requested $2,214 million. Division F of P.L. 113-76 provided $1,878 million for USCIS, 15.2% below the requested level. USCIS focuses on adjudicating immigration and naturalization petitions. USCIS is responsible for processing work authorizations, travel documents, naturalization petitions, refugee and asylum claims, and citizenship benefits. The agency primarily funds its operations through fee revenues. Annual appropriations from the Treasury have been used for specific projects like reducing processing backlogs and the E-Verify program. The Administration requested $124 million in appropriations for USCIS, with a focus on the E-Verify program and Immigrant Integration. The Administration requested $124 million in appropriations for USCIS, including $114 million for the E-Verify program and $10 million for the Immigrant Integration Initiative. The total projected new gross budget authority for USCIS would be $3,219 million, with funding allocated for adjudication services, asylum operations, digital conversion of immigrant records, information and customer services, Administration expenses, and the SAVE program. The House-passed H.R. 2217 would have provided $114 million in appropriations for USCIS, $10 million less than requested. Under the House-passed bill, USCIS would have received $3,209 million in new gross budget authority for FY2014. Appropriated funds would only be provided for the E-Verify Program, with language allowing USCIS to use up to $10 million in user fees for immigrant integration grants. The bill also included provisions requiring criminal background checks before granting immigration benefits and restrictions on the use of funds for immigrant integration grants. The Senate-reported bill for USCIS in FY2014 included $119 million in appropriations, with an additional $5 million for Immigrant Integration Grants. USCIS would have had a total gross budget authority of $3,219 million, including projected fee collections. The Senate committee specified that funds could only be used for immigration benefits after background checks. In FY2014, USCIS received $114 million in appropriations from Division F of P.L. 113-76 for the E-Verify Program, slightly less than requested. The total gross budget authority for USCIS was $3,217 million, including projected fee collections. The Senate committee specified funds could only be used for immigration benefits after background checks. The $114 million appropriation was solely for the E-Verify Program, with $7.5 million available for immigrant integration grants. The grants are for individuals lawfully admitted into the US for permanent residence. None of the funds can be used to administer the program. The appropriations also included provisions for background checks. The FY2014 budget cycle raised concerns about E-Verify operability. In the budget cycle, potential issues for Congress included concerns about E-Verify operability, fee-generated funding, immigrant integration grants, USCIS efforts to convert to an online system, naturalization, and fraud prevention. Congress is worried about E-Verify's accuracy and directed USCIS to develop a review process for final non-confirmations. The House bill proposed extending E-Verify authorization for one year. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed USCIS to improve E-Verify accuracy and performance, create mobile applications for small employers, and provide incentives for using the system. The committee also expressed concerns about challenges in implementing E-Verify. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed USCIS to improve E-Verify accuracy and performance, create mobile applications for small employers, and provide incentives for using the system. USCIS was also directed to report to Senate Committees on progress in implementing E-Verify in the agricultural industry and consult with the Small Business Administration to encourage E-Verify usage. Additionally, USCIS must monitor fee revenues to avoid backlogs. The House committee directed USCIS to monitor fee revenues and obligations, provide quarterly briefings, and brief Congress on an updated fee schedule. They emphasized maintaining affordable naturalization application fees. The Senate report did not provide further direction on this issue. The explanatory statement directed USCIS to brief the committees semiannually on fee revenues and obligations. The House report acknowledged the work of the Office of Fraud Detection and National Security (FDNS) in combating immigration benefit fraud. It expressed concern about limited resources for FDNS and urged USCIS to allocate more resources. USCIS was directed to brief committees semiannually on final non-confirmations. USCIS launched the electronic immigration application system, ELIS, to modernize the paper-based process. Under ELIS, USCIS customers can now apply online to extend or change their nonimmigrant status for certain visa types. This system allows USCIS officers to review and adjudicate filings online, improving efficiency and enhancing fraud detection and national security measures. The House report emphasized the importance of USCIS transformation and directed USCIS to provide quarterly updates on ELIS. Congress also directed USCIS to brief committees semiannually on the transformation progress. The House report expressed concerns about the accuracy of the SAVE system, a web-based tool for verifying immigration status of benefit applicants. DHS's Office of Inspector General was tasked to review the program's effectiveness. USCIS was directed to provide updates on the program's response to OIG recommendations by October 31, 2013. The Senate report did not provide further direction on this issue. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) provides training to federal, state, local, and international law enforcement agencies. It aims to promote consistency and collaboration among partner organizations. FLETC has four training sites across the US, employs 1,100 personnel, and has a proposed budget of $271 million, with the majority allocated to Salaries and Expenses. The House-passed H.R. 2217 proposed $259 million for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), with a $13 million reduction from the request. This reduction was due to anticipated efficiencies and the denial of transferring the National Computer Forensics Institute (NCFI) to FLETC. The appropriation included $4.5 million for active shooter threat training programs and funding to train 1,600 new CBP officers. The Senate-reported H.R. 2217 also allocated $259 million for FLETC, with funding for active shooter threat training programs. The Senate report included $4.5 million in funding for expanding active shooter threat training programs. It also mentioned funding to phase-in $1,850 new CBP officers, different from the 1,600 officers in the House report. Both the House and Senate allocated $259 million for FLETC in the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014. The Senate-passed comprehensive immigration reform calls for 19,200 additional Border Patrol agents, which would require an increase in FLETC's budget for operations. The Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) is the primary DHS organization for research and development (R&D), with a requested budget of $1.527 billion for FY2014, an 82% increase from FY2013. This increase is mainly for the construction of the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) to replace the Plum Island Animal Disease Center. The FY2014 budget request for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) was sufficient to fully fund construction, with an estimated total cost of $1.230 billion. Funding for University Programs saw a decrease in FY2014, reflecting reductions in university centers of excellence and the elimination of scholarships and fellowships for STEM education. The House bill proposed $1.225 billion for Science and Technology, including $404 million for NBAF construction. The House bill proposed $1.225 billion for Science and Technology, including $404 million for NBAF construction. The committee report explained the need to fully leverage funding contributions by the State of Kansas for the federal matching funds required. The $40 million provided for University Programs would support an increase for university centers of excellence. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $1.218 billion for S&T, with $404 million for NBAF construction. The recommendation of $33 million for University Programs recognizes the requested reduction resulting from the consolidation of the Scholars. The enacted appropriation for Science and Technology was $1.220 billion, including funding for NBAF and University Programs. No funds were provided for S&T scholarships and fellowships program. DHS will collaborate with NSF for STEM education activities alignment. GAO reported that S&T Directorate, Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, and Coast Guard report R&D activities to OMB. The GAO report highlighted that DHS lacks department-wide policies for defining and reporting R&D activities, leading to a lack of knowledge on total R&D investments. Recommendations were made for DHS to develop policies, guidance, and a tracking mechanism for R&D projects. In response, the Secretary of Homeland Security was directed to establish a review process for all R&D work within DHS. The House-passed bill directed DHS to submit a report on reforms to its R&D programs, including setting priorities, involving DHS-wide in decision-making, and implementing GAO's recommendations. The Senate report directed DHS to implement policies for defining and overseeing R&D, and to continue R&D portfolio reviews to improve coordination within DHS. The joint explanatory statement emphasized compliance with House and Senate reports on R&D prioritization. DHS will comply with House and Senate reports on R&D prioritization and review, brief appropriations committees on future portfolio reviews, and implement policies for defining and overseeing department-wide R&D. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office manages nuclear detection research, development, testing, and acquisition. DNDO funding breakdown is in Table 21, with a requested $291 million for FY2014. Funding for Systems Architecture and Systems Development would decrease, while Transformational R&D and Assessments would increase in the Research, Development, and Operations account. The DHS budget justification for Human Portable Radiation Detection Systems (HPRDS) described a $14 million request as an increase from previous years. The House and Senate bills differed in the amounts they would provide for DNDO's various programs. The enacted appropriation for DNDO was $285 million, $4 million less than the Administration's request for Transformational R&D. Title V of the DHS appropriations bill contains general provisions that may include additional appropriations, rescissions, limitations on fund use, or permanent legislative language. This section of the report focuses on new general provisions impacting the budget scoring of the bill. The Administration proposed changes to general provisions in the FY2014 appropriations bill, including dropping 36 provisions, adding 10, and modifying 10. One significant change was in Section 503, allowing for fund transfers within DHS for faster response to emergencies. The Administration proposed changes to general provisions in the FY2014 appropriations bill to expedite response to emergencies. House-passed H.R. 2217 included rescissions in Title V, reducing the net scoring of the bill. $34 million would have been appropriated for DHS's data center consolidation effort under this title. Additionally, fee revenues of $50 million from Section 563 of P.L. 113-6 further reduced the score of the bill. The House Appropriations Committee did not add requested general provisions to the FY2014 DHS appropriations bill, except for a rescission provision. They rejected expanding reprogramming authority and added 19 new general provisions during floor action, totaling 84. These new provisions included restrictions on funds for specific activities like carrying sharp objects, buying foreign-made American flags, and contracting with firms with past criminal convictions. Individuals convicted of crimes such as fraud or tax evasion in the past three years, indicted for similar offenses, or delinquent on taxes; Operating armed drones; Violating immigration laws; Restricting government officials from sharing immigration status information; Limiting the use of federal air marshals on international flights; Enforcing premium increases for flood insurance; Contracting for ammunition purchases. The curr_chunk discusses various actions related to government contracting, enforcement of laws, and policy memos issued by ICE director. It includes topics such as purchasing ammunition, enforcing energy regulations, conducting preclearance operations, implementing an entry-exit visa system, and enforcing immigration enforcement priorities. The curr_chunk discusses amendments adopted in a bill related to civil immigration enforcement priorities and funding restrictions. It also mentions specific allocations for DHS data center and headquarters consolidation efforts, as well as legislative language allowing DHS to use fee revenues collected under the Colombia Free Trade Act. The DHS will use fee revenues from the Colombia Free Trade Act, adding $110 million to the legislation's cost. The Senate Appropriations Committee agreed with the Administration to drop a provision regarding the appointment of a \"Principal Federal Official\" for disaster response coordination. The Senate-reported bill included provisions for funding CBP services through reimbursable fee agreements and receiving donations for land ports of entry construction. Division F of P.L. 113-76 included $693 million in rescissions and funding for USCIS immigrant integration grants, data center migration, DHS headquarters consolidation, and financial systems modernization. Division F of P.L. 113-76 included legislative language on CBP fees, with 77 general provisions. Seven provisions from the FY2013 Homeland Security Appropriations Act were dropped, and 10 new ones were added. The division also included a provision for coordinating disaster response and modified authority for reimbursable fee agreements and donations. The requested expansion of reprogramming authority was not included. Federal government spending involves a multi-step process starting with budget authority enactment by Congress. Agencies then use the budget authority to pay for activities, with payments reflected as outlays. Budget authority is determined by appropriations acts or direct spending legislation and must not exceed the amount enacted by Congress. It can be indefinite or available on a one-year, multi-year, or no-year basis. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments. One-year budget authority is only available for obligation during a specific fiscal year, while multi-year and no-year budget authority specify different timeframes for spending. Obligations are incurred when agencies engage in transactions, while outlays represent actual funds spent during the fiscal year. Budget authority may be obligated in one fiscal year but spent in a future year, leading to discrepancies between budget authority and outlays. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. It consists of discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary spending appropriated yearly by Congress and mandatory spending provided in laws other than appropriation acts. Within DHS, the Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offsetting collections are funds collected by the federal government as part of business-type transactions, not counted as revenue but as negative outlays. DHS net discretionary budget authority consists of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset it. Some collections offset discretionary budget authority, while others offset mandatory spending. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. These entitlements are funded by permanent or annual appropriations, as well as Trust and Public Enterprise Funds that are not appropriated by Congress. The President's budget includes gross budget authority calculations, determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget, which are then allocated among appropriations committees as 302(a) allocations. These allocations include discretionary funds for annual appropriations bills, which are further allocated among subcommittees by the appropriations committees. The 302(b) allocations are discretionary funds distributed among subcommittees for appropriations bills. These allocations must not exceed the 302(a) discretionary allocation to enforce budget discipline. The Budget Control Act set spending caps for FY2012-FY2021, affecting the FY2012 appropriations bills. Adjustments to 302(b) allocations can be made as bills progress towards enactment. The Budget Control Act sets spending caps for defense and non-defense discretionary spending, including funding for international affairs programs, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and the Intelligence Community Management Account. The Act allows for adjustments to cover overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and healthcare fraud and abuse control. The House and Senate reach a budget resolution agreement on 302(a) allocations. House uses H.Con.Res. 25 for 302(b) allocations, while Senate uses BCA allocations. DHS's initial 302(b) allocations for FY2014 are compared to FY2013 and President's request. Adjustments to caps under BCA include disaster relief, emergency spending, and overseas contingency operations. The allowable adjustment for disaster relief under the BCA is determined by OMB using a formula. For FY2014, the upper limit for disaster relief adjustment was set at $12,143 million. The Administration requested $5,785 million in disaster relief through DHS and SBA subject to the cap adjustment. P.L. 113-76 included $5,626 million in appropriations through DHS to be paid for by the allowable adjustment. Unlike FY2013, there was no carryover of unused disaster relief adjustment. In FY2013, there was no carryover of unused disaster relief adjustment to be carried forward into FY2014. Since 9/11, there has been increasing interest in homeland security funding levels. The Office of Management and Budget publishes an annual report to Congress on combating terrorism, including homeland security analysis. Table B-1 allows year-to-year comparisons, but distinctions between homeland and non-homeland security activities have become more precise. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding for FY2012 accounted for over 51% of total federal funding for homeland security, with the Department of Defense following at nearly 26%. The top five agencies in spending on homeland security collectively accounted for approximately 93% of all federal spending in this area. It is important to note that not all DHS funding is included in federal spending on homeland security efforts. The DHS funding for FY2012 accounted for 93% of federal spending on homeland security. Not all DHS funding is classified as homeland security-related. The total budget authority for DHS was $52.5 billion, with $35.1 billion allocated to homeland security activities. The budget amounts in Table B-1 may not align with total amounts in the report. The FY2014 budget request did not include estimates for FY2013 due to sequestration impact. No authoritative data for FY2013 are available as of March 1, 2014."
