The exchanges authorized by this Act shall be conducted without cost to the Navajo Nation and the Goshute Indian Tribe. The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to accept state lands within the National Forest System on behalf of the United States. Lands acquired under this section will become part of the national forest and be subject to all applicable laws and regulations. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to accept school and institutional trust lands owned by Utah within the National Park System. These lands will become part of the National Park System and be subject to its laws and regulations. Compensation will be provided for a specific acreage as part of the exchange process. The State of Utah conveyed 580.64 acres to the United States in 1971 within Capitol Reef National Park without compensation. The fair market value of these lands will be determined according to the Act. SEC. 7. OFFER TO STATE. The Secretary of the Interior will provide a list of specific Federal lands in Utah for transfer to the State in exchange for State lands. This includes the Blue Mountain Telecommunications Site, Beaver Mountain Ski Resort Site, unleased coal in Winter Quarters and Crandall Canyon tracts, and all royalties receivable by the United States. The Secretary of the Interior will offer specific Federal lands in Utah to the State in exchange for State lands, including royalties from coal leases in various tracts and a portion of royalties from Federal geothermal, oil, gas, or mineral interests. The offer will not exceed 50% of the total appraised value of the State lands described. The Secretary will offer Federal lands in Utah to the State in exchange for State lands, with a cap on royalties not exceeding $12,500,000 annually. If the total value offered is less than the State lands' value, the Secretary will provide a list of public lands suitable for disposal by exchange. SEC. 8. APPRAISAL OF LANDS TO BE EXCHANGED. All exchanges authorized under this Act must be for equal value. Within ninety days of enactment, appraisals of lands involved in the exchanges must be conducted by the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Governor of Utah. If final terms of exchanges are not agreed upon within two years, the United States District Court for the District of Utah, Central Division, will resolve disputes. The United States District Court for the District of Utah, Central Division, has jurisdiction to determine the value of lands involved in exchanges. Any legal action related to this must be filed within two to five years of the Act's enactment. If the State shares revenue from Federal properties, the value will be adjusted accordingly. Royalty offers by the Secretary will be adjusted for net present value. The State is entitled to receive interest at a reasonable rate on the value owed by the United States until full payment is made and mineral rights revert back to the United States. SEC. 9. TRANSFER OF TITLE. The State of Utah is entitled to receive lands or interests in lands and additional royalties from the Secretary of the Interior. Fee simple title will be conveyed to the State for some properties, while for others, less than fee simple will be conveyed with the United States retaining remaining rights. Mineral rights described in section 7 will also be conveyed to the State. The State of Utah will convey school and institutional trust lands to the United States if they accept the offers in the Act. The conveyance must happen within sixty days after agreement between the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor of Utah, or through a court order. Both parties will inspect records and physically inspect the lands to be exchanged. The Act requires a physical inspection for hazardous materials on lands to be exchanged, with costs of remedial action borne by responsible entities. The Act also satisfies provisions for land exchanges in the public interest and subjects mineral interests to applicable laws and regulations. The Act requires compliance with laws, rules, and regulations for development in national forests. SEC. 10. LEGAL DESCRIPTIONS. After enactment, maps and legal descriptions of lands added to Navajo and Goshute Indian Reservations, and exchanged lands, must be filed with relevant committees. These documents will have the same legal effect as the Act, with the ability for clerical corrections. Maps and descriptions will be available for public inspection in specified offices. Section 6902(b) of title 31, United States Code, is related to a pilot program. Section 6902(b) of title 31, United States Code, is amended regarding a pilot program for land acquisition in Utah. The intent is for the State to establish offers related to specific lands and interests described in the Act, without precluding other land exchanges under existing laws or future Acts of Congress. The State of Utah should establish a funding mechanism to ensure equitable treatment of counties in land exchanges. The United States and Utah will each bear their own costs for implementing the Act. \"School and institutional trust lands\" refer to properties granted to Utah for the benefit of the public school system or designated institutions. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out this Act."
