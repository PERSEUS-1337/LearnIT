    "content": "The international security environment has shifted from the post-Cold War era to renewed great power competition with China and Russia. Congress must decide how U.S. defense funding and strategy should adapt to this new situation, which could have significant implications for defense capabilities and funding requirements. The Cold War era was a period of intense competition between the United States and the Soviet Union across multiple regions. Future reports may explore how a shift in the international security environment could impact areas such as foreign policy, trade, energy, and foreign assistance. Another report discusses the ongoing debate on the future U.S. role in the world and its implications for defense and other policy areas. The post-Cold War era began in the late 1980s and early 1990s after key events marked the end of the Cold War. It led to a unipolar situation with the United States as the world's sole superpower. The post-Cold War era saw the United States emerge as the world's sole superpower, with reduced competition among major states. Following 9/11, there was a focus on countering transnational terrorist organizations. Recent events, such as Chinese actions in the South and East China Seas and Russia's annexation of Crimea, have shifted the international security environment. The international security environment has shifted from the post-Cold War era to a new situation with renewed great power competition involving the United States, China, and Russia. Observers see this as a situation characterized by ideological competition and challenges to the U.S.-led international order. The current shift in the international security environment involves renewed ideological competition against authoritarianism and illiberal democracy in Russia, China, and other countries. This includes the promotion of nationalistic historical narratives by China and Russia, as well as the use of aggressive military and cyber operations. Challenges to the U.S.-led international order are also being posed by Russia and China. The current international security environment involves principles of order, freedom of the seas, regional security challenges from countries like Iran and North Korea, countering terrorist organizations, weak or failed states, and potential intervention by major powers. The Obama Administration's June 2015 National Military Strategy acknowledged a shift to a new international security environment, with the Trump Administration's December 2017 National Security Strategy and January 2018 National Defense Strategy focusing on great power competition with China and Russia. This new strategy, known as a \"2+3\" strategy, prioritizes countering the military capabilities of China and Russia, as well as addressing challenges from North Korea, Iran, and terrorist groups. The December 2017 NSS highlights America's complacency after the Cold War, allowing China and Russia to challenge American power and interests. These countries aim to control information, grow their militaries, and expand their influence, posing a threat to American security and prosperity. The dictatorships of North Korea and Iran, along with transnational threat groups, are actively trying to harm Americans and destabilize regions. The United States needs to rethink past policies that engaged rivals and included them in international institutions. The main challengers include China, Russia, Iran, and transnational threat groups. The revisionist powers of China and Russia, along with rogue states like Iran and North Korea, are actively competing against the United States and its allies. These rivals engage in political, economic, and military contests to shift regional power balances in their favor. China aims to displace the US in the Indo-Pacific region, while Russia seeks to restore its great power status. Both countries want to shape a world contrary to US values and interests. The United States must develop new concepts and capabilities to protect its interests amidst geopolitical contests with China and Russia. The country faces simultaneous threats across multiple arenas, accelerated by technology. Strategic complacency since the 1990s has led to a need for new approaches to preserve peace and advance prosperity. The United States faces challenges from China and Russia as they assert their influence globally and regionally, contesting America's geopolitical advantages and attempting to change the international order in their favor. This shift comes after a period of strategic complacency, where the US believed in its military superiority and the inevitability of democratic peace. The country now recognizes the erosion of its competitive military advantage and the need for new concepts and capabilities to protect its interests. The US faces challenges from China and Russia in a period of strategic atrophy, with a decline in the rules-based international order. Inter-state strategic competition is now the primary concern in national security, with China using predatory economics and militarizing the South China Sea, Russia violating borders, North Korea's outlaw actions, and Iran sowing violence in the Middle East. Despite ISIS's defeat, stability threats persist. Despite the defeat of ISIS, threats to stability persist as terrorist groups continue to pose a danger. The main challenge to US prosperity and security is the strategic competition from revisionist powers like China and Russia, who aim to shape the world according to their authoritarian model. The international order established after WWII is resilient but weakening, with China and Russia undermining it from within by exploiting its benefits while disregarding its principles. Rogue regimes such as North Korea and Iran further destabilize regions through their pursuit of nuclear weapons. The global security environment is shifting with challenges to the US military advantage and every domain being contested. Rapid technological advancements and non-state actors like terrorists and cyber hackers are also impacting the security landscape. The global security environment is evolving with increased capabilities for mass disruption. Partners in security now include multilateral organizations, NGOs, corporations, and strategic influencers. Terrorism persists due to ideology and unstable structures, despite ISIS's defeat. The homeland is no longer a sanctuary, with threats from terrorists, cyber attacks, and political subversion. Long-term strategic competitions with China and Russia are top priorities for increased investment. The Trump Administration emphasizes increased investment in countering threats from rogue regimes like North Korea and Iran, defeating terrorism, and stabilizing Iraq and Afghanistan. Additionally, there is a focus on the concept of a free and open Indo-Pacific (FOIP), extending from the west coast of the United States to the west coast of India. The discussion in the December 2017 NSS highlights the Indo-Pacific region as a key area of interest for the United States. The shift in the international security environment, highlighted by Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, has been gradual and cumulative, with China's economic growth and military modernization also playing a significant role. Observers trace the beginning of this shift back to the period of 2006-2008. Freedom House's 2018 report highlights a trend of declining freedom in countries since 2006. Russian President Putin's 2007 speech predicted a shift to a multipolar world order and a more assertive Russian foreign policy. In 2008, Russia invaded Georgia without a strong response from the US and its allies, coinciding with the financial crisis. China's perception of the United States as a declining power and its assertive actions in the South and East China Seas are believed to have started after the 2008 financial crisis and successful staging of the 2008 Summer Olympics. The international security environment is constantly evolving, with each era having unique actors, dimensions of competition, and available technologies. This new environment may share similarities with previous ones but also have distinct features not seen before. The new international security environment is characterized by features that are not seen in previous environments. Comparisons to earlier environments can be helpful in understanding it, but can also be limiting if applied too rigidly. Some observers liken it to a new Cold War, particularly in relation to U.S.-Russian or U.S.-Chinese tensions. The current international security environment features competition and tension with Russia and China. Unlike the Cold War, this situation includes China as a major competing power. The bipolarity of the Cold War with the U.S. and Russia was reinforced by alliances, while Russia and China today do not lead an equivalent of the Warsaw Pact. The focus on countering transnational terrorist groups post-9/11 is more significant now than during the Cold War. Some observers compare the current situation to the multipolar environment before World War I. China and Russia promote nationalistic historical narratives supporting revanchist or irredentist foreign policies. The current international security environment involves competition and tension with Russia and China, with a focus on countering transnational terrorist groups. Observers have identified similarities to past situations but note differences in available technologies. There is no consensus on a single term to describe this new situation, with some referring to it as an era of renewed great power competition or a competitive world order. The current international security environment involves competition and tension with Russia and China, focusing on countering transnational terrorist groups. Terms used to describe this situation include a new Cold War, multipolar era, tripolar era, and disorderly world. The shift from the Cold War to the post-Cold War era in the late 1980s and early 1990s prompted a reassessment of defense funding levels, strategy, and missions, leading to changes in DOD plans and programs, such as the 1993 Bottom-Up Review. The international security environment has shifted towards competition with Russia and China, leading to a debate on future U.S. defense spending levels. This shift has renewed emphasis on grand strategy and geopolitics in discussions about defense budgets. The resurgence of Russia and China has created a new period of great-power rivalry. The rise of China has led to a new period of great-power rivalry, emphasizing the need for a solid grand strategy according to U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work. He highlighted the importance of carefully managing limited resources and preventing the emergence of a regional hegemon in Eurasia to protect core U.S. interests. The U.S. aims to prevent the emergence of a regional hegemon in Eurasia to safeguard its core interests, utilizing military operations to support this goal. This includes maintaining a military structure capable of crossing vast distances and conducting large-scale operations. Russia and China's nuclear capabilities have led to increased focus on nuclear weapons and deterrence in U.S. defense discussions. The Department of Defense is planning to spend billions to modernize its strategic nuclear deterrent forces. The Department of Defense is planning to modernize U.S. strategic nuclear deterrent forces, including acquiring new ballistic missile submarines and a next-generation long-range bomber. There are concerns about the adequacy of U.S. and NATO military capabilities in Europe, particularly in defending the Baltic members of NATO against potential Russian aggression. DOD has announced specific actions to bolster military deterrence in Europe. The Department of Defense is planning to modernize U.S. strategic nuclear deterrent forces, including acquiring new ballistic missile submarines and a next-generation long-range bomber. Concerns exist about the adequacy of U.S. and NATO military capabilities in Europe, particularly in defending the Baltic members of NATO against potential Russian aggression. Specific actions have been announced to bolster military deterrence in Europe, focusing on high-end conventional warfare capabilities. The renewed U.S. emphasis on high-end warfare includes procurement programs for advanced aircraft, warships, ballistic missile defense, land-attack weapons, new weapon technologies, ISR capabilities, military space capabilities, electronic warfare, cyber capabilities, hypersonic weapons, robotics, quantum technology, and artificial intelligence. The U.S. is concerned about narrowing military edge due to improving capabilities in other countries, like China and Russia. To maintain superiority, DOD created the Strategic Capabilities Office in 2012. The Defense Innovation Initiative aims to enhance community and commercial systems with new roles and capabilities to outmatch potential adversaries. The Long-Range Research and Development Plan focuses on high-payoff technology investments to maintain U.S. military superiority within the next five years. The Third Offset Strategy seeks to establish a new U.S. military advantage. The DOD announced the \"third offset strategy\" in 2015 to maintain U.S. military superiority over numerically large and technologically advanced adversaries. This strategy emphasizes speed of development and deployment in defense acquisition policy, promoting experimentation, risk-taking, and tolerance of failure. Individual military services are working towards more rapid acquisition of new capabilities as part of this effort. The DOD's emphasis on speed in developing and deploying new weapons and military technologies is highlighted in the 2018 NDS. The Department aims to prioritize speed of delivery, continuous adaptation, and frequent upgrades to better integrate new technologies and adapt its way of fighting. This shift is necessary as current processes are not responsive to the needs of the warfighter, and the Department is over-optimized for exceptional performance at the expense of timely decisions and capabilities. The DOD seeks to streamline approval chains, avoid wasteful resource applications, and overcome risk-averse thinking to facilitate change. The DOD aims to shed outdated management practices and structures to deliver performance by integrating insights from business innovation. There is a growing interest in reducing dependency on Russian and Chinese military systems and components. Concerns over Chinese cyber activities and restrictions on exports have raised worries about using Chinese-made components and materials in U.S. military systems. The focus among policymakers is on countering Russia's hybrid warfare tactics and China's salami-slicing tactics in the South and East China Seas. Potential policy and oversight issues for Congress include assessing the effectiveness of the December 2017 NSS and January 2018 NDS in responding to the shift in the international security environment. The current focus is on countering Russia's hybrid warfare tactics and China's actions in the South and East China Seas. Key questions include the U.S. national security strategy, defense funding levels, and nuclear weapons modernization aligned with new security needs. The focus is on countering Russia's hybrid warfare tactics and China's actions in the South and East China Seas. Key questions include U.S. and NATO military capabilities in Europe, acquiring capabilities for high-end conventional warfare, and maintaining technological superiority in conventional warfare. Trade-offs need to be made in balancing these capabilities against other defense priorities. The focus is on countering Russia's hybrid warfare tactics and China's actions in the South and East China Seas. Key questions include U.S. and NATO military capabilities in Europe, acquiring capabilities for high-end conventional warfare, and maintaining technological superiority in conventional weapons. The discussion also involves adjusting defense acquisition policy to prioritize speed of development and deployment, experimentation, risk-taking, and greater tolerance of failure. New legislative authorities may be needed to achieve greater speed in defense acquisition.

The curr_chunk discusses the role of Congress in responding to changes in the international security environment, specifically the shift from the Cold War to the post-Cold War era in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This led to reassessments by the Department of Defense and Congress, resulting in changes in defense funding levels, strategy, and missions. The 1993 Bottom-Up Review (BUR) articulated many of these changes. The 1993 Bottom-Up Review (BUR) reshaped the U.S. military into a smaller force oriented towards conducting two major regional contingencies. Congress played a significant role in reassessing defense funding levels, strategy, and programs in response to the end of the Cold War. In the early 1990s, Congress focused on reassessing defense funding levels and strategy following the end of the Cold War. Senator John McCain and Representative Les Aspin were among the Members who proposed reductions in defense spending and detailed plans for future defense strategy. Representative Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, led a comprehensive effort to reassess U.S. defense. In early 1992, Aspin, with committee staff support, developed a new defense plan as an alternative to the \"Base Force\" proposed by the Bush Administration. Despite criticism, Aspin's effort in 1992 became significant when he later became Secretary of Defense in the Clinton Administration. Aspin's 1992 defense plan influenced his role as Secretary of Defense in the Clinton Administration, leading to the 1993 BUR and subsequent Defense Strategy Review process until 2016."
