The program aims to promote awareness of services available to veterans and use technology to support veteran entrepreneurship.

Grants under this program range from $75,000 to $250,000, with funding subject to appropriations Acts. Integration of service providers is also emphasized to provide a one-stop point of contact for veteran entrepreneurs and small business owners. The Small Business Administration will increase the number of Veterans Business Outreach Centers in the U.S. annually, starting with at least 2 new centers in fiscal years 2008 and 2009. The Administrator will determine additional centers needed based on demand. Additionally, an independent study will be conducted to identify gaps in outreach center availability. The Small Business Administration will sponsor an independent study on gaps in the availability of Veterans Business Outreach Centers across the United States to inform decisions on funding and resource allocation. A report on the study results must be submitted to Congress within 6 months of the enactment of this Act."
