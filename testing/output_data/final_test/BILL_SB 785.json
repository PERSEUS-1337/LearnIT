    "title": "SB 785",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 19000 of the Probate Code is amended to define \"claim\" as a demand for payment for various liabilities of the deceased settlor, excluding disputes over specific trust property. \"Creditor\" is defined as a person with a claim against the trust property, and \"trust\" is described as a trust subject to revocation at the deceased settlor's death. The Probate Code defines terms like \"deceased settlor,\" \"debts,\" \"probate estate,\" and \"trust estate\" related to trust administration and estate distribution. Section 19001 of the Probate Code is amended to address the distribution of a deceased settlor's property and debts. The deceased settlor can direct the priority of payment of debts among subtrusts or gifts in the trust instrument. Additionally, Section 19003 is also amended regarding trust administration and estate distribution. Section 19003 of the Probate Code is amended to allow the trustee to file a proposed notice to creditors after the death of the settlor, without a petition to administer the probate estate being filed. The trustee must publish and serve notice to creditors as prescribed, which will serve as notice of the requirements of this part. The filing of a notice for a deceased settlor's trust must be made in the county where the settlor resided, where trust property was located, or where the trust was administered. This filing does not affect any notice or request to a public entity. Additionally, if a trustee files a notice as required, the protection from creditors extends to other trusts established by the deceased settlor, their trustees, and beneficiaries. If the personal representative of the deceased settlor's probate estate has published notice and given notice of administration, the protection from creditors extends to the trustee and beneficiaries of the trust. The trustee has the right to collect debts paid from trust assets if a proceeding requires notice to be published. Section 19008 of the Probate Code states that if there is no probate estate administration for a deceased settlor and the trustee does not provide notice to creditors, the trust's liability to any creditor follows the law. Section 19024 requires the petitioner to notify trustees and beneficiaries of any trusts involved in a petition at least 30 days before a hearing. Section 19025 of the Probate Code amends the rules for creditors, beneficiaries, and trustees who fail to file a written pleading upon notice. If they fail to do so, the case can proceed based on the petition and written statements filed by the time of the hearing, and they will be bound by the decision in the proceeding. The court's final order is conclusive on trust property liability for claims in the petition, binding on the deceased settlor's probate estate, creditors, and beneficiaries. Amendments to the Probate Code allow for allocation of a deceased settlor's debt from trust property. Section 19323 of the Probate Code is amended to require the petitioner to serve notice of the hearing and petition to the surviving spouse and other relevant parties at least 30 days before the hearing. This includes trustees, beneficiaries, and the personal representative of the deceased settlor's probate estate. The Attorney General may be notified for a charitable trust, and beneficiaries receiving property from a trust without proper notice to creditors may be personally liable for the deceased settlor's probate estate debts."
