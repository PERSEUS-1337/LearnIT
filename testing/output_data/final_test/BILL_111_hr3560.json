    "content": "The Act is titled the \"21st Century Global Health Technology Act\". The United States is committed to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, including reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, and combating diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria. Health technologies are essential to reaching these goals, particularly for vulnerable populations in the developing world. The United States is committed to global health by recommending knowledge sharing, supporting partnerships for health products, and investing in innovative research models to address health needs in low- and middle-income countries. This includes investments in affordable health technologies like medical devices for maternal and child care, vaccine delivery tools, safe injection devices, and diagnostic tests for infectious diseases. The USAID's Technologies for Health program (HealthTech) supports the development of technologies to reduce disease transmission, accelerate access to global health interventions, maximize resources, and ensure products reach those in need through public-private collaboration. The HealthTech program facilitates public-private collaboration in developing global health technologies, leverages public sector support for early-stage research to encourage private sector investment, benefits the US economy by investing in the global health technology sector, and enhances national security. The HealthTech program enhances United States national security by reducing the risk of pandemic disease and contributing to economic development and stability in developing countries. The Act aims to establish a health technology development program to improve global health, reduce maternal and child mortality rates, and combat diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to establish the Health Technology Program within USAID, focusing on research and development for global health, maternal and child mortality reduction, and disease prevention. The Health Technology Program under USAID aims to improve disease diagnosis, prevention, and reduction, focusing on HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other major diseases. The program is located at an institution with a successful record of advancing technologies and integrating practical field experience into research and development. The Administrator of USAID collaborates with the program to submit an annual report to Congress and relevant agencies detailing activities in the incubation phase and progress on projects. The Health Technology Program under USAID aims to improve disease diagnosis, prevention, and reduction, focusing on major diseases. $5,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year 2010 through 2014 for the program."
