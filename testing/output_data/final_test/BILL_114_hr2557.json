    "content": "The Act titled \"Promoting New Manufacturing Act\" includes a section on creating a Building and Manufacturing Projects Dashboard. The Administrator is required to publish the EPA's estimates for preconstruction permits issued, percentage issued within one year, and average time for appeals decisions. Initial publication for fiscal years 2008-2014 must be done within 60 days of the Act's enactment. The Environmental Protection Agency is required to publish estimates for preconstruction permits, including information from the RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse database. The Agency must update this publication annually and is not compelled to seek additional information beyond what is voluntarily provided by States and local air agencies. SEC. 3. TIMELY ISSUANCE OF REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE TO ADDRESS NEW OR REVISED NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS IN PRECONSTRUCTION PERMITTING. In publishing final rules for national ambient air quality standards, the Administrator must also publish regulations and guidance for implementing the standard concurrently. If this information is not published at the same time, the standard will not apply to preconstruction permit applications until it is released. After finalizing national ambient air quality standards, the Environmental Protection Agency can issue additional regulations or guidance to help states and facilities comply. Preconstruction permit applicants must still adhere to installing best available control technology and lowest achievable emissions rate technology. States, local, or tribal permitting authorities can enforce stricter emissions requirements if needed. States, local, or tribal authorities can impose stricter emissions requirements than Federal standards set by the EPA. SEC. 4. REPORT TO CONGRESS ON ACTIONS TO EXPEDITE REVIEW OF PRECONSTRUCTION PERMITS. The Administrator must report to Congress on EPA activities to improve preconstruction permitting efficiency and reasons for delays in issuing permits under the Clean Air Act. The Administrator must report to Congress on EPA efforts to improve preconstruction permitting efficiency, including resolving delays in completeness determinations and processing permits. Public comments on the report must be solicited for at least 30 days before submission. The Environmental Protection Agency will only use voluntarily provided information by States and local air agencies for the RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse database. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, best available control technology, lowest achievable emissions rate, major emitting facility, major stationary source, and national ambient air quality standard. The \"national ambient air quality standard\" refers to a standard for air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. A \"preconstruction permit\" is required for the construction or modification of major emitting facilities or sources. The \"RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse database\" is a central database. The RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse database is the central database of air pollution technology information on the EPA's Website."
