    "content": "The April 15, 2013, Boston Marathon bombing resulted in 3 deaths and 264 injuries, leading to discussions on terrorist watchlist screening and firearm background checks. One of the alleged perpetrators was reportedly on a watchlist as a suspected terrorist. The Tsarnaev brothers, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar, were accused of killing a police officer, hijacking a car at gunpoint, and engaging in a shootout with police. The Russian FSB had contacted the FBI and CIA in 2011 with information about Tamerlan's extremist views and intentions to meet with like-minded individuals in Russia. Tamerlan Tsarnaev had intentions to travel to Russia to meet with extremists, but was not found to be radicalized by the FBI or CIA. His records were possibly included in various screening systems, such as TECS and TIDE, with potential misspellings of his name on watchlists. Authorities were not fully alerted about Tamerlan Tsarnaev's travels to Russia from January through July 2012, potentially leading to missed watchlist matches. On April 18, 2013, the Tsarnaev brothers allegedly shot and killed a police officer at MIT in an attempt to seize his firearms. They were armed with a 9mm Ruger semiautomatic pistol during the attack. The ATF is tracing a pistol used in a shootout with police. Attempts to erase the serial number failed, providing insight into how the brothers acquired the firearm. If Tamerlan bought it from a licensed dealer, a background check might have flagged him on a terrorist watchlist, prompting authorities to revisit previous assessments. The Administration is reviewing intelligence procedures. The ATF is reviewing intelligence procedures after the Boston bombing. Senator Lautenberg has reintroduced bills to close the \"Terror Gap\" for firearms and explosives. Congress may reconsider these bills in light of recent events. After the 9/11 attacks, the Bush Administration expanded terrorist watchlists. The FBI modified background check procedures to screen firearms and explosives buyers against these lists. FBI counterterrorism agents found it useful to share information on terrorist watchlist matches. The FBI modified background check procedures post-9/11 to screen firearms buyers against terrorist watchlists. While there were concerns about terrorists exploiting the availability of firearms, there was little outcry initially. The Attorney General lacks authority to maintain records on approved firearms transfers beyond 24 hours. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluated modified Brady background check procedures for firearms and explosives. GAO reported that individuals on the terrorist watchlist were able to proceed with firearms transfers due to lack of disqualifying factors. This has led to a legislative proposal developed by the Department of Justice. The Department of Justice developed a proposal in 2007 to give the Attorney General authority to deny firearms transfers to watch-listed individuals deemed as \"dangerous terrorists.\" The proposal was reintroduced in 2009 after the Fort Hood shooting, sparking renewed interest. In 2010, the Senate debated the need for legislation like the Terror Gap proposal. The Terror Gap proposal, reintroduced in the 112th and 113th Congress, raises policy issues regarding notifying U.S. persons of \"dangerous terrorist\" determinations for gun control, redress for misidentifications, and wrongful denials. The Terror Gap proposal would grant the Attorney General authority to deny firearms transfers and permits to watchlisted persons deemed \"dangerous terrorists,\" potentially setting a judicial review precedent for other screening processes. The report focuses on the potential policy issues of denying firearms transfers or state-issued permits to individuals under the Terror Gap proposal. It does not address due process concerns but examines related policy issues. The post-9/11 reforms incorporating terrorist watchlist checks into background checks are also discussed. The report discusses the incorporation of terrorist watchlist checks into the Brady background check process, key provisions of the Terror Gap proposal, and possible issues for Congress regarding terrorist watchlist checks for firearms. The report explores the incorporation of terrorist watchlist checks into the Brady background check process for firearms. It raises questions for Congress regarding the maintenance of approved firearm transfer records and the Attorney General's authority to deny transfers based on a terrorist watchlist match. The background check procedures were modified in February 2004 to address these issues. The Gun Control Act and the Brady Act established paper-based procedures for firearm transactions. Private individuals buying from licensed dealers must fill out ATF Form 4473 and pass background checks to ensure they are not prohibited from owning firearms. Prohibited persons include those convicted of certain crimes and fugitives from justice. Prohibited persons from owning firearms include those convicted of certain crimes, fugitives from justice, unlawful users of controlled substances, mentally defective individuals, illegal immigrants, dishonorably discharged military personnel, renounced citizens, individuals under court restraints for domestic violence, and those indicted for crimes punishable by over a year in prison. A federally licensed gun dealer must submit a prospective firearms transferee's information to the FBI through NICS for a background check, including name, sex, race, date of birth, and state of residence. Optional numeric identifiers like social security numbers can expedite the process. The transferee's data is checked against III, NCIC, NICS index, and immigration databases if indicated as a non-U.S. citizen by the transferee. The FBI handles background checks for most states, while some states act as points of contact for firearms background checks. Federally licensed gun dealers contact a state agency, which then contacts the FBI for checks. Denied individuals can challenge the accuracy of their denial by requesting the reason from the agency that conducted the NICS check. The denying agency must respond within five business days. The FBI conducts background checks for most states, with some states acting as points of contact. Denied individuals can challenge the accuracy of their denial by requesting the reason from the agency that conducted the NICS check. If inaccuracies are found, the denying agency must correct the record. The FBI has implemented the NICS Voluntary Appeal File (VAF) to reduce false positives in background checks. The NICS Voluntary Appeal File (VAF) is used to prevent misidentifications and delays in transfers. Current law mandates the destruction of NICS records on approved firearms transfers within 24 hours. Prohibited individuals can petition the Attorney General for \"relief from disabilities\" to restore firearms eligibility, but a rider on ATF appropriations has halted processing such petitions since FY1993. The only way to regain firearms eligibility is through civil rights restoration or expungement of disqualifying criminal records. The U.S. government expanded watchlists to screen for terrorists at entry points and track them. The Terrorist Screening Center was established under HSPD-6 to consolidate screening efforts. The NCTC serves as a central knowledge bank for counterterrorism efforts. The NCTC plays a pivotal role as the U.S. government's central knowledge bank on international terrorists and groups. It maintains TIDE, the central repository for terrorist identities. Federal agencies nominate individuals based on intelligence and law enforcement information for inclusion in TIDE if they engage in certain terrorist-related activities. The NCTC maintains TIDE, a database of individuals involved in international terrorist activities, including planning attacks, fundraising, providing support, or being members of terrorist organizations. TIDE contains over 740,000 persons, with U.S. persons making up less than 2% of listings. The NCTC provides international terrorist screening records to the FBI-administered TSC for screening operations. The FBI-administered TSC forwards international terrorist screening records to the TSDB, which contains information on 423,000 individuals. U.S. persons make up about 5% of TSDB listings. FBI Special Agents forward watchlist nominations on international terrorists to the NCTC for inclusion in TIDE, and then to the TSC for inclusion in the TSDB. Domestic terrorist watchlist nominations are forwarded directly to the TSC for inclusion in the TSDB, making it the U.S. government's consolidated watchlist of known or suspected terrorists. The TSDB is the U.S. government's consolidated watchlist of known or suspected terrorists, including international and domestic individuals. The Director of National Intelligence is required to report to Congress on the criteria for placing individuals in the TSDB, but these criteria cannot be made public to prevent compromising intelligence and security. The TSDB is the U.S. government's consolidated watchlist of known or suspected terrorists. The FBI and Intelligence Community use reasonable standards for watch-listing persons with possible terrorism links. The TSC shares terrorist screening records with frontline screening agencies, tailoring them according to legal authorities. Critics argue for better screening of visa and passport applicants and air passengers. The TSC director, in coordination with federal agencies, develops policies for including terrorist identities data in the TSDB. The TSC has access to classified information but cannot disclose it publicly. Frontline screening agencies like TSA and CBP have access to unclassified data. The TSA and CBP have access to traveler information and intelligence data. The federal government does not confirm or deny terrorist watchlist status. Misidentifications and errors in watchlist entries have been a concern. DHS has programs like TRIP to address these issues. Individuals who feel they have been wrongly targeted as terrorists by TSA or CBP can seek relief through TSA's Office for Transportation Security Redress (OTSR) or pursue administrative review in federal court if unsatisfied with TRIP determinations. Despite concerns about misidentifications and errors in watchlist entries, there has been little inclination from Congress and the Administration to provide further judicial review for those affected. In 2003, the DOJ directed the FBI to reassess NICS procedures to include screening against terrorist watchlist records. In February 2004, the FBI started conducting background checks for firearms and explosives against a terrorist watchlist in NCIC. This list was expanded after 9/11 with TSDB-generated terrorist screening records. The FBI segregated gang- and terrorist-related records in NCIC-VGTOF, with terrorist screening records downloaded into a designated NCIC file. The FBI conducts background checks for firearms against a terrorist watchlist in NCIC. The Known or Suspected Terrorist File (KST File) contains terrorist screening records. NICS provides outcomes to federally licensed gun dealers: \"proceed,\" \"denied,\" or \"delayed.\" If a possible watchlist match occurs, NICS sends a delayed response for up to three days. NICS contacts FBI Counterterrorism Division and Special Agents for further action. The FBI conducts background checks for firearms against a terrorist watchlist in NCIC, known as the Known or Suspected Terrorist File (KST File). If no prohibiting factors are found within three days, firearms dealers can proceed with the transaction. FBI counterterrorism officials continue to investigate for up to 90 days. NICS staff may contact gun dealers for additional applicant information to verify a positive match. Gun dealers are not legally required to provide this information. The FBI conducts background checks for firearms against a terrorist watchlist in NCIC, known as the Known or Suspected Terrorist File (KST File). If a positive match is found, the information is forwarded to the FBI's Terrorist Screening Operations Unit (TSOU) for further investigation. The FBI Counterterrorism Division and TSOU agent determine if the applicant is under investigation, coordinating with the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) if necessary. If not under investigation, the FBI will initiate an investigation based on the positive encounter. The TSOU case agent must respond to the NICS Command Center within 72 hours if a watch-listed applicant tries to acquire a firearm or explosives license. Once a federally licensed gun dealer is notified that the transaction can proceed, all identifying information of the transferee must be destroyed within 24 hours. If there is a delayed response, most identifying information is to be destroyed in 90 days, except for the NICS Transaction Number and transaction date. If the FFL proceeds with the transaction after three business days and the applicant is later found to be disqualified, the ATF is notified for a firearms retrieval action. In January 2005, GAO reported that NICS checks resulted in 650 terrorist-related record hits, with 44 positive matches. However, 35 transactions were allowed to proceed despite being identified as known or suspected terrorists. GAO recommended the Attorney General clarify information sharing with counterterrorism officials and monitor background checks more frequently. Following GAO recommendations, NICS procedures were changed to have NICS and TSC staff handle all KST hits for full and partial POC states. However, it is unclear if the Attorney General specified what NICS-generated information could be shared with counterterrorism officials. The Brady Act did not initially consider the use of terrorist watchlists in firearms background checks, but the DOJ and FBI have implemented procedures to screen prospective gun buyers against these lists. The FBI has procedures in place to handle terrorist watchlist checks during background checks for firearms. NICS-approved firearms transaction records are required to be destroyed within 24 hours. If background checks result in incomplete criminal history records or a terrorist watchlist hit, the firearms transaction is delayed for up to three business days. The FBI has procedures for handling terrorist watchlist checks during firearm background checks. If a final determination cannot be made within three business days, the transaction record is kept open for up to 90 days. Information from background checks is passed on to FBI agents and analysts. The fate of information from terrorist watchlist hits is unknown, but it may be stored in FBI investigative case files. The FBI's investigative case files store electronic records, with provisions in the Brady Act preventing the transfer of NICS records and the use of the system as a national firearms registry. Congress may consider granting the FBI more authority to access NICS records for counterterrorism. Another issue is whether the Attorney General should have the power to deny firearms transfers to watch-listed individuals or if all known or suspected terrorists should be prohibited from obtaining firearms. In the 109th Congress, legislation related to NICS background checks and terrorist watchlists was introduced, including the Terrorist Apprehension and Record Retention Act of 2005. This bill aimed to notify the FBI immediately when NICS checks identified known or suspected terrorists seeking firearms, coordinate responses, and retain related records for at least 10 years. Senator Lautenberg also proposed a similar bill in the 110th and 111th Congresses, called the Preserving Records of Terrorists & Criminals Transactions Act. In the 109th Congress, various bills were introduced to address record retention of terrorist-related background checks. While some proposals focused on preserving records, others aimed to restrict firearm possession for individuals on the \"No Fly\" list. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced regarding terrorist-related background checks and firearm possession for those on the \"No Fly\" list. The DOJ proposed giving the Attorney General authority to deny firearms to watch-listed individuals deemed dangerous terrorists, but faced limitations under current law in using watchlists for background checks. Attorney General Gonzales was questioned about NICS procedures and watchlist hits in hearings before the House Committee on the Judiciary. Attorney General Gonzales discussed the challenges of preventing terrorists from obtaining firearms in the US, stating that unless individuals are disqualified under the law, there is limited action that can be taken. In 2005, he directed the DOJ to review federal gun laws, particularly in relation to NICS background checks, to determine if additional authority is needed to prevent firearms transfers. In 2007, the DOJ proposed legislation to give the Attorney General authority to deny firearms transfers to individuals involved in terrorism. In 2009, a follow-up report revealed 963 NICS background checks with positive results related to terrorism. From February 2004 to February 2009, 963 NICS background checks matched the terrorist watchlist. About 90% were allowed to proceed, potentially resulting in firearms or explosives transfers. Only one case involved a potential explosives transfer. The 10% of denials were based on felony convictions, illegal immigration, fugitive status, or substance abuse. GAO recommended giving the Attorney General discretionary authority to deny transfers based on terrorist watchlist hits. During the 111th Congress, the Fort Hood shooting heightened congressional interest in using terrorist screening records for firearms background checks. Representative King and Senator Lautenberg reintroduced the \"Terror Gap\" proposal as bills (H.R. 2159 and S. 1317) following a terrorist watchlist hit. The shooter, Major Nidal Malik Hasan, had ties to a radical Muslim imam suspected of links to al-Qaeda. The Fort Hood shooting raised concerns about using terrorist screening records for firearms background checks. FBI agents were aware of Hasan's ties to al-Qaeda but it's unclear how closely he was monitored. If Hasan had been watch-listed as a terrorist, his purchase of a pistol could have alerted authorities to prevent the shooting. This incident led Congress to reconsider the Terror Gap proposal, with a hearing held in May 2010 on \"terrorists and guns.\" The HSGAC held a hearing on \"terrorists and guns,\" discussing the Fort Hood shooting and a proposal to give the Attorney General authority to deny firearms to terrorists. Senator Lieberman highlighted past terrorist plots involving firearms and supported the Terror Gap legislation to prevent further attacks. Homegrown terrorists, armed with powerful weapons, can cause significant harm quickly. They may be harder to detect and stop, especially when acting alone. The easy access to lethal weapons allows them to legally obtain firepower for devastating attacks. Concerns were raised in 2011 when Al Qaeda's U.S.-born spokesperson urged extremists to acquire firearms for terrorist acts. GAO provided updated statistics on background checks for individuals on terrorist watch lists and FBI efforts to enhance counterterrorism checks. The GAO recommended improvements in firearms and explosives background checks for counterterrorism purposes. The FBI implemented modified background procedures in 2004 to include terrorist watchlist screening. In 2008, the FBI Counterterrorism Division began analyzing firearms and explosives background checks for potential terrorist threats. The FBI initiated an analysis of firearms and explosives background checks for potential terrorist threats, leading to the issuance of monthly and quarterly analytical reports to FBI field offices and JTTFs. These reports have been crucial in FBI investigations, allowing them to collect, retain, and share information on watch-listed individuals involved in firearms or explosives transactions. Background checks have become a valuable source of criminal intelligence for the FBI. Senator Lautenberg and Representative King testified in support of bills S. 1317 and H.R. 2159. King, Mayor Bloomberg, and Police Chief Kelly testified in support of bills S. 1317 and H.R. 2159. Assistant Police Chief MacArthur discussed the LAPD's response to multiple attacks with firearms and explosives. MacArthur suggested applying firearm prevention measures to known or suspected terrorists. However, Privacy Director Titus and Senator Graham argued against the Terror Gap legislation, citing concerns about due process and constitutional rights. In response to the Terror Gap legislation, Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins raised concerns about denying firearms transfers based on terrorist watchlist records, citing constitutional issues. The HSGAC categorized the Fort Hood shooting as the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11. Senator Lautenberg and Representative King reintroduced their Terror Gap legislation in the 112th Congress. In the 112th Congress, Senator Lautenberg and Representative King reintroduced the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2011. Supporters argued that individuals on a terrorist watchlist should be prevented from acquiring firearms. Opponents, including the NRA, claimed the bill would violate the right to bear arms without due process. In the wake of the Boston bombing, Senator Lautenberg reintroduced a proposal to close the \"Terror Gap,\" granting the Attorney General authority to designate individuals as \"dangerous terrorists\" and deny them firearms-related licenses. The bill would allow the Attorney General to designate individuals involved in terrorism as ineligible for firearms licenses based on specific criteria. This provision is discretionary to account for varying levels of threat posed by individuals on watch-lists. Intelligence officers and counterterrorism agents may want to monitor individuals closely without alerting them to being watch-listed as suspected terrorists. There are instances where allowing a firearms transfer to proceed could help surveil the individual's actions. The Attorney General may avoid drawing attention to terrorist screening methods by not publicly disclosing denied firearm transfers involving known or suspected terrorists. The bill could hold the Attorney General responsible for assessing the risk of firearms transfers with terrorist watchlist hits. The bill grants the Attorney General discretion in assessing the risk of firearms transfers involving terrorist watchlist hits. This authority could lead to public expectations of accuracy in these assessments, potentially holding the Attorney General responsible for any terrorist acts committed by watch-listed individuals who acquire firearms. Additionally, the Attorney General may choose not to inform denied individuals of their \"dangerous terrorist\" determination. The Attorney General has discretion in assessing firearms transfers involving terrorist watchlist hits. The individual denied a firearms transfer has the right to learn the reason for the denial, even if not notified. If the FBI does not confirm or deny watch-list status, the individual may deduce the reason for the denial. The bill would add individuals notified of a \"dangerous terrorist\" determination to the list of those prohibited from possessing firearms. If not notified, the individual can legally possess firearms. The bill would allow denied individuals to possess previously owned firearms legally and acquire firearms from private persons if transfers are intrastate and comply with state laws. It prohibits transferring firearms to individuals determined as \"dangerous terrorists\" by the Attorney General. The bill also allows denied individuals to request reasons for denial from the Attorney General, who can withhold reasons if it compromises national security. The bill allows denied individuals to challenge determinations in federal court within 60 days. The Attorney General can withhold information that compromises national security, but the court can access summaries or redacted versions of documents. The bill allows denied individuals to challenge determinations in federal court within 60 days. The court can review undisclosed documents ex parte and in camera to determine their accuracy, but cannot overturn the Attorney General's decision based solely on them. Implications of a determination being overturned, such as removal from the watchlist, are not addressed in the bill. The bill allows individuals to challenge determinations in federal court within 60 days, with the possibility of a court order directing firearms transfer. This could set a precedent for challenging outcomes of terrorist screening activities. The bill also amends firearms and explosives licensing statutes. The bill prohibits individuals deemed \"dangerous terrorists\" by the Attorney General from possessing explosives. The Attorney General can deny or revoke firearms and explosives licenses if the holder is a known or suspected terrorist. The bill does not address license renewals, allowing continuous screening for terrorist ties. The bill allows the Attorney General to deny firearms and explosives licenses to individuals deemed \"dangerous terrorists.\" It includes provisions for challenging denials in federal court and guidelines for making \"dangerous terrorist\" determinations. The Terror Gap bill aims to monitor the exercise of authority to achieve its goals while safeguarding privacy and civil liberties. Arguments for the bill focus on enhancing public safety due to terrorists using firearms and explosives in attacks. Arguments against it include concerns about non-notification feasibility, redress opportunities, and judicial review precedents. The Attorney General would have discretionary authority to deny firearms transfers to individuals deemed dangerous under the bill. The Terror Gap bill grants the Attorney General discretionary authority to deny firearms transfers to individuals deemed dangerous, without the obligation to notify the subject of the determination. This raises concerns about non-notification feasibility and the potential for individuals to deduce they have been placed on a terrorist watchlist if no reason is given for the denial upon inquiry. The policy of neither confirming nor denying watch-list status after a firearms denial based on a \"dangerous terrorist\" determination raises sustainability questions. Denied individuals may struggle to seek redress if they believe they were mistakenly placed on a terrorist watchlist. Proponents argue the FBI would respond within five days, giving the individual time to hire an attorney and present their case in court. Opponents suggest those mistakenly labeled as \"dangerous terrorists\" would have limited legal recourse. Opponents argue that individuals labeled as \"dangerous terrorists\" would have limited legal recourse, especially if not notified by the Attorney General. Supporters of the Terror Gap proposal believe it would provide denied individuals a chance to appeal such a determination, which is currently unavailable in other federal government screening operations. Opponents of the proposal argue that implementing redress and remedy provisions could draw unwanted attention to the U.S. government's use of terrorist watchlists and set a precedent for judicial review. The curr_chunk provides a list of acronyms related to counterterrorism and security agencies, such as JTTF, NCIC, NCTC, NICS, POC, TIDE, TSA, TSC, TSDB, TRIP, TSOU, VAF, and VGTOF."
