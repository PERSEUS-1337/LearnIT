    "content": "The State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides health coverage to uninsured, low-income children and pregnant women above Medicaid eligibility levels. CHIP is jointly financed by the federal government and states, with states having flexibility in program design. States can choose from three program options: CHIP Medicaid expansion, separate CHIP program, or a combination approach. There is significant variation across CHIP programs in terms of benefit coverage. Medicaid expansion and CHIP programs have different benefit coverage and cost-sharing rules. Separate CHIP programs can resemble private health insurance and may include cost sharing based on family income. Federal appropriations for CHIP have been provided for multiple years at a time in recent legislation. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and subsequent legislation provided funding for CHIP through FY2027. The federal government's share of CHIP expenditures is determined by the enhanced federal medical assistance percentage rate, based on the FMAP rate for Medicaid. Various aspects of federal CHIP funding are discussed, including state allotments, redistribution funds, and recent legislative activity ensuring funding through FY2027. The FMAP formula determines the federal matching rate for the Medicaid program based on each state's income compared to the national average. States with lower incomes receive higher reimbursement (up to 83%), while states with higher incomes receive lower reimbursement (minimum of 50%). The E-FMAP rate is calculated by reducing the state share under the regular FMAP rate by 30%, ranging from 65% to 85% statutorily. Different matching rates apply for certain CHIP expenditures, such as translation services (75% or E-FMAP rate plus 5 percentage points). CHIPRA included a provision reducing the matching rate for children with family incomes over 300% of the federal poverty level. The ACA provision increased the E-FMAP rate by 23 percentage points for most CHIP expenditures from FY2016 to FY2019. A continuing resolution extended the increase to FY2020, but at 11.5 percentage points. Certain expenditures are excluded from the increase, such as translation services and Medicaid coverage for certain patients. The E-FMAP rate for CHIP was increased by 23 percentage points for most expenditures from FY2016 to FY2019, extending to FY2020 at 11.5 percentage points. This increase led to states spending federal CHIP funding faster due to the higher federal share. Federal CHIP funding is mandatory and provided through a statutory appropriation. The federal appropriation for CHIP from FY1998 through FY2016 is the maximum amount of federal funding for the program. Most expenditures come from state CHIP allotments, with additional funding sources including shortfall funding and outreach grants. CHIP funding can also be used for some Medicaid expenses. CHIPRA and the ACA increased annual appropriation amounts, with MACRA adding funding through FY2015. The federal appropriation is provided in Section 2104(a) of the Social Security Act. The ACA and MACRA provided funding for CHIP through FY2017. FY2018 began without federal funding, but a continuing resolution in December 2017 allocated $2.85 billion for the first six months. Full-year funding for FY2018 through FY2023 was provided in January 2018, increasing annually from $21.5 billion to $25.9 billion. BBA 2018 then provided funding for FY2024 through FY2027. Funding amounts for FY2024 through FY2026 are unspecified. The funding for FY2027 includes two semiannual appropriations of $7.65 billion and a one-time appropriation to cover state allotments. Federal appropriations have been more than enough to fund CHIP expenditures since FY2009, with $46.4 billion rescinded from FY2011 to FY2018. State allotments are federal funds allocated to each state for CHIP expenditures. CHIPRA established new allocation of federal funds among states based on actual use and projected need for CHIP funds. State allotments determined by even-year and odd-year formulas, adjusting for growth in per capita National Health Expenditures and child population. The odd-year formula for CHIP allotments is based on states' actual CHIP fund usage, leading to adjustments in state allotments. Re-basing in FY2011 resulted in a significant decrease in aggregate state allotment amounts. Federal CHIP expenditures can include funding from states' allotments for the current and prior years, as well as shortfall funding. The federal share covers both CHIP benefit and administrative expenses, with a limit of 10% of federal CHIP funds that a state can access. The federal CHIP funds have a limit of 10% for nonbenefit expenditures, including administration and outreach. Shortfall funding sources like the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund, redistribution funds, and Medicaid funds are available if a state's allotment is insufficient. The Child Enrollment Contingency Fund was established by CHIPRA and extended by the ACA and MACRA until FY2017. P.L. 115-120 and BBA 2018 further extend the funding mechanism. The Child Enrollment Contingency Fund, established by CHIPRA and extended by the ACA and MACRA until FY2017, has been further extended through FY2027 by P.L. 115-120 and BBA 2018. States are eligible for payments if they have a funding shortfall and CHIP enrollment exceeding a target level. The fund was initially funded with 20% of the appropriated amount for FY2009 and receives additional deposits for FY2010 through FY2027. Payment formula is based on state's CHIP enrollment growth and per capita spending. The Child Enrollment Contingency Fund, established by CHIPRA and extended by the ACA and MACRA until FY2017, has been further extended through FY2027 by P.L. 115-120 and BBA 2018. Iowa, Michigan, and Tennessee are the only states that have received payments from the fund. Unused state CHIP allotment funds are redistributed to shortfall states, with each shortfall state receiving a proportionate share of available funds based on their shortfall. During FY2009 through FY2017, Michigan and five territories received redistribution funds from the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund. Special rules were added during the FY2018 CHIP funding shortfall to prevent states from exhausting their federal funding. Continuing resolutions in December 2017 included special rules prioritizing redistribution funds for emergency shortfall states. The December 2017 continuing resolution extended the definition of emergency shortfall states through March 2018, allowing states facing a CHIP funding shortfall to receive federal Medicaid matching funds. This means that when Medicaid funds are used to fund CHIP, the state receives the lower regular FMAP rate. Federal CHIP funding is capped, but federal Medicaid funding is open-ended, with no upper limit on the amount a state may receive. In certain situations, federal CHIP funding is used to finance Medicaid expenditures. Federal CHIP funding is used to finance Medicaid expenditures, with certain states allowed to use their CHIP allotment funds to cover the cost for children in Medicaid above 133% of FPL. The qualifying state option was extended through FY2027 by P.L. 115-120 and BBA 2018, with 11 states eligible for this option. The ACA required states to transition CHIP children aged 6 through 18 with income less than 133% of FPL to Medicaid starting in 2014. CHIPRA established outreach grants to increase Medicaid and CHIP enrollment and retention for eligible children. The CHIPRA, ACA, MACRA, P.L. 115-120, and BBA 2018 legislation provided funding for outreach and enrollment grants to improve retention of eligible children in Medicaid and CHIP programs. Funding amounts varied from $100 million to $48 million over different fiscal years, with the latest funding covering FY2018 through FY2027. Federal CHIP funding for FY2018 was not provided until January 22, 2018. The legislative activity for CHIP funding from FY2018 to FY2027 included states using unspent funds from previous years, redistribution funds, and short-term funding through continuing resolutions in December 2017. Each state received a proportionate share of available funds based on their shortfall. On December 8, 2017, a law (P.L. 115-90) extended appropriations for federal agencies and programs, amending the CHIP statute to prioritize redistribution funds for emergency shortfall states. Another law on December 22, 2017 (P.L. 115-96) provided $2.85 billion in CHIP appropriations from October 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018, and extended the special rule for redistribution funds through March 2018. The CHIP funding provided by various laws extended appropriations through FY2027, including short-term funding until March 2018. P.L. 115-120 included full-year appropriations for FY2018 and extended funding for FY2019 through FY2023. Additionally, the law extended the E-FMAP rate increase through FY2020 at 11.5 percentage points. BBA 2018 further extended CHIP funding for FY2024 through FY2027."
