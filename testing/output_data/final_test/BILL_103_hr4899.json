    "content": "SECTION 1. CREDIT FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO FAMILY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS: Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow for contributions to certain organizations operating family development programs to qualify for a nonrefundable personal credit. The tax code allows individuals to receive a credit for 100% of qualified family development contributions made to a qualified organization for family development program activities, provided the contribution is in cash and the organization assures its proper use. The term 'qualified organization' in this section refers to an organization primarily engaged in family development program activities and has not received funds from the Federal Government or related programs. 'Family development program activities' are community-based initiatives aimed at supporting at-risk youth aged 18. The curr_chunk discusses activities for at-risk youth under 18, including child care, health services, mentoring, job training, and substance abuse services. It also mentions the denial of double benefits for family development contributions. Reporting requirements are outlined in subpart B of the tax code. The curr_chunk discusses returns related to qualified family development contributions under SEC. 6050Q. Every organization receiving qualified family development contributions must make a return with the names, addresses, and amounts of contributions from each person. They must also provide a written statement to each contributor with the organization's details and the total contributions made by the individual, by January 31 of the following year. The return for qualified family development contributions must be furnished to individuals by January 31 of the following year. Penalties for non-compliance are outlined in the Code. The Code is amended to include a new subparagraph (Q) regarding returns for qualified family development contributions. Clerical amendments are made to the table of sections. Sec. 23 amends the Code to include a new section for qualified family development contributions. The effective date for these amendments applies to contributions made after the enactment of the Act."
