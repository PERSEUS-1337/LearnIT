    "content": "The \"Domestic Violence Identification and Referral Act of 1993\" establishes requirements for identifying and referring victims of domestic violence in certain health professions programs. The Secretary may award a grant or contract to a health professions entity only if the application describes the entity's requirement for students to have training in identifying and treating victims of domestic violence. The designated health professions entities must provide medical advice on domestic violence and refer victims to relevant services. These entities include schools of medicine, osteopathic medicine, public health, mental health practice programs, nursing schools, physician assistant training programs, and allied health professional training programs. Awards of grants or contracts are subject to limitations determined by the Secretary. The Secretary evaluates designated health professions entities for grant eligibility based on meeting specific criteria for training students in relevant functions. Failure to meet criteria may result in the entity not receiving a grant award. The Secretary may not award a grant or contract exceeding certain percentages based on the entity's past performance under specific programs. The Secretary limits grant awards based on past performance, with reductions in funding for consecutive fiscal years. Ineligibility for further awards occurs if criteria are not met after the fourth fiscal year. If an entity fails to meet criteria after receiving an award, limitations on further awards will be applied. Definitions include 'designated health professions entity' and 'domestic violence'. The curr_chunk discusses the behavior of an individual in an intimate or acquaintance relationship with the victim, which may involve physical injury, sexual assault, psychological abuse, or neglect. This behavior is referred to as various terms such as 'domestic violence', 'partner abuse', 'elder abuse', and 'date rape'."
