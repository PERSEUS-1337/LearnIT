    "content": "Federal advisory committees are created by Congress, Presidents, and executive branch agencies to obtain expertise and policy advice from individuals outside the federal government. These committees bring together experts with diverse opinions to examine issues and make recommendations for policy actions. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) was enacted in 1972 to govern these advisory bodies, providing a detailed definition of what constitutes a federal advisory committee. These committees are a formalized mechanism for private-sector citizens to participate in the federal policymaking process. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) governs entities established to provide advice or recommendations to the President or federal agencies, excluding certain committees. However, there is uncertainty regarding the application of FACA to specific advisory committees. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) governs advisory bodies established to provide advice to the President or federal agencies. The application of FACA to specific committees depends on whether Congress explicitly states it in legislation or on the appointing branch of the federal government. The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains guidelines for federal advisory committees. In FY2011, 1,029 FACA committees with 69,750 members reported their operations. In FY2011, 1,029 FACA committees with 69,750 members reported total operating costs of $395,179,373 among 51 departments and agencies. H.R. 3124, the Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 2011, would require advisory committee members to be selected without partisan affiliation and subcommittees to adhere to FACA requirements. It also clarifies ethics requirements and increases records access requirements for committee members. H.R. 3124, the Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 2011, clarifies advisory committee transparency requirements and increases public access to records. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the House Committee on Ways and Means. It may enhance public participation but could also lead to increased time and costs for administering advisory committees. The text discusses the history of advisory committees in the US, starting from George Washington's use of outside expertise in 1794. Congress has legislated control over federal advisory bodies since the 1840s, mainly by limiting funding and committee member pay. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) was enacted in 1972 to address concerns about the inefficiency and lack of public accessibility of executive branch advisory bodies. Congress aimed to increase oversight and control over the proliferation of advisory committees by requiring those that meet certain criteria to report annually. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) was enacted in 1972 to address concerns about the inefficiency and lack of public accessibility of executive branch advisory bodies. FACA requires advisory bodies that meet certain criteria to report annually to the General Services Administration (GSA), which then reports aggregated information to Congress. The law established statutory requirements for management, access, and oversight of federal committees, ensuring they are advisory only and their determinations are made in accordance with the law. FACA allocates oversight and management responsibilities to the standing committees of Congress and the Office of. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) of 1972 delegates oversight and management responsibilities to Congress, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), agency heads, and the President. FACA requires congressional committees to continuously review federal advisory committees under their jurisdiction for necessity and balance of viewpoints. Committees must have autonomy from appointing powers to avoid undue influence. OMB is tasked with overseeing advisory committee management, including reviewing existing entities for potential abolition. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) was tasked with overseeing advisory committee management, including reviewing existing entities for potential abolition. In December 1977, these duties were reassigned to the General Services Administration (GSA) by E.O. 12024, which now promulgates regulations related to FACA administration and performs annual reporting requirements to Congress. The President is required to report to Congress within one year of receiving advice from an advisory committee. The President is required to report to Congress within one year of receiving advice from an advisory committee, and annually report on the activities and composition changes of advisory committees. FACA mandates that only Congress, the President, or an agency head can create advisory committees, with all committees required to file a charter outlining their objectives, duties, costs, meeting frequency, and termination date. Most committee meetings must be advertised in the Federal Register. In FY2009, 907 active FACA committees reported nearly 82,000 members with operating costs of $361,493,408. By FY2011, the number of committees grew to 1,029 with 69,750 members, and operating costs increased to $395,179,373. Over the past three years, the number of committees increased by 100, while the number of members decreased by 12,190. Figures show the growth in committees, decrease in members, and increase in costs. The increase in FACA committee membership in FY2009 was largely due to committees making recommendations on distributing funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. FACA requires advisory committees to make their recommendations public and hold open meetings, with exceptions. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) mandates that all papers, records, and meeting minutes be available for public inspection. Committee membership must be balanced in viewpoints and functions, free from undue influence. Advisory committees subject to FACA must file a charter every two years outlining their mandate, duties, meeting frequency, and membership requirements. GSA annually reviews committee accomplishments and assists agencies in creating new advisory bodies. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) requires agencies to respond to inquiries, maintain a database of advisory bodies, and have a committee management officer (CMO) overseeing committee activities. A designated federal official (DFO) must be present at meetings to call and adjourn them, ensuring compliance with the Sunshine Act. FACA committees must be essential to their duty's performance according to OMB Circular No. A-135. According to OMB Circular No. A-135, FACA committees must be essential to the performance of duties conveyed by law. Agencies should review and eliminate obsolete, duplicative, or low priority advisory committees. All committees created since FACA's enactment must sunset after two years unless specified otherwise. Limited scholarship exists on federal advisory committees' creation, operations, and effects. Studies have explored ways Congress can design more effective committees and whether they serve presidential interests. Competing theories exist on which branch of the federal government advisory committees serve. Scholars have not agreed on a single definition for advisory committees in the federal government. FACA-governed entities are specifically defined as committees established by statute, reorganization plan, the President, or agencies to provide advice. The term excludes committees composed solely of government employees. Advisory committees in the federal government, governed by FACA, are strictly advisory and prohibited from creating policy or regulations. They allow a President to deflect blame, buy time, and show action on politically charged issues. Commissions are used to garner public support, show concern at the highest level, establish a fact base, respond to crises, and deflect political heat. Advisory committees in the federal government, governed by FACA, serve as advisory bodies to the President. They help in deflecting blame, buying time, and showing action on politically charged issues. Commissions are categorized into agenda, information, and political constellation commissions, aiming to attract support, provide new ideas to policymakers, and foster consensus in policy domains. Some committees are created to acquire new ideas from outside experts or to allow politicians to avoid blame for contentious issues. Advisory committees in the federal government, governed by FACA, serve as advisory bodies to the President. They help in deflecting blame, buying time, and showing action on politically charged issues. Committees may be created to handle the workload of legislators and manage problems efficiently. Research has shown that the structure and composition of a federal advisory committee can impact its deliberative process and contribution to public policy. The requirement for committee membership to be \"fairly balanced\" has been questioned, with arguments that the distinction between experts and laypeople is arbitrary. The federal ethics requirements mandate that expert members of advisory committees disclose any conflicts of interest. Scholars and practitioners debate the impact of advisory bodies on public interaction with the federal government. In March 2012, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report on federal advisory committees within the Departments of Transportation and Education. The report found that while advisory committees are generally useful and cost-efficient, there is potential for duplication both within and outside agencies. GAO recommended specific steps be taken to address this issue. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended specific steps to address potential duplication and ongoing need for advisory committees. GAO also highlighted four practices that can influence the usefulness of an advisory body. FACA defines an \"advisory committee\" broadly. FACA defines an advisory committee broadly as a body created for obtaining advice or recommendations for the President or on agency issues. It applies when a committee is established or utilized by an agency, excluding those performing regulatory or policy-making functions. Advisory committees created by the executive branch may sometimes be unclear if they must adhere to FACA requirements. Advisory committees created by the executive branch may or may not be obligated to follow FACA requirements, depending on which branch appoints members and to whom the committee reports. It is generally up to the hosting agency to determine FACA applicability. Members of Congress can include a clause in legislation to clarify FACA governance. FACA requirements may enhance transparency in government operations but can also burden committees with additional administrative tasks. Agencies find FACA compliance resource-intensive, hindering timely focus on substantive issues. Some argue that FACA's openness requirements may stifle candid discussions within committees. Congress can exempt advisory committees from FACA to operate more efficiently. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) can slow down committee operations with its transparency requirements. Some committees are exempt from FACA, such as those consisting of federal employees or created by specific organizations like the National Academy of Sciences. Representative William Lacy Clay introduced H.R. 3124, the Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 2011, to address FACA's limitations. H.R. 3124, the Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 2011, aims to clarify FACA language, increase transparency in committee selection, and enhance public access to federal advisory committees. It also extends FACA requirements to federally contracted advisory committees. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the House Committee on Ways and Means, with no further action taken as of October 13, 2011. H.R. 3124 aims to modify the committee-member appointment process by requiring agencies to publish a request for comments in the Federal Register before making appointments. The public can submit recommendations electronically, and appointments must be made without regard to partisan affiliation. The bill also mandates a review of each committee member's designation as a special government employee or representative. H.R. 3124 would require committee members to be explicitly designated as SGEs or representatives, determining their ethical standards. Subcommittees and contracted committees must adhere to FACA requirements under the bill. H.R. 3124 would require committees to adhere to FACA requirements, including providing a statement of independence, defining committee membership criteria, and mandating the publication of meeting minutes and recordings on agency websites. The curr_chunk discusses the process of selecting committee members, including the criteria for balance of viewpoints or expertise, justification for representative members, and listing current members and their affiliations. It also mentions special government employees who can provide advice despite conflicts of interest. The agency must disclose certifications, recusal agreements, decision-making processes, meeting minutes, closed meeting determinations, future meeting notices, and any additional information related to advisory committee operations. The bill outlines requirements for FACA committee charters and recommendations for improvements, including public comment on potential members, explicit ethics requirements, and posting waivers online. The bill proposes improvements for FACA committees, such as public comment on members and posting waivers online. Congress aims to enhance transparency and oversight by clarifying FACA's application to advisory committees. FACA applies to bodies created by the President or agency heads for advisory purposes, with non-federal members reporting to the executive branch. Congress may pass legislation to make all advisory committees adhere to FACA, limiting flexibility for non-FACA entities. The 112th Congress could clarify FACA requirements for committees created by or reporting to Congress, potentially exempting them from certain reporting and transparency rules. This could lead to concerns about government transparency if legislation is enacted. Congress may also need to address ethics requirements for federal advisory committee members. Committee members must adhere to federal ethics requirements, with agency heads responsible for ensuring compliance. Not all members are required to follow federal ethics codes, depending on their designation as government employees or representatives. H.R. 3124 proposes explicit designation of committee members before service on an advisory committee, clarifying their status under federal ethics regulations. H.R. 3124 proposes explicit designation of committee members before service on an advisory committee to increase trust and prevent bias. It also aims to make the process for selecting FACA committee members more transparent by requiring agencies to publish a request for comments in the Federal Register and consider the comments when making appointments. The Administrative Conference of the United States recommended that agencies invite public nominations for committee members. Congress may consider requiring public comment on membership appointments to inject new ideas and opinions. However, this could slow down the process of setting up federal advisory committees. Key considerations for advisory committees include defining purpose, membership, duties, powers, and effectiveness. The process of establishing federal advisory committees involves defining committee duties, setting powers, allocating support staff, and mandating reporting requirements. Committee charters must include a mission statement and identify the authority for the committee's establishment. Advisory committees can be authorized by statute, executive order, or agency authority. Black Colleges and Universities were authorized by Executive Order 13256 in 2002 and renewed by Executive Order 13532 in 2010, which rescinded the previous order. The Air Traffic Procedures Advisory Committee was created by agency authority and its powers and mission are detailed in its charter. The Forestry Research Advisory Council within the Department of Agriculture has advisory duties to provide reports on forestry research coordination. State agencies, forestry schools, and forest industries form committees with specific powers and objectives to operate independently. Charters should allow autonomy for realistic achievement within time constraints. Committees need time for staff acquisition, office setup, and logistical concerns. Membership for FACA committees has few restrictions. Membership for advisory committees must be fairly balanced and may be affected by federal ethics statutes. The size and composition of the committee should allow for effective communication and ensure completion of the mission. Members are appointed on a staggered schedule to maintain continuity, and some committees include specific federal government members or their designees. The committees are designed to include specific members of the federal government or their designees, with certain qualifications or expertise required for membership. The U.S. Military Academy Board of Visitors, for example, has 15 committee members outlined in its charter, including members from the Senate and House of Representatives, as well as persons designated by the President. The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Public Advisory Committee Charter established a 15-member committee with specific expertise required for membership, including aquaculturists, commercial fishers, tourism business persons, recreation users, conservationists/environmentalists, and local government representatives. The curr_chunk discusses various stakeholders involved in the response to the oil spill, including local government, Native landowners, tribal governments, scientists, sport hunters/fishers, subsistence users, and regional monitoring program operators. The curr_chunk discusses the roles of stakeholders in response to an oil spill, including trade, regional monitoring program operators, marine transportation operators, and the public-at-large. Charters may include positions for Members of Congress, the President, or agency heads to appoint, allowing for a widespread base of support but potentially losing control over the advisory body's actions. Advisory panel members, not federal government employees, may or may not receive compensation for their work. The authority designing the committee decides on pay levels, capped at Executive Level IV. Committee staff must be quickly assembled to meet mission deadlines. Executive directors are common in committees. Committees typically consist of an executive director, staff members, committee members, and sometimes outside consultants. Committee staff draft the final report, which is approved by committee members. Interim or annual reports may be required to be submitted to the President, Congress, or department heads. Recommendations made by committees are advisory and do not result in policy action. Presidential advisory committees require the President to report to Congress on any actions taken based on recommendations within a year. A statute creating a FACA committee can include instructions for entities receiving the final report. The President may not put much effort into a report if not interested in the committee's issues. Explicit authority may be needed for special duties of an advisory body, such as holding hearings and receiving evidence. The FACA committee can receive evidence, use the franking privilege, accept donations, and permit volunteers. Subpoena power is granted selectively based on the committee's mission. Committee charters outline procedural requirements, election procedures, and committee operations. Congressional control over committee procedures is greater if provided by statute. The General Services Administration's designated federal officer is responsible for approving or calling meetings of advisory committees, approving agendas, adjourning meetings, and certifying minutes. Congress may fund committees through appropriations or private donations if not explicitly prohibited. Committee charters may determine if private financial gifts can be accepted. The authority creating advisory bodies may require detailed recordkeeping of donations to maintain transparency. Advisory committees typically terminate two years after establishment, requiring rechartering with GSA. National study committees mandated to terminate 30 days after final report submission. FACA enactment involved debates and hearings over many decades. The Appendix details the legislative and executive branch actions leading to the enactment of FACA in response to concerns about private sector advisory committees influencing federal policies without proper authority. The DOJ released legal opinions on the creation and oversight of advisory committees, with guidelines outlined by Attorney General Francis Biddle in 1944 and the Office of the Deputy Attorney General in 1955. The guidelines emphasized the government's responsibility in forming industry advisory committees and the necessity for statutory authority or administrative findings for federal advisory committees. The DOJ released guidelines on advisory committees in 1944 and 1955. Representative Dante Fascell introduced a bill in 1957 to make DOJ's advisory committee requirements law. The bill aimed to regulate the use of experts and consultants by government departments and agencies. The bill introduced in 1957 aimed to make the DOJ's advisory committee requirements law by requiring the President to submit an annual report detailing committee membership and compliance with standards. President Kennedy later reinforced these requirements with an executive order in 1962. The executive branch established guidelines for federal advisory committees in the 1960s, limiting their lifespan to two years unless extended by agency heads. Circular No. A-63 outlined policies for creating and maintaining advisory committees, emphasizing the use of the term \"committees\" and discouraging dual chairmanships. Congress was also exploring ways to increase oversight over advisory committees during this time. President Nixon issued Executive Order 11671 in 1972, setting new standards for advisory committees, aligning with the upcoming Federal Advisory Committee Act. Congress reacted by holding hearings on executive branch committee use in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The Senate Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations held hearings to examine the rights of people to access information and take action. Over 30 witnesses testified over 12 days, leading to the conclusion that many advisory committees were duplicative, ineffective, and costly. There was a lack of effective mechanisms for evaluating these committees. In December 1970, the House Committee on Government Operations' Special Studies Subcommittee issued a report on the Role and Effectiveness of Federal Advisory Committees. Representative John Mongan introduced the Federal Advisory Committee Standards Act in February 1971 to address the responsibilities of Congress, OMB, the President, and agency heads in controlling federal advisory bodies. Congressional committees were to review and eliminate advisory bodies related to specific topics. The congressional committees were tasked with reviewing and eliminating duplicative advisory bodies, clarifying missions, and ensuring adequate resources. The OMB director was to conduct a comprehensive review and recommend elimination or merger of advisory bodies. Senator William V. Roth, Jr., introduced a similar bill in the Senate. Senator Roth introduced a bill to authorize the Office of Management and Budget to establish a system governing advisory committees in the Federal Government due to a lack of congressional oversight. There are over 2,600 advisory entities currently operating, with the number possibly reaching 3,200. Despite their contribution to government effectiveness, Congress has not provided adequate controls. Congress has neglected to provide adequate controls to supervise the growth and activity of advisory committees, leading to criticism in the media. Bills were introduced to address this issue, with one passing in the House with openness provisions for public access. On April 25, 1972, S. 3529 merged pending advisory committee bills to streamline and improve their effectiveness. The bill aimed to strengthen Congress and the executive branch's authority to limit unnecessary advisory committees, establish uniform standards for their creation and operation, ensure transparency in their membership and costs, and mandate that they remain advisory only. Debate in the Senate focused on making public participation and transparency mandatory. S. 3529 aimed to facilitate public information requests by making committee records subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The bill passed the Senate with amendments exempting certain committees from reporting requirements. The final bill included reporting requirements for advisory committees planning to hold meetings. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) was signed into law by President Nixon on October 6, 1972. It replaced E.O. 11671 as the primary document guiding federal advisory bodies. In the years following FACA's enactment, there have been efforts to clarify the statute and streamline the number of FACA committees, including the incorporation of the Sunshine Act in 1977. The Sunshine Act, incorporated into the law by the Committee Act (P.L. 94-409), aims to increase transparency in government agency meetings. Executive Order 12024 in December 1977 transferred advisory committee oversight duties to the Administrator of General Services. Various executive orders have abolished or extended the lifespan of federal advisory committees. Efforts to strengthen FACA's management controls and establish new disclosure requirements for committee members were introduced in Congress from 1983 to 1989 but were not enacted. Executive Order 12838, issued by President Clinton on February 10, 1993, required each executive department to terminate certain committees. President Clinton issued Executive Order 12838, mandating the termination of one-third of advisory committees not required by statute by the end of fiscal year 1993. Agency heads had to justify the necessity of remaining committees, with approval needed from the OMB director to continue operation. Vice President Albert Gore later required agencies to reduce advisory committee costs by 5%, and President Clinton would not support new legislation establishing or exempting advisory committees from FACA. Alice M. Rivlin, acting OMB director, released a circular in 1994 detailing management policies for remaining FACA committees. The circular released in 1994 by acting OMB director Alice M. Rivlin detailed management policies for remaining FACA committees, reinforcing the Clinton Administration's decision to reduce advisory committees and cut costs. Two FACA-related laws were enacted in 1995, exempting intergovernmental advisory actions from FACA and eliminating GSA's annual reporting requirements to Congress. GSA stopped creating its Annual Report to Congress in 1998 but continues to publish the Annual Comprehensive Review as an oversight document for FACA committees. The Comprehensive Review is a document required by FACA to assess advisory bodies' adherence to their missions and statutes. The Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 1997 allowed for public comment on committee membership and attendance at meetings for advisory bodies within certain organizations."
