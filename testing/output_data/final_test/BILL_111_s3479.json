Definitions in the Act include terms like \"organization\" and \"pregnancy and breastfeeding information services\" for specialized information provision. The Secretary will establish a program for birth defects prevention and public awareness, including providing information on maternal exposures during breastfeeding that may pose health risks to infants. This information will be evidence-based and weigh the risks against the benefits of breastfeeding, and will be delivered through various channels such as counselors, websites, and fact sheets. The Secretary will conduct a nationwide media campaign to increase awareness about pregnancy and breastfeeding information services. Grants will be awarded to organizations for providing pregnancy and breastfeeding information services. The Secretary will conduct campaigns to increase awareness about pregnancy and breastfeeding information services, as well as support surveillance and research on maternal exposures that may influence birth defects and health risks to breastfed infants. Certain organizations in specific states may receive preference for grants under this initiative. The Secretary prioritizes organizations in states with existing pregnancy and breastfeeding information services for grants. Recipients must provide matching funds of at least 25% and coordinate activities with other initiatives. The Secretary will evaluate pregnancy and breastfeeding information services to identify effective models for providing information, raising awareness about birth defects prevention, modifying risk behaviors, and other outcome measures. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2011 to carry out this program. $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2011, $6,000,000 for fiscal year 2012, $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2013, $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2014, and $9,000,000 for fiscal year 2015 are authorized to be appropriated."
