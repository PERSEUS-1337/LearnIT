    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Public Lands Rehabilitation and Job Creation Act.\" Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that the National Park Service has a significant maintenance backlog due to poor condition of facilities in new parks and inadequate funding over the years, leading to major repairs and new construction needs. The National Park Service has a significant maintenance backlog, with over half of the projects related to roads. Reversing the backlog requires full funding for repairs and maintenance programs. Despite the ARRA funding in 2009, there is still $3.2 billion in critical deferred maintenance projects. The National Park Service recommends phasing in funding increases over several years to rebuild staff and support capacity. Preventive maintenance is crucial to slowing the maintenance backlog growth, with a proposed increase in cyclic maintenance funding from $100 million to $350 million annually. Gains from increased maintenance efforts may be limited without additional funding. The National Park Service faces a significant maintenance staffing shortfall, with evaluations showing a 50 to 100 percent deficit in needed personnel. Increasing maintenance staffing by 50 percent would require an additional operational increase of $350 million a year. This funding increase is crucial to address identified maintenance needs and prevent the backlog from growing further. The NPS estimates that with funding, it can prepare plans and hire for construction and maintenance within 4 to 6 months. The Wilderness Society suggests road removal and reclamation as a long-term solution for National Forests, creating jobs and improving water supplies for rural communities. The Forest Service estimates that road and culvert reclamation could save taxpayers up to $1,200 per mile annually in reduced maintenance costs. Additionally, $1 million spent on road decommissioning would create 11 direct jobs for heavy equipment operators and 3.5 jobs for other forest workers. While beneficial for rural communities and the environment, the Forest Service currently has limited shovel-ready projects. The Forest Service needs to identify its minimum road system, design engineering projects to remove unneeded roads, and conduct NEPA analysis before starting work on shovel-ready projects, which would create family-wage, high-skilled, green jobs. Emergency supplemental appropriations of $1,250,000,000 are designated for the National Park Service for maintenance and repair of park facilities until September 30, 2014. The curr_chunk provides an additional $2,000,000,000 for construction and major repairs, designated as an emergency requirement for the Department of Agriculture's Forest Service capital improvement and maintenance. An additional $500,000,000 is allocated for road-related projects, including decommissioning, with $100,000,000 for identifying a minimum road system for national forests and grasslands, and another $100,000,000 for decommissioning unauthorized roads through private contracting. This funding is designated as an emergency requirement to meet urgent needs. Emergency funding of $500,000,000 allocated for road-related projects, including decommissioning unauthorized roads through private contracting, to meet urgent needs as per S. Con. Res. 13 (111th Congress). The Federal Highway Administration is allocating $1 billion for critical park road and transportation-related infrastructure repairs and maintenance under section 204 of title 23, United States Code. This funding is designated as an emergency requirement to meet urgent needs as per S. Con. Res. 13 (111th Congress)."
