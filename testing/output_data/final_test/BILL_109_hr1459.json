    "content": "The \"Boutique Fuels Reduction Act of 2005\" allows for temporary waivers during supply emergencies. The Clean Air Act allows the Administrator to temporarily waive fuel or fuel additive regulations in cases of extreme supply circumstances after consultation with the Secretary of Energy. The Clean Air Act permits the Administrator to grant a temporary waiver for fuel or fuel additive regulations in cases of extreme and unusual supply circumstances, such as natural disasters or equipment failures, if it is in the public interest to do so. The Clean Air Act allows for a temporary waiver of fuel or fuel additive regulations in cases of extreme supply circumstances. The waiver must be limited to the smallest necessary area, last for 20 days or shorter if sufficient, and include a transitional period for wholesalers and retailers to adjust their inventory. The Boutique Fuels Reduction Act of 2005 allows for a temporary waiver of fuel regulations in the motor fuel distribution system. The Administrator must define the term 'motor fuel distribution system' through rulemaking. Regulations to implement the waiver must be promulgated within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. This waiver authority does not limit other waiver authorities of the Administrator. The Administrator has the authority to issue waivers for fuel regulations in the motor fuel distribution system, subjecting States or individuals to enforcement actions solely related to actions taken under the waiver. SEC. 3. CAP ON NUMBER OF BOUTIQUE FUELS. Section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Clean Air Act is amended to restrict the approval of new fuels that would increase the total number of fuels approved in State implementation plans. The Administrator cannot approve any fuel unless it was already implemented in at least one State plan. The Clean Air Act restricts the approval of new fuels that would increase the total number of fuels in State implementation plans. The Administrator can approve new fuels only if they replace existing fuels without increasing the total number of approved fuels. States can still require the use of registered fuel additives. SEC. 4. STUDY AND REPORT TO CONGRESS ON BOUTIQUE FUELS. The Administrator and the Secretary will conduct a study on the effects of State plan provisions on air quality, fuel blends, availability, fungibility, and costs. The focus is on developing a Federal fuels system to maximize fuel fungibility, supply, preserve air quality, and reduce price volatility. The study will also assess the need for cleaner fuel reformulations to help states comply with air quality standards. The Administrator and the Secretary will coordinate with affected parties to gather comments on the air quality impact assessment and fuel-related aspects of the study. A task force will be appointed to provide information and assist in developing recommendations for the report to Congress. The Administrator and the Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 12 months of the enactment of the Act, including recommended regulatory and legislative changes. $500,000 is authorized for the completion of the required study. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy."
