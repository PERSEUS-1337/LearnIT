    "content": "Congressional hearings, news reports, and the film Blood Diamond have raised awareness about conflict minerals, defined as minerals mined in conditions of armed conflict and human rights abuses, particularly in the DRC. The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative aims for transparency in resource extraction payments, involving sponsoring countries, extractive companies, and NGOs. Dodd-Frank added sections addressing armed conflicts in the DRC and the transparency of resource extraction payments. The Dodd-Frank Act added sections to address conflict minerals and resource extraction payments, requiring SEC regulations for disclosure by publicly traded companies. Section 1502 mandates disclosure of conflict mineral origins, while Section 1504 requires disclosure of payments for oil, gas, or minerals development. SEC rules have faced legal challenges. The SEC must require publicly traded companies to disclose annually the origins of conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries, due to concerns about funding conflict and violence in the region. Companies must report on their due diligence and chain of custody for these minerals. The SEC voted to adopt final rules requiring publicly traded companies to disclose information on their use of conflict minerals, as defined by Dodd-Frank. This includes reporting on the chain of custody and products manufactured that are not DRC conflict free. Companies with conflict minerals necessary for their products must file a Form SD report disclosing information. They must conduct a country of origin inquiry in good faith. If minerals did not come from the DRC or adjoining countries, or are recycled, this must be disclosed. If minerals are from the DRC or adjoining countries and not recycled, due diligence on the source is required. When dealing with conflict minerals, companies must exercise due diligence on the source and chain of custody. Depending on the results, a Conflict Minerals Report may be required, detailing due diligence efforts and product information. The company must follow a recognized due diligence framework and disclose steps taken to mitigate risks if minerals benefit armed groups. The SEC requires companies to disclose the source and chain of custody of conflict minerals if no recognized due diligence framework exists. Products not DRC conflict free must provide details on processing facilities, country of origin, and efforts to determine mine origin. Recycled or scrap sourced products may be considered conflict free. Critics argue compliance costs are excessive despite due diligence efforts. The National Association of Manufacturers, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Business Roundtable challenged the SEC's rule on conflict minerals, citing issues with cost-benefit analysis, lack of de minimis exception, and burdensome due diligence requirements. The SEC's rule on conflict minerals was criticized for being burdensome and inconsistent, requiring companies to trace minerals back to their source. The rule was seen as violating the First Amendment by forcing companies to label their products as not DRC conflict free, even if they couldn't trace the minerals' origins. Amnesty International intervened in the case to defend against these issues. Amnesty International defended the SEC's conflict minerals rule in a case involving human rights violations. The court ruled in favor of the SEC, stating that it complied with the Administrative Procedure Act and did not violate the First Amendment. The plaintiffs' arguments were categorized into claims regarding APA compliance and First Amendment rights. The court discussed the narrow \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard for agency actions, emphasizing that the court cannot substitute its judgment for the agency's. The Chevron test limits a court's role in reviewing agency interpretations of statutes, requiring a rational connection between the agency's interpretation and its choice. The court applies the Chevron test to determine if Congress has directly spoken on the issue or if the agency's interpretation is permissible. The district court examined plaintiffs' claim regarding the SEC's analysis of costs and benefits of a rule under the Securities Exchange Act. The court disagreed with the plaintiffs' argument that the SEC was required to evaluate whether the Conflict Mineral Rule would achieve the social benefits Congress envisioned. The court stated that the Exchange Act provisions cited by the plaintiffs did not require the type of analysis they claimed was necessary. The court also noted that previous D.C. Circuit Court cases cited by the plaintiffs were based on shortcomings on the Commission's part. The court found that the SEC was not required to evaluate if the Conflict Mineral Rule would achieve the humanitarian benefits Congress intended. It stated that previous cases cited by the plaintiffs highlighted the Commission's shortcomings in considering economic implications, but the SEC's role was to promote the benefits identified by Congress. The court concluded that the SEC satisfied the Chevron test's requirement for a permissible interpretation of the statute. The SEC appropriately considered factors required by the Exchange Act, deferred to Congress's determination on humanitarian benefits, and satisfied the Chevron test for a permissible interpretation of the statute. Plaintiffs argued for a de minimis exception, but the SEC's interpretation of its authority was upheld. The SEC did not have the authority to set a de minimis threshold, and its decision not to provide an exception was deemed arbitrary by plaintiffs. The SEC argued that it had the power to exempt certain classes of persons or transactions under the Exchange Act, but chose not to create a de minimis exception. The district court sided with the SEC, agreeing that it was within its discretion to decline a de minimis exception. The court upheld the SEC's decision not to adopt a de minimis exception, finding it reasonable and within the SEC's discretion. Plaintiffs argued that the rule requiring due diligence and reports for minerals originating in the DRC was inconsistent with the statute, but the court determined that the SEC's interpretation was permissible as the statute was ambiguous. The court found the SEC's extension of the conflict minerals rule to be reasonable and permissible under Chevron Step One and Step Two. Plaintiffs argued that the rule should only apply to issuers that manufacture products themselves, but the court found the statute to be ambiguous on this point. The term \"manufacture\" was deemed inherently ambiguous, and both parties presented credible arguments, suggesting Congress did not clearly define its meaning in the statute. The court found the SEC's conflict minerals rule extension reasonable under Chevron Step One and Step Two. The term \"manufacture\" was deemed ambiguous, allowing the rule's application to issuers that contract to manufacture. Plaintiffs' arguments on arbitrariness and violation of the APA were dismissed by the court. The court upheld the SEC's conflict minerals rule extension, deeming the plaintiffs' concerns overinflated. It found that the requirement for companies to declare certain products as \"not found to be DRC conflict free\" on their websites did not violate First Amendment rights. The court determined that the public disclosure requirement aligned with the First Amendment. The SEC argued for a \"rational basis\" standard of review for the rules. The court upheld the SEC's conflict minerals rule extension, finding that the requirement for companies to declare certain products as \"not found to be DRC conflict free\" on their websites did not violate First Amendment rights. The court applied the \"rational basis\" standard to certain factual disclosure requirements, allowing disclosures related to preventing consumer deception. The D.C. District Court declined to apply this standard as the conflict minerals rules were not aimed at preventing consumer deception. Ultimately, the court decided based on commercial context. The court applied the \"intermediate scrutiny\" standard known as the Central Hudson test to the conflict minerals rule extension. The test requires a regulation to address a substantial government interest, directly advance that interest, and be narrowly tailored. NAM argued that the requirement to disclose \"DRC conflict free\" status did not directly advance the interest in promoting peace in the DRC. The court applied the \"intermediate scrutiny\" standard to the conflict minerals rule extension, requiring the regulation to address a substantial government interest, directly advance that interest, and be narrowly tailored. The plaintiffs argued that public disclosures of \"DRC conflict free\" status may not lead to peace promotion in the DRC. The court acknowledged the need for evidence of direct advancement but noted that in foreign relations, informed judgment can suffice. The court found that Congress's decision to enact the conflict minerals statute was based on informed judgment and that requiring disclosure from companies using these minerals would advance its interests in addressing funding for armed groups in the DRC. The plaintiff argued that the rules requiring companies to disclose their conflict mineral reports on their websites were burdensome, likening it to branding themselves with a \"scarlet letter\" of complicity in DRC atrocities. However, the court disagreed, stating that companies had the freedom to present the information in any manner they chose without prominently featuring the fact that their products were \"not found to be DRC conflict free.\" The court found that the regulations requiring companies to disclose conflict mineral reports on their websites were proportionate to Congress's goals and represented a reasonable fit between means and ends. NAM and other plaintiffs appealed the decision to the D.C. Circuit, which held that the SEC rule and statute violated the First Amendment but not the APA. The D.C. Circuit upheld the SEC rule on conflict minerals, finding that the SEC did not violate the APA or the Securities Exchange Act. The court rejected NAM's argument for a de minimis exception, stating that it could interfere with Congress's intent. The court upheld the SEC rule on conflict minerals, rejecting NAM's argument for a de minimis exception. The court also addressed the requirement for issuers to conduct due diligence if conflict minerals may have originated in covered countries, using Chevron reasoning to allow the SEC discretion in filling gaps in the statute. The court upheld the SEC rule on conflict minerals, rejecting NAM's argument for a de minimis exception. The SEC filled in gaps in the statute in a non-arbitrary manner, applying the rule to issuers that contract to manufacture products. The court found the SEC's different phase-in periods for large and small companies to be logical. The appeals court upheld the SEC rule on conflict minerals, rejecting NAM's argument for a de minimis exception. The court found no issues with the SEC's cost-benefit analysis and emphasized the SEC's obligation to promulgate a disclosure rule to promote peace and stability in the Congo. The appeals court upheld the SEC rule on conflict minerals, emphasizing the need to promote peace and stability in the Congo. The court questioned the factual nature of required disclosures but did not make a final decision on the issue, ultimately refusing to apply a rational basis standard. The appeals court refused to apply a rational basis standard for the SEC rule on conflict minerals, as disclosures were not deemed necessary to alleviate consumer deception. The court found that the regulations did not survive even intermediate scrutiny under the Central Hudson test, stating that narrower restrictions on expression could serve the government's interest just as well. The government failed to provide evidence that less restrictive means would be ineffective. The court found that the SEC rules on conflict minerals did not meet the standard of being narrowly tailored and violated the First Amendment. The association challenging the rules suggested less restrictive alternatives, but the SEC failed to provide evidence that these alternatives would be less effective. The dissent would have postponed the First Amendment decision until the full court had ruled on applying a rational basis standard to disclosure requirements. The United States District Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, sitting en banc, ruled that the rational basis standard of review could be applied to factual commercial disclosure requirements, even outside of the consumer deception context. This decision led to a rehearing of NAM v. SEC and also applied to the case of American Meat Institute v. USDA regarding meat producers disclosing the country of origin of their products. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the rational basis standard could be applied to factual commercial disclosure requirements, even beyond preventing consumer deception. The court found that the Zauderer standard's application extends beyond deception, as commercial speakers have a minimal First Amendment interest in disclosing factual information of interest to consumers. The court ruled that the Zauderer rational basis standard could be applied to factual and uncontroversial disclosure requirements beyond deception. This decision overruled a previous ruling and left open the question of applying the standard to SEC's conflict minerals rules. The court in NAM v. SEC questioned whether the SEC's conflict mineral disclosures were purely factual and uncontroversial. A rehearing was granted to decide the application of the Zauderer standard to the disclosure requirements. Despite the en banc court's ruling, the majority panel still held that Zauderer applies. The panel in NAM v. SEC questioned the application of the Zauderer standard to conflict mineral disclosures. Despite the en banc ruling in American Meat Institute, the majority held that Zauderer does not apply to the \"not DRC conflict free\" disclosure requirement for commercial speech. The panel found that the regulation would not survive scrutiny for commercial speech regulations. The relaxed standard of review in Zauderer only applies to disclosure requirements in advertisements, point-of-sale displays, and labeling. The panel in NAM v. SEC found that the Zauderer standard does not apply to compelled disclosures on companies' websites, as it only applies to voluntary commercial advertising, point-of-sale labeling, and advertisements. The panel in NAM v. SEC found that the Zauderer standard does not apply to compelled disclosures on companies' websites. The panel struck down the \"not found to be DRC conflict-free\" disclosure requirement, citing confusion in the courts about the application of Zauderer. Even if the en banc court's view in American Meat Institute controlled the analysis, the disclosure requirement would not survive review. The court must evaluate the government interest, effectiveness of the measure, and factual nature of the disclosures. The panel in NAM v. SEC found that the disclosure requirement failed to meet the effectiveness and factual nature criteria. The SEC provided little evidence that the rules would reduce funds flowing into the DRC or alleviate the conflict, with conflicting post-hoc evidence on the rules' impact. The panel in NAM v. SEC found that the disclosure rules may help achieve the government's goal but lacked sufficient evidence to withstand First Amendment scrutiny. The requirement to disclose products as \"not found to be DRC conflict mineral free\" was deemed not purely factual and uncontroversial information, failing the test in A merican M eat I nstitute's interpretation of Zauderer. The court did not define \"purely factual\" and \"uncontroversial,\" suggesting they are separate concepts for consideration. The panel in NAM v. SEC found that disclosure requirements, such as labeling products as \"not conflict free,\" were deemed controversial and interfered with freedom of speech under the First Amendment. The court concluded that the disclosure rules did not withstand scrutiny, even under A merican M eat I nstitute's interpretation of Zauderer. The SEC has asked the D.C. Circuit to rehear the case regarding disclosure requirements in NAM v. SEC, as it may have broader implications for governmental disclosure requirements. The dissent in the case would have upheld the disclosure requirements under Zauderer and Central Hudson standards. The SEC issued guidance on what covered companies must file for the required disclosures. The SEC issued guidance for covered companies on filing required disclosures under the conflict minerals rule. Companies must file reports addressing upheld parts of the rule. Companies not needing to file a Conflict Minerals Report should disclose their country of origin inquiry. Companies required to file should include due diligence descriptions. Products falling under specific categories on Form SD do not need to be labeled as \"DRC conflict undeterminable\" or \"not found to be 'DRC conflict free,'\" but should disclose production facilities, mineral origin, and efforts made. Section 1504 of Dodd-Frank requires resource extraction issuers to disclose payments made to foreign governments for oil, gas, or minerals development. The disclosure should include payment amounts for each project and to each government. The rules aim to support U.S. commitment to international transparency. The SEC issued final rules to implement Section 1504 of Dodd-Frank, requiring resource extraction issuers to disclose payments made to foreign governments for oil, gas, or minerals development. This includes reporting on Form SD and disclosing information related to the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals. The SEC rule required public disclosure of reports for activities involving payments to foreign governments for resource extraction. In response, industry groups filed a lawsuit, arguing that the rule violated the First Amendment and lacked a proper cost-benefit analysis. Plaintiffs claimed that the disclosure requirements could expose sensitive commercial information to competitors, impacting companies, employees, and shareholders. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in American Petroleum Institute v. Securities and Exchange Commission, finding that the SEC violated its duty to consider the public interest and burden upon competition. Oxfam International intervened in support of the rules. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, vacated the rule, and remanded it to the SEC for further proceedings. The First Amendment challenge and most Administrative Procedure Act arguments were not addressed by the court. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in American Petroleum Institute v. Securities and Exchange Commission, finding that the SEC violated its duty to consider the public interest and burden upon competition. The court vacated the rule due to substantial errors, including misreading the statute and arbitrary decision-making. The court applied Chevron's framework in its analysis of the rule's validity, emphasizing the need for agency adherence to congressional intent. The court vacated the SEC rule due to errors in statutory interpretation and lack of agency discretion. The SEC believed it was compelled by Congress to make annual reports publicly available, leading to the rule's invalidation. The court found that the SEC wrongly concluded that Section 1504 of Dodd-Frank required public disclosure of full payment information by resource extraction issuers. The statute only required the SEC to make a \"compilation of the information\" public to the extent practicable, without specifying that annual reports must be public. The SEC's arguments were deemed unpersuasive by the court. The court ruled that the SEC misinterpreted the requirement for public disclosure of annual reports under Section 1504 of Dodd-Frank. The SEC's argument that full reports must be publicly disclosed was deemed unpersuasive by the court, which stated that the statute only required a \"compilation of information\" to be made public. The court found that the term \"compilation\" can have various meanings and elements, and the SEC was not mandated by the statute to disclose all information. The court ruled that the SEC misinterpreted the requirement for public disclosure of annual reports under Section 1504 of Dodd-Frank. It stated that the commission was not required to make all information available annually but had a significant responsibility to evaluate and compile the information for disclosure. The court also rejected arguments from intervenor Oxfam, stating that the Securities Exchange Act does not mandate public filing of reports and allows for confidential treatment. The court disagreed with Oxfam's argument that the SEC's decision was reasonable and emphasized that regulations must be based on the agency's own judgment. The court also found the SEC's denial of exemptions for countries where disclosure is prohibited to be arbitrary and capricious, noting concerns about the impact on issuers' profitability and competitiveness. The court rejected the SEC's argument against adopting an exemption for the resource extraction provision, citing concerns about impact on profitability and competitiveness. The court emphasized the SEC's discretionary exemption authority and the need for reasoned decision-making in granting exemptions. The court rejected the SEC's reasoning for not providing an exemption from disclosure requirements, stating that an exemption is an exclusion from an obligation and not inconsistent with the statute. The court also disagreed with the SEC's argument that transparency objectives are best served by no exemptions. The court found the SEC's exemption analysis arbitrary and capricious, invalidating the rule. The SEC will not appeal and will consider issuing a new rule. The SEC will not appeal the court's decision and will undertake further proceedings to issue a new rule. Oxfam America has filed a lawsuit against the SEC for delaying the new resource extraction disclosure rule. The court ruled that SEC's delays violated the APA, requiring the SEC to publish a new rule. The SEC has been required by a judge to publish an expedited schedule for issuing a rule after missing the statutory deadline. The SEC's rules implementing Sections 1502 and 1504 of Dodd-Frank have been controversial, with a court upholding some parts but striking down others as a violation of the First Amendment. The U.S. District Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overruled a previous decision regarding the rational basis standard of review for these requirements. The SEC has faced legal challenges regarding rules for Sections 1502 and 1504 of Dodd-Frank. The D.C. District Court vacated the rules, leading to a lawsuit by Oxfam America. The SEC has not issued a new rule yet, prompting a court order for an expedited schedule. The final outcome remains uncertain. The status of rules for Sections 1502 and 1504 of Dodd-Frank remains unknown as of the date of this report."
