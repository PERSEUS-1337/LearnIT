    "content": "The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938 establishes the federal minimum wage for covered workers, with certain exemptions for workers with disabilities or youth workers. The act aims to protect workers and stimulate the economy, creating the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) within the Department of Labor to enforce its provisions. The initial minimum wage set in 1938 was $0.25 per hour, and it has been amended multiple times to expand coverage or raise the wage rate. The federal minimum wage has been raised 22 times since its establishment. The most recent change in 2007 increased the rate to $7.25 per hour. The Fair Labor Standards Act covers around 130 million workers, or 84% of the labor force, under two types of coverage - \"enterprise coverage\" and \"individual coverage.\" An enterprise must have at least two employees and annual sales of at least $500,000 to be covered. The Fair Labor Standards Act covers around 130 million workers, or 84% of the labor force, under two types of coverage - \"enterprise coverage\" and \"individual coverage.\" Enterprise coverage requires at least two employees and annual sales of $500,000. Individual coverage applies to employees regardless of the enterprise's sales volume. Employees of enterprises with less than $500,000 in annual sales may still be covered under the FLSA if they are engaged in interstate commerce activities. The definition of interstate commerce is broad and includes producing goods for shipment out of state, traveling to other states for work, communicating with individuals in other states, handling records for interstate transactions, or providing services to buildings where goods are produced for shipment outside the state. Certain exemptions exist for both employers and employees from FLSA minimum wage provisions. The FLSA provides exemptions for certain classes of workers from minimum wage coverage, such as executive, administrative, and professional employees. Workers employed on a casual basis for specific tasks like babysitting may also be exempt. Examples of workers not covered by FLSA minimum wage requirements include elected state or local government officials and individuals employed by seasonal establishments. Certain classes of workers are exempt from minimum wage coverage under the FLSA, including elected state or local government officials, seasonal establishment employees, agricultural workers, volunteers at nonprofit food banks, and certain youth workers who can be paid a subminimum wage of $4.25 per hour. Employers can pay youth under 20 a minimum wage of $4.25 per hour for the first 90 days. Special certificates allow employers to pay learners and full-time students below the federal minimum wage. Employers can also pay individuals with disabilities below the standard minimum wage with special certificates. The Wage and Hour Division of DOL allows employers to pay individuals with disabilities below the standard minimum wage if their earning capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury. Disabilities include blindness, mental illness, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, alcoholism, and drug addiction. Tipped employees can have their cash wage reduced to $2.13 per hour if they regularly receive more than $30 a month in tips, as long as their total earnings meet the federal minimum wage requirement. The tip credit allows employers to count an employee's tips towards the federal minimum wage. The maximum tip credit is $5.12 per hour. Approximately 2.2 million workers earn at or below the federal minimum wage, with 700,000 earning exactly $7.25 per hour and 1.5 million earning below that. Approximately 2.2 million workers earn at or below the federal minimum wage, with 700,000 earning exactly $7.25 per hour and 1.5 million earning below that. The Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that many individuals earning less than the minimum wage may not necessarily violate the law but could be due to exemptions or misreporting. Characteristics of minimum wage earners include being female, age 20 or older, part-time, and working in food service. States can set labor standards different from federal laws, with state laws applying if more protective of employees. As of January 1, 2017, 29 states and the District of Columbia have minimum wage rates above the federal rate of $7.25 per hour, ranging from $7.50 to $12.50. Some states have lower minimum wages than the FLSA, in which case FLSA-covered workers receive the federal minimum wage instead. Two states have minimum wage rates below the federal rate, while five have no minimum wage requirement. Individuals not covered by the FLSA are subject to lower state minimum wages. The federal minimum wage applies to individuals not covered by the FLSA, with varying rates across states. The effects of minimum wage changes are extensively studied in labor economics, with no universal consensus on outcomes. Proponents argue that raising wages can reduce poverty and increase earnings for lower-income workers. Increasing the minimum wage can help close the gap between earnings and the poverty line, benefiting low-income families. For example, a raise to $9 per hour would bring family earnings to 97% of the poverty line, and $12 per hour would increase it to 129%. Proponents also argue that higher wages lead to increased consumer spending, especially among lower-income households, which can stimulate the economy. A minimum wage increase could reduce earnings inequality and stimulate the economy. Wage compression may occur if higher pay for minimum wage earners leads to freezes or reductions in pay for higher earners. This could narrow the gap between low-wage and high-wage earners within businesses and across the economy. Higher wages may also encourage workers to stay in their jobs longer. A higher minimum wage may lead to reduced turnover costs for businesses. Opponents argue that it could result in increased unemployment or reduced hours worked. In a competitive labor market model, a minimum wage increase typically leads to employment losses. The minimum wage may not effectively reduce poverty as it is not targeted towards low-income households. It can also lead to higher prices for consumers and potentially decrease profits for businesses. The ability of a business to lower profits to pay for mandated minimum wage increases depends on the firm's profit margins."
