    "content": "The \"Border Tunnel Prevention Act of 2011\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section highlights key points related to border tunnel prevention. Congress finds that as the US-Mexico border becomes more secure, trafficking organizations are increasing the number of tunnels to enter the US. These tunnels are primarily used for transporting narcotics but can also be used for people and contraband. Law enforcement has discovered 137 tunnels between 1990 and 2011, with a significant increase in California since 2001. Since 2001, there has been a significant increase in the number of border tunnels discovered in California. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2007 criminalizes the construction or financing of unauthorized tunnels across the US border. Anyone convicted of using a tunnel for smuggling faces enhanced sentencing. The Department of Homeland Security Act criminalizes unauthorized border tunnels, leading to enhanced sentencing for smuggling through tunnels. Additional sentence enhancements could deter tunnel activities and provide more prosecutorial options. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
