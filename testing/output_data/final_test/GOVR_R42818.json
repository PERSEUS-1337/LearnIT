    "content": "This report examines the impacts of wind generation on competitive power markets, focusing on financial and economic effects on electric power generators. It aims to provide context for understanding the economic implications of wind power generation and addresses specific questions about market interaction. The analysis is based on data from competitive electricity markets managed by regional transmission operators or independent system operators. The report focuses on the impacts of wind generation on competitive power markets, specifically analyzing three RTO/ISO organizations: MISO, PJM, and ERCOT. These RTOs were chosen to narrow the scope of the analysis due to their significant wind power generation impact. The report does not discuss wind power market impacts in cost-of-service markets or federally owned transmission systems. Wind electricity generation in the US has seen rapid growth, with installed capacity increasing from 1,500 MW in 1992 to a new milestone in August 2012. In August 2012, the U.S. wind industry reached 50,000 MW of installed capacity, with 3% of electricity generated in 2011 coming from wind power. Growth is driven by state and federal policies, such as renewable portfolio standards (RPS) in 29 states and incentives supporting wind electricity generation. Federal incentives for wind electricity generation include tax credits and depreciation benefits for qualified projects. These incentives provide economic benefits and help reduce the financial impact on rate payers in states with renewable energy requirements. Qualified wind projects can receive a production tax credit or an investment tax credit, with the production tax credit currently set at 2.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. These incentives are scheduled to end on January 1, 2013. The growth of U.S. wind power has led to challenges in power markets, with integration studies analyzing transmission system challenges. Some electricity markets have experienced lower wholesale prices linked to wind power generation, impacting conventional power generators. Reports suggest that these low prices are distorting markets and hindering new capacity builds for electric system reliability. The impact of wind power on competitive electricity markets is complex and varies regionally. Studies show that additional wind power can reduce wholesale prices and benefit consumers. However, the financial performance of electricity generators in these markets is influenced by various factors, making it difficult to quantify the direct impact of wind power. A comprehensive analysis of how wind power affects each market is beyond the scope of this report. The report focuses on how wind power is integrated into competitive markets in the United States. It provides an overview of important concepts and definitions related to wholesale electric power markets and the financial economics of power generators. The report discusses the integration of wind power into wholesale power markets in the United States, operated by RTO/ISO organizations. These entities balance electricity supply and demand through market price mechanisms. Wind power's impact on other generators varies based on market structure and dispatch rules. In wholesale electricity markets, power is dispatched based on lowest marginal cost, determined by fuel cost and plant efficiency. RTO/ISO organizations request price bids from generators, arranging them into a dispatch curve. Factors like generator types, season, congestion, and demand level influence the curve and clearing price. Transmission congestion can occur when power demand exceeds the capacity of transmission infrastructure. RTOs manage generation to avoid exceeding transfer limitations. Economic dispatch relies on sufficient transmission capability to deliver power efficiently. System operators adjust output of generating units to balance transmission line loading. Transmission congestion occurs when power demand exceeds transmission infrastructure capacity. RTOs manage generation to avoid exceeding transfer limitations. Economic dispatch relies on sufficient transmission capability for efficient power delivery. LMPs reflect individual prices for different zones/nodes within the RTO's system, affected by transmission constraints leading to different prices in areas. In competitive power markets, prices vary due to transmission congestion. Different areas have different prices to manage constraints. Generators can earn revenue from energy sales, capacity payments, and ancillary services. Energy sales are the main revenue source for generators in competitive markets. In competitive power markets, sales are the primary revenue source for generators. Each wholesale power market varies in revenue opportunities, with PJM having both capacity and energy markets, while ERCOT only has an energy market. This report focuses on energy sales impacts, with a comparison of generation and wind capacity among MISO, PJM, and ERCOT. RTOs have different levels of wind penetration and market types, with notable differences in capacity markets. RTOs manage various markets including day-ahead and real-time energy sales, with 95% of sales in the day-ahead market and 5% in the real-time market. Real-time prices are more volatile, reflecting deviations in forecasted versus actual load and generation. Wind-influenced negative prices can occur in the real-time market. Generators in RTO/ISO power markets can enter into bilateral power purchase contracts with load serving entities to establish consistent electricity prices. These contracts reduce the risk of low wholesale power prices and provide a stable revenue stream. The mechanism for settling the power purchase price is referred to as contracts for differences. Contracts for differences settle the difference between market clearing price and power purchase price in bilateral contracts. Short-term bilateral contracts may impact generator's ability to negotiate future contracts due to low wholesale prices. RTOs use uplift/make-whole payments to incentivize offering electricity at marginal cost. These payments compensate generators if revenue is less than operating costs. Contracts for differences do not guarantee dispatch or a threshold rate of return but provide assurance that generators might not operate at a loss. To obtain financial capital for a new power generating facility, a revenue, operations, and profitability plan is needed to recover all installation costs over the asset's lifetime. Typically, capital cost recovery occurs within 20 to 30 years of plant operations. Project developers require assurance that revenue from energy sales, capacity markets, and ancillary services will cover all necessary costs and provide a financial return. In wholesale power markets, older generators that have fully recovered costs may find it more lucrative than newer plants still recovering capital costs. Negative wholesale electricity prices can occur in competitive markets due to transmission congestion and low-priced bids from generators. In wholesale power markets, negative LMPs can occur in areas with transmission congestion, leading to some generators accepting negative prices to continue being dispatched. This can be due to factors such as maintenance costs exceeding the temporary negative price event or technical difficulties with cycling nuclear plants. In wholesale power markets, various factors influence wholesale electric power prices, including economic activity, weather, fuel prices, transmission congestion, and zero marginal cost generation. Wholesale prices are bid based on the marginal cost of production and cleared at the intersection of supply bid and load demand. For example, the MISO 2011 state-of-the-market report noted lower wholesale market prices in 2011 compared to 2010. Incentives like the production tax credit for wind power projects encourage continuous operation of nuclear plants. The 2011 state-of-the-market report highlights lower wholesale market prices compared to 2010 due to decreased natural gas prices and loads. Natural gas generation influences peak demand prices, while weather conditions and transmission congestion can also impact clearing prices. The addition of zero marginal cost generation may further reduce market clearing prices. Since 2008, wholesale power prices in all RTO markets have declined, with substantial decreases in some markets. This decline is attributed to lower natural gas generation costs, reduced electricity demand, and the 2008 financial crisis. Increased U.S. natural gas production also contributed to lower prices. The use of drilling techniques led to low natural gas prices, resulting in low costs for natural gas electricity generation. This impacted market clearing prices during peak demand times, affecting power generators' revenues and margins. Studies have examined the impact of wind power on wholesale electricity prices and system reliability. The addition of wind power capacity in competitive power markets can lower electricity market clearing prices. Proponents argue this benefits consumers by reducing power prices, while opponents claim it distorts markets and impacts existing generation assets. Both views assume energy sales are the only revenue source for electric power assets. The addition of wind power capacity in competitive power markets can lower electricity market clearing prices. Wind projects must capture revenue to pay for capital, operations, and maintenance costs. Electricity markets are complex and can include multiple revenue opportunities. The impact of lower market clearing prices from increased wind power production is uncertain and can be influenced by various factors. The PJM market monitor report states that wind power displaces output from other generation types, affecting the output of marginal units. Wind power has the lowest fuel cost, followed by nuclear power. As generation becomes more fuel intensive, the marginal price increases based on fuel cost and plant efficiency. The wholesale electricity clearing price determines compensation for generators based on bids. Additional wind power can lower the clearing price by shifting the dispatch curve. The addition of more wind power reduces the value received by wind projects and other power suppliers in wholesale markets by shifting the dispatch curve to the right, lowering the electricity clearing price. This could result in less electricity from other fuel sources. Figure 5 illustrates the economic supply and dispatch curves for ERCOT, PJM, and CAISO to show how wind power affects wholesale power prices. In 2009, PJM conducted a study on the impact of adding 15,000 MW of wind power, which would decrease wholesale market prices by $4.50 per MWh. This would lead to a reduction in market-wide expenditures for wholesale power. Additionally, power generators may have pre-negotiated contracts with load serving entities, and can also contract with LSEs to meet capacity needs. Other market factors, such as economic activity, can also influence wholesale power prices. The impact of wind power on wholesale market prices can lead to opportunities for power generators to earn additional revenue. Reports suggest a positive correlation between wind electricity generation and negative real-time electricity prices in some locations. The extent of the impact on other generators will vary based on factors such as location, contractual conditions, and cost recovery. The ability of wind to bid negatively priced electricity is a result of federal production tax credit incentives and the potential opportunity to sell renewable energy credits. Each generator operates under different contractual conditions and transmission constraints, leading to varying impacts of negative wholesale prices on a case-by-case basis. The impact of negative prices on power generators' revenue is uncertain due to various factors such as contractual conditions, transmission constraints, and revenue sources. Factors like fuel prices, weather, and electricity demand also influence power generation revenues and margins. Time-of-day plays a crucial role, with wind power generation being highest during nighttime and off-peak hours. Wind power generation is highest during nighttime and off-peak demand periods, leading to lower wholesale prices. Conversely, during peak demand periods, wind power generation is lowest, resulting in higher wholesale prices. Negative power prices associated with wind power typically occur at night when wind production is high, potentially causing transmission congestion and negatively priced wholesale power in certain locations. This can impact generator revenues and margins, especially during peak demand periods when wind power generation is lower, allowing other suppliers to take advantage of high-price periods. Wind power generation peaks during night time, leading to potential non-dispatch of traditional base load generators in certain locations. Each RTO has a unique generation mix and capacity, impacting generators differently during negative price events. MISO, PJM, and ERCOT have experienced negative prices, with MISO hubs showing concentration of such events. The introduction of the Dispatchable Intermittent Resources (DIR) program in 2011 enabled price setting in MISO by wind resources. Wind generation can be dispatched up or down based on production forecasts, giving MISO more control over the variable nature of wind power generation. According to MISO's Independent Market Monitor (IMM), DIRs are treated comparable to other dispatchable generation and are eligible for all uplift payments. By June 2013, most wind units in MISO will be Dispatchable Intermittent Resources (DIRs) eligible for uplift payments and operating requirements. In 2011, wind power generation influenced wholesale electricity prices, with some periods showing an average price of negative $20 per MWh attributed to federal production tax credits. The availability of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and lower natural gas prices contributed to a 1.9% decline in average real-time energy prices in the MISO market area in 2011 compared to 2010. In 2011, wind power influenced wholesale electricity prices in the MISO market area. Wind and solar units were the only ones making negative price offers in PJM energy markets. Approximately 935.5 MW of wind resources were offered at a negative price in PJM's real-time market in 2011. In 2011, wind power in PJM's market area made negative price offers due to federal incentives and renewable energy credit opportunities. Wind generators had incentives to generate until the negative price equaled the credits received. Wind represented 2% of real-time energy market generation and 1.5% of total electricity generation in PJM. In 2011, wind power in ERCOT, Texas, caused negative wholesale electricity prices due to high wind power capacity. The West Zone had the most real-time negative price events, with over 10,600 MW of wind power installed out of 84,000 MW total capacity. In 2011, ERCOT experienced high wind power capacity leading to negative wholesale electricity prices, particularly in the West zone where over 90% of wind capacity is located. Wind generation in ERCOT is inversely correlated with load demand, with potential excess generation during nighttime hours. ERCOT may need to balance supply and demand by ramping down generation or utilizing down-balancing-energy services from generators. Wind generators in ERCOT can offer down-balancing-energy services with negative price offers due to federal production tax credits and renewable energy credits. The PUCT is working on transmission infrastructure through the CREZ Transmission Program to transmit wind power from West Texas to other load centers in the state. The CREZ Transmission Program aims to reduce negative price frequency in ERCOT's West zone by transmitting wind power to other demand centers. However, generators in other ERCOT hubs are concerned about potential revenue and margin pressures from additional wind power. Wind power's impact on electricity markets is discussed in terms of real-time system operations and economic signals for all generators. The economic signals for building new power capacity are distorted due to reduced revenues and margins from wind power generation. Managing a large wind power fleet poses operational challenges for system operators in balancing supply and demand, requiring specific reserve capacity to respond to output variations. The need for specific reserve capacity to manage wind power output variations, including operating reserves and spinning reserves, is crucial for system operators. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has studied the challenges associated with integrating large amounts of wind power, as highlighted in the \"Eastern Wind Integration and Transmission Study (EWITS).\" The EWITS report suggests that expanding transmission infrastructure can address operational challenges with large wind power amounts. Some U.S. power system operators are facing issues with wind generation and are implementing solutions like the DIR program by MISO. Curtailment policies and improved wind forecasting are also being used to manage wind output variability. RTO system operators monitor power generation resources for reliability and resource adequacy, measured by reserve margins. Wind power may reduce market clearing prices and contribute to negative locational marginal prices. Wind power reduces economic signals for new power generation investment, potentially leading to declining reserve margins and system reliability risks. Wholesale electricity prices, influenced by factors like demand and market design, play a crucial role in revenue generation for power generators in different RTOs. MISO, PJM, and ERCOT have varying market designs and approaches to addressing resource adequacy and reserve margin issues. Both MISO and PJM operate a capacity market to provide income to generators needed for system reliability. With more variable energy sources, the premium for reserve capacity could increase, changing revenue profiles for power generators. RTOs assign capacity credits to estimate resource adequacy and reserve margins. ERCOT operates an energy/ancillary services market. Capacity credits are assigned by RTOs to generators based on their ability to supply power during peak demand. Wind generators typically receive lower capacity credits due to the variable nature of wind power. In MISO, wind generators receive a 14.9% capacity credit, while PJM assigns a 13% capacity credit. This means a 100 MW wind project in PJM would only contribute 13 MW towards resource adequacy. Coal or nuclear generators, on the other hand, may be assigned 80% to 85% capacity credits. The 2011 MISO State of the Market report shows an inverse relationship between wind generation and capacity margins. The relationship between wind generation and capacity margins affects capacity credits and market transactions. As wind generation increases, capacity margins may decrease, leading to higher capacity values in the market. Economic signals are needed to stimulate additional capacity for target reserve margins. Power system reliability and resource adequacy in RTO markets are influenced by various factors, such as market conditions and generation mix. Unlike PJM and MISO, ERCOT only has an energy market, which poses challenges for ensuring adequate generation capacity and reserve margins. The study highlights that market conditions, wind penetration, and environmental regulations pose challenges for new capacity additions in ERCOT. Despite environmental regulations not significantly affecting system reliability, the combination of low prices, demand, and compliance could impact resource adequacy in RTO-managed markets. The future of production tax credit (PTC) incentives for wind projects in RTO-managed markets is a key policy issue. The PTC has supported U.S. wind industry growth since 1992, but incentives will no longer be available for new projects starting January 1, 2013. Debate surrounds the financial and economic impacts of extending the PTC, with proponents citing job creation, environmental benefits, energy supply diversification, and potential consumer cost reductions. Opponents argue that wind is a mature technology that no longer needs federal subsidies. The debate over extending production tax credits (PTC) for wind projects continues, with proponents highlighting job creation, environmental benefits, and energy supply diversification. Opponents argue that wind is a mature technology that no longer needs federal subsidies. The Senate Finance Committee introduced the Family and Business Tax Cut Certainty Act of 2012, which includes an extension of PTC availability for wind facilities until January 1, 2014. This bill also allows projects that start construction by January 1, 2014 to qualify for PTC incentives. The modification allows wind projects starting construction by January 1, 2014 to qualify for PTC incentives, alleviating investment pressures. Wind power can impact wholesale power prices by reducing market clearing prices and contributing to negative price events in certain locations and times. Financial impacts are unclear due to the complex nature of wholesale power markets and various variables. Independent market monitor reports for selected RTOs indicate wind power's potential to contribute to negative price events. Wind power can impact wholesale power prices by contributing to negative price events, especially at night when generation is high and demand is low. However, during peak demand when prices are high, wind generation is typically low. Some studies suggest wind power could affect reliability and resource adequacy, but each RTO has market designs to incentivize these factors. If wind power continues to grow, it is uncertain if current market designs will ensure availability of necessary generation. The text discusses the need for different types of generation to maintain resource adequacy and manage the variable nature of wind power."
