    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"States' Rights and Second and Tenth Amendment Restoration Act of 2001\". Congressional findings state that domestic violence is a serious crime in the United States and should be punished accordingly. States, not the Federal Government, should have the authority to classify domestic violence offenses as misdemeanors or felonies. The Lautenberg amendment is criticized for overstepping federal authority and violating states' rights without a proven connection to interstate commerce. The Lautenberg amendment is deemed unconstitutional under the tenth amendment and oversteps Congress's power to regulate commerce. Gun control laws in cities with high gun violence incidents are strict, indicating the amendment may not reduce domestic violence. State and Federal judges can already restrict firearm possession for misdemeanors. The amendment is criticized as an unfunded Federal mandate. The Lautenberg amendment is an unfunded Federal mandate that imposes lifetime bans on firearm ownership for misdemeanors, not just felonies. It is criticized for violating constitutional due process and being an ex post facto law. Law-abiding citizens use guns for self-defense, with women defending against sexual assault in up to 200,000 cases annually. Section 658 of Public Law 104-208 imposes lifetime gun bans on individuals for misdemeanor offenses, potentially disarming millions of citizens, including battered women who may need firearms for self-protection. The law has been criticized for its impact on individuals who committed minor offenses without a jury trial. Section 658 of Public Law 104-208 imposes lifetime gun bans on individuals for misdemeanor offenses, potentially disarming many law enforcement officers and servicemen. The law ignores the issue of domestic violence by allowing truly violent offenders to plea-bargain down to misdemeanors. The purpose of this Act is to restore States' rights, the tenth amendment, and second amendment freedoms. SEC. 3. REPEALER.\n\nSection 658 of Public Law 104-208, which imposes lifetime gun bans for misdemeanor offenses, is repealed. Any liabilities incurred by individuals due to this section are extinguished.\n\nSEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\nThis Act shall take effect retroactively as part of Public Law 104-208. Any penalties or forfeitures under section 658 are nullified."
