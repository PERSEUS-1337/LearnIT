The Act applies to contracts above $2,000 and is enforced through the Copeland Act, which requires weekly wage reporting and proper deductions. The Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 mandates minimum wages for laborers on federal construction contracts, enforced through the Copeland Act. Some states have enacted similar laws. The act raises questions about its impact on workers, the construction industry, and federal contracting. The Davis-Bacon Act mandates minimum wages for laborers on federal construction contracts, determined by the Department of Labor. It may or may not be a union wage, depending on prevailing rates. The Act is administered by the Department of Labor to ensure fair wages without inflating the cost of federal contracts. The Davis-Bacon Act determines prevailing wages for federal projects based on locality, which may not always reflect the actual market rate. The Act is based on wage rates across different types of construction in each jurisdiction. The potential savings from repealing or modifying the Act's scope are uncertain due to limited empirical evidence available. The Davis-Bacon Act's impact on saving money for federal construction consumers is uncertain due to limited empirical evidence and challenges in accessing and reviewing relevant documentation. The Davis-Bacon Act's impact on construction contracts is complex, as analysts must consider if the same contractor would have been chosen without the Act, how the contract would have been managed differently, and if wages and workforce utilization would have been affected. Public agencies face similar challenges in investigating the Act's impact, with constraints on funding and staff time. The Davis-Bacon Act's impact on construction contracts is complex, with historical uncertainties surrounding its suspension by past administrations like Franklin Roosevelt and George W. Bush. Limited documentation is available, and the rationale for the suspension remains unclear. The current state of research may not fully justify the potential positive or negative impacts of changing the statute. The Davis-Bacon Act, originally enacted in 1931, allowed for suspension during national emergencies. In 1934, a conflict arose between this act and the National Industrial Recovery Act, leading Roosevelt to declare a national emergency and suspend the Davis-Bacon Act. In 1934, President Roosevelt declared a national emergency and suspended the Davis-Bacon Act due to administrative confusion and delay caused by its concurrent operation with the National Industrial Recovery Act. The impact of the suspension was not immediately felt, with building trades unions protesting that it was the \"beginning of a national wage-cut campaign.\" In June 1934, President Roosevelt restored the Davis-Bacon Act after suspending it due to administrative issues. The act was reinstated quietly, with little notice in the press. The AFL-CIO Executive Council discussed the act in 1971 during a meeting in Florida, demanding labor standards in pending legislation. The AFL-CIO Executive Council discussed pending legislation before Congress, including the Davis-Bacon Act, which they supported for labor standards. They rejected the Administration's approach and proposed their own diversified program for federal financial aid to state and local governments. The Council also addressed the Nixon Administration's proposals in the Baker-Betts bills. The AFL-CIO Council discussed the Baker-Betts bills, emphasizing the importance of federal performance standards for civil rights and fair labor practices in projects supported by federal grants. They also highlighted the significance of the Davis-Bacon Act in ensuring prevailing wages and preventing worker exploitation in federal contracts. President Nixon met with the Construction Industry Collective Bargaining Commission to address concerns about the wage-price structure in the construction industry. Various options were discussed, including the suspension of the Davis-Bacon Act. President Nixon set a 30-day deadline for the construction industry to resolve issues, with discussions on suspending the Davis-Bacon Act. The AFL-CIO met to address the deadline, and President Nixon awaited Secretary Hodgson's report on holding down wages and prices in construction. Secretary Hodgson met with industry leaders and promised action to address issues in the construction industry. He highlighted the high construction wage increases and emphasized the need for more reasonable settlements and wage stability, with $14 billion of the federal budget allocated to construction in the next fiscal year. Secretary Hodgson met with industry leaders to address issues in the construction industry, emphasizing the need for reasonable settlements and wage stability. President Nixon later suspended the Davis-Bacon Act provisions regarding wage rates on federal construction projects. President Nixon suspended the Davis-Bacon Act provisions on federal construction projects due to concerns about excessive wage increases during a period of inflation. He believed that the law, enacted in 1931, was no longer suitable for the current high-wage environment in the construction industry. President Nixon suspended the Davis-Bacon Act provisions in 1971, stating that the preferential arrangement did not benefit the construction industry or the public during a time of rising wages. The suspension aimed to encourage a more responsible wage/price policy, rather than being a direct attack on the act itself. President Nixon suspended the Davis-Bacon Act in 1971 due to emergency conditions in the construction industry. He advised industry and labor to work together to find solutions to the problems causing the emergency. The Act was reinstated later, with the President's support for contractors and labor leaders in carrying out their responsibilities. President Nixon suspended the Davis-Bacon Act in 1971 following the AFL-CIO Council meeting in Florida. The Secretary discussed wage and price control plans with labor representatives in Miami but could not secure voluntary assurances. The President chose to suspend relevant provisions of the Act as an alternative to imposing wage controls, believing it would be effective in addressing prevailing wage issues in federal construction. President Nixon suspended the Davis-Bacon Act in 1971 to address prevailing wage issues in federal construction. The Secretary believed this action would lead to more reasonable settlements in the industry. Organized labor, however, criticized the suspension as punitive against workers and a windfall for non-union contractors. President Nixon's suspension of the Davis-Bacon Act in 1971 was seen as a windfall for non-union contractors, allowing them to bid competitively and pay lower wages. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce welcomed the action, as they had long fought to remove Davis-Bacon from the statute books. The interrelationship between state and federal laws on prevailing wage issues was also highlighted, with many states having their own prevailing wage protection laws in place. In the 1970s, President Nixon suspended the Davis-Bacon Act, allowing states to enact their own prevailing wage laws on federally-funded projects. New York State affirmed that state prevailing wage laws would still apply on federally-assisted projects. Ohio's Governor John Gilligan criticized the suspension of the Davis-Bacon Act by President Nixon, stating it was \"misdirected\" and lacked consideration. He highlighted Ohio's own prevailing wage law and the impact on road contracts with federal funding. Ohio's Governor John Gilligan criticized President Nixon's suspension of the Davis-Bacon Act, stating it was \"misdirected\" and lacked consideration. He emphasized Ohio's prevailing wage law and its impact on road contracts with federal funding. Despite the uncertainty, the state informed bidders to comply with state law, resulting in bids awarded to union contractors below estimates. The state affirmed it would not suspend its law, ensuring stability in the construction industry. Peter G. Nash, U.S. Solicitor of the Department of Labor, stated that the President's suspension of the Davis-Bacon Act overrides state 'little Davis-Bacon laws' in federally assisted construction projects. This has led to a new federal-state conflict, potentially restricting state and local decision-making. Industry leaders and government representatives, guided by John Dunlop, are working to address issues in the construction sector following the Act's suspension. Some believe the suspension has not been entirely successful. The suspension of the Davis-Bacon Act, overseen by Assistant Secretary of Labor Arthur Fletcher, was seen as a move to diminish union influence in the construction industry. Despite some challenges in implementation, the Administration realized the legal complexities involved in the suspension. President Nixon reinstated the Davis-Bacon Act on March 29, 1971, establishing a Construction Industry Stabilization Committee to stabilize wages and prices in the construction industry. Contractors and labor leaders were willing to cooperate with the government for greater stability. President Nixon reinstated the Davis-Bacon Act on March 29, 1971, establishing a Construction Industry Stabilization Committee to stabilize wages and prices in the construction industry. Reaction to restoration was mixed, with attention shifting to broader wage and price restraints. The Nixon suspension of the Davis-Bacon Act had implications that were not entirely expected, calling into question the existence of the statute and sparking reactions from labor and critics alike. President Nixon reinstated the Davis-Bacon Act in 1971, but the suspension of the act was more complex than anticipated. The suspension was not intended to be long-term and was seen as a tactic to pressure parties, particularly organized labor, to take the Administration's wage/price policies seriously. The suspension of the Davis-Bacon Act under the Nixon Administration created confusion within the industry, with bidding continuing and projects underway. President Bush faced challenges leading up to the 1992 election, with criticism from his own party urging him to define his vision for effective governance. The suspension of the act was under consideration. The Bush Administration considered suspending the Davis-Bacon Act in early 1992, with senior officials and media reports confirming the possibility. Despite ongoing discussions, no action was taken immediately. White House Deputy Press Secretary Judy Smith confirmed in April 1992 that the suspension was still under consideration. The White House considered suspending the Davis-Bacon Act in 1992, with ongoing discussions and conflicting reports on the decision. Critics urged action, but the issue eventually faded from public view. Despite no identifiable emergency, the act was still under consideration behind the scenes. In October 1992, OMB sought comments on suspending the Davis-Bacon Act. President Bush declared a national emergency due to hurricanes, leading to the suspension of wage payment provisions under the Act. The suspension of the Davis-Bacon Act by President Bush in response to a national emergency raised questions about the criteria for such suspensions and the extent of presidential authority in disaster situations. The suspension of the Davis-Bacon Act by President Bush in response to a national emergency raised questions about the criteria for such suspensions and the extent of presidential authority in disaster situations. Some questioned the President's authority to selectively suspend the act, while others criticized the decision to send low-wage, low-skilled workers to hurricane-damaged areas where skilled tradesmen were needed. Georgine of the AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades Department called it a callous election-year move. President Bush signed Executive Order No. 12818, which addressed project labor agreements, following the suspension of the Davis-Bacon Act for hurricane relief efforts. Critics viewed this as a political move to gain business support in Florida and Louisiana, while some praised it as courageous. Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) supported President Bush's action to suspend the Davis-Bacon Act for hurricane relief efforts, creating new job opportunities in the affected areas. The Coalition to Reform the Davis-Bacon Act and the National Utility Contractor also expressed gratitude and highlighted the potential for job creation. President Clinton revoked Executive Order No. 12818 and reinstated project labor agreements in federal construction, creating job opportunities. This move pleased his supporters in organized labor. President Clinton pleased his political supporters in organized labor by revoking the prohibition on project labor agreements, which was initially suspended by George W. Bush. Clinton issued Proclamation No. 6534 to fully restore the Davis-Bacon Act within 15 days. In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck Florida and the Gulf Coast, causing one of the greatest natural disasters in U.S. history. Hurricane Katrina caused significant impact in the United States, leading to displacement of thousands of people and the availability of public and private funding for affected areas. Representative George Miller noted Republican attempts to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act, but the hurricane may have influenced the political agenda. The storm revealed pockets of poverty in New Orleans, highlighting issues of resource scarcity and transportation challenges for the vulnerable population. After Hurricane Katrina, poor residents in New Orleans faced a lack of resources and shelter. House Republicans urged the President to waive Davis-Bacon wage rules to expedite clean-up and reconstruction efforts in the Gulf Coast. Time was deemed crucial in the process. After Hurricane Katrina, House Republicans urged the President to suspend the Davis-Bacon Act to speed up reconstruction efforts in the Gulf Coast. They argued that the act drives up construction costs, causes delays, and discriminates against non-union workers. President Bush eventually suspended the act in specific areas of the country on September 8, 2005. President Bush suspended the Davis-Bacon Act in specific areas of the country after Hurricane Katrina to speed up reconstruction efforts. Representative Charlie Norwood praised the President for removing unnecessary bureaucracy that drives up costs, stating that the nation can't afford inefficiency and inflated costs during the rebuilding process. The suspension is expected to provide greater assistance to devastated communities. President Bush's suspension of the Davis-Bacon Act in hurricane-affected areas is seen as a move to aid in reconstruction efforts and create job opportunities. However, organized labor criticizes the decision, arguing that it could lead to exploitation of workers and lower wages. The New York Times editorializes that the suspension goes against principles of decency. Several bills were introduced in response to President Bush's suspension of the Davis-Bacon Act in hurricane-affected areas, including the CARE Act introduced by Representative Flake and a bill by Senator Barbara Boxer to give employment preference to displaced workers. Two bills were introduced to address the impact of Hurricane Katrina: S. 1763 aimed to provide employment preference to displaced workers and restore the Davis-Bacon Act, while H.Res. 467 requested information on wages and benefits for workers in Katrina recovery contracts. Another similar bill, H.Res. 488, was introduced by Representative Steve LaTourette. In response to Hurricane Katrina, bills were introduced to address employment preferences and the reinstatement of the Davis-Bacon Act. Republicans urged President Bush to rescind his proclamation and reinstate the act to prevent profiteering. In late October, about 20 Republicans met with the White House Chief of Staff. In late October, about 20 Republicans met with White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card, who acknowledged that there were no savings from suspending the Davis-Bacon Act. A change in policy was confirmed, with the Bush Administration reinstating the Act on November 8th. The Davis-Bacon Act prevailing wage requirements were reinstated for reconstruction projects in the hurricane-battered Gulf Coast region just two months after being suspended. Labor Secretary Elaine Chao stated that the administration would reinstate Davis-Bacon after reviewing current conditions in the declared areas. The suspension-related bills became moot under these circumstances."
