The \"ANCSA Shee Atika Land Exchange Settlement Act\" defines key terms such as Account, Agency, Agreement, and Cube Cove Land. The Cube Cove Land refers to approximately 23,000 acres of land in Admiralty Island, Alaska. The \"ANCSA Shee Atika Land Exchange Settlement Act\" defines terms like Property, Secretary, Segment, and Shee Atika. Shee Atika will receive consideration under the Agreement treated as if it were under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act allows for the receipt of land or cash to equalize property values. Shee Atika has the option to receive credits by writing to the Secretary before a closing of any segment of the Cube Cove Land. The Agreement does not impose any duties on Shee Atika not expressly stated. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act allows Shee Atika to receive credits or cash for property values equalization. Credits can be used to purchase property at public sale, while cash is paid if no election is made. The Secretary must make payments within 30 days of notification, regardless of other elections made. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act allows Shee Atika to receive credits or cash for property values equalization. The Secretary establishes the \"Shee Atika Account\" within 90 days of the election, where credits are deposited for Shee Atika to receive or make deposits. The Shee Atika Account allows for deposits into escrow for property sales, reinstatement of unused escrow deposits, and assignment of amounts with written notice. The balance is immediately available for Shee Atika's use and remains available until expended. Shee Atika can use funds from the Account to bid for and purchase property at public sales by agencies. Any property purchased will be considered a conveyance under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act."
