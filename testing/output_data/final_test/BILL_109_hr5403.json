    "content": "The \"Safe and Timely Interstate Placement of Foster Children Act of 2006\" encourages States to ratify the revised Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, implement deadlines for home studies, and promote expedited placement of children into safe, permanent homes across State lines. SEC. 3 amends the Social Security Act to require states to have procedures for interstate placement of children. Procedures under an interstate compact can satisfy this requirement. SEC. 4 addresses home studies. The Social Security Act is amended to require states to conduct home environment studies within 60 days of receiving a request from another state for assessing child placement suitability. The Social Security Act now requires states to conduct home environment studies within 60 days of a request for child placement assessment. If circumstances beyond the state's control delay the study, an additional 15 days may be granted with proper documentation and certification of the child's best interests. The State must complete the education and training parts of the home study for prospective foster or adoptive parents within the specified period. Reports from other States or Indian tribes can be accepted as meeting home study requirements, unless specific grounds are found within 14 days that would be contrary to the child's welfare. No restrictions can be imposed on State agencies overseeing the process. The State agency can contract with a private agency for home studies. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must report to Congress on States needing an extended compliance period for home study requirements. The Congress recommends that States use private agencies for home studies and recognize home study reports from other States or Indian tribes for foster care or adoption placements. Title IV of the Social Security Act is amended by adding a new section after 473A. SEC. 473B. Timely interstate home study incentive payments. The Secretary shall grant each home study incentive-eligible State an amount equal to the timely interstate home study incentive payment for the fiscal year, payable in the following fiscal year. A State qualifies if it has an approved plan, complies with requirements, and completes a timely interstate home study. Compliance includes providing necessary data for the fiscal year. The State must provide a written report to the Secretary for each fiscal year, detailing the total number of interstate home studies requested and completed, along with other required information to determine eligibility for home study incentives. The Secretary verifies data provided by States for timely interstate home studies and calculates incentive payments based on the number of studies completed. Payments are $1,500 per study, with adjustments if funds are insufficient. The total amount available for incentive payments in a fiscal year may be reduced based on previous payments. If payments are reduced, the Secretary must prioritize unpaid incentive payments from prior years before making new payments. The Secretary will pay each State the total amount of reductions made, with a pro rata adjustment if funds are insufficient. Payments to States under this section will be available for two years. The State can use the incentive payments through the next fiscal year for services to children or families. A home study evaluates if a proposed child placement meets their needs. The term 'interstate home study' refers to a study conducted by one State for another State to facilitate foster or adoptive placements. A 'timely interstate home study' is completed within 30 days of the request, providing a report on the results. Authorization of appropriations for payments under this section is limited to $10,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2007 to 2010. The amounts appropriated are authorized to remain available until expended. Additionally, effective October 1, 2010, section 473B of the Social Security Act is repealed. SEC. 5. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS: State agencies should fully cooperate with courts in locating parents of children in foster care or adoption, including sharing information from the Federal Parent Locator Service. \n\nSEC. 6. CASEWORKER VISITS: Amends the Social Security Act to allow private agencies to provide services in interstate placement cases and reduces required visits from 12 to 6.\n\nSEC. 7. HEALTH AND EDUCATION RECORDS: No further details provided. SEC. 7 amends Section 475 of the Social Security Act regarding health and education records for children in foster care. It includes provisions for the most recent information available and ensures that records are provided to the child at no cost when leaving foster care. SEC. 8 amends the Social Security Act to give foster parents and caregivers the right to be notified of any proceedings regarding a child in foster care. SEC. 9 amends the Social Security Act to improve court procedures for interstate placement of children, including cooperation between courts in different states and allowing information sharing without requiring interstate travel. SEC. 10 amends the Social Security Act to enhance efforts for interstate placements, permanency hearings, and concurrent planning. It includes considerations for in-State and out-of-State placements for children. SEC. 12 amends the Social Security Act to include considerations for in-State and out-of-State placement options in permanency hearings for children not returning to parents. SEC. 13 focuses on utilizing interjurisdictional resources effectively through contracts and eliminating legal barriers. SEC. 14 specifies the effective date of the amendments. The amendments made by this Act will take effect on October 1, 2006, applying to payments under parts B and E of the Social Security Act. If State legislation is required for compliance, the plan will not be considered non-compliant until after the first regular session of the State legislature following the date of determination. The amendments made by this Act will take effect on October 1, 2006, applying to payments under parts B and E of the Social Security Act. If State legislation is needed for compliance, the plan will not be considered non-compliant until after the first regular session of the State legislature following the date of determination. If the State has a 2-year legislative session, each year is considered a separate regular session. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
