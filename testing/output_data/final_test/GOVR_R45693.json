Tax equity transactions occur when a party transfers credit rights to a third party for financing. The tax equity market was estimated at $20 billion in 2017. The tax equity market was estimated at $20 billion in 2017. This report explains the structure and functioning of tax equity arrangements for subsidizing activities through tax credits like LIHTC, NMTC, PTC, and ITC. It does not evaluate the economic rationale for these subsidies but focuses on the tax equity approach. Tax equity transactions involve assigning tax credits to another party in exchange for cash financing. This differs from trading corporate stock as it requires a partnership agreement for tax credit claims. The partnership structure allows for direct allocation of income, losses, and tax items to individual partners. Tax equity transactions involve assigning tax credits to another party in exchange for cash financing. Nonprofit entities can partner with taxable investors to benefit from tax credits. The process begins with a developer identifying a project eligible for federal tax credits and seeking investors for equity capital in exchange for expected tax credits. In tax equity transactions, developers partner with investors to exchange tax credits for equity capital. Investors can work directly with developers or through a syndicator managing a tax credit fund. The syndicator earns a fee for managing investments. Tax equity investors are usually large corporations with predictable tax liabilities. The amount of equity capital exchanged for tax credits is negotiated between developers and investors. This process is known as \"selling,\" \"trading,\" or \"monetizing\" tax credits. Tax equity investors serve as limited partners in partnerships with developers, who act as general partners overseeing project operations. Investors monitor compliance to ensure tax credit benefits are secured. Their return depends on credit price and associated benefits. Compliance violations can lead to forfeiture of tax credits. In exchange for tax credits, an investor contributes $900,000 for $1 million in credits, resulting in a net return of $100,000 or 11.1%. The project developer must cover the remaining cost, known as the \"equity gap,\" through traditional loans or equity. The \"equity gap\" in projects can be filled with traditional loans, equity financing, or subsidies. Tax equity investors may receive benefits like tax incentives, operating income, capital gains, and goodwill. Investments in projects like LIHTC and NMTC can help financial institutions meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements. Tax equity investors in renewable energy projects seek large projects with significant tax credits, influenced by project risk, financing, and benefit accrual period. The federal tax equity mechanism may not be suitable for small projects due to complexity and investor tax liabilities. Investors require financial return for providing capital. Investors require a financial return in exchange for providing capital, diverting a portion of the subsidy from the targeted activity. Tax equity mechanism can create fluctuations in subsidy amounts received by qualified activities, depending on the price tax equity investors receive for their financing contributions. During the Great Recession, falling corporate tax liabilities reduced investor demand for tax credits, leading to lower credit prices and difficulty in financing projects. Fluctuations in tax credit prices can impact the subsidization rate, affecting the subsidy delivered through the tax equity mechanism. Congressional policies unrelated to the tax credit program can also cause subsidy fluctuations. The 2017 tax revision (P.L. 115-97) led to subsidy fluctuations in the tax credit program. Reduction in corporate tax rates could decrease investor appetite for credits, resulting in less tax equity investment. Geographic variations and policy changes can also impact the demand for tax equity, affecting the cost of financing for targeted activities. Renewable energy investors may see fewer tax credits available for monetization, leading to reduced demand for tax equity financing and lower financing costs. Different federal tax credits utilize the tax equity financing mechanism in varying ways, with differences in application processes, subsidization rates, and time frames for claiming credits. This section examines three major tax credits that use tax equity financing to demonstrate the diverse approaches employed. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program was established in 1986 to replace inefficient affordable housing tax incentives. It provides tax credits to developers over 10 years for building affordable rental housing. The program, costing the government around $9.9 billion annually, allocates credits to states based on population. In 2019, states received an LIHTC allocation of $2.75625 per person, with a minimum small-population state allocation of $3,166,875, reflecting a temporary increase due to the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act. State or local housing finance agencies award credits to developers through a competitive process based on federally required and state-specific criteria. Some states prioritize amenities like computer centers or proximity to public transportation in selecting projects. Delegating authority to Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs) to award Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) allows states to address individual housing needs. Developers sell tax credits to investors for equity investment, typically ranging from mid-$0.80s to mid-$0.90s per $1.00 of tax credit. Investors may also receive tax benefits and residual cash flow. The New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program was created by the Community. The NMTC program, created in 2000, aims to stimulate investment in low-income communities. The total allocation authority was increased to $61 billion, with tax credits awarded to CDEs for investments. The program costs the government around $1.2 billion annually in reduced tax revenues. Multiple steps and agents are involved to ensure the tax credit achieves its goal of encouraging investment in low-income areas. The Department of the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI) reviews NMTC applicants submitted by CDEs, issues tax credit authority to qualified CDEs, and plays a significant role in program compliance. CDEs must submit an application to the CDFI, which asks standardized questions about their track record and plans for allocation authority. Applications are scored to identify those with the greatest community impact, and allocations are awarded based on ranking until all authority is exhausted. Upon receiving an NMTC award, developers often sell the tax credits. The NMTC allocation authority is exhausted, and developers sell tax credits to investors for equity investment. NMTC prices fluctuate but typically range from mid-$0.70s to mid-$0.80s per $1.00 of tax credit. Unlike LIHTC investors, NMTC equity investors do not receive tax benefits for losses. Investment tax credits for renewable energy date back to the late 1970s, with the PTC enacted in 1992. Costs for these incentives have increased with the rise in renewable energy investments. Investment in renewable energy technologies has accelerated, leading to increased tax expenditures. For FY2018, the JCT estimates $2.8 billion for the renewable energy investment tax credit (ITC) and $5.1 billion for the production tax credit (PTC). Most of the forgone revenue for ITC is for solar projects, while for PTC, it is for wind energy. The solar energy credit is 30% for projects starting construction before 2019, reducing to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021. After 2021, the credit is 10%. The Investment Tax Credit (ITC) is generally claimed in the year the property is placed in service, with a recapture period of five years if the property is disposed of or no longer used for its intended purpose. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) is a per-kilowatt-hour tax credit for the first 10 years of renewable energy production, with wind projects receiving 2.4 cents per kWh in 2018. Taxpayers have the option to elect to receive an ITC instead of the PTC since 2009. Tax equity financing arrangements allow developers to monetize tax benefits by trading future tax benefits for upfront capital. The ITC and PTC were not designed as tax equity incentives but to subsidize investment in renewable energy. Partnerships began forming to efficiently use tax benefits, leading to the IRS establishing a safe harbor for tax equity partnership structures in 2007. Tax equity partnerships in renewable energy markets follow safe harbor guidance for tax credits. Partnership flips involve a developer and tax equity investor forming a project company to utilize tax benefits. The investor may provide upfront cash in exchange for tax credits and deductions. Tax equity partnerships in renewable energy projects involve a developer and tax equity investor forming a project company. The investor initially receives most tax benefits and income, with the developer retaining a small allocation. Once the investor reaches a targeted internal rate of return, the roles flip, and the developer receives the majority of tax benefits and income. Tax equity typically covers 30% to 60% of a project's capital needs. Tax equity for renewable energy projects is generally more expensive than other debt financing sources, with investors requiring higher rates of return. Yields can range from 6% to 8%, depending on the project specifics. Various policy options exist for utilizing tax equity markets to monetize tax benefits efficiently. Consideration of the effectiveness of using tax equity markets for federal financial support is crucial. The government can benefit from utilizing tax equity investors for oversight and compliance monitoring in renewable energy projects. While some argue that this role may be redundant with government oversight, there is value in outsourcing this function to investors. Various policy options are discussed for improving the efficiency of tax equity markets for federal financial support. Making tax credits refundable could reduce the need for tax equity in some cases, making financing more accessible. Currently, all tax credits using the tax equity approach are nonrefundable, only valuable if there is a tax liability. Refundable credits have value regardless of tax liability. Making tax credits refundable could reduce the need for tax equity in some cases, making financing more accessible. Refundable credits have value regardless of tax liability, allowing developers to receive tax refunds even if they have no tax liability. This could make it easier for projects to rely on debt financing, as lenders may be more willing to lend on favorable terms knowing there is a refundable tax benefit in the future. Making tax credits refundable could potentially increase the efficiency of subsidy delivery by increasing the amount of subsidy per dollar of federal revenue loss. This would attract more investors and competition, leading to higher tax credit prices and easier access to financing for projects. Transitioning to refundable business tax credits could enhance the subsidy mechanism by increasing competition among investors and raising tax credit prices. While there are concerns about the federal cost, converting LIHTC and NMTC to refundable credits may not significantly increase federal revenue loss. However, making energy credits (PTC and ITC) refundable could result in considerable federal revenue loss. Making energy tax credits refundable could make them more attractive to developers not currently participating in tax equity markets and reduce costs for those who are. Without a cap on the amount of credits that can be claimed, increased demand could lead to higher delivery costs. One option to address concerns about the potential cost associated with an unlimited tax credit would be to limit the amount of tax credits that could be claimed. Refundable energy tax credits have been used in the past for wind and solar energy, but legislation made them nonrefundable in 1980. Allowing businesses to claim refundable tax credits may raise concerns as they are typically reserved for households, especially lower-income ones. Some suggest replacing tax credits with grants to avoid subsidy diversion to third-party investors. Nonprofit entities not filing federal income tax returns may not benefit from tax incentives. Concerns also exist about bias towards larger-scale projects due to tax credit investors' preferences. Replacing tax credits with lump-sum grants could potentially address concerns about subsidy diversion to third-party investors. However, this may lead to a lack of outside investors scrutinizing project feasibility and compliance, potentially increasing project failure and noncompliance. Carefully designed recapture provisions would be necessary in case of project failure. Overall, this shift could increase government involvement in project funding. Replacing tax credits with grants could increase government administrative costs, offsetting the subsidy increase to projects. One option is to provide a portion of tax credits as upfront grants and the rest over time. The proportion of grant funding would need to encourage developers to sell their remaining tax credits. The split could be determined statutorily or left to states for programs like LIHTC. Alternatively, developers could request a specific funding mix. During the Great Recession, falling corporate tax liabilities reduced investor demand for tax credits, leading to depressed credit prices. Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5) in early 2009, allowing a portion of LIHTCs to be converted into grants. Renewable energy tax credits also had the option of receiving a grant in exchange for forgoing future tax benefits. Grants in lieu of tax credits were awarded via a competitive process. The LIHTC grants were awarded through a competitive process during the Great Recession. The ARRA allowed taxpayers to receive a one-time grant instead of the PTC or ITC. The grant option was extended for projects starting construction before the end of 2011. Tax-exempt entities were not eligible for the grant. The tax code could be modified to allow direct transfer of tax credits without forming a legal partnership. The tax code could be modified to allow the direct transfer of tax credits without forming a legal partnership, potentially broadening the pool of investors and increasing competition for tax credits. The impact on deals involving other tax benefits is uncertain. The potential direct transfer of tax credits could impact deals involving other tax benefits bundled with the credits. Issues to address include oversight incentives for investors, tracking credit ownership, and preventing noncompliance. The direct transfer of tax credits raises questions about credit ownership tracking, oversight incentives for investors, and preventing noncompliance. Policymakers must decide on transfer restrictions and who can participate in the market, considering the need for accurate tracking of eligible claimants. Tax credit brokers and online exchanges have emerged to facilitate credit transfers, but their services come at a cost that reduces the subsidy for targeted activities. Imposing reporting requirements on brokers or exchanges may aid in the administration of a direct transfer regime. Allowing more flexibility in transferring tax credits among project participants, such as tax-exempt entities, could reduce the cost of tax equity. However, this option would not eliminate the need for tax equity markets entirely. Accelerating tax credits by shortening the time period or frontloading the credits can increase equity raised by developers. This would attract more tax equity investors willing to pay a higher price per dollar of tax credit, resulting in more subsidy for targeted investments and allowing for more projects with the same federal revenue loss. Tax equity investors would pay more for accelerated tax credits due to reduced discount and risk, attracting new investors and increasing credit prices. Concerns about losing focus on investments can be addressed with a longer compliance period and credit recapture. Investors and developers face a 15-year compliance period for LIHTC, with tax credits claimed over 10 years. Shortening the claim period to five years could reduce the risk of credit recapture in the last five years."
