    "content": "The House and Senate approved the conference report on S.Con.Res. 21, the Concurrent Resolution on the FY2008 Budget, on May 17, 2007. The budget resolution includes reconciliation instructions for authorizing committees to report legislation to reduce mandatory spending for FY2007-FY2012. The House Committee on Education and Labor and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions were tasked with reporting these proposals. The House Committee on Education and Labor and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions reduced $750 million for FY2007-FY2012 by making changes to the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program and the William D. Ford Direct Loan (DL) program. These reductions offset new student aid benefits. The William D. Ford Direct Loan program and the Federal Family Education Loan program provide loans to students for postsecondary education. The DL program, established in 1993, uses federal capital while the FFEL program relies on private lenders with government guarantees. Both programs disburse similar loans but have different administrative structures. The DL program, established in 1993, aimed to streamline student loan delivery and achieve cost savings. Both the DL and FFEL programs provide loans to students, with the DL program introduced to gradually replace the FFEL program. In FY2007, these programs provided $63.9 billion in new loans, with the FFEL program averaging $4,494 per loan and the DL program averaging $4,603 per loan. Funding for both programs is provided on a permanent basis, not subject to appropriations. The Credit Reform Act of 1990 calculates subsidy costs for government loans based on net present value of costs over the loan lifetime. Subsidy costs include interest benefits, special allowance payments, and defaults. These costs are highly dependent on interest rate forecasts and can vary significantly. Congress has made cuts to loan programs to achieve savings in mandatory spending. In order to achieve savings in mandatory spending on loan programs, Congress often cuts loan subsidies or introduces fees. The Congressional Budget Office issues a baseline budget forecasting estimated spending over a 10-year period. The current CBO baseline projects $406 billion in new loans over 2008-2012, costing $21.2 billion. Legislation affecting mandatory spending is measured against the CBO baseline. The College Cost Reduction Act of 2007 and the Higher Education Access Act of 2007 resulted in changes to the FFEL program to achieve savings in student financial aid benefits. The House and Senate passed H.R. 2669, incorporating provisions from S. 1762, meeting the FY2008 budget resolution requirements. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007, signed into law as P.L. 110-84, aimed to achieve savings in mandatory spending through changes to federal student loan programs and enhance student aid benefits. It reviewed major proposals from the House-passed and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 2669 and outlined changes enacted under P.L. 110-84 to achieve savings and establish new student aid benefits. The House reconciliation bill's student loan provisions resulted in $20.4 billion in savings over the 2008-2012 period and $41.1 billion over the 2008-2017 period. The required savings of $750 million over the 2007-2012 period were met, with net savings of approximately $2.8 billion over the 2008-2012 period and $3.5 billion over the 2008-2017 period. The House reconciliation bill's student loan provisions resulted in significant savings, with roughly $17.6 billion over the 2008-2012 period and $37.6 billion over the 2008-2017 period.

The House reconciliation bill includes provisions to reduce insurance for lenders from 97% to 95% for new loans, decrease guaranty agency retention amounts, alter guaranty agency fees, establish a delinquency prevention fee, and set a minimum amount to be paid to each guarantor in loan processing fees. The House reconciliation bill includes provisions to increase direct spending, with additional savings used to offset costs of new loan and grant aid. The bill also includes provisions for new or enhanced loan aid, such as reducing interest rates on subsidized Stafford Loans and increasing annual loan limits. The House reconciliation bill includes provisions to increase direct spending, with additional savings used to offset costs of new loan and grant aid. Effective July 1, 2008, aggregate loan limits on subsidized Stafford Loans will increase for undergraduate and graduate students. A new loan forgiveness program will be established for new borrowers, offering forgiveness of up to $5,000 for five years of service in specified areas of national need. Loan forgiveness will also be granted for remaining balances for borrowers who have made 120 payments under the income-contingent repayment plan while employed in certain public sector jobs. Borrowers may qualify for economic hardship deferment based on revised criteria.

The House reconciliation bill includes provisions to extend authorization of the Pell Grant program through FY2013, eliminate the Pell Grant tuition sensitivity provision, and allow students pursuing degrees or certificates to receive more than one Pell Grant award in a single academic year. Mandatory funding for the Pell Grant program is added through FY2017, with increasing amounts allocated each year. The Pell Grant program received increasing mandatory funding through FY2017, totaling $2.57 billion. The funds were used to raise the maximum Pell Grant award by $200-$500 per year, increase income protection allowances for dependent and independent students, and adjust allowances annually. In 2009-2010, the IPA for academic years was increased by 10% from the previous year. Special rules were established for independent students with dependents, and IPA tables were updated annually based on the Consumer Price Index. Eligibility criteria for the need analysis simplified needs test were also amended. The eligibility criteria for the simplified needs test (SNT) were amended in 2009 to include parents or students who received a benefit under a means-tested program in the last 24 months. This change also affected the automatic-zero expected family contribution (auto-zero EFC) eligibility criteria. The income eligibility threshold for auto-zero EFC would increase from $20,000 to $30,000 for both parents and independent students with dependents, adjusted annually using the CPI. Special circumstances for financial aid administrators to use professional judgment would include a dislocated worker as defined by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. Distribution from a qualified education benefit is excluded from the need analysis calculation, and some untaxed income is eliminated from consideration. The provisions aim to exclude certain income sources from the total income calculation for students and parents in need analysis. It also clarifies the treatment of qualified education benefits as assets for dependent and independent students. Additionally, it establishes a competitive grants program for institutions of higher education to provide need-based grant aid to eligible students. The legislation aims to provide bonus rewards to institutions of higher education (IHEs) for guaranteeing tuition and fees for a specific number of years, with funds distributed as need-based grant aid to Pell Grant-eligible students. It includes a mandatory appropriation for cooperative education grant rewards, Centers of Excellence at minority-serving institutions, and a new program for historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and other minority-serving institutions. The legislation aims to provide funding for various types of institutions, including colleges and universities serving specific demographics, through mandatory appropriations totaling $100 million per year for FY2008-FY2012. It also establishes a College Access Challenge Grant Program with a $300 million mandatory appropriation for FY2008-FY2012, providing funds for need-based grants and outreach programs. Additionally, $30 million per year for FY2008-FY2011 is allocated for specified Upward Bound programs, and $100 million in mandatory funding is designated for Perkins Loan federal capital contributions each year for FY2008-FY2012.

Additional savings would support new student aid benefits. The Senate reconciliation bill, effective October 1, 2007, would change formulas for calculating lender yields on student loans, reducing rates for different types of loans held by for-profit and not-for-profit lenders. It would also eliminate lender exceptional performer status, increase lender origination fees, reduce guaranty agency retention amounts, replace guaranty agency account maintenance fees with fixed dollar payments per loan, and introduce loan auctions starting July 1, 2009.
