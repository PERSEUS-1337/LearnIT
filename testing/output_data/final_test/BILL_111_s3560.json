    "content": "The Act titled \"Combating the Pakistani Taliban Act of 2010\" designates the Pakistani Taliban as a foreign terrorist organization. The Pakistani Taliban is designated as a foreign terrorist organization due to its history of committing terrorist acts, including the assassination of Benazir Bhutto. In 2010, a video indicated their intention to target cities in the United States. The Pakistani Taliban has expanded its deadly influence through alliances with other militant groups and terrorist organizations. Faisal Shahzad was charged in the failed Times Square bombing with support from the Pakistani Taliban. The Pakistani Taliban is eligible for designation as a foreign terrorist organization due to its engagement in terrorist activities and threat to US national security. Designation would make it illegal to provide support to the group within the US jurisdiction. The Pakistani Taliban, if designated as a foreign terrorist organization, would make it illegal to provide support to them within the US. This includes various forms of support such as currency, financial services, weapons, and personnel. Additionally, representatives and members of the Pakistani Taliban who are aliens could be inadmissible to and removable from the United States. Financial institutions in the US would be required to retain possession of funds in which the Pakistani Taliban or its agent has an interest. Designation of the Pakistani Taliban as a foreign terrorist organization would support US efforts to curb terrorism financing, isolate them internationally, deter donations, and raise public awareness. The Secretary of State must designate the Pakistani Taliban as a foreign terrorist organization within 30 days of the enactment of the Act, without the need for an administrative record."
