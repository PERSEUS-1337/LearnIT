    "content": "In vitro diagnostic (IVD) devices, including genetic tests, provide information for health care decisions. IVDs are used in laboratory analysis of human samples, including commercial test products and instruments. They have various uses such as diagnosis, screening, staging, and disease management. Clinical laboratory tests influence around 70% of health care decisions. Spending on IVDs is a small portion of overall health care costs, with approximately 6.8 billion clinical laboratory tests performed in the United States. The use of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) devices in the United States is significant, with approximately 6.8 billion clinical laboratory tests performed annually. These tests play a crucial role in patient care by providing information for health care decisions and can impact the overall delivery of health care. The federal government has recognized the potential risks associated with inaccurate test results and their impact on patient management. The federal government oversees in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs) to ensure safety, effectiveness, accuracy, and reliability. This includes genetic tests that analyze genetic material for variations contributing to human illness and treatment responses. The use of in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs) in personalized medicine involves genetic variability in patients' responses to treatments. Pharmacogenomics studies how genetic variation affects drug response, with over 100 FDA-approved drugs containing pharmacogenomic information. Regulation of genetic testing has raised concerns about premarket review by the FDA and the development of laboratory-developed tests. The FDA has been debating the regulation of laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) used to diagnose diseases, including common ones like cancer. In 2014, the FDA announced draft guidance on LDT regulation, seeking public comments. However, finalization of the guidance was delayed in 2016. The FDA has been debating the regulation of direct-to-consumer genetic testing, with for-profit companies like 23andMe and Pathway Genomics offering tests that consumers can purchase online. The Government Accountability Office testified about the availability of these tests almost a decade ago. In 2010, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found direct-to-consumer genetic tests to be misleading and of little practical use. However, in April 2017, FDA approved 23andMe's DTC genetic test providing information on disease risk. The federal government plays a dual role in regulating and paying for in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs), including Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs). Congress has introduced bills to balance innovation and regulatory oversight, such as streamlining regulation and enforcing FDA authority over LDTs. Medicare covers outpatient and inpatient clinical laboratory testing, reimbursing based on the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS). The federal government regulates and pays for in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs), including Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs). Medicare covers clinical laboratory testing based on the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS). FDA approval or clearance is necessary for Medicare coverage of IVDs, but not sufficient for a favorable decision. The regulation of IVDs is overseen by FDA through the FFDCA and PHSA, and by CMS through CLIA. FDA has announced a Framework for Regulatory Oversight of LDTs. The federal government regulates and pays for in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs), including Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs). FDA oversees the regulation of IVDs through the FFDCA and PHSA, while CMS oversees it through CLIA. FDA has announced a Framework for Regulatory Oversight of LDTs, and the regulation of DTC genetic tests is also discussed. Risk classification of IVDs is based on the risk they pose to patients or users. IVDs are products used in the collection, preparation, and examination of specimens from the human body. They can be complete tests or test components regulated by the FDA. There are two routes to market for IVDs used in patient management: commercial test kits distributed to multiple labs and laboratory developed tests (LDTs) used in a single lab. LDTs may use in-house or commercially manufactured reagents. The FDA generally exercises enforcement discretion for Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) which are used in a single lab and may use in-house or commercially manufactured reagents. IVDs used in patient management fall under the definition of medical devices and are subject to FDA regulation under the Medical Device Amendments of 1976. The FDA regulates the sale and distribution of medical devices, including instruments, apparatus, machines, implants, in vitro reagents, and related articles. In vitro diagnostic tests, including components and accessories, are intended for diagnosing diseases or conditions, treating or preventing diseases, or affecting body functions in humans or animals. Some tests, like genetic testing for ancestry, may not be regulated by the FDA. Certain IVDs, such as blood donor screening tests, fall under the PHSA requirements for biological product licensure. IVDs are regulated by the FDA through CDRH and CBER based on risk classification for intended use and patient safety. Classification is determined by the level of risk posed by the device, with definitions provided in the MDA for class I, II, and III devices. Device classification for in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs) is based on risk levels - class I, II, and III, with 50% being class I, 42% class II, and 8% class III. Class I devices are low-risk and exempt from premarket review, while class II and III devices require premarket review. Manufacturers can bring moderate- and high-risk devices to market through clinical studies and a premarket approval (PMA) application. The PMA process is used for novel and high-risk devices, resulting in FDA approval. Another path is the 510(k) process, demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device for FDA clearance. Clinical data is usually not required for 510(k) clearance. FDA has 180 days for PMA review and 90 days for 510(k) review. Manufacturers must comply with regulations post-approval, including manufacturing, labeling, surveillance, and adverse event reporting. Class I devices are low-risk and generally exempt from premarket review, but still need to comply with general controls. Class II devices are higher risk and require FDA clearance. Class II devices pose a moderate risk to patients and are subject to general controls and special controls, such as premarket notification. Special controls for these devices may include labeling requirements, performance standards, and postmarket surveillance. Class III devices are the highest risk category, where general and special controls are not sufficient to ensure safe and effective use. Class III devices require premarket approval (PMA) due to their high risk of illness or injury. For example, a false negative result in a hepatitis C virus test could lead to delayed treatment and potential liver failure. Clinical studies and an investigational device exemption (IDE) are usually required for PMA applications. The IDE allows devices to be shipped for investigation without full FDA compliance. Many IVD devices are exempt from IDE requirements if testing is noninvasive. FDA focuses oversight on diagnostic test kits like infectious disease tests. Laboratory developed tests (LDTs) are a subset of in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) that are manufactured and offered within a single laboratory. They are often used for rapidly changing conditions or diseases and have not traditionally been regulated by the FDA. FDA enforces regulatory requirements for components of IVDs, including analyte specific reagents (ASRs). Analyte specific reagents (ASRs) are regulated by the FDA based on their diagnostic use and level of risk, classified as class I, II, or III. ASRs are used for identifying and quantifying chemical substances in biological specimens, with high-risk applications like HIV diagnosis falling under class III requirements. General purpose reagents (GPRs) are chemical reagents used for general laboratory purposes in specimen examination for diagnostic use. General purpose reagents (GPRs) are chemical reagents used in the laboratory for diagnostic purposes, such as buffer solutions and enzymes. They are regulated as class I devices and exempt from premarket notification procedures. FDA guidance in November 2013 addressed the use of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) products labeled for \"Research Use Only\" (RUO) or \"Investigational Use Only\" (IUO), which are in the development phases. IUO products may be used in research testing on human samples and could lead to the approval of new IVDs for clinical diagnostic use. The FDA 2013 guidance clarifies that RUO or IUO IVD products should only be used for research or investigational purposes, not for clinical diagnostic use. The distribution of unapproved products for clinical use can lead to misleading results and serious health consequences for patients. The FDA 2013 guidance clarifies that RUO or IUO IVD products should only be used for research or investigational purposes, not for clinical diagnostic use. It defines an IVD companion diagnostic device as essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product. These tests identify patients who would benefit from a specific therapeutic product or are at increased risk for adverse reactions. The FDA guidance clarifies the use of IVD companion diagnostic devices for safe and effective treatment. Examples include Herceptin for breast cancer and other drugs like Erbitux and Gleevec for specific cancers. These tests help identify patients who would benefit from a particular treatment and avoid potential side effects. The FDA guidance outlines the use of IVD companion diagnostic devices for various cancers, such as Gleevec for gastrointestinal stromal tumors and Tarceva for non-small cell lung cancers. CLIA regulates clinical laboratories that perform diagnostic testing on human specimens. The FDA and CMS have different regulatory goals for diagnostic tests. FDA focuses on safety and effectiveness, while CLIA regulates the quality of clinical testing. There is overlap in their approaches, with CLIA evaluating analytical validity and FDA assessing both analytical and clinical validity of tests. The FDA oversees the safety and effectiveness of in vitro diagnostic tests, including pre-market review, demonstration of clinical validity, adverse event reporting, and recalls. In contrast, CLIA was established in 1988 to regulate the quality of clinical laboratory testing in response to concerns about Pap smears. CLIA certification is required for clinical laboratories to ensure quality standards for laboratory examinations. It categorizes testing complexity into low, moderate, and high levels, with the FDA responsible for test categorization. This is separate from the FDA's oversight of in vitro diagnostic tests for safety and effectiveness. The FDA categorizes tests based on complexity levels for CLIA certification. Laboratories conducting moderate and high complexity testing must meet specific standards, including proficiency testing, quality control, and personnel qualifications. Inspections are part of the certification process, with subsequent biennial inspections to ensure compliance. Waived tests receive a Certificate of Waiver from CMS. Proficiency testing is required for CLIA-certified laboratories conducting moderate and high complexity testing to monitor quality and accuracy. Samples are tested in the same way as patient samples and sent back for analysis by approved programs. Proficiency testing is essential for CLIA-certified laboratories to evaluate the quality of their services. Laboratories must handle proficiency testing samples the same way they handle patient samples. Genetic testing laboratories do not have specified proficiency testing requirements due to genetics not being a designated specialty area under CLIA. Genetic testing laboratories do not have specified proficiency testing requirements under CLIA because genetics is not a designated specialty area. The CDC's CLIAC recommended adding a genetic specialty under CLIA, but CMS decided against it due to potential lack of proficiency testing samples and a mechanism for assessing clinical validity. FDA has focused enforcement efforts on commercial IVDs and has not generally enforced pre-market clearance or approval for genetic tests. The FDA has indicated its intent to regulate Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) using a risk-based approach, starting in 2014 with draft guidance and a 120-day comment period. The American Clinical Laboratory Association (ACLA) has retained counsel to represent them in matters related to the FDA's guidance on LDT regulation. The American Clinical Laboratory Association (ACLA) opposes FDA regulation of Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs), stating they are not commercially distributed products and are integral to physician practice. FDA delayed finalizing draft guidance in November 2016 to work with stakeholders and Congress. The FDA summarized comments on Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) in a discussion paper, stating they would not issue final guidance to allow for further public discussion and congressional input. Regulation of LDTs has drawn support for device safety but criticism for potential impact on innovation. Congress has also shown interest in the issue. On December 9, 2014, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce discussed FDA's enforcement of regulatory requirements for LDTs and released a white paper seeking feedback on the regulation of LDTs and IVD commercial test kits. The committee later held a second hearing on the issue on November 17, 2015, exploring different legislative approaches for agency oversight, including FDA, CLIA program at CMS, or a combination of both. During a hearing, CMS Chief Medical Officer Dr. Patrick Conway emphasized that CMS lacks the expertise to assess clinical validity in premarket review, stating that FDA staff currently hold that expertise. The FDA released a report with 20 case studies showing events involving LDTs that may have caused harm. The FDA released a report on 20 case studies of events involving LDTs that demonstrated harm to patients. The Association for Molecular Pathology critiqued the report, stating that only a few of the tests identified could have caused patient harm that FDA oversight might have prevented. Despite having regulatory authority over LDTs, the FDA traditionally exercised enforcement discretion towards these tests. \"Various groups have raised concerns about the lack of oversight and regulation of LDTs, with recommendations from organizations like Genentech, AdvaMed, and CAP. Some argue that LDTs should not be regulated by the FDA, while others, like ACLA, support FDA oversight. AMP has proposed a distinction between LDTs and commercial test kits.\" The Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) has proposed a new name for LDTs: laboratory-developed procedures (LDPs). FDA published draft guidance on a subset of LDTs called In Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assays (IVDMIAs) in 2006. IVDMIAs raise safety and effectiveness concerns according to FDA. The FDA expressed concerns about the safety and effectiveness of IVDMIAs, stating that patients may be making critical healthcare decisions based on tests that have not been clinically validated. FDA announced its intent to regulate all LDTs, including IVDMIAs, to ensure their safety and effectiveness. The FDA announced its decision to regulate all Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) in June 2010. During a public meeting in July 2010, the FDA presented reasons for asserting its enforcement authority over LDTs, citing the significant growth in volume and types of tests, their evolution to be more like commercial in vitro devices, and the shift away from traditional laboratory-developed tests. Some companies prefer the laboratory developed testing pathway to avoid FDA regulation for their tests, which can put commercial test kit manufacturers at a disadvantage. LDTs are marketed aggressively to clinicians, raising concerns about their reliability. The FDA has expressed concerns about the safety and effectiveness of LDTs, while some argue they should be outside FDA regulation. The American Clinical Laboratory Association has petitioned the FDA to refrain from issuing guidance on LDT regulation. The American Clinical Laboratory Association (ACLA) has petitioned the FDA to refrain from regulating Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) as devices, arguing that LDTs are proprietary procedures and not subject to FDA regulation. FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg mentioned a \"risk-based framework\" for LDT regulation in 2013. Section 1143 of FDASIA requires the FDA to notify Congress before issuing any guidance on LDT regulation. The FDA notified Congress of issuing draft guidance for regulating Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) in response to a statutory requirement. The draft guidance outlines a risk-based framework for regulating LDTs, categorizing them into classes exempt from regulation, those requiring registration and listing, and those needing premarket review and quality system compliance. The FDA's draft guidance outlines a risk-based framework for regulating Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) based on event reporting, premarket review, and quality system regulation requirements. Enforcement discretion for LDTs will be determined based on risk evaluation, with a strict definition of LDT as an IVD intended for clinical use within a single laboratory. Tests not meeting this definition will still be regulated as LDTs to maintain market continuity. Examples include tests with components from third-party manufacturers and tests not solely developed within a single laboratory. The FDA's draft guidance outlines a risk-based framework for regulating Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) based on event reporting, premarket review, and quality system regulation requirements. Two subsets of LDTs will not fall under the purview of the regulatory framework: LDTs used solely for forensic purposes and LDTs used for organ, stem cell, and tissue transplantation. FDA will classify LDTs based on risk and enforce premarket review requirements, prioritizing the highest risk class III tests. Devices will remain on the market during review and FDA's consideration of applications. The FDA's draft guidance outlines a risk-based framework for regulating Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) based on event reporting, premarket review, and quality system regulation requirements. Devices will remain on the market during review and FDA's consideration of applications. FDA will exercise enforcement discretion for premarket review for three subsets of LDTs, but will enforce other regulatory requirements for all LDTs, including general controls, registration and listing, adverse event reporting, and quality system regulation. The FDA's draft guidance outlines a risk-based framework for regulating Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) based on event reporting, premarket review, and quality system regulation requirements. FDA will focus on three types of class III LDTs with the highest risk, including those with the same intended use as cleared companion diagnostics or FDA-approved class III devices. Registration, listing, and adverse event reporting will start six months after the guidance is final, with premarket review beginning 12 months later for high-risk LDTs and phasing in over four years for others. Moderate risk class II LDTs will undergo premarket review after class III LDTs, with an anticipated nine-year timeline for full compliance. The process of bringing all LDTs into compliance will take nine years. Estimates suggest there may be up to 11,000 laboratories developing LDTs. A recent analysis identified 8,245 clinical genetic tests, with only 15 having gone through FDA premarket review. FDA acknowledges the need for additional oversight of LDTs since the 2014 draft guidance release. The FDA acknowledges the need for additional oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) and proposes various features for regulation, including a risk-based approach, independent premarket review, focus on analytical and clinical validity, adverse event reporting, and public availability of test performance information. The proposals suggest agency oversight by FDA, the CLIA program at CMS, or a blend of FDA and CMS. The complementary approach is supported by a broad array of stakeholders. The proposed oversight framework for Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) in the January 2017 discussion paper focuses on new and significantly modified high and moderate risk LDTs. Previously marketed LDTs would be grandfathered and not expected to comply with most FDA regulatory requirements unless necessary for public health protection. Low-risk LDTs and LDTs for rare diseases would also not be expected to comply with FDA regulatory requirements unless necessary for public health protection. Low-risk LDTs for rare diseases and traditional LDTs, as well as those intended solely for public health surveillance or used in high-complexity histocompatibility labs for transplantation purposes, are exempt from most FDA regulatory requirements unless needed for public health protection. The FDA retains the ability to enforce premarket review and other requirements for certain LDTs, including those not analytically and clinically valid, involved in deceptive promotion, or posing serious health risks. FDA estimates a phased four-year premarket review for new LDTs to reduce workload on FDA laboratories. The FDA proposes a phased four-year premarket review for new LDTs to reduce workload on FDA laboratories. Year One focuses on serious adverse event reporting, Year Two on premarket review for high-risk tests, Year Three on moderate-risk tests, and Year Four on other LDTs. The proposal also includes expanding the FDA third-party premarket review program to include eligible LDTs. The FDA proposes expanding the third-party premarket review program to include eligible LDTs and emphasizes transparency in test performance. Postmarket surveillance activities would ensure LDTs continue to perform as intended, as modifications can impact test performance. Serious adverse events would be reported to the FDA for all tests except traditional LDTs and certain specified categories. The FDA may decrease or discontinue the requirement for reports on certain LDTs as monitoring shifts to real-world data collection through the National Evaluation System for health Technology (NEST). Direct-to-consumer genetic testing is expanding, with companies like 23andMe offering health-related tests. Proponents argue that DTC genetic testing empowers consumers to make better healthcare decisions, but concerns about regulation, accuracy, and utility have emerged. The FDA has not provided guidance on regulating direct-to-consumer genetic testing, but has stated publicly that it should be regulated by the agency. Some companies are working with the FDA to come into compliance with premarket submissions. The FDA has not actively enforced regulatory requirements for direct-to-consumer genetic tests, despite stating that it generally does not exercise enforcement discretion over them. The FDA has recently enforced regulations on certain direct-to-consumer genetic tests, including sending warning letters to companies like 23andMe. In April 2017, FDA approved 23andMe's Personal Genome Service Genetic Health Risk test, the first FDA-approved DTC genetic test providing information on disease risk. The FDA announced in the Federal Register its intent to exempt autosomal recessive carrier screening gene mutation detection systems from premarket notification requirements, classifying them as Class II devices for over-the-counter direct-to-consumer marketing with special controls. The rationale includes the fact that carriers of autosomal recessive mutations do not manifest the disease being screened for, reducing potential harm from false negatives. Regulators have difficulty determining if companies offering direct-to-consumer genetic testing use CLIA-certified labs. The FTC regulates manufacturer claims about products, prohibiting false advertisements. The FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts in commerce, including false advertising for health-related products. The role of advertising in providing health information to consumers can lead to law enforcement actions against false or deceptive advertising in direct-to-consumer genetic testing. Companies may alter webpage content in real-time, making it challenging to enforce regulations. GAO investigations have revealed misleading and medically unproven test results from DTC genetic testing companies. In July 2010, GAO testified before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Committee on Energy and Commerce about DTC genetic testing companies. The tests were found to be misleading and of little practical use, with contradictory predictions depending on the company. The tests cost between $299 to $999 and provided risk predictions for various diseases. The science of risk prediction based on genetic markers is not fully developed, with limitations not adequately disclosed. Different companies using the same samples predict varying directions of risk, indicating a lack of interpretive ability. Experts state there are too many uncertainties and ambiguities in the testing to rely on any results. Limitations of the tests should be clearly disclosed upfront, with some companies offering refunds while others refuse. SACGHS also addressed the regulation of DTC testing. In response to recommendations by SACGT and SACGHS, NIH has created a voluntary genetic testing registry to provide information on the purpose, methodology, validity, and usefulness of genetic tests, including those marketed directly to consumers. This registry could help physicians and patients make better informed decisions about using these tests."
