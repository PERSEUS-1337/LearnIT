    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pediatric, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancer Survivorship Research and Quality of Life Act of 2013\". Congress finds that an estimated 13,500 children and adolescents are diagnosed with cancer each year, with cure rates increasing to 78 percent by 2011. There are over 360,000 childhood cancer survivors in the US, but up to two-thirds may experience late effects of treatment, including serious or life-threatening conditions. Late effects can affect neurocognitive, psychological, cardiopulmonary, endocrine, and musculoskeletal systems, as well as lead to secondary malignancies. The late effects of cancer treatment in childhood survivors may change with evolving treatments, requiring routine monitoring and modified care. The Institute of Medicine emphasizes the need for an organized system of care for pediatric cancer survivors. SEC. 417H. PILOT PROGRAMS TO EXPLORE MODEL SYSTEMS OF CARE FOR PEDIATRIC CANCER SURVIVORS. This section introduces pilot programs to develop model systems of care for pediatric cancer survivors. The Secretary may provide grants to eligible entities like medical schools, children's hospitals, cancer centers, or other experienced entities to establish pilot programs for monitoring and caring for childhood cancer survivors. The grants must be used to develop, study, or evaluate model systems for survivor care with special emphasis on cancer survivors. The curr_chunk emphasizes the design of protocols for follow-up care, multidisciplinary care models, culturally competent care, support programs for cancer survivors, and systems for transferring treatment information effectively. The curr_chunk focuses on the transfer of treatment information and care summaries between cancer care providers and other healthcare providers, dissemination of information to cancer survivors and their families, and initiatives promoting coordination between different healthcare professionals. Authorization of $15,000,000 for this purpose is provided. Authorization of $15,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 to facilitate the transfer of treatment information and care summaries between cancer care providers and other healthcare professionals. The legislation authorizes $15,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 to establish a workforce development collaborative focused on medical and psychosocial care for childhood cancer survivors. The Secretary may convene a Collaborative on Medical and Psychosocial Care for Pediatric Cancer Survivors, composed of educators, advocates, and health service providers. The Collaborative will submit a report to establish a plan for workforce development in medical and psychosocial care. The Collaborative on Medical and Psychosocial Care for Pediatric Cancer Survivors will focus on developing models and curricula for healthcare providers, adapting curricula for workforce education, training faculty in evidence-based teaching strategies, advocating for psychosocial healthcare in accreditation standards, evaluating patient navigator and peer support program effectiveness in pediatric cancer care. The Hematological Cancer Research Investment and Education Act of 2002 is amended to authorize appropriations of $5,000,000 annually for psychosocial care of pediatric cancer patients and survivors."
