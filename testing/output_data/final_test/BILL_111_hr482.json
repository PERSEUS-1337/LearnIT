    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Frank Buckles World War I Memorial Act\". In 2017, the United States will commemorate the centennial of its entry into World War I, marking the first time American soldiers went overseas to defend foreign soil. This event introduced the American soldier as a defender, liberator, and promoter of peace and democracy. Despite World War I being called the \"Great War\" and the \"War to End All Wars\", the United States would commit its troops to the defense of foreign lands several more times in the 20th century. The United States commemorates the centennial of its entry into World War I in 2017. Despite more Americans dying in World War I than in the Korean War or Vietnam War, there is no memorial to World War I on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The District of Columbia War Memorial on the Mall does not fully commemorate the total participation of the United States and its Armed Forces in World War I. The District of Columbia War Memorial on the National Mall is in disrepair and often overlooked. It is proposed to rededicate the site to honor those who served in World War I and ensure future generations understand America's 20th-century struggle against aggression and totalitarianism. The District of Columbia War Memorial on the National Mall is proposed to be rededicated as the \"National and District of Columbia World War I Memorial.\" This Act authorizes the rededication and enhancement of the existing commemorative work without the need for site approval under the Commemorative Works Act. The World War I Memorial Foundation is authorized to establish a commemorative work rededicating the District of Columbia War Memorial as a National and District of Columbia World War I Memorial, including full restoration of the existing memorial and the addition of a new commemorative element. Compliance with standards for commemorative works and the location of the memorial are also addressed. The rededication of the District of Columbia War Memorial must comply with the Commemorative Works Act. Private contributions will be solicited for the memorial, and any excess funds will be deposited accordingly. The World War I Memorial Foundation will deposit any excess funds from the rededication of the District of Columbia War Memorial to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit in a specific account as per the Commemorative Works Act."
