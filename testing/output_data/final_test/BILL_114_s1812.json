    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Improving Cooperation with States and Local Governments and Preventing the Catch and Release of Criminal Aliens Act of 2015\". It includes definitions for various terms used in the Act. The Act defines a \"criminal alien\" as an alien who has been arrested, charged, or convicted of certain offenses related to immigration, is removable under specific sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act, or has committed DUI offenses. The term \"sanctuary jurisdiction\" refers to a State or political subdivision that prohibits law enforcement officers from assisting Federal immigration law enforcement during routine duties. Limits on federal funding for state and local jurisdictions are outlined in Section 3. Section 3 outlines restrictions on federal funding for jurisdictions that do not cooperate with federal officials on the removal of criminal or priority aliens. This includes withholding funds allocated under the Immigration and Nationality Act and grants authorized by the Second Chance Act of 2007. The jurisdiction can become eligible for funds, grants, or contracts from the Department of Homeland Security or Department of Justice after certifying cooperation with federal officials on detentions and transfers related to immigration law. The repeal of assisting Federal immigration law enforcement with criminal aliens has led to the reallocation of withheld funds to cooperating states and political subdivisions, as well as federal grant programs for victims of violence. SEC. 4. TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General are required to annually publish lists of sanctuary jurisdictions and jurisdictions that do not grant Federal immigration law enforcement officers access to jails. Additionally, the Secretary of Homeland Security must disclose the total number of detainers and requests for notification issued to each State or political subdivision. The Secretary of Homeland Security must disclose the total number of detainers and requests for notification issued to each State or political subdivision, including the number of detainers and requests that have been ignored or not honored. SEC. 5 amends the penalty for reentry by removed aliens to a minimum of 5 years imprisonment. SEC. 6 clarifies that the Act does not require reporting or arresting victims or witnesses of a crime by state law enforcement, and does not limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement for non-criminal aliens."
