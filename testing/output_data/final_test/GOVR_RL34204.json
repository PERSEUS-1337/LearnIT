    "content": "During the 110th Congress, comprehensive immigration reform was a major topic of discussion. A bipartisan group of Senators, with input from the Bush Administration, developed legislation addressing various issues in the U.S. immigration system. The Senate considered multiple reform measures in 2007, but a cloture motion on S. 1639 failed to pass, ultimately halting the bill's progress. The cloture motion on comprehensive immigration reform bill failed in the 110th Congress, leading to its withdrawal from the Senate floor. The Senate later considered the DREAM Act for unauthorized alien students but failed to invoke cloture. Various other immigration measures were also considered and enacted during this Congress, including provisions on the Visa Waiver Program and border security. The 110th Congress enacted various immigration-related provisions, including security measures, military service-based immigration benefits, alien inadmissibility, alien eligibility for benefits, and employment eligibility verification. Refugee-related provisions were also included in different acts. The 110th Congress enacted various immigration-related provisions, including security measures, military service-based immigration benefits, alien eligibility for benefits, and employment eligibility verification. The Immigration and Nationality Act provides for the temporary admission of foreign workers and business personnel to the United States. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows for the temporary admission of foreign workers, business personnel, and students to the United States through nonimmigrant visa categories like H, F, M, and J visas. The issuance of temporary employment-based visas has increased over the past decade, while the number of nonimmigrants admitted for academic and vocational study has more than doubled in the last two decades. Additionally, the Act provides for the permanent admission of certain individuals as legal permanent residents. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows for the permanent admission of certain categories of foreign workers and business personnel as legal permanent residents (LPRs) through five employment-based preference categories. The focus has been on reforming the system for aliens of extraordinary ability and unskilled workers. The annual limit for employment-based LPR admissions is 140,000. The H-2A nonimmigrant visa allows for temporary admission of foreign workers for agricultural work in the U.S. Employers must apply for certification from the Department of Labor to show a lack of qualified U.S. workers. Workers must be paid the highest of federal or state minimum wage, prevailing wage rate, or adverse effect wage rate. Various bills in the 110th Congress address foreign temporary agricultural workers, proposing changes to the H-2A program. Bills like AgJOBS and H.R. 1792 aim to streamline the process of importing H-2A workers and make adjustments to wage requirements. AgJOBS freezes the AEWR at the January 2003 level for three years, while H.R. 1792 eliminates H-2A employers' obligation to adhere to certain wage requirements. Several bills in the 110th Congress address reforms to the H-2A program for foreign temporary agricultural workers. H.R. 1792 eliminates certain wage requirements for H-2A employers, while S. 1639 and H.R. 1645 include provisions similar to AgJOBS. H.R. 2954 also contains H-2A reform provisions. Some measures in the 110th Congress propose new agricultural worker programs instead of reforming the H-2A program. H.R. 2413 and S. 330 propose new agricultural worker programs with numerical limitations. AgJOBS includes a legalization program for agricultural workers granting temporary resident status. Up to 1.5 million blue cards could be issued for eligible workers to adjust to LPR status. The curr_chunk discusses eligibility requirements for adjusting to LPR status under a new bill, with different provisions in various proposed legislation. It also mentions visa categories for temporary workers and professionals. The curr_chunk discusses various visa categories for temporary workers, such as O visas for individuals with extraordinary abilities and H-2B visas for nonagricultural temporary work in the United States. It highlights the requirements for employers to demonstrate the unavailability of U.S. workers and the need to pay foreign workers at least the prevailing wage rate. In recent years, there have been proposals to overhaul the H-2B visa program and establish new guest worker programs. Attention has been on an expired provision exempting certain returning H-2B workers from the cap, with bills introduced to re-enact this exemption. Several bills propose exemptions from the H-2B cap for returning workers who were previously counted against the cap in specific fiscal years. Some bills aim to revise the expired H-2B returning worker exemption to cover workers present in the U.S. as H-2B nonimmigrants in the prior three fiscal years. H.R. 1843 proposes a permanent exemption for returning H-2B workers who were present in the U.S. in any of the three years preceding the current year. This provision was considered in various bills but was ultimately not included in the final legislation for FY2008. The H.R. 2642 bill proposed exempting H-2B workers from the cap if they had worked in the U.S. in the previous three fiscal years. The H-1B visa is the largest classification of H visas, requiring employers to meet specific conditions when hiring nonimmigrants. Firms classified as H-1B dependent must attest to recruiting U.S. workers and not laying off U.S. workers around the time of hiring H-1B nonimmigrants. The H-1B visa has an annual cap of 65,000, often reached before the fiscal year begins. Some H-1B workers are exempt from the cap, such as those with a master's degree. Bills related to the H-1B visa have been introduced in Congress. Several bills have been introduced in Congress to increase H-1B visa admissions, including S. 1038/H.R. 1930, S. 1092, and H.R. 1758. These bills propose amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act to exempt certain individuals from the annual H-1B visa cap, increase the annual cap, and provide additional H-1B visas. Several bills have been introduced in Congress to increase H-1B visa admissions, including H.R. 1758 which would provide additional H-1B visas for individuals with master's or Ph.D. degrees. Another bill, H.R. 5642, would set the total H-1B admissions at 195,000 for FY2008 and FY2009. Additionally, bills like S. 1035 aim to strengthen H-1B requirements by requiring employers to make a good-faith effort to hire U.S. workers before hiring H-1B visa holders. Several bills have been introduced in Congress to increase H-1B visa admissions, including H.R. 1758 which would provide additional H-1B visas for individuals with master's or Ph.D. degrees. Another bill, H.R. 5642, would set the total H-1B admissions at 195,000 for FY2008 and FY2009. Additionally, bills like S. 1035 aim to strengthen H-1B requirements by prohibiting employers from displacing U.S. workers, outsourcing H-1B employees, or hiring more than 50% H-1B visa holders if they employ over 50 people. H.R. 2538 would change the LCA process by requiring H-1B employers to use the highest wage determination method and prohibiting outsourcing of H-1B nonimmigrants. Several bills in Congress aim to increase H-1B visa admissions, with provisions to raise the cap to 150,000 in FY2008 and exempt certain individuals with advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics from the cap. These bills also strengthen labor market protections for U.S. workers and expand enforcement authority. S. 1397 and H.R. 5630 propose raising the annual H-1B limit to 115,000 and 130,000 respectively, with provisions for potential escalations in subsequent years. S. 1639 includes revisions to raise the cap to 115,000 for FY2008 and potentially up to 180,000 in the following years, along with requirements for IRS W-2 forms submission for H-1B applicants. S. 1639 proposes raising the H-1B cap to 115,000 for FY2008 and potentially up to 180,000 in the following years. It includes requirements for submitting IRS W-2 forms for H-1B renewal petitions. The bill also originally included a provision for employers to pay a supplemental fee for each H-1B hired, but this was not included in the final version of the bill. The O and P visa categories were established along with the H-1B visa category for aliens of distinguished merit and ability. The O visa is for individuals with the highest level of accomplishment in various fields, while the P visa is for artists, athletes, and entertainers. The P visa has a lower standard of achievement than the O visa and is used for internationally recognized athletes and entertainment groups. H.R. 5060 and H.R. 1312 aim to amend visa laws for athletes and artists. H.R. 5060 would allow P visas for individual athletes to be renewed indefinitely in five-year increments. H.R. 1312 would expedite O or P visa petitions for nonprofit arts organizations. Additionally, H.R. 4080 would create a new subcategory for fashion models under the P visa category. Under H.R. 4080, fashion models under the P visa category would have the same authorized period of stay as individual athletes, up to 5 years initially and up to 10 years in total, with a cap of 1,000 visas issued annually. Most LPRs enter under priority worker categories based on extraordinary ability, advanced degrees, or skilled work experience. The current debate surrounds increasing employment-based immigration levels, with a focus on revising admissions upwards and potentially implementing a \"merit-based\" point system. There are discussions about excluding derivative family members from the numerical ceiling to address backlogs in family-based immigration. However, concerns arise about prioritizing employment-based immigration over resolving existing family-based backlogs. The immigration debate includes discussions on increasing employment-based immigration levels and implementing a merit-based point system. Proposed changes in the immigration bill would eliminate current preference categories and introduce a multi-tiered point system for merit-based immigrants based on factors like employment, education, English proficiency, and family relationships. Other pending bills also address employment-based LPRs. Several pending bills aim to increase employment-based LPRs, such as H.R. 1645, S. 1038/H.R. 1930, and S. 1397. These bills propose to raise the annual number of employment-based LPRs, exempt certain individuals with advanced degrees from numerical limits, and no longer count derivative family members towards the numerical ceiling. H.R. 5924 focuses on employment-based immigrants with advanced degrees in STEM fields working in shortage occupations like nurses and physical therapists. It would make 20,000 visas available annually outside of existing numerical limitations, with unused visas rolling over to the next fiscal year. Employers petitioning for these visas for nurses would be subject to a $1,500 fee per nurse for training facilities and nursing education enhancement. The legislative option to \"recapture\" unused LPR visas from previous years, specifically for employment-based visas in shortage occupations like nurses and physical therapists, was included in H.R. 3043. Employers petitioning for these visas would have been required to pay a $1,500 fee for nursing education in the United States. However, these provisions were not included in P.L. 110-161. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved provisions to exempt aliens in DOL-designated shortage occupations from numerical limitations on employment-based visas through FY2011. However, these provisions were dropped from the Senate version of the bill. H.R. 5882 would recapture unused LPR visa numbers from FY1992-FY2007 for issuance in subsequent years, separately for employment-based and family-based visas. The recapture of unused LPR visa numbers from FY1992-FY2007 for issuance in subsequent years would be done separately for employment-based and family-based visas. Available visas not issued in a fiscal year would automatically be added to the available total for the following year. Proposals for increasing immigration of high-skilled workers also include reforms for student visas in STEM fields. S. 1639 and H.R. 1645 propose creating a new F visa category for STEM students, allowing them to work off-campus after completing their studies. Employers must first attempt to hire a U.S. citizen before employing foreign students and pay them the prevailing wage. H.R. 1645 also includes provisions for foreign nationals with a master's degree. The proposed legislation includes provisions to exempt foreign nationals with master's degrees from numerical limits on permanent admissions, including those in STEM fields who have been working in the U.S. for three years. These exemptions would apply retroactively to previous degree holders. Unauthorized alien students in the United States are not legally in the country on nonimmigrant visas like foreign students. They face obstacles in attending college, including restrictions on in-state residency status for tuition purposes. They are also ineligible for federal benefits under the Higher Education Act of 1965. Unauthorized alien students in the United States are ineligible for federal student financial aid and face obstacles in attending college. Bills like the DREAM Act have been introduced to provide relief by enabling certain unauthorized alien students to adjust to LPR status. S. 774 and H.R. 1275 are stand-alone DREAM Act bills in the 110th Congress that aim to repeal the IIRIRA provision and eliminate restrictions on state provision of postsecondary educational benefits to unauthorized aliens. Both S. 774 and H.R. 1275 aim to enable unauthorized alien students to adjust to LPR status through cancellation of removal, allowing them to apply for LPR status without being placed in removal proceedings. Eligibility requirements include demonstrating continuous presence in the US for at least five years and being under age 16. Both S. 774 and H.R. 1275 aim to grant unauthorized alien students LPR status through cancellation of removal. Eligibility requires continuous presence in the US for at least five years and being under age 16. There is no limit on the number of aliens who could be granted this status. If granted, aliens would initially receive conditional permanent resident status, valid for six years and subject to termination. To become a full-fledged LPR, additional requirements such as acquiring a college degree or completing two years in a bachelor's program must be met. S. 2205, a DREAM Act bill introduced in October 2007, failed to pass in the Senate. It proposed granting LPR status to unauthorized students through cancellation of removal, requiring continuous presence in the US for at least five years and admission to an institution of higher education. The DREAM Act bill S. 2205 proposed granting LPR status to unauthorized students under age 30 who had been admitted to an institution of higher education or earned a high school diploma in the US. Those granted cancellation of removal would initially be adjusted to conditional permanent resident status, with requirements such as acquiring a college degree or serving in the uniformed services for at least two years to become a full-fledged LPR. There would be no limit on the number of aliens eligible for cancellation of removal/adjustment of status. S. 2205 proposes granting LPR status to unauthorized students under age 30 who have been admitted to a higher education institution or earned a US high school diploma. Unlike previous bills, S. 2205 does not repeal the IIRIRA provision restricting state provision of postsecondary educational benefits to unauthorized aliens. The DREAM Act provisions have also been included in larger immigration reform bills, such as H.R. 1645 and S. 1639, with variations in eligibility criteria and pathways to legal status. S. 1639 introduces a new \"Z\" nonimmigrant visa category for aliens in the United States to obtain legal status. Unlike other DREAM Act bills, S. 1639 does not completely repeal the IIRIRA provision but makes it inapplicable for aliens with probationary Z or Z status. The Department of State issues visas and passports, while DHS issues other immigration documents. The Department of State issues visas and passports, while DHS issues most other immigration documents needed by foreign nationals in the United States. The security of immigration documents has been a concern for over a decade, focusing on preventing document fraud and unauthorized employment. Post-9/11, the emphasis shifted to preventing identity fraud and intercepting security threats, with a consensus on including biometric identifiers in immigration documents. Since 1996, the Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs has been required to issue biometric border crossing cards, known as laser visas. Congress later mandated that all visas include biometric identifiers, leading to the issuance of machine-readable visas with biometric features since October 2004. Additionally, USCIS in DHS issues immigration documents with biometric identifiers, such as the \"green card\" for permanent residents. Approximately 14.6 million biometric green cards were issued between FY1998 and FY2006. Between FY1998 and FY2006, over 8.3 million biometric Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) were issued to aliens eligible to work in the United States. The United States does not require its citizens to have national identification cards, but does require a valid passport for entry and exit. P.L. 108-458 mandates the development of a plan for a document denoting identity and citizenship for all entries into the United States, known as the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) aims to balance travel facilitation, document integrity, personal privacy, and security. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 requires collaboration with international partners to enhance border and document security. Bills in the 110th Congress focus on improving document security for immigration. The bills in the 110th Congress aim to improve document security for immigration, including provisions for authentication standards, document fraud training, and criminal penalties for fraud. The Visa Waiver Program allows nationals from certain countries to enter the US without a visa, based on meeting specific requirements. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) requires countries to meet specific criteria, such as offering reciprocal privileges to U.S. citizens, issuing machine-readable passports with biometric identifiers, and maintaining a low nonimmigrant refusal rate. P.L. 110-53 introduced new requirements for VWP participation, including the development of an electronic travel authorization system for aliens to provide biographical information before traveling to the United States. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) under P.L. 110-53 mandates an exit system to record the departure of VWP entrants, with a requirement for a 97% verification rate. The Secretary of DHS can waive the nonimmigrant refusal rate for VWP admission upon certification of an operational exit system and electronic travel authorization. By June 30, 2009, the exit system must include biometric identifiers for matching with watch lists and manifest information. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) requires an exit system with biometric capacity to match alien's information with watch lists. DHS must waive nonimmigrant refusal rate for VWP if exit system is operational. Border security is crucial for preventing illegal entries and protecting against threats like terrorists and smugglers. Border security has been a key issue for the 110th Congress, with debates on DHS resources and bills to add personnel, infrastructure, and technology. Several bills aim to enhance resources for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at ports of entry and between them, where the U.S. Border Patrol enforces immigration and federal laws. The USBP patrols over 8,000 miles of U.S. international borders with Mexico and Canada, as well as coastal waters. P.L. 110-53 authorizes hiring 200 additional CBP officers in FY2008 for busy airports and requires a report on efforts to secure the northern border. Other bills propose hiring 500 CBP officers annually from FY2008 to FY2012 to address attrition within the CBP workforce. In FY2012, P.L. 110-161 extends retirement program enhancements to CBP officers to reduce attrition. Bills like S. 1639 and H.R. 4088 aim to increase USBP agent manpower and recruit former Armed Forces personnel. H.R. 4088 also allows deployment of USBP agents to states in emergencies, grants administrative control over agent assets, and calls for additional surveillance technology for a \"virtual fence.\" The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is utilizing sensors, radars, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to establish a \"virtual fence\" along international borders for national security. Legislation requires DHS to submit a land border security plan to Congress biennially. Additionally, there are provisions in bills like H.R. 3916 to integrate UAVs into national airspace, address scientific innovation for border security, and establish a research program for detecting underground tunnels. The FY2008 DHS appropriations bill includes funding for increasing the USBP workforce, constructing fencing along the southern border, and deploying camera and radar towers. In 2006, Congress passed the Secure Fence Act (P.L. 109-367) directing DHS to construct 700 miles of fencing along the southern border. Congress has shown interest in deploying barriers along the U.S. international land border, with previous legislation granting broad authority to construct barriers and specifying where fencing should be built. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 directed the construction of 700 miles of fencing along the southern border, with new modifications in P.L. 110-161 requiring reinforced fencing in practical and effective locations. The Secretary of Homeland Security must identify areas for fencing construction by December 31, 2008, with bills like H.R. 4088 aiming to expand border infrastructure. P.L. 110-161 imposes new consultation requirements on the Secretary of Homeland Security for border barrier duties and conditions appropriations on compliance. The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) mandates the use of passports or other documents for travelers entering the US. The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) mandates the use of passports or other documents for travelers entering the US. Legislation has eased the deadline for implementation, requiring U.S. citizens to present a passport or accepted biometric document to re-enter the country. The 110th Congress enacted P.L. 110-53, requiring DHS to pilot an enhanced driver's license for WHTI entry. P.L. 100-53 mandates a cost-benefit analysis of WHTI and proposals to reduce passport card fees. H.R. 1061 aims to allow registered traveler programs as proof of citizenship under WHTI. State and local law enforcement officials have limited authority to enforce immigration law, mainly focusing on criminal provisions. The 287(g) program allows for agreements between the Secretary of Homeland Security and states/local governments to involve law enforcement officers in immigration enforcement. Some bills in the 110th Congress aimed to modify or expand this program, such as S. 1639 requiring DHS to reimburse states and local governments. Some bills in the 110th Congress aimed to modify or expand the 287(g) program. For example, S. 1639 would require DHS to reimburse states and local governments for training and equipment under the program. Other bills would create grant programs to reimburse states for unauthorized immigration-related expenses. Additionally, some bills would reaffirm the authority of states to enforce immigration laws. The bills S. 2717 and H.R. 842 in the 110th Congress would require DHS to designate central detention facilities for placing aliens apprehended by state and local law enforcement. These bills also mandate DHS to take aliens into federal custody within a specific timeframe. Employment verification and worksite enforcement are crucial in the immigration reform debate, with congressional support to expand verification requirements and strengthen worksite enforcement efforts. The INA \u00a7274A prohibits employers from hiring unauthorized aliens and requires participation in the I-9 employment eligibility verification system. Violations may result in civil and criminal penalties under worksite enforcement. Employers can also opt for the E-Verify program for electronic verification. E-Verify, established under IIRIRA, electronically verifies new hires' employment authorization through SSA and DHS databases. P.L. 110-329 extends E-Verify until March 6, 2009. The House passed a bill to extend E-Verify until November 2013, but the Senate did not act on it. P.L. 110-161 includes provisions building on current law for entities required to participate in an employment eligibility verification pilot program. The pilot program established under IIRIRA requires participation from Members of Congress, officers of Congress, and legislative branch agency heads. Employers violating employment laws may also be mandated to participate. Funding restrictions in P.L. 100-161 and P.L. 110-161 ensure compliance with employment verification requirements. Management may be used for new hires not verified through E-Verify. FY2008 appropriations bills contained language to prohibit funds for contracts with entities not participating in E-Verify. Various bills in the 110th Congress proposed electronic employment eligibility verification. S. 1639 would establish a new employment eligibility verification system. The new electronic EEVS would eventually become mandatory for all employers in the United States, with the Secretary of DHS authorized to require participation from federal contractors, critical infrastructure industries, and those related to national or homeland security. Within 18 months of enactment, all employers must participate for newly hired and certain current employees, and within three years, participation is required for all employees. S. 1639 proposes a new employment eligibility verification system. S. 1639 proposes changes to the current I-9 system, including provisions for administrative and judicial review for individuals with final nonconfirmation notices. It also includes modifications to monetary penalties for employer violations and provisions for disclosure of taxpayer identity information, secure Social Security cards, and a voluntary fingerprint verification program for employment eligibility. The bill H.R. 1645 proposes a new electronic employment verification system, making it illegal to hire without verifying identity and eligibility. Participation in the system would be phased-in based on employer size, with \"critical employers\" required to participate within one year of enactment. The schedule for participation is contingent on annual certifications of database updates. H.R. 1645 proposes a new electronic employment verification system with annual certifications required for database updates, low error rates, non-discrimination, privacy protection, and adequate staffing and funding. Employers must participate based on size, with \"critical employers\" required to participate within one year. The bill also includes a one-time reverification for current employees, administrative and judicial review for terminated individuals, modifications to the current I-9 system, and increased penalties for employer violations. H.R. 1645 includes provisions on disclosure of taxpayer identity information, enhancing Social Security card security, and amending unfair immigration-related employment practices. It also proposes making the E-Verify system permanent and requiring all employers to conduct employment authorization verification through it. S. 3093, like H.R. 4088 / S. 2366 / S. 2368, would make E-Verify permanent and require federal contractors to participate. It does not make participation mandatory for all employers but allows employers to elect to verify existing employees' eligibility. The Secretary of Homeland Security could also require E-Verify for employers with reasonable cause to believe they have committed material violations. H.R. 98 and H.R. 2954 propose adding an encrypted electronic ID strip and a digitized photo to Social Security cards for employment verification. Employers would use this new card to verify identity and work authorization through a DHS and SSA database. Penalties for unlawful employment violations would increase, with verification requirements starting two years after enactment. H.R. 2954 and H.R. 5515 propose new verification systems for employment eligibility, replacing the current E-Verify system. Employers would need to verify identity and eligibility using the Electronic Employment Verification System (EEVS) or the Secure Employment Eligibility Verification System (SEEVS) within three years of enactment. The EEVS would utilize the National Directory of New Hires database for information, differentiating it from E-Verify. H.R. 5515 proposes the Secure Employment Eligibility Verification System (SEEVS) to authenticate identity and verify employment eligibility using private sector entities. It also increases penalties for employer violations of immigration-related employment laws. The bill H.R. 5515 proposes the Secure Employment Eligibility Verification System (SEEV) to verify employment eligibility and increase penalties for employer violations of immigration-related employment laws. It also includes amendments to antidiscrimination requirements related to the EEVS and the SEEVS, as well as provisions for the disclosure of information in the National Directory of New Hires. Refugee admissions to the United States are authorized by the INA, with a worldwide refugee ceiling for FY2009 set at 80,000. Unused refugee numbers in a fiscal year are lost and do not carry over. Refugee numbers unused in a fiscal year are lost and do not carry over. The Department of State (DOS) handles overseas processing of refugees through a system of three priorities for admission: Priority One (P-1) for compelling protection cases, Priority Two (P-2) for groups of special humanitarian concern, and Priority Three (P-3) for family reunification cases. In FY2009, USCIS adjudicates refugee cases for individuals outside their country of nationality. The Lautenberg amendment eases evidence requirements for former Soviet and Indochinese nationals seeking refugee status. The Specter amendment directs the Attorney General to establish categories for refugee status. The \"Specter amendment\" directs the Attorney General to establish categories for Iranian religious minorities to qualify for refugee status under the Lautenberg amendment. P.L. 110-5 and P.L. 110-161 extend the Lautenberg amendment through FY2008. The \"McCain amendment\" made adult children of certain Vietnamese refugees eligible for U.S. refugee resettlement, with subsequent extensions through FY2009. The House passed H.R. 3096 to offer refugee resettlement to eligible nationals of Vietnam due to administrative errors or missed deadlines. Funding for refugee assistance was allocated for FY2007 and FY2008, with a request for $628.0 million for FY2009. The Senate Appropriations Committee's FY2009 Labor, HHS, Education appropriations bill (S. 3230) allocates $635.0 for ORR programs. Iraqi refugees are eligible for resettlement in the U.S. with 13,823 admitted in FY2008 and 1,443 as of November 30, 2008. Multiple bills in the 110th Congress aim to facilitate Iraqi refugee resettlement. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 specifies groups of Iraqis eligible for refugee processing priorities, including those employed by the U.S. government, media organizations, or persecuted religious minorities with family in the U.S. Iraqis are also eligible for Priority Three processing in FY2009, requiring individuals to be outside their country for resettlement in the U.S. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 specifies groups of Iraqis eligible for refugee processing priorities, including those employed by the U.S. government, media organizations, or persecuted religious minorities with family in the U.S. Provisions in various bills allow for the establishment of programs to facilitate the admission of Iraqis who have worked closely with the U.S. government or military. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 specifies groups of Iraqis eligible for refugee processing priorities, including those employed by the U.S. government, media organizations, or persecuted religious minorities with family in the U.S. Provisions in various bills allow for the establishment of programs to facilitate the admission of Iraqis who have worked closely with the U.S. government or military. Additionally, laws have been expanded to grant special immigrant status to nationals of Iraq or Afghanistan who have worked directly with the U.S. Armed Forces or under Chief of Mission authority as translators or interpreters. The annual cap on this program has been increased to 500 for FY2007 and FY2008. Absences from the United States due to work with the Chief of Mission or U.S. Armed Forces as a translator or interpreter in Iraq or Afghanistan will not be considered a break in U.S. continuous residence for naturalization purposes under the INA. Furthermore, P.L. 110-181 broadens DHS's authority to provide special immigrant status to certain nationals of Iraq and grants the Secretary of State the authority to provide such status in consultation with DHS. Iraqi nationals are eligible for special immigrant status under this law. Iraqi nationals eligible for special immigrant status if employed by U.S. government in Iraq after March 20, 2003, for at least one year, provided valuable service, and faced ongoing serious threat. Program capped at 5,000 principal aliens for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. Secretary of Homeland Security or State can convert approved petitions for special immigrant status for Afghani or Iraqi translators. Iraqi and Afghani translators or interpreters under special immigrant program can have their approved petitions converted to special immigrant status under P.L. 110-181 if visa not immediately available. They are eligible for resettlement assistance and federal public assistance. Special immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan can receive benefits similar to refugees for up to six months under P.L. 110-161. H.R. 6328 would establish a White House Coordinator for Iraqi refugees and IDPs. The U.S. government reports estimate 14,500 to 17,500 victims trafficked into the country annually. The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 created a nonimmigrant category for trafficking victims and relief avenues. The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007 and 2008 reauthorized existing grant programs, created new grant programs, and amended the T visa in the United States. H.R. 3887 and S. 3061 included similar provisions with minor differences, focusing on reauthorizing grant programs, creating new programs for U.S. citizen victims of trafficking, and establishing a White House Coordinator for Iraqi refugees and IDPs. The bills H.R. 3887 and S. 3061 aim to create new grant programs for U.S. citizen victims of trafficking, establish a monitoring system for assistance, provide information on U.S. laws against trafficking to visa applicants, deny certain visas to those involved in trafficking, and broaden relief options for trafficking victims. H.R. 3887 also includes disclosure requirements for foreign labor contractors. The bills H.R. 3887 and S. 1703 aim to expand compensation eligibility under the Victims of Crime Act for foreign labor contractors hiring aliens and make it a federal offense to persuade individuals into prostitution.

The smuggling of aliens into the United States poses a significant risk to national security and public safety, with potential ties to terrorism. Alien smuggling generates revenue for criminal enterprises and leads to collateral crimes. Various bills aim to amend alien smuggling provisions to enhance penalties and enforcement. The bills (S. 2463) and H.R. 4088 / S. 2366 / S. 2368 (SAVE Act) aim to expand prohibited activities under INA \u00a7274, including asserting extraterritorial jurisdiction for alien smuggling outside the U.S. They propose increased penalties for smuggling offenses, modifications to the religious denomination exemption, and higher penalties for individuals piloting maritime vessels in violation of immigration laws. Certain refugees, asylees, and specified humanitarian categories are eligible for SSI benefits for seven years after arriving in the United States. LPRs need a substantial work history or military connection to qualify for SSI. H.R. 2608 would extend eligibility to nine years for certain individuals and make LPRs with pending naturalization applications eligible for SSI benefits. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2608 extends eligibility for SSI benefits to certain refugees, asylees, and aliens in specified humanitarian categories for nine years, from FY2009 through FY2011. The bill includes victims of trafficking as eligible and sets criteria such as being an LPR for less than six years, applying for LPR status within four years of receiving SSI, being at least age 70, or being under age 18.

Additionally, the Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act (S. 844) addresses issues surrounding unaccompanied alien children and allows UAC to consult with a consular officer before repatriation. The legislation grants UAC the right to consult with a consular officer before repatriation, establishes criteria for their treatment and detention, and outlines the preference order for child placement. It also allows the Office of Refugee Resettlement access to children in DHS custody to verify their age. Child advocates, including counsel, would be appointed for UAC not being repatriated to a contiguous country, serving on a pro bono basis. This legislation was passed as a floor amendment and includes stricter reporting requirements for agencies with UAC jurisdiction. The House Foreign Affairs Committee included provisions in H.R. 3887 for special immigrants, such as ministers of religion and religious workers. Religious work is defined as employment related to traditional religious functions within a denomination. The provision for religious workers has a sunset date that has been extended by Congress multiple times. The House passed H.R. 5570 to extend the sunset date for religious workers in the INA to January 1, 2010. S. 3606 extended the provision only through March 6, 2009, with a focus on reducing fraud. P.L. 110-391 was passed in September 2008. The EB-5 visa is set aside for immigrant investors coming to the U.S. The EB-5 visa program includes a pilot program for Regional Centers to encourage investment and job creation. The program was extended multiple times, with the latest extension until March 6, 2009. Provisions in the INA offer temporary protected status (TPS) under specified circumstances, such as ongoing armed conflict, environmental disasters, or extraordinary conditions preventing aliens from returning home. TPS is granted if consistent with U.S. national interests. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, can issue TPS for 6 to 18 months and extend if conditions don't change. Currently, TPS is provided to nationals from seven countries. The Bush Administration announced the expiration of Liberian TPS in 2007, citing improved country conditions. Legislation was passed to extend Liberia's TPS designation and work authorization for Liberian nationals. President George W. Bush deferred the enforced departure of Liberians with TPS until 2009. Legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to expand the scope of terrorism-related activities affecting immigration consequences, but recent laws have narrowed these provisions. P.L. 110-161 exempts certain groups from being labeled as terrorist organizations for immigration purposes and gives officials more discretion to waive terrorism-related grounds for alien removal and exclusion. The 110th Congress legislation aimed to broaden terrorism-related immigration consequences, but recent laws have narrowed these provisions.

Additionally, Congress is considering expanding immigration benefits for military service members and their families, including provisions for reentry into the United States and overseas naturalization for certain LPRs. The Military Personnel Citizenship Processing Act expedites military service-related naturalization applications by allowing the use of fingerprints taken at enlistment and establishing an FBI liaison office in USCIS for background checks. This applies to current and former service members, as well as spouses of current service members. The Military Personnel Citizenship Processing Act expedites military service-related naturalization applications for current and former service members, spouses of current service members, surviving spouses and children of service members who died on active-duty, and deceased service members eligible for posthumous citizenship. The amendments made by P.L. 110-382 sunset five years after enactment. H.R. 6020 aims to further facilitate and expand immigration benefits for military service members and their families, expanding the scope of military naturalizations to include persons serving honorably in the Armed Forces in support of contingency operations. The bill H.R. 6020 aims to expand immigration benefits for military service members by facilitating naturalization for those serving in contingency operations and removing conditional LPR status for certain current or former members of the Armed Forces. It also limits removal proceedings against honorably serving aliens and allows for waivers of certain inadmissibility or deportation grounds at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General.

Foreign medical graduates on J-1 visas must return to their home countries for two years before applying for other visas or LPR status, unless granted a waiver. The Conrad State Program allows for waivers of the foreign residency requirement for foreign medical graduates (FMGs) on J-1 visas. The program, established in 1994, has been extended multiple times, most recently covering aliens acquiring J status before June 1, 2013. Additionally, P.L. 110-286 bans travel to the United States by leaders of the Myanmar junta and prohibits visas for former or present leaders of the junta or the Burmese military. The visa ban applies to individuals associated with the SPDC, USDA, or Burmese military involved in human rights abuses. The President can waive the ban if in the national interest. Health-related grounds bar entry for those with communicable diseases. Certain prospective immigrants with communicable diseases, including HIV, can obtain a discretionary waiver. Section 305 of P.L. 110-293 removes the reference to HIV/AIDS from health-related exclusion grounds. S. 456 would increase penalties for immigration-related gang crimes. P.L. 110-340 addresses gang-related offenses and penalties for aliens involved in child soldier recruitment.
