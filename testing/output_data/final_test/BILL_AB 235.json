    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 12814.6 of the Vehicle Code is amended to require a provisional licensing program for drivers aged 16 to under 18, with specific components outlined. Upon application for an original license, the applicant is issued an instruction permit under Section 12509. The permit allows the person to operate a motor vehicle, excluding motorcycles or motorized bicycles, while taking driver training or practicing it under the supervision of a licensed driver over 25 years old. The person must hold the instruction permit for at least six months before applying for a provisional driver's license and comply with specific requirements. To obtain a driver's license in California, a person must complete approved courses in driver education or training in a secondary school or an integrated program approved by the department. The program must include 30 hours of classroom instruction and six hours of behind-the-wheel training. To obtain a driver's license in California, completion of six hours or more of behind-the-wheel instruction by a licensed driving school or instructor, along with an accredited course in automobile driver education in a secondary school or equivalent professional instruction meeting department standards, is required. Compliance with this requirement exempts a person from needing to fulfill additional driver education requirements to graduate from high school. A student must complete driver education before taking driver training instruction, except as provided under certain circumstances. The person must complete 50 hours of supervised driving practice, including 10 hours of driving during darkness, before getting a provisional license. A certification from a parent, guardian, or instructor is required for the driving test application. This requirement does not apply to motorcycle practice. The provisional driver's license has restrictions for the first 12 months, including not driving between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. and not transporting passengers under 20 years old without supervision. A provisional driver's license allows driving between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. or transporting family members without supervision in certain circumstances, such as medical necessity with a physician's statement. The provisional driver's license allows driving during specified hours or transporting family members in certain circumstances, such as medical necessity with a physician's statement. Additionally, the licensee can operate a vehicle for schooling, school-authorized activities, or employment necessity when transportation facilities are inadequate, with the requirement of keeping a signed statement from the school or employer. The provisional driver's license allows driving for specific reasons like medical necessity or transportation for schooling, employment, or school-authorized activities. Law enforcement cannot stop a vehicle solely to check if the driver is violating license restrictions or health and safety codes. Upon finding a licensee violating license restrictions, the court may impose community service or fines. For a first offense, community service ranges from 8 to 16 hours, with fines up to $35; for subsequent offenses, community service is 16 to 24 hours, with fines up to $50. The court retains jurisdiction until community service is completed within 90 days, or fines are imposed. A conviction of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) may not be disclosed or count as a violation point. Any driving privilege restriction or suspension remains in effect until the term ends, even if the person turns 18 before then. The driving privilege is suspended if notifications under Section 40509 or 40509.5 are on record, and the suspension continues until the notifications are cleared. A 30-day restriction is imposed in certain cases. A 30-day restriction is imposed on a driver with two or more violation points in 12 months, requiring accompaniment by a licensed driver 25 years or older. A six-month suspension and one-year probation is imposed on a driver with three or more violation points, with conditions including no law violations and accident responsibility. The person with violation points may demand a hearing within 10 days if the department takes action due to a motor vehicle accident. No hearing is allowed if the action is based on a conviction reportable to the department. The department requires proof of financial responsibility from a person with a suspended or revoked driving privilege. This proof must be submitted before reinstatement and maintained with the department for three years. The department may issue distinctive driver's licenses to individuals aged 16-18 and 18-21 with unique features for immediate recognition. Changes in license format can be made under a new production contract. The Brady-Jared Teen Driver Safety Act of 1997 requires the original issuance date of the provisional driver's license to be included on the license. No reimbursement is needed for this act as it pertains to creating new crimes or infractions."
