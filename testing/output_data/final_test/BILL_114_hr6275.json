    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Donald Payne Sr. Colorectal Cancer Detection Act of 2016\" and includes Medicare coverage for FDA-approved qualifying colorectal cancer screening blood-based tests. The \"Donald Payne Sr. Colorectal Cancer Detection Act of 2016\" amends the Social Security Act to include Medicare coverage for qualifying colorectal cancer screening blood-based tests that meet specific criteria. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act amends the Social Security Act to include frequency limits for colorectal cancer screening tests and payment amounts for qualifying colorectal cancer screening blood-based tests. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act includes frequency limits for colorectal cancer screening tests and payment amounts for qualifying blood-based tests. This includes timeframes for follow-up screenings after different findings, such as adenomas or small polyps. Frequency limits are set for colorectal cancer screening tests under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Payment is not allowed for a screening colonoscopy within specific timeframes after previous tests, based on risk levels for colorectal cancer. The payment amount for colorectal cancer screening tests using blood-based methods will be determined by the Secretary based on a comparison to tests for inherited colorectal cancer. Frequency limits apply to these tests as well. The amendments made by this section apply to colorectal cancer screening tests using blood-based methods, with an effective date more than 6 months after the enactment of the Act."
