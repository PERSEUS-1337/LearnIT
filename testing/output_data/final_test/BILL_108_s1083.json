    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Children's Express Lane to Health Coverage Act of 2003\". Congress finds that despite recent gains, 8.9 million children in the US are uninsured, with 6.9 million eligible for public health insurance. Most low-income uninsured children are enrolled in nutrition programs like food stamps, school lunch, and WIC. Improving administrative efficiency and reducing bureaucracy in federal means-tested programs would benefit the public. The purpose of this Act is to give States flexibility in determining income eligibility for Medicaid or State children's health insurance based on a child's enrollment in nutrition assistance programs like WIC. This aims to streamline administrative processes and reduce unnecessary bureaucracy. Children can qualify for nutrition assistance or similar public programs based on income standards and methodologies. State has the option to simplify determining a child's financial eligibility for Medicaid or SCHIP. The Medicaid program allows states to simplify financial eligibility requirements for individuals under 21 years of age by using determinations of family income or resources from specified agencies. The Food Stamp Act of 1977, the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 allow specified agencies to provide information for determining eligibility for medical assistance or child health assistance under State plans. This does not authorize denial of assistance to individuals based on this information. The financial eligibility process under title XXI may apply to individuals older than age 21 at the option of the State, relieving the State of certain obligations related to determining eligibility for assistance. The amendments to the Social Security Act allow states to extend medical assistance eligibility to individuals over 21 based on pregnancy or if they are a parent, guardian, or caretaker relative of a qualified individual. The changes also include the option for states to base a child's eligibility on financial determinations from a nutrition or public assistance program. These amendments will take effect on October 1, 2003."
