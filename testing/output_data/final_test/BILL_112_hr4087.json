    "content": "The Act titled \"Prescription Drug Labeling Promotion Act of 2012\" aims to improve accessibility of information in prescription drug labeling for visually-impaired and blind consumers. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a working group to develop guidance on best practices for access to prescription drug labeling for the visually impaired. The group will include representatives from organizations for the blind, elderly, and industry stakeholders, with equal representation from consumer and industry advocates. The working group will provide guidance on best practices for pharmacies to ensure blind and visually impaired individuals have independent access to prescription drug labeling. This guidance will include considerations such as the use of Braille and auditory means like \"talking bottles\". The working group will provide guidance on best practices for pharmacies to ensure blind and visually impaired individuals have independent access to prescription drug labeling. This includes using \"talking bottles\" for audible label information, digital voice recorders, RFID tags, large font labels, high-contrast printing, and sans-serif font for enhanced visual means. The working group will provide guidance on best practices for pharmacies to ensure blind and visually impaired individuals have independent access to prescription drug labeling. This includes technical, financial, and manpower factors unique to pharmacies with 20 or fewer retail locations, as well as an informational and educational program conducted by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. The Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to the working group, and a GAO study will begin 18 months after the publication. Beginning 18 months after the guidance on best practices is published, the Comptroller General will review pharmacy compliance and barriers to accessible prescription drug labeling for the blind and visually impaired. A report with recommendations to reduce these barriers must be submitted to Congress by September 30, 2016. The term \"pharmacy\" includes those that dispense prescription drugs through an Internet website. A \"prescription drug\" refers to a drug regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act."
