Congress finds that diabetes is a significant public health threat in the United States, with over 18 million Americans currently living with the disease. Diabetes is the fifth leading cause of death in the country and accounted for $132 billion in healthcare costs in 2002. There are two forms of diabetes - type 1, caused by the body's inability to produce insulin, and type 2, where the body either doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use it properly. Type 2 diabetes can be managed through diet, nutrition, and lifestyle changes, accounting for 95% of all diabetes cases. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has tripled in the last 30 years, largely due to obesity. Lifestyle changes can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58%. Diabetes self-management training provides knowledge and skill training. Diabetes education involves providing knowledge and skill training to patients with diabetes to help them manage the condition effectively. Certified diabetes educators, such as nurses, dietitians, or pharmacists, specialize in assisting patients with developing self-management skills to prevent complications and secondary conditions. There are over 20,000 diabetes educators in the United States. Certified diabetes educators (CDEs) in the United States must meet specific requirements to provide diabetes self-management training, distinguishing them from other healthcare professionals who may have less experience in this area.
