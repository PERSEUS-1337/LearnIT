    "title": "AB 2371",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Article 2 adds a Special Olympics Fund to the Revenue and Taxation Code, allowing individuals to contribute excess funds to support Special Olympics Northern California and Southern California. Contributions must be in full dollar amounts and are irrevocable once designated on the tax return. The Franchise Tax Board will update the tax return form to include a section for the \"Special Olympics Fund\" contribution. The contribution can be one dollar or more and will support activities for individuals with intellectual disabilities. A deduction is allowed for contributions made to the fund. The Special Olympics Fund is established in the State Treasury to receive contributions from taxpayers. The Franchise Tax Board and Controller will transfer designated amounts to the fund, which will be allocated for reimbursement of costs incurred in connection with their duties under this article. The State Department of Social Services will disburse the balance of the Special Olympics Fund between Special Olympics Northern California and Special Olympics Southern California based on taxpayer donations. The Department may use up to 3 percent for administrative costs, while the organizations cannot use the funds for administrative purposes. The Special Olympics Northern California and Southern California must report annually to the State Department of Social Services on the use of funds received, ensuring they were not used for administrative costs or purposes outside of California. The Special Olympics Fund will be in effect until January 1 of the fifth taxable year after its appearance on tax returns, with the Franchise Tax Board required to provide updates each year. The Franchise Tax Board determines the minimum contribution amount required for a fund to appear on tax returns. They estimate contributions to be received during the year to meet or exceed this minimum amount. The Franchise Tax Board sets a minimum contribution amount for the Special Olympics Fund to appear on tax returns. If estimated contributions for a calendar year fall below this amount, the article becomes inoperative for taxable years starting that year and is repealed by December 1. The minimum contribution amount is $250,000 for the second calendar year after the fund's first appearance on tax returns. The Franchise Tax Board adjusts the minimum contribution amount for the Special Olympics Fund annually based on the inflation factor adjustment. The adjustment is calculated using the California Consumer Price Index for all items."
