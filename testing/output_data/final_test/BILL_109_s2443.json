The \"Separate Enrollment and Line Item Veto Act of 2006\" requires detailed allocation information in appropriation measures, with a point of order if not met. Authorization legislation also mandates specific details in allocation. Authorization measures must present new direct spending or targeted tax benefits separately, with detailed allocation information. Failure to comply results in a point of order and recommittal to the committee. The conference report must contain detailed allocation information for appropriations and authorizations. Failure to comply with this requirement results in a point of order. If the House or Senate fails to comply with detailed allocation information in the conference report, it will not be allowed to consider the report. If a point of order is sustained, the measure will be sent back to the conference committee. SEC. 3. WAIVERS AND APPEALS. Any provision of section 2 may be waived or suspended in the House or Senate by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members shall be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order. SEC. 4. SEPARATE ENROLLMENT. When an appropriation or authorization measure first passes both Houses of Congress in the same form, the items shall be disaggregated and assigned new bill numbers. Each item will be treated as a separate bill to be considered individually. The remaining parts of the bill will also be considered separately with the disaggregated bills. The bill must be disaggregated into separate bills without substantive revision, bearing the original designation and a new one if necessary. The new bills will be placed on the appropriate calendars in both Houses for consideration as the next order of business. The bills will be considered and voted on en bloc without amendment. Debate will be limited to 1 hour, divided equally between majority and minority leaders. Further debate limitations or motions to recommit are not allowed. Reconsidering the vote on the bills is also not permitted. SEC. 5. VETO OF BILL.
