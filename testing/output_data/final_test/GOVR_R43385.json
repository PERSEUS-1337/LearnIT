    "content": "This report provides data on the geographic distribution of the mortgage interest deduction (MID) tax expenditure, which benefits qualifying taxpayers by lowering their federal tax liabilities. Understanding how the benefits of the deduction are distributed across different states can help policymakers assess the potential impact on constituents from a policy change. The mortgage interest deduction allows homeowners to deduct interest paid on mortgages for primary or secondary residences if they itemize their tax deductions. The deduction is limited to the interest on the first $1 million of combined mortgage debt and $100,000 of home equity debt. Taxpayers with mortgages over $1 million can still claim the deduction by allocating interest payments appropriately. The value of the deduction increases with a taxpayer's income due to their marginal tax rate. The mortgage interest deduction allows homeowners to deduct interest paid on mortgages for primary or secondary residences if they itemize their tax deductions. The deduction is limited to the interest on the first $1 million of combined mortgage debt and $100,000 of home equity debt. Taxpayers with mortgages over $1 million can still claim the deduction by allocating interest payments appropriately. The value of the deduction increases with a taxpayer's income due to their marginal tax rate. Higher-income individuals tend to purchase more expensive homes, resulting in larger mortgage interest payments and a larger deduction. The original purpose of the deduction was to allow for the deduction of expenses incurred in the generation of income, consistent with traditional economic theories of income taxation. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 limited the amount of mortgage interest that could be deducted and restricted the number of homes for which the deduction could be claimed to two. Mortgage interest deductibility was limited to the purchase price of the home, plus any improvements, and on debt secured by the home but used for qualified medical and educational expenses. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 resulted in current basic deduction limits. Various proposals have emerged to modify the mortgage interest deduction, including reducing the maximum mortgage amount, converting it to a tax credit, or limiting the deduction rate for higher income taxpayers. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the mortgage interest deduction reduced federal tax revenues by $59.0 billion in FY2016, providing individuals with a similar tax benefit. An analysis was conducted to distribute this benefit across states using statistical measures, accounting for state-level differences in incomes and mortgage interest deducted. The data is presented in tabular form in Appendix A, with the estimated per capita mortgage interest deduction tax expenditure for each state shown in Figure 1. The data in Figure 1 shows the variation in per capita tax expenditure for the mortgage interest deduction across states in 2014. Residents of Mississippi and West Virginia were the smallest beneficiaries, receiving an average of $87 and slightly less, respectively. In 2014, residents of Mississippi and West Virginia received the smallest benefit of $87 per person from the mortgage interest deduction tax expenditures. In contrast, residents of the District of Columbia and Maryland were the largest beneficiaries, with per person benefits of $436 and $402, respectively. The per capita benefit in DC and Maryland is nearly five times higher than in Mississippi and West Virginia. Residents of the 10 smallest beneficiary states received an average of $109 per person, while residents of the 10 largest beneficiary states averaged $349 per person, more than five times as much. The mortgage interest deduction benefits are concentrated in the mid-Atlantic, northeastern coastal states, and the west coast. States like Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, and Minnesota also benefit. The Midwest and Southern regions receive the least benefit. Claim rates vary across the country, with North Dakota and South Dakota having the lowest rates, and Connecticut having the highest. The mortgage interest deduction benefits are concentrated in states along the west coast and portions of the east coast, with high claim rates in Connecticut and Maryland. Only about half of all homeowners nationally claim the deduction, with factors such as not having a mortgage or living in a state without an income tax contributing to non-claiming homeowners. The distribution of homeowners claiming the mortgage interest deduction varies across states. States like Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, and West Virginia have the lowest claim rates, while the west coast and parts of the mid-Atlantic and northeastern states have higher claim rates. On average, Americans saved approximately $2,149 in taxes in 2014 by claiming this deduction. Figure 4 shows the variation in the average benefit received by homeowners claiming the mortgage interest deduction across different states. DC claimants received the largest benefit ($3,683), followed by California ($3,223), while Iowa and Kentucky claimants received the smallest benefits ($1,324 and $1,345 respectively). The distribution is skewed towards certain geographic areas, with mid-Atlantic and northeast coast states benefiting more. Homeowners in mid-Atlantic and northeast coast states, as well as west coast states like California and Washington, benefited the most from the mortgage interest deduction. Alaska, Colorado, and Hawaii homeowners also saw significant benefits. On the other hand, claimants in the Midwest, southern states, and Maine benefited the least. Various factors contribute to the state variation in deduction amounts, making it complex to isolate the precise effects of each factor. Understanding the variation in benefits from the mortgage interest deduction among states is important for analyzing potential policy changes. Homeownership rates vary across states, with higher rates in lower cost-of-living areas like West Virginia and lower rates in higher cost-of-living areas like New York and California. This variation influences which tax filers claim the deduction and who ultimately benefits from it. States with higher homeownership rates like Minnesota, Maine, Iowa, Delaware, New Hampshire, and Vermont may expect higher claims rates for the mortgage interest deduction. However, the correlation between homeownership rates and the average amount of interest deducted or tax savings is not clear-cut. Other factors such as home prices and incomes also play a role in determining the benefits of the deduction. Higher home prices contribute to variation in the mortgage interest deduction data in two ways: homeowners in higher priced areas are more likely to claim the deduction due to larger mortgages and interest payments, and they also benefit more from the deduction because of the larger amounts of deductible interest. This explains why beneficiaries of the deduction differ between states with varying home prices, with higher prices along the east and west coasts leading to more beneficiaries. Additionally, variation in state and local taxes, such as income, property, and sales taxes, also contributes to the variation in deduction benefits. The variation in the mortgage interest deduction data is influenced by state and local taxes, as well as area incomes. Higher area incomes support higher home prices, leading to larger mortgages and interest payments. Homeowners in areas with higher incomes are more likely to claim the deduction, and the deduction is more valuable in higher income markets. Congress has various options for the mortgage interest deduction, which may need careful consideration to minimize disruptions. Changes could lead to a more evenly distributed benefit for homeowners. The House GOP \"Better Way\" Blueprint for tax reform does not specify a direction but aims to make the deduction more effective and efficient in promoting homeownership. The House GOP \"Better Way\" Blueprint for tax reform aims to make the mortgage interest deduction more effective and efficient in promoting homeownership. Any changes would include a grandfather provision for existing mortgages. The deduction is popular among homeowners and industry groups, but research suggests it may not effectively increase homeownership. The House GOP \"Better Way\" Blueprint for tax reform aims to make the mortgage interest deduction more effective and efficient in promoting homeownership. Leaving the mortgage interest deduction unaltered could result in continued uneven distribution of benefits across states. Congress could consider alternatives to the deduction to assist homeowners more equitably and efficiently. Eliminating the mortgage interest deduction is one option that could be evaluated for its impact on taxpayers. Eliminating the mortgage interest deduction could promote a more uniform tax treatment across taxpayers, treating homeowners equally regardless of their location. It would also align treatment between homeowners and renters in the tax code, potentially improving economic efficiency by reallocating resources to more productive sectors. Studies suggest that owner-occupied housing is currently taxed favorably compared to other investments. Eliminating the mortgage interest deduction could create tax uniformity, improve federal revenue, and potentially impact homeownership rates by addressing barriers beyond tax deductions. Eliminating the mortgage interest deduction may have a small long-term effect on homeownership rates, as it is not well-targeted towards lower-income households. Careful consideration is needed to avoid short-term negative consequences such as a drop in home demand, decrease in home prices, capital losses for current owners, and a reduction in new home construction and homeowner wealth. Eliminating the mortgage interest deduction could lead to a reduction in new home construction, homeowner wealth, and higher defaults. Phasing out the deduction over 15-20 years could mitigate negative consequences for the economy and housing market. Researchers propose a fixed date after which the deduction would no longer be available to avoid short-term negative impacts. Eliminating the mortgage interest deduction could have negative consequences for the economy and housing market. Researchers suggest phasing out the deduction over 15-20 years to mitigate these effects. Currently, the deduction allows for claiming interest on up to $1 million of mortgage debt for primary or secondary residences, or up to $100,000 of home equity debt. The mortgage interest deduction could be limited to benefit first-time homebuyers, with proposals to gradually reduce the maximum deductible mortgage amount from $1.1 million to $500,000. This could generate $41.4 billion in revenue between 2013 and 2019. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp also suggested limiting the size of mortgages eligible for the deduction in a 2014 tax reform draft. The proposal aims to reduce the eligible mortgage amount for the deduction to $500,000 over four years starting in 2015. Interest on home equity debt incurred after 2014 would no longer be deductible, with new limitations only applying to new mortgage debt. A grandfather provision is included for refinanced debt if the original mortgage debt was incurred before the reduction. Another option is to keep the maximum mortgage amount unchanged but limit the deductible interest to a percentage of adjusted gross income. Limiting the deduction for mortgage interest to a percentage of adjusted gross income (AGI) could help reduce interstate variation in the deduction. States with higher incomes would benefit more from the deduction, as itemization is more common among higher income households. Placing limits on the deductible amount could decrease the variation, although some differences will still exist. One option for Congress is to replace the mortgage interest deduction with a tax credit, which could benefit more homeowners and provide a consistent rate of subsidization regardless of income. Making the tax credit refundable would target lower-income homeowners effectively. Several mortgage interest tax credit options have been proposed, including limiting the deduction to a taxpayer's principal residence, a 15% credit rate for four out of five options, and three nonrefundable credit options. Limits on eligible mortgages range from $300,000 to 125% of the area median home prices. One option has no cap on the mortgage size but limits the tax credit to $25,000. The CBO suggested converting the mortgage interest deduction to a 15% nonrefundable tax credit. The proposal suggests converting the mortgage interest deduction to a nonrefundable tax credit of 15% for interest paid on a taxpayer's primary residence, excluding home equity loans. The credit would phase in between 2017 and 2021, with a reduction in eligible mortgage amounts by $100,000. From 2022 onwards, only mortgages up to $500,000 would qualify for the credit, estimated to raise $105 billion from 2017 to 2026. Similar options were previously presented in 2013 and 2009. In 2015, a proposal recommended replacing the mortgage interest deduction with a nonrefundable credit equal to 12% of interest paid on mortgages of $500,000 or less for a taxpayer's primary residence. The credit would not apply to home equity loans. The proposal by former Senator Pete Domenici and former CBO Director Alice Rivlin suggests a 15% credit for up to $25,000 of mortgage interest paid on a principal residence, excluding home equity loans and second homes. The refundable tax credit would be administered through mortgage lenders, benefiting lower-income homeowners. President George W. Bush's Tax Reform Panel in 2005 also proposed a 15% credit for mortgage interest paid on a primary residence, limited to 125% of median income. The mortgage interest credit proposed by the Tax Reform Panel in 2005 would be limited to 125% of the median home price in the taxpayer's region and appears to be nonrefundable. Data for the report came from various sources including the U.S. Census Bureau and the Internal Revenue Service for the year 2014. The 2014 Statistics of Income from the IRS and estimates of federal tax expenditures for 2014-2018 from the Joint Committee on Taxation provide data on individual tax filers and mortgage interest deduction tax expenditures. Economist Martin A. Sullivan's method considers income differences across states and calculates national average marginal tax rates for various income groups. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) adjusted income classes to match IRS data, calculated average marginal tax rates for each income class, and estimated each state's share of the mortgage interest deduction tax expenditure. The estimated tax rates are reported in Table B-2."
