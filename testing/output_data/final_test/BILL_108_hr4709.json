The Act titled \"Military Sexual Assault Crimes Revision Act of 2004\" addresses sexual abuse in the military, amending Section 920 of title 10, United States Code to define various forms of sexual abuse. Any person who substantially impairs another person's ability to appraise or control conduct with drugs or intoxicants and engages in a sexual act is guilty of aggravated sexual abuse. Additionally, engaging in a sexual act with a child under twelve years old is considered aggravated sexual abuse of a child. Any person who causes another person to engage in a sexual act through threats or fear, or engages in a sexual act with someone incapable of consent, is guilty of sexual abuse. This includes engaging in a sexual act with a person between the ages of twelve and sixteen. Any person who engages in a sexual act with a minor under the age of sixteen, regardless of their knowledge of the minor's age, is guilty of sexual abuse of a minor. It is an affirmative defense if the accused reasonably believed the minor was sixteen or older. Additionally, engaging in a sexual act with someone in official detention or under one's authority is also considered sexual abuse. Any person who engages in a sexual act with a prisoner under their authority, excluding their spouse, is guilty of sexual abuse of a prisoner and will be punished accordingly. The term 'sexual act' includes various forms of sexual contact and penetration with the intent to abuse, humiliate, or gratify sexual desire. The text discusses amendments to laws regarding sexual abuse, specifically focusing on acts involving minors and prisoners. Amendments include changing terminology from \"rape\" to \"aggravated sexual abuse\" and \"sexual abuse of a child.\" The amendments aim to address and punish acts intended to abuse, humiliate, or gratify sexual desire. The amendments made by this section regarding sexual abuse offenses will take effect 6 months after the enactment of the Act. Interim maximum punishments are specified for different types of sexual abuse, including dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of pay, and life imprisonment without parole. For sexual abuse offenses, the maximum punishment includes dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of pay, and up to twenty years of confinement. For sexual abuse of a prisoner, the punishment includes bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of pay, and up to one year of confinement. Prosecution under this section does not prevent prosecution for other offenses."
