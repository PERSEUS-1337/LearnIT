    "content": "The United States and Liberia have maintained diplomatic relations for over 150 years, with close ties enduring through the 20th century. Despite strains during Liberia's civil wars, the U.S. provided humanitarian assistance and helped mediate peace. Relations improved under former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and remain close under current President George Weah. Congress has shown ongoing interest in Liberia, appropriating over $2.4 billion since the end of the second civil war. Since the end of the second civil war, Congress has appropriated over $2.4 billion in State Department- and USAID-administered assistance to support Liberia's stabilization, recovery, and development. This aid focuses on promoting good governance, strengthening the rule of law, reforming the security sector, improving service delivery, and spurring inclusive economic development. Additionally, Congress provided roughly $600 million in assistance to combat the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in Liberia. Members of Congress have also sought to adjust the immigration status of over 80,000 Liberian nationals residing in the United States. The United States and Liberia established diplomatic relations in 1864, nearly two decades after Liberia declared independence from the American Colonization Society. A small elite dominated by \"Americo-Liberians\" held power until a 1980 military coup. Charles Taylor launched a rebellion in 1989, leading to factional violence and mass displacement of Liberians. Hundreds of thousands died and \"virtually all\" Liberians fled their homes during Liberia's first civil war. After a series of ceasefires, the war ended in a peace accord and general elections in 1997, which Taylor won. A second nationwide conflict erupted in 1999, leading to Taylor's resignation in 2003 due to rebel assault on Monrovia and international pressure. A peace agreement was reached, establishing a transitional government and a UN peacekeeping mission in Liberia. In 2003, Charles Taylor was arrested in Nigeria for supporting rebels in Sierra Leone's civil war. He was convicted of war crimes in 2012 and is serving a 50-year sentence in the UK. Calls for a war crimes court in Liberia have been growing due to the lack of accountability for atrocities committed during the country's wars. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Harvard-educated former Finance Minister and U.N. official, won election in 2006, ending a three-year transitional government led by Taylor's vice president. Sirleaf oversaw a postwar transition marked by political stability and economic growth, drawing significant international aid for infrastructure rehabilitation and development efforts. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf oversaw economic growth, secured debt relief, and received significant assistance from the United States for various programs. Her administration rehabilitated Liberia's global standing by lifting sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council. In 2016, UNMIL transferred national security duties to Liberian authorities in anticipation of full withdrawal in 2018. Despite economic growth, Sirleaf's administration faced challenges meeting postwar expectations, with widespread poverty and failure to implement key TRC recommendations. Corruption scandals and criticism for appointing her sons to state posts marred her tenure. Her response to the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak was criticized for financial irregularities and a heavy-handed approach by security forces. The October 2017 presidential and legislative polls in Liberia saw George Weah's Coalition for Democratic Change win with 62% of the votes. Weah, a former soccer star, defeated incumbent Vice President Joseph Boakai in a runoff election. Despite some violence and legal challenges, Weah emerged as the new president, succeeding Ellen Johnson Sirleaf due to constitutional term limits. After some violence and legal challenges, George Weah's party won a slim plurality in the House of Representatives elections in Liberia in 2017. The U.S., EU, and other donors provided substantial support for the elections, including technical assistance and voter education initiatives. President Weah was praised for the historic achievement of the election. President Weah, a former soccer star, faced criticism for his lack of formal education but later earned degrees in the US. He won a Senate seat in 2014 and became president in 2018. His choice of running mate hinted at the influence of Charles Taylor in Liberian politics. Since his inauguration, President Weah has faced criticism for corruption scandals, including failing to disclose assets and awarding contracts to associates. He also faced backlash for attempting to nominate a political ally with bribery allegations to a board position. President Weah has been embroiled in corruption scandals, including the reported disappearance of 15.5 billion Liberian dollars. An inquiry found discrepancies in the procurement and delivery processes, raising concerns about potential misappropriation and money laundering during the government's infusion of $25 million USD to control inflation. The Liberian government is implementing a new monetary system to replace the Liberian dollar in order to control inflation. Former central bank officials, including former President Sirleaf's son, have been charged in a corruption scandal. A USAID program led by Kroll Associates aims to improve the Central Bank's currency management. Concerns have been raised about the Weah administration's handling of donor assistance, with reports of aid funds being used for unintended purposes. The U.S. ambassador and foreign counterparts have expressed discontent with the administration's actions. In late 2019, the World Bank demanded the Liberian government refund ineligible expenses identified during a project review. The State Department's fiscal transparency report highlighted issues with foreign assistance receipts not being adequately captured in the budget in 2018. Large-scale anti-government protests in Monrovia in June 2019 called for an audit of all state ministries. In response to large-scale anti-government protests in Monrovia, politicians and activists called for an audit of state ministries and demanded President Weah to disclose his assets. The government faced criticism for blocking social media during the protests. Security forces dispersed COP-led demonstrations with tear gas, leading to calls for an inquiry into alleged excessive force. The US, EU, and ECOWAS ambassadors praised security forces' handling of the protests but criticized the government for dispersing peaceful protesters without warning. Human rights groups condemned the crackdown on COP leader Henry Costa. The Liberian economy experienced significant growth following the end of the second conflict, with FDI increasing under President Sirleaf. However, the 2014 Ebola outbreak and global commodity price slump led to a contraction in 2016. The IMF projects a contraction in 2019 due to slowing demand, with a recovery expected in 2020. The Liberian dollar has weakened, leading to rising inflation. The weakening Liberian dollar and high inflation have reduced local purchasing power and living standards. The World Bank predicts an increase in household poverty from 42% in 2018 to 44% by 2021, with rural poverty at 72%. The IMF forecasts modest growth of 3.0% annually from 2020 to 2023, insufficient to improve living standards for a population growing at 2.6% per year. Infrastructure gaps, low electricity access, poor service delivery, corruption, and an uncompetitive business climate hinder growth prospects. Liberia ranks fifth lowest globally in the World Bank's 2018 Human Capital Index. The government faces challenges in securing donor assistance for its Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development, focusing on infrastructure and social service improvements. Key sectors like rubber, gold, iron ore, diamonds, and palm oil drive state revenues but provide minimal local employment. Major firms like ArcelorMittal and Firestone have downsized due to low commodity prices. Most Liberians are in subsistence agriculture, hindered by infrastructure gaps and limited support. Liberia faces challenges in agriculture with high rates of food insecurity and malnutrition. Despite ample rainfall and fertile land, the country depends on imports for staple foods. A 2018 analysis found that 18% of Liberians face moderate to severe food insecurity, and 36% of children under five are \"stunted.\" Low global oil prices and a poor business climate have reduced interest in Liberia's agricultural sector. Low global oil prices and a poor business climate have dimmed interest in Liberia's oil and gas sector. U.S. oil firms like Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Anadarko Petroleum have given up licenses to offshore blocks due to unsuccessful exploration activities. Foreign investors cite corruption as a major obstacle to engagement in Liberia, with graft prevalent in various government systems. Human rights challenges in 2018 included extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detention, harsh prison conditions, discrimination, and violence against women and marginalized communities. President Weah's government in Liberia has been criticized for targeting opposition media figures, shutting down critical news outlets, and allowing harassment and violence against reporters. Sexual and gender-based violence remains a serious issue, with limited access to justice due to a corrupt and ineffective judicial system. Despite efforts to address these issues, rape continues to be a pervasive problem in the country. President Weah's government in Liberia has faced criticism for targeting opposition media, shutting down critical news outlets, and allowing harassment of reporters. The Domestic Violence Act criminalizes intimate partner violence, including spousal rape, but does not address female genital mutilation/cutting. Same-sex relations are illegal, and LGBTQ+ individuals face violence and discrimination. Interethnic tensions over land access have led to social and political conflicts. Since 2017, Liberia has faced political tension and discrimination towards its Muslim community and Mandingo ethnic group. The country is on the Tier 2 Watch List for human trafficking, with a risk of downgrading to Tier 3. President Weah's government has been criticized for targeting opposition media and allowing harassment of reporters. LGBTQ+ individuals face violence and discrimination, and interethnic tensions over land access have led to conflicts. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Liberia recommended the establishment of a war crimes tribunal, but it has not been implemented due to opposition from former combatants and elected officials. Some current legislators were recommended for prosecution, including Senator Prince Johnson, who holds influence at the national level. Senator Prince Johnson, a former armed faction leader in Liberia's legislature, played a crucial role in President Weah's 2017 political coalition. Former President Sirleaf, identified by the TRC for supporting Charles Taylor, opposes a war crimes court. Some Liberians fear revisiting wartime atrocities. President Weah initially supported a war crimes court but later withdrew his endorsement. Some perpetrators of wartime atrocities have faced justice abroad, including in the United States. Charles Taylor's son, Roy M. Belfast Jr., was sentenced to 97 years in prison for wartime acts of torture. Others have faced immigration-related charges for nondisclosure of involvement in wartime abuses in applications for U.S. asylum, residency, or citizenship. Several Liberian nationals have been convicted on such offenses. Several Liberian nationals have been convicted of offenses related to wartime abuses, leading to lengthy prison sentences, deportation, and loss of citizenship or residency permission. George Boley, a former armed faction leader, was deported from the United States in 2012 for his involvement in the use of child soldiers, marking the first deportation under the Child Soldiers Accountability Act. The United States has played a significant role in Liberia's history, with close bilateral ties and substantial U.S. assistance. U.S. engagement in Liberia increased during President Sirleaf's administration, with over $2.1 billion appropriated by Congress between FY2006 and FY2018. Between FY2006 and FY2018, Congress allocated over $2.1 billion in aid to Liberia for various programs. The Trump Administration has shown support for strong U.S.-Liberia ties, with recent focus on youth engagement, trafficking, economic growth, and health and education systems. Congress has allocated significant bilateral foreign assistance for Liberia, focusing on development and governance prospects. The House Democracy Partnership program has worked with the Liberian legislature since 2006 to enhance parliamentary capacity. In October 2019, five Members of Congress visited Liberia to meet with legislators and President Weah. Liberian immigration to the United States has also been a key aspect of bilateral relations, with approximately 85,000 foreign-born Liberians living in the U.S. as of 2018. In 2018, Liberians in the United States were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) due to conflicts and the Ebola outbreak in Liberia. Efforts to extend their immigration status have bipartisan congressional support. President Trump extended the wind-down period for certain Liberians until March 30, 2020, to allow Congress to consider legislation providing relief for Liberian DED beneficiaries. Congress granted relief to Liberian DED beneficiaries in the National Defense Authorization Act for 2020, adjusting the status of eligible applicants to lawful permanent resident status. U.S. aid to Liberia focuses on health system strengthening, public service delivery, civil society capacity building, agriculture sector development, and justice sector improvements. The United States has a direct government-to-government financing agreement with Liberia's Ministry of Health to support health service delivery. The State Department funds programs to train the Armed Forces of Liberia and civilian law enforcement. DOD conducts trainings for AFL personnel and supports Liberia's defense ministry. Liberia also benefits from a State Partnership Program with the Michigan National Guard and hosts Peace Corps Volunteers working on education and health projects. In December 2019, the U.S. Embassy withdrew PCVs from some regions due to liquidity challenges. FY2020 aid allocations for Liberia are pending, with a requested amount of $32.6 million. The Trump Administration requested a 66% decrease in aid for Liberia in FY2021, but Congress has consistently appropriated more than the proposed budget. Liberia is implementing a $256.7 million MCC Compact focusing on improving electricity access and road infrastructure. The energy project includes a new hydropower turbine and training for personnel, while the roads project aims to enhance road maintenance capacity. Liberia previously received a $15 million MCC grant. Liberian authorities are planning road maintenance following a failed MCC Scorecard in FY2019 and FY2020. State finances are strained due to weak economic growth, poor tax administration, declining donor aid, and the departure of UNMIL. Pressures on Weah's administration are increasing as popular expectations for postwar dividends grow. The IMF has approved a $213.6 million program to support macroeconomic adjustments in Liberia. Austerity measures, including cuts to the public sector wage bill, have been welcomed. However, these policies may be unpopular domestically, and the government's commitment to politically challenging reforms remains uncertain. Corruption and governance issues continue to pose challenges in Liberia. Corruption remains prevalent in Liberia's government, with a \"culture of impunity\" in the civil service. Efforts to combat corruption may face resistance from officials benefiting from the current system. President Weah's push for postwar transitional justice measures has faced opposition, leading to political tensions in the country. The U.S. Embassy has condemned divisive rhetoric that could threaten Liberia's peace and security. The U.S. Embassy warns Liberia's opposition against using charged rhetoric that could jeopardize peace and security. Mounting socioeconomic pressures and calls for governance reform are key challenges for Liberia's democracy. U.S.-Liberia ties remain close, with the United States poised to support development, despite potentially lower aid allocations. The United States continues to exert influence in Liberia, with the Weah administration receptive to U.S. engagement. The Weah administration in Liberia faces challenges such as mismanagement of donor assistance, corruption, political tensions, institutional weaknesses, and inaction on transitional justice measures. Members of Congress debate on the effectiveness of tools like diplomacy, foreign assistance, and punitive measures in advancing U.S. interests in Liberia."
