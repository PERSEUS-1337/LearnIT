A new method called collaborative generated hashing (CGH) is introduced to improve efficiency by representing users and items as binary codes. CGH uses the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to learn hash functions and can handle various recommendation settings, including cold-start users, cold-start items, and warm-start ones. Additionally, CGH employs a generative step to mine potential users and reconstruct effective users. The MDL principle is utilized in collaborative generated hashing (CGH) to learn compact binary codes for effective user recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of CGH over traditional recommender systems in various settings, particularly in marketing applications. Recommendations play a crucial role in helping users discover desired items and generating revenue opportunities for e-commerce platforms like Amazon and eBay. Cold-start issues in e-commerce vendors are caused by a lack of interactive data for accurate recommendations. Previous studies have addressed this by using hybrid recommender systems like Collaborative Deep Learning (CDL), Visual Bayesian Personalized Ranking (VBPR), Collaborative Topic modeling for Recommendation (CTR), DropoutNet, and ABCPRec. These systems incorporate side information to learn real latent factors, improving recommendation accuracy. In response to the limitations of real latent space models for hybrid recommender systems, scholars have explored binary code learning techniques like two-stage hashing and Iterative Quantization. Learning-based hashing frameworks have been proposed to reduce information loss, but the requirement for binary outputs makes training expensive for large-scale recommendation. To address this, a generative approach called collaborative generated hashing (CGH) has been proposed to learn hash functions for users and items. CGH is a generative approach to learn hash functions for users and items from content data using the principle of Minimum Description Length. It helps in discovering potential customers in e-commerce by generating new potential users and recommending products to them. This strategy can attract users who might be interested but didn't plan to buy, leading to the development of effective e-commerce strategies. The paper introduces Collaborative Generated Hashing (CGH) as a technique to learn compact and informative hash codes for marketing analysis and recommendation accuracy. It compares CGH with competing baselines, presents the generative and inference steps, and demonstrates the process of mining potential users for marketing applications. Experimental results are discussed in various settings, and the paper concludes with the main contributions of proposing CGH with the principle of MDL. The paper introduces Collaborative Generated Hashing (CGH) with the principle of MDL to learn compact and informative hash codes for marketing analysis and recommendation. It provides a marketing strategy by discovering potential users through the generative step of CGH, which can boost e-commerce development. The effectiveness of CGH is evaluated compared to state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating robustness and convergence properties on public datasets. The framework of CGH includes observed user and item content matrices, binary codes for users and items, and generative and inference steps for recommendation. The proposed Collaborative Generated Hashing (CGH) learns binary codes for online recommendation using the principle of MDL. Compared to CDL, CGH focuses on hashing and optimizing an objective with MDL. It also outperforms DropoutNet by discovering potential users for marketing strategies. The process involves formulating the generative step, conducting inference, and optimizing the training objective. In this paper, a new strategy for item recommendation is proposed - mining potential users. The process involves generating binary codes for items and users, maximizing similarity functions, and identifying potential users through a generative step. The strategy proposed in this paper involves generating binary codes for items and users, maximizing similarity functions, and identifying potential users through a generative step using nearest neighborhood algorithms like KNN. This approach can help discover potential users for both warm-start and cold-start items, serving as another form of item recommendation. The generation of user-item ratings is modeled using a Gaussian distribution based on binary codes for users and items. The prior probabilities for the binary codes are modeled as multivariate Bernoulli distributions. Ratings are determined by the similarity between binary codes, similar to matrix factorization techniques. The joint probability of observed ratings, content vectors, and binary codes is determined by the generative model. The inference process, influenced by generative hashing and DropoutNet, involves binary latent variables depending on content vectors and ratings. The inference process in generative hashing and DropoutNet involves using a multivariate Bernoulli distribution to model binary variables. Linear parametrization and matrix factorization are used to obtain hash codes for users and items. Constraints are added to improve the quality of the hash codes, including balanced and uncorrelated constraints to maximize entropy and ensure independence of binary bits. The training objective of Compact Generative Hashing (CGH) involves maximizing the posterior probability to reconstruct users, items, and ratings with minimal information using binary codes. Constraints on parameters T u and T v are imposed to obtain compact and informative hash codes during the inference process. The objective of Collaborative Generative Hashing (CGH) is to minimize the reconstruction error and obtain compact and informative hash codes by imposing balance and independent constraints. The training involves maximizing a constrained objective function to address the difficulty of optimizing a discrete optimization problem. In the inference step, the tanh function is used to replace the sign function. In Collaborative Generative Hashing (CGH), the tanh function replaces the sign function in the inference step to generate continuous outputs as hash codes. Training involves optimizing objectives based on recommendation settings like warm-start, cold-start item, and cold-start user. The aim is to minimize rating loss and content reconstruction errors with regularizers. The Collaborative Generative Hashing (CGH) function optimizes objectives for warm-start, cold-start item, and cold-start user recommendation settings by setting user content weight to 0 and learning parameters with observed ratings and item content. Validation is done on CiteUlike 1 and RecSys 2017 Challenge datasets for marketing analysis and recommendation performance. The experimental settings and results analysis for cold-start user recommendation are discussed using the CiteUlike dataset and the RecSys 2017 Challenge dataset. The CiteUlike dataset includes user-article interaction pairs and article abstract content, while the RecSys 2017 Challenge dataset contains user-item interactions and content data from a career-oriented social network. The datasets are used to evaluate the accuracy of recommendation in different settings. The study evaluates methods on binary rating data from a career-oriented social network similar to LinkedIn. The data includes user and item content dimensions, split into warm start, cold-start user, and cold-start item ratings. The goal is to recommend top-k items users may be interested in, with accuracy@k as a metric. The experimental results are reported as average values after 5 independent random selections. The study evaluates ranking-based recommender systems using the Accuracy@k metric. A new evaluation metric is proposed for marketing applications, similar to Accuracy@k. It involves identifying potential users for an item and checking if interested users are in the list. The study evaluates ranking-based recommender systems using the Accuracy@k metric for marketing applications. It involves identifying potential users for items and checking if interested users are in the list, with a focus on warm-start and cold-start items. The marketing analysis for warm start and cold-start items shows that accuracy increases with the number of potential users. The proposed CGH is effective for cold-start items, suggesting new e-commerce strategies can be developed. Warm-start and cold-start recommendations have a smaller gap than traditional recommendations. Performance evaluation indicates accuracy grows steadily with the number of interested users in the target item. The experimental results in Fig. 3 show that the accuracy of the proposed CGH for marketing applications increases with the size of the test set, indicating its robustness in sparse and cold-start settings. Fig. 3 also demonstrates the convergence of CGH, validating its effectiveness in terms of reconstruction errors. Additionally, Fig. 4 compares the accuracy of warm-start recommendation on the CiteUlike dataset, showing that the proposed CGH has comparable performance with other hybrid recommender systems. CGH is a hashing-based recommendation system with binary vectors for online recommendation. Real-valued recommendations have more information than hash codes, leading to small gaps between the two approaches. CGH considers reconstruction error, giving it an advantage in marketing applications. The experiment compares the accuracy of hybrid recommender systems with CGH for cold-start item recommendation. The experiment compares the accuracy of hybrid recommender systems with CGH for cold-start item recommendation. CGH performs comparably to competing baselines and outperforms CTR in recommending cold-start items to users. The results are also consistent when evaluated using the MRR metric. Accuracy for cold-start user recommendation was tested on the dataset R u where each cold-start user had less than 5 positive ratings. Test items were selected based on at least one positive rating. CGH was compared with Dropout for cold-start user recommendation, showing similar performance. CGH also has advantages for marketing applications. In this paper, a collaborative generated hashing (CGH) framework is proposed to address cold-start and efficiency issues in recommendation. The framework uses Minimum Description Length and constraints to derive compact hash codes for accurate recommendation and marketing. A marketing strategy is also presented to discover potential users. Experimental results on public datasets show the effectiveness of CGH for warm-start and cold-start recommendation."
