It gained independence from Spain in 1825 but has a history of military coups. The country lost territory in the War of the Pacific with Chile and the Chaco War with Paraguay, impacting its access to the ocean and significant territory. Bolivia holds the second-largest natural gas reserves in Latin America and valuable mineral deposits. Bolivia, with a population of 10.5 million, is ethnically diverse with Quechua and Aymara as the predominant indigenous groups. Despite the National Revolution of 1952, indigenous peoples have historically faced under-representation in politics and higher levels of poverty and inequality. Indigenous-based political parties emerged in the 1980s to address these issues. Since the 1980s, indigenous political parties in Bolivia have advocated for indigenous rights, economic development, and land preservation in the legislature. Despite some progress, indigenous communities still protest for their interests. Bolivia has been a major coca leaf producer, legal for traditional use but leading to illegal cultivation in the past. U.S.-backed eradication policies caused social unrest, reducing cultivation levels by the early 2000s. Since 2006, Evo Morales and his MAS party have brought political stability and economic growth to Bolivia. Morales has increased state control over the economy by renegotiating contracts and expropriating companies, angering foreign investors. The MAS now holds majorities in both legislative chambers. President Morales has used revenue from expropriating companies to expand social programs, including cash transfers to vulnerable groups. Economic growth in Bolivia has averaged 4.5% per year under his administration. Women's participation in government has increased, but indigenous representation remains limited. The autonomy of subnational entities in Bolivia has increased under Morales, allowing for more direct political participation. However, challenges remain in implementing these provisions, particularly in protecting indigenous communities' rights. President Morales has at times used anti-democratic methods to consolidate power and suppress dissent, such as passing a draft constitution prioritizing indigenous rights in 2007. President Morales passed a draft constitution prioritizing indigenous rights and agrarian reform, sidelining opposition delegates and leaders through controversial corruption charges. Bolivia's criminal justice system faces corruption, inefficiency, and politicization hindering democratic development. Restrictions on press freedom and attacks on critical journalists have been reported. Opposition to Morales is divided between wealthy eastern provinces and those opposing his state-led, pro-indigenous policies. President Morales has faced opposition from conservative sectors, unions, and indigenous groups, but remains popular among the poor and indigenous in Bolivia. He received strong support in national referendums and elections, especially in the western highlands. Support for Morales is lower in the wealthier eastern lowlands. The coca leaf has been used for spiritual and medical purposes by indigenous communities in Bolivia. In 2013, the United Nations recognized Bolivia's coca cultivation for licit uses. President Morales implemented a \"coca yes, cocaine no\" policy allowing limited coca production for traditional uses. President Morales implemented a \"coca yes, cocaine no\" policy allowing limited coca production for traditional uses. The policy aims to rationalize coca cultivation in Chapare and other regions, increase interdiction of cocaine, and negotiate agreements with coca producers. Critics argue that the policy is based on false premises regarding coca demand and market viability. Bolivia's coca cultivation has decreased, with Peru and Colombia having higher cultivation rates. Despite this, Bolivia's international investor perception is poor due to issues like corruption and social unrest. Despite issues like corruption and social unrest, the World Bank has praised Bolivia's economy for its positive macroeconomic results driven by state-centered policies and commodity exports. The IMF has noted solid economic performance and active social policies leading to a nearly tripled income per capita and reduced poverty. However, Bolivia remains one of the poorest and most unequal countries in South America, ranking 108th in the U.N. Development Program's human development index with low life expectancies and high maternal and child mortality rates. Bolivia has low life expectancies and high maternal and child mortality rates, especially in indigenous and rural communities. Despite progress in access to clean water, there are still challenges in sanitation and health services. Evo Morales seeks to extend his time in office, going back on a pledge not to run for a third term. The Constitutional Court ruled that President Morales is exempt from the two-term limit established by the 2009 constitution. Polls show Morales leading with 46% of the vote, while his closest rivals have much lower support. Analysts doubt opposition candidates can defeat Morales in the upcoming elections. Bolivia is also set to hold legislative elections in October 2014. In October 2014, Bolivia is set to hold elections for 60 Senate seats and 130 Chamber of Deputies seats. The opposition may prevent the MAS party from winning a Senate majority. U.S. relations with Bolivia have historically focused on controlling coca production for cocaine. The U.S. has supported Bolivia's counternarcotics efforts with assistance and debt forgiveness. Bolivia has been seen as a success story in counternarcotics, with joint operations and effective development programs. The U.S. has historically focused on controlling coca production in Bolivia for cocaine. While Bolivia has been successful in counternarcotics efforts with joint operations and development programs, U.S.-Bolivian relations became tense after President Morales took office due to concerns about drug policies, ties with Venezuela and Cuba, and nationalization of the hydrocarbons industry. In 2008, U.S.-Bolivian relations deteriorated significantly, leading to the expulsion of ambassadors from both countries. President Morales accused the U.S. Ambassador of supporting opposition forces, resulting in tensions reaching their lowest point in modern times. President Bush designated Bolivia as failing to meet international narcotics agreements, leading to the suspension of trade preferences. In 2008, U.S.-Bolivian relations soured, leading to the expulsion of ambassadors. President Morales suspended DEA operations and accused agents of espionage. The Peace Corps also halted operations due to instability. Efforts to repair relations failed, but in 2011, a Framework Agreement was signed for the return of ambassadors. In 2013, the U.S. requested Bolivian approval for a new Ambassador, but after the nominee's name was leaked, President Morales lost interest in exchanging Ambassadors. This led to the end of most U.S. foreign aid to Bolivia, with President Morales asking USAID to leave the country, accusing them of funding opposition forces. The State Department closed its International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs office in Bolivia in December 2013 due to lack of cooperation. Tension also arose from the case of Jacob Ostreicher, a New York contractor imprisoned in Bolivia on suspicion of money laundering. Corruption in Bolivia's judicial system has been a human rights concern, with Congress pushing for Ostreicher's release. The United States criticized Bolivia for its handling of the Jacob Ostreicher case, leading to tensions between the two countries. Bolivia considered Ostreicher a fugitive, while the U.S. government denied Bolivia's extradition request for former President Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada. U.S. aid to Bolivia has been declining since FY2007, with Bolivia receiving $122.1 million in assistance in that year. Since FY2007, U.S. aid to Bolivia has been declining, with assistance falling from $122.1 million in that year to $5.2 million in FY2013 and zero in FY2014 after President Morales expelled U.S. Ambassador, DEA, and USAID. The FY2015 budget request does not include any funding for Bolivia, although other donors like the European Union support development assistance in the country. The EU supports development assistance and interdiction programs in Bolivia, including funding for a base in Yapacani and border control improvements. Despite Bolivia's efforts to eradicate coca, the U.S. identified it as a major drug-producing country that failed to meet counternarcotics agreements for the sixth consecutive year. Cocaine production in Bolivia decreased by 2% and 18% in 2012 compared to 2011. The U.S. determined Bolivia failed to meet counternarcotics agreements due to legal coca leaf chewing, coca diversion to illicit markets, and lack of drug trafficking convictions. Bolivia's rejection of the U.S. determination was based on its major exports of natural gas, precious metals, and tin to neighboring countries, not the U.S. In 2013, Bolivia imported heavy machinery, electronics, and vehicles from the United States. Bolivia previously received trade preferences under the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) to promote economic growth and discourage illicit drug dependence. However, ATPA benefits were suspended in 2008 due to lack of counternarcotics cooperation. This suspension had minimal impact on Bolivia's economy as ATPA exports accounted for a small percentage of GDP. Bolivia's textile exports have shifted to Venezuela, with economists predicting steady economic growth of around 4% from 2015-2018. The country's significant reserves should protect its economy from shocks, allowing President Morales and the MAS to maintain political dominance despite occasional protests. The upcoming presidential elections in October are unlikely to improve relations with the United States. Bolivia, a landlocked country in South America, has minimal U.S. cocaine supply and primarily trades with Brazil. Despite being part of ALBA, Bolivia does not aim to counterbalance the U.S. like Venezuela. President Morales may consider improving relations with the U.S., as indicated during a meeting with a U.S. Senate delegation. The conditions for enhancing relations remain uncertain."
