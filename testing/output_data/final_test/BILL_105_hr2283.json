    "content": "The Act titled \"Arches National Park Expansion Act of 1997\" expands Arches National Park in Utah. The Arches National Park Expansion Act of 1997 includes the addition of approximately 3,140 acres known as the 'Lost Spring Canyon Addition' to the park's boundary. Additionally, the Act amends Section 2 of Public Law 92-155 to include this new land in the park. The Secretary of the Interior will transfer jurisdiction over the Lost Spring Canyon Addition from the Bureau of Land Management to the National Park Service after the enactment of the Arches National Park Expansion Act of 1997. Grazing permits for lands within the addition issued before the Act will be protected. Before the enactment of the Arches National Park Expansion Act of 1997, the Secretary of the Interior will continue grazing leases, permits, or licenses for the lifetime of the permittee and their descendants born before that date. These permits will be permanently retired at the end of the specified period, during which the permittee or their descendant can renew them periodically. The sale of any grazing lease, permit, or license during this period requires the purchaser to retire it immediately upon acquisition. The Arches National Park Expansion Act of 1997 allows for the continuation of grazing leases, permits, or licenses until the end of the specified period, after which they must be permanently retired. Any acquisition of these permits requires immediate retirement by the purchaser. Lands within the Lost Spring Canyon Addition are withdrawn from mineral entry and leasing under the public land laws. The Lost Spring Canyon Addition in Arches National Park will not impact the operation of the natural gas pipeline by Northwest Pipeline Corporation. A parcel of State school trust lands is partially within the Lost Spring Canyon Addition. The parcel of State school trust lands within the Lost Spring Canyon Addition is proposed to be exchanged for Federal lands of equivalent value to allow for Federal management of all lands within the addition. \"SEC. 8. LAND EXCHANGE INVOLVING SCHOOL TRUST LANDS.\" The Arches National Park Expansion Act of 1997 allows the State of Utah to transfer school trust lands to the United States, with the Secretary of the Interior facilitating the exchange within 180 days. The exchange is subject to valid existing rights, and both parties will succeed each other's rights and obligations. The State of Utah can transfer school trust lands to the United States under the Arches National Park Expansion Act of 1997. The Secretary of the Interior will facilitate the exchange within 180 days, subject to valid existing rights. The State will convey section 16, township 23 south, range 22 east, while the Federal lands consist of approximately 639 acres identified as lots 1 through 12 in section 1, township 25 south, range 18 east. The Federal lands are of equivalent value to the State school trust lands. The State of Utah can transfer school trust lands to the United States under the Arches National Park Expansion Act of 1997. The State shall consult with the Utah State Office of the Bureau of Land Management before surface disturbing activities on acquired lands. The State must preserve existing land uses and resources while managing archaeological and cultural resources. The State of Utah can transfer school trust lands to the United States under the Arches National Park Expansion Act of 1997. Administrative actions for the land exchange must be completed within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Arches National Park Expansion Act of 1997 was passed by the House of Representatives on November 9, 1997. Attest: ROBIN H. CARLE, Clerk."
