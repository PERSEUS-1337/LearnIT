The Congress acknowledges that low-power television license holders have provided valuable broadcasting services to their communities despite severe license limitations. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 has created uncertainty for low-power television stations due to lack of specific provisions regarding the permanency of their licenses and their treatment during the transition to digital television, limiting their access to capital and ability to provide quality broadcasting. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 has caused uncertainty for low-power television stations by not providing specific provisions for the permanency of their licenses and their treatment during the transition to digital television, which limits their access to capital and ability to provide quality broadcasting. SEC. 3 addresses the preservation of low-power community television broadcasting. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 has caused uncertainty for low-power television stations by not providing specific provisions for the permanency of their licenses and their treatment during the transition to digital television. Section 336 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to establish a class A license for qualifying low-power television stations, subject to the same license terms and renewal standards as full-power television stations. The Commission will notify low-power television licensees of the terms within 30 days. A class A television station license will be awarded to qualifying low-power television stations within 30 days of an acceptable application, submitted within 90 days of receiving the notice. A qualifying station must have broadcast a minimum of 18 hours per day in the 90 days before the enactment of the Community Broadcasting Protection Act of 1997. The Commission will award class A television station licenses to qualifying low-power television stations within 30 days of an acceptable application. Qualifying stations must have broadcast a minimum of 18 hours per day and meet specific programming requirements. The Commission is not required to issue additional licenses for advanced television services to qualifying low-power television stations. The Commission is not obligated to issue more licenses for advanced television services to class A television station licensees. Licensees can choose to convert to advanced television services but are not required to do so until the Commission mandates the use of digital or advanced technologies by full-power television stations. No class A station licensee is required to cease operations or have their license terminated for implementing amendments to the table of allotments. The Community Broadcasting Protection Act of 1997 allows for additional licenses for advanced television services. The Commission can order cessation, rescission, or termination only after specific requirements are met, including revising the table of allotments to preserve each class A station unless it hinders assigning an additional license for advanced television services to a full-power station. The Commission must revise the table of allotments to preserve a class A station in the same community of license by assigning a different frequency. If unable to do so, they will seek to provide the licensee with a class A license in an adjacent community. If preservation is not possible, the Commission will take necessary actions. The Commission will award a licensee another station in a different community if unable to preserve their current station, with preference given to the licensee over other applicants."
