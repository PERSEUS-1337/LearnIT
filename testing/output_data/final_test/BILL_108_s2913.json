    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Community-Based Health Care Retraining Act\" and includes a Health Professions Training Demonstration Project. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 is amended to include a Health Professions Training Demonstration Project for communities experiencing job declines and health professional shortages. The curr_chunk discusses criteria for determining a shortage of personal health services in designated areas under the Public Health Service Act. It also defines the term 'covered worker' in relation to healthcare workforce shortages. The curr_chunk defines a 'covered worker' as an individual terminated or laid off from a manufacturing or service sector job, eligible for unemployment compensation, or demonstrating attachment to the workforce but not eligible for compensation due to insufficient earnings. The curr_chunk describes eligibility criteria for a 'covered worker' who has been terminated or laid off from a manufacturing or service sector job, including specific circumstances such as plant closures or layoffs. The curr_chunk defines a 'health care professional' as an individual involved in delivering health care services, dietary and nutrition services, and long-term care. The Secretary will establish a health professions training demonstration project that includes various healthcare professionals such as nurses, home health aides, physician assistants, and more. Grants will be provided for this project. The Secretary will make grants to eligible entities to train workers as healthcare professionals in covered communities. Grants will range from $100,000 to $500,000 and eligible entities must be partnerships under the direction of a local workforce investment board. To be eligible for a grant under this subsection, an entity must submit an application to the Secretary, proposing to use the funds to establish or expand a training program in healthcare. Eligible entities include community colleges, vocational schools, health clinics, long-term care facilities, and VA healthcare facilities. To be eligible for a grant, entities must propose a training program for healthcare professionals or paraprofessionals. The application must include information on the need for training, how funds will be used, activities to be carried out, and meeting requirements. The Secretary will select eligible entities based on their applications. Entities eligible for grants must meet criteria determined by the Secretary of Labor, with a focus on serving communities with the greatest need and potential benefit. Grant funds must be used for training and support services that align with the application submitted, including increasing capacity at educational institutions or training centers. The grant funds can be used by institutions or training centers to train individuals for health professions by expanding facilities, course offerings, hiring faculty, providing student loan repayment programs, establishing clinical education opportunities, purchasing equipment, and conducting recruitment. The grant funds can be used for expanding facilities, offering tuition assistance, distance education programs, transportation assistance, and child care for covered workers participating in training. Eligible entities must demonstrate increased capacity to expand facilities. The funding of $25,000,000 will be used to establish and carry out a demonstration project to increase facility capacity."
