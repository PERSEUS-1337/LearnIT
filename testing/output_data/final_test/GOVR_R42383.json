    "content": "The budget process can be altered in various ways, such as through adopting or amending rules in the House or Senate, creating concurrent resolutions, or changing statutes. Informal changes in practice can also impact the budget process. The House majority party leadership released specific protocols that may govern chamber practices. Congress voted on budget process reforms in 2011, including changes in rules affecting appropriations bills. The Budget Control Act of 2011 significantly altered the federal budget process by creating spending limits and a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established spending limits and a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to reduce the deficit. The Budget Act of 1974 outlines the annual adoption of a concurrent resolution on the budget to coordinate congressional decision-making on budgetary matters. The budget resolution sets enforceable spending and revenue levels for Congress. Points of order can be raised against legislation that violates these levels, but they can be waived by a majority vote. Budget process reform proposals aim to change the budget resolution. The House and Senate did not agree on a budget resolution for FY2011 or FY2012. The House Rules committee marked up H.R. 3575, the Legally Binding Budget Act of 2011, on January 23, 2012. This bill would change the budget resolution from a concurrent resolution to a joint resolution, giving the President a direct role in setting preferred budgetary levels. The enforcement of the budget resolution would not be altered by this new measure. The new measure, H.R. 3575, would make the budget resolution a joint resolution, involving the President in setting budget levels. Enforcement would still rely on points of order, not sequestration. If vetoed, the resolution's levels would still be enforceable in the House and Senate. The President may propose rescissions, but if Congress does not enact the proposed rescission within 45 calendar days of continuous session after the message is received, the President must make the funds available for obligation. Congress has the power to initiate rescission legislation that would cancel previously enacted budget authority. If the rescission request is sent pursuant to procedures outlined in the Impoundment Control Act, it may be considered under expedited procedures. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 granted the President the power to cancel certain provisions after signing a bill, but it was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. H.R. 3521, the Expedited Legislative Line-Item Veto and Rescissions Act of 2011, aimed to enhance Congress's ability to act on rescission requests. H.R. 3521, the Expedited Legislative Line-Item Veto and Rescissions Act of 2011, aims to enhance Congress's ability to act on rescission requests by allowing the President to submit special messages proposing rescissions within 10 days of a spending measure's enactment. The President can also submit a second rescission message related to the same measure, but without duplicating any rescissions from the first message. H.R. 3521 allows the President to propose rescissions within 10 days of a spending measure's enactment. It includes expedited procedures for consideration in Congress, limiting debate and prohibiting amendments. Rescissions must be dedicated to reducing the deficit or increasing the surplus, with budget allocations revised downward accordingly. The rescission bill would revise downward federal spending limits to reflect savings achieved from the rescissions. A baseline projects future spending and revenue levels based on current law, serving as a neutral benchmark for assessing policy options. It is not a forecast but reflects the Congressional Budget Office's best judgment on how factors will impact federal finances under existing policies. The baseline projects future spending and revenue levels based on current law, using economic and technical assumptions. Discretionary spending levels are determined annually, with assumptions of constant inflation-adjusted terms. Actual spending and revenue levels are not set by the baseline. The Baseline Reform Act of 2012 proposed changes to the calculation of the baseline by removing the inflation adjustment for discretionary spending. This would keep nominal dollars the same but decrease the purchasing power of discretionary spending due to inflation. The Baseline Reform Act of 2012 proposed changes to the baseline calculation by removing the inflation adjustment for discretionary spending, which would decrease purchasing power as inflation occurs. H.R. 3578 includes provisions for extending current revenue policy and requires CBO to submit a Long-Term Budget Outlook for the next 40 years. The Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2011, H.R. 3582, requires CBO to prepare a macroeconomic impact analysis for \"major\" measures over a 40-year period, in addition to existing estimates under the 1974 Budget Act. H.R. 3582 expands the requirement for a macroeconomic impact analysis to all major measures reported from any House or Senate committee. It also requires CBO to submit a supplemental projection assuming the extension of current revenue policy, regardless of its expiration. The Budget and Accounting Transparency Act, H.R. 3581, amends the Credit Reform Act and changes the budgetary treatment of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It requires CBO to submit a Long-Term Budget Outlook for the next 40 years and expands the requirement for a macroeconomic impact analysis on major measures. H.R. 3581 modifies the Federal Credit Reform Act by requiring expenses and income to be discounted by a rate that includes a \"fair value\" risk adjustment, representing the additional compensation that private lenders would require to take on the risks inherent in the transaction. H.R. 3581 proposes a fair value adjustment to make government loans and loan guarantees more comparable to private transactions. Critics argue that including market risk in the discount rate would make loans appear more costly than grants or tax expenditures. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) budget treatment may increase federal loan costs by $55 billion in 2012. H.R. 3581 proposes a fair value adjustment for government loans to align with private transactions, without affecting loan availability or interest rates. The bill includes language to prevent budget enforcement rule changes and adjusts spending caps accordingly. The proposed bill, H.R. 3581, would impact the scoring of bills related to loan and loan guarantee programs, affecting their treatment under PAYGO rules. Major programs affected include mortgage guarantee programs, student loan programs, credit programs for rural utilities, and loan guarantee programs. The bill maintains exemptions for certain entities from credit-reform accounting. H.R. 3581 would impact the scoring of loan and loan guarantee programs under PAYGO rules, including mortgage guarantee, student loan, and rural utilities credit programs. It would move Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on budget while in federal conservatorship, require studies from CBO and OMB, and mandate federal agencies to make budget justifications available online. CBO estimates $14 million in appropriations over five years for compliance."
