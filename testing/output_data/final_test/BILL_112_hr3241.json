The \"International Travelers Bill of Rights Act of 2011\" defines key terms such as Commission, covered website operator, international travel services, and overseas vacation destination. The term \"United States\" includes several States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. The section discusses providing information on health and safety risks for overseas vacation destinations. A covered website operator must inform consumers about health and safety risks at overseas vacation destinations, including State Department travel warnings and onsite medical services available. Overseas vacation destinations must have personnel trained in CPR, an automated external defibrillator, and lifeguards for water-based activities. If onsite health services are not available 24/7, the website operator must inform consumers. Covered website operators must display the hours and days of availability for health and safety services on their website. If they lack information about onsite services at an overseas vacation destination, they must request it. If these services are not available, operators must disclose this on their website. Covered website operators must display a disclaimer on their website if certain health and safety services are not available at an overseas vacation destination. The operators are not liable for inaccurate information provided by the destination as long as they published it without knowledge of its inaccuracy. The Federal Trade Commission will enforce the Act treating violations as unfair or deceptive acts. The Commission will have the same powers and duties as under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Regulations must be issued within a year. Additionally, the Department of State will maintain records of overseas deaths of U.S. citizens from nonnatural causes. The State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 is amended to include increased granularity of data collected on deaths, with details like location and frequency of publication updated to be monthly. Reports to Congress are required each time the information is updated."
