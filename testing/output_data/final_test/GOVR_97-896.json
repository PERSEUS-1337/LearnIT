    "content": "The United States entered into broad-gauged trade agreements in the 1990s, including NAFTA and the WTO Agreement, negotiated by the President and submitted to Congress under the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The Act provided the President with authority to negotiate tariff and nontariff trade barrier agreements until April 15, 1994, to complete the GATT Uruguay Round. These agreements had to be submitted to Congress with an implementing bill for enactment into law. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 allowed the President to negotiate trade agreements like NAFTA and the WTO Agreement, which had to be submitted to Congress with an implementing bill for enactment into law. The implementing bill contained provisions necessary to implement the trade agreements, making them congressional-executive agreements. This legislative approach to international trade policy evolved over the years, with Congress delegating tariff bargaining authority as early as 1890. The President's authority to negotiate trade agreements and modify tariffs evolved over the years, starting as early as 1890 when Congress delegated tariff bargaining authority. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 allowed the President to enter into reciprocal tariff agreements with foreign countries and proclaim tariffs without subsequent congressional approval. This authority was used to enter into numerous trade agreements and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The President's modification of tariffs under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was deemed valid under the Treaty Clause. Congressional-executive trade agreements were found to have a constitutional basis in the joint exercise of Congress's tariff and commerce authorities and the President's foreign affairs power. Congress enacted legislation to provide the President with negotiating credibility and ensure its constitutional responsibilities in implementing agreements addressing nontariff trade barriers. These agreements could require elaborate changes in federal law. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President authority to negotiate trade agreements, allowing tariff reductions through presidential proclamation but requiring Congressional approval for nontariff barrier agreements. Congressional involvement in implementing nontariff agreements could lead to potential challenges regarding legislative authority and constitutional requirements. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President authority to negotiate trade agreements, allowing tariff reductions through presidential proclamation but requiring Congressional approval for nontariff barrier agreements. Congress provided the President with a sound negotiating posture by considering trade agreement implementing legislation within a prescribed period of time and without amendment. The fast-track procedure in the 1974 act was first used for the GATT Tokyo Round Agreements, approved and implemented in 1979. Temporary statutory authority for bilateral free trade agreements was added in the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984. The Trade Act of 1984 added temporary statutory authority for bilateral free trade agreements, which was further provided for in the OTCA. Congress approved various FTAs with countries like Israel, Canada, and Jordan, as well as agreements like NAFTA and GATT Uruguay Round under these authorities. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 granted renewed trade negotiating authority to the President, allowing for expedited legislative consideration of implementing bills for trade agreements entered into before July 1, 2007. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 granted expedited legislative consideration for trade agreements entered into before July 1, 2007. Agreements with various countries were approved under this process, including the U.S. free trade agreements with Colombia, Korea, and Panama. Additionally, negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) were initiated in December 2009. The USTR is following procedures of the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act for the TPP negotiations. Efforts to reinstate TPA through legislation have gained attention, with the Obama Administration working with Congress on new TPA legislation. The USTR is using the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act for TPP negotiations. Efforts to enact new TPA legislation involve the United States and TPP negotiating parties. Congress may include TPP negotiations under TPA if enacted. The constitutionality of trade agreements as congressional-executive agreements has been questioned. The constitutionality of trade agreements as congressional-executive agreements has been questioned in a judicial challenge to NAFTA. In Made in the USA Foundation v. United States, a federal court held that the President had the authority to negotiate and conclude NAFTA based on executive authority and approval by Congress. The court found that the agreement was constitutionally sufficient under the Foreign Commerce Clause and the President's foreign relations power. The court preliminarily held that institutional plaintiffs had standing to sue for the agreement. On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit agreed on standing but deemed the issue of NAFTA as a treaty a nonjusticiable political question. The Supreme Court denied certiorari. The political question doctrine allows courts to decline ruling if the matter falls under the discretion of the legislative and executive branches. The Eleventh Circuit applied a tripartite inquiry suggested by Justice Lewis Powell in Goldwater v. Carter to determine justiciability. The court posed three questions: (i) Does the issue involve questions committed by the Constitution to another branch of government? (ii) Would resolving the question require expertise beyond the court's? (iii) Are there prudential reasons against judicial intervention? The court found that the Constitution assigns authority over foreign affairs to the political branches, limiting the court's role in overseeing actions of the President and Congress. The court emphasized the constitutional grants of power to the political branches in foreign affairs and commerce, recognizing their ability to make agreements that are not treaties. It stated that ruling on the merits would require expertise beyond its scope and would involve making policy judgments unsuited for the judicial branch. The court cited the need for uniformity in foreign affairs and commerce, warning that invalidating NAFTA could harm the nation's economy and international agreements made over the past half-century."
