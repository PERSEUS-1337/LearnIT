    "content": "The ACF basin has varying population densities, highest in metropolitan Atlanta and lowest in Florida. The fall line marks a boundary between ancient rocks and coastal plain, serving as a barrier to species movement and a line of settlements for hydropower and navigation. The Apalachicola and Chipola Rivers are designated as \"Outstanding Florida Waters,\" with Apalachicola Bay hosting a National Estuarine Research Reserve. Apalachicola Bay is a designated research site by NOAA and a Biosphere Reserve. The upper basin habitat has been significantly altered, while the lower basin remains less affected. Dams along the rivers have closed off habitat, causing loss for species that move between river habitats and the Gulf. The Corps proposed a revised plan in 2008 to store 50% of basin inflow instead of 30%. The Corps proposed storing 50% of basin inflow, eliminating a minimum flow of 6,500 cfs during wetter periods, and switching to a three-season operation regime to prevent lowering Apalachicola River minimum flows. The Revised Operating Plan could impact species in the area, prompting collaborative analysis by various organizations. The Corps proposed changes in water management to prevent lowering Apalachicola River minimum flows, which could impact species in the area. Various organizations are analyzing the relationship between freshwater inflow and benthic communities in Apalachicola Bay, as well as changes in fish and shellfish abundance due to variations in habitat features caused by freshwater runoff. Mobile species can move to avoid unsuitable habitat conditions, while sedentary species may experience detrimental effects. Species movement in response to changing habitat features is expected, with some becoming less abundant and others increasing in abundance. Apalachicola Bay is a crucial habitat for a majority of commercially and recreationally harvested species in the Gulf, serving as a nursery area for many commercial fish species. Changes in freshwater flow affecting salinity levels could impact the suitability of the habitat for forage and nursery use, potentially leading to declines in coastal fisheries and harm to biota. Apalachicola Bay is vital for commercial and recreational fisheries, with concerns about higher salinity levels impacting Gulf sturgeon access and oyster industry in the area. The town of Apalachicola sued to prevent further flow reductions, citing harm already done to the bay. Oysters are a significant part of the economy in Franklin County, with the bay historically contributing a large portion of Florida's oyster harvest. Oyster distribution in Apalachicola Bay is influenced by salinity and sea-floor geology, with beds forming in areas with 5 to 25 parts per thousand salinity. Decreased freshwater inflow from the Apalachicola River may increase salinity, affecting oysters depending on how quickly salinity rises and the extent of exposure to intolerable levels. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection has concerns about the impact of decreased freshwater inflow on oyster habitat in Apalachicola Bay. High salinity levels have led to the death of oyster beds, affecting the oyster industry. Other commercial species in the bay include shrimp, blue crabs, and striped mullet, with blue crabs migrating long distances to spawn and the bay serving as a nursery for various fish species. Apalachicola Bay is a vital ecosystem for various marine species, including juvenile penaeid shrimp, blue crabs, and a variety of fish like striped bass, grouper, and redfish. The bay also serves as a forage area for offshore fish such as gag grouper and gray snapper, with commercial fish landings valued at $33 million in 2006. Species that can be caught in the bay include spotted sea trout, flounder, cobia, and redfish, among others. Changes in the estuarine environment could impact the distribution of these species and their prey. The Apalachicola River is home to 131 species of freshwater and estuarine fish, with some species only found in the lower tidal reaches. Important sport species in the lower river include largemouth bass, striped bass, sunshine bass, white bass, and river bream. Speckled trout and redfish move into the lower river during winter, while young grouper and snapper inhabit wetlands before moving into marine waters. Striped bass and sunshine bass are annually stocked in the lower river by wildlife conservation agencies. The lower River is stocked annually with striped bass and sunshine bass. The management of the ACF basin during drought focuses on protecting four endangered species: Gulf sturgeon, fat threeridge mussel, Chipola slabshell mussel, and purple bankclimber mussel. Water quality factors are crucial for these species. Federal agencies consult with FWS under the ESA when their actions may impact listed species. The Corps conducted formal consultations on ACF management in 2006 and 2007, resulting in Biological Opinions and Incidental Take Statements. In 2006 and 2007, the Corps consulted with FWS on the Interim Operating Procedure of the Jim Woodruff Dam. FWS issued a Biological Opinion with measures to reduce incidental take of listed species, including developing trigger points and water management measures for drought conditions. The Corps submitted a revised Biological Assessment in 2007, and FWS approved the BiOp and incidental take statement. The Corps consulted with FWS on the Interim Operating Procedure of the Jim Woodruff Dam in 2006 and 2007. FWS issued a BiOp with measures to reduce incidental take of listed species. The 2006 IOP included conditions to protect species, such as minimum flow of 5,000 cfs in drought conditions. The Corps proposed Exceptional Drought measures on November 1, 2007. The Corps proposed Exceptional Drought Operations (EDO) for the Jim Woodruff Dam on November 1, 2007, due to the ongoing drought. They requested formal consultation with FWS regarding the effects on listed species and submitted a new Biological Assessment (BA). The proposed changes included reducing flows from the dam to a minimum of 4,150 cfs, with a maximum fall rate of 0.25 ft/day until 4,200 cfs is achieved. Adverse impacts on listed species, especially mussels, were expected as flows dropped below 5,000 cfs. The rationale for the EDO was to reduce the demand for water. The Corps proposed Exceptional Drought Operations (EDO) for the Jim Woodruff Dam to reduce water demand and sustain flows for listed species during a severe multi-year drought. The proposal would result in reduced water flow this year to mitigate risks in later years if the drought persists. The Corps requested an expedited BiOp from FWS, with a goal of November 15, 2007 for a BiOp and associated Incidental Take Statement. Other agencies may provide additional information on species in question during formal consultation with FWS. The Corps BA provided data on the effects of its operations on water quality, including impairments like turbidity, coliforms, and dissolved oxygen. It is unclear if the implementation of the IOP has changed the baseline water quality in the action area due to drought conditions causing salinity changes and increased temperatures. The Corps BA noted changes in dissolved oxygen levels due to low flow conditions, with observations showing signs of stress in mussels. Reduced river flow below 5,000 cfs could worsen temperature and oxygen conditions, increasing the risk of harm to aquatic organisms. The FWS decision on jeopardy weighed immediate harm to species against future risks. FWS cannot require actions outside of agency's authorities to save listed species. RPAs in ACF basin did not include water conservation measures as Corps lacked authority. FWS had rare option to conclude no way to implement changes without harm to species or habitat. The Corps amended its Biological Assessment based on new data from FWS, proposing incremental reductions in flows to protect the fat threeridge mussel. Consultation with FWS on triggers and conditions for reductions was planned. The Corps amended its Biological Assessment with incremental reductions to protect listed species and their critical habitat. FWS concluded that the EDO would have measurable impacts on survival and recovery of certain mussels, but not appreciable effects on Gulf sturgeon. The FWS did not anticipate that reducing minimum releases to 4,500 cfs would appreciably diminish the critical habitat's capability to provide conservation for mussel species. Triggers for additional reductions would need to be provided. The Gulf sturgeon's distribution in rivers has changed, but it still spawns in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. In the ACF system, it once occupied 636 river miles. The Gulf sturgeon are anadromous, migrating upriver from the Gulf of Mexico in the springtime to spawn near the headwater of rivers with coarse substrates. Adults do not feed in rivers, using stored nutrients for spawning, and feed in estuaries or the Gulf of Mexico. They are a long-lived species, with females maturing at 8-12 years and males at 7-10 years, reaching lengths exceeding 6 feet. Major limiting factors include barriers to spawning habitats, habitat loss, poor water quality, and overfishing. The construction of dams in the ACF basin has gradually reduced spawning habitat for Gulf sturgeon. The Jim Woodruff Dam confined spawning habitat to 107 miles below it, which is a significant portion of the species' spawning habitat. Critical habitat was designated in 2003, encompassing rivers and estuaries along the Gulf coast. The effects of a reduction in water flow on the listed species are outlined in the BiOp. Sturgeon spawning habitat is highly dependent on the river's flow. The BiOp outlines the impact of the EDO on various species, including sturgeon and mussels. Sturgeon spawning habitat would decrease from 13 to 10-12 acres, deemed \"probably not significant\" but with limited data. The mussels require good water quality, stable stream channels, and flowing water, facing challenges from manmade structures like dams. The three mussel species are threatened by pollution and habitat fragmentation, leading to small isolated populations. They have limited movement abilities and are listed as endangered species. Low water levels increase mortality rates, while higher levels and cooler temperatures decrease them. The mussels may encounter problems when moving downslope within the river channel. The Fat Threeridge Mussel species historically inhabited the Apalachicola, Flint, and Chipola Rivers but is no longer found in the Flint River and has never been found in the Chattahoochee River. Their preferred habitats in rivers can be patchy, with high populations in favorable areas and low populations in intervening areas. They may become stranded in isolated pools as water levels fall, leading to fatal oxygen levels unless waters rise in time. The Fat Threeridge Mussel is no longer found in the Flint River and occurs only in the lowest portion of the Chipola River. Population densities in the Apalachicola River are highest between River Miles 40 and 50, with suitable habitat potentially decreasing due to the EDO. Mussels may move downslope to deeper unoccupied habitat, which is subject to higher water velocities and a coarser substrate. The purple bankclimber mussel, once widespread in the ACF basin, is now rare in the Flint River and nearly disappeared in the Chattahoochee and Chipola Rivers. It is primarily found at two sites in the Apalachicola River, with one site at River Mile 105 on a limestone shoal. The species could decline by as much as 30% between 2006 and 2008 according to FWS. The Chipola slabshell mussel was historically found in the Chipola River and its headwater streams, but has disappeared from one creek and Dead Lake. Six subpopulations remain in the Chipola River, with the EDO expected to affect only a small fraction of the population. The Chipola slabshell mussel's habitat in the lower portion of the Chipola River may be affected by lowered flows, but the higher parts of its range would not be impacted. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) limited its opinion to a few months due to a lack of long-term data, making it difficult to predict the effects of flow changes on the species. FWS also lacks information on other potential habitat changes, such as pollution levels, that could impact the mussel's tolerance to lower flows. The Fish and Wildlife Service limited its opinion on the Chipola slabshell mussel's habitat to a few months, due to a lack of long-term data. The Incidental Take Statement issued in 2007 included reductions in flow levels, with measures to determine triggers for incremental reductions. This makes long-term analyses difficult. The Mobile District Corps must ensure that measures are binding conditions in contracts or permits for the EDO. Mandatory terms and conditions, including reporting requirements and monitoring, are attached to the ITS. Failure to comply could invalidate the ITS. Discretionary recommendations include working with stakeholders to reduce water depletions in the ACF basin. The Corps recommended measures to reduce water depletions in the ACF basin, particularly in the Flint River, including incentives for agricultural demand reduction. The Revised Interim Operating Plan (RIOP) submitted to FWS incorporated elements of the EDO and proposed storing additional water during winter and drought periods to avoid lowering minimum flows in the Apalachicola River. The Corps proposed changes to the Apalachicola River minimum flows, including storing more water during wetter periods, adjusting fish spawn releases based on storage levels, and switching to a three-season operation regime. The RIOP also includes a new protocol for determining minimum discharge from Woodruff Dam, with water releases based on inflow levels. Additionally, the plan suspends maximum fall rate requirements during drought conditions. The FWS issued a BiOp in 2008 stating that the proposed changes to the Apalachicola River minimum flows under the RIOP would not harm the listed species with certain measures in place. The Corps would store water more often under the RIOP, leading to less water in the river about 9% of the time. The RIOP aims to maintain a minimum flow of 5,000 cfs, but the frequency of flows less than 10,000 cfs would increase by about 5%. FWS concluded that there would be \"no added harm\" to the species with the implementation of the RIOP. The FWS issued a BiOp in 2008 stating that the proposed changes to the Apalachicola River minimum flows under the RIOP would not harm the listed species with certain measures in place. The effects of the RIOP on each of the four species are discussed, with a focus on periods when flows below Woodruff Dam would be at or below 5,000 cfs. The RIOP may have a moderate beneficial effect on the Gulf sturgeon by decreasing the maximum number of consecutive days/year less than 16,000 cfs. The 2008 BiOp discusses the potential impact of water usage on sturgeon estuarine habitats and the fat threeridge mussel due to changes in flow levels. It mentions that if inflow falls below 5,000 cfs, releases downstream would be lowered to 4,500 cfs, potentially affecting 9% of the fat threeridge population. The 2008 BiOp discusses the potential impact of water usage on sturgeon estuarine habitats and the fat threeridge mussel. FWS concluded that the RIOP would have a measurable but not appreciable impact on the fat threeridge if flows fall to 4,500 cfs, expecting a take of about 200 animals. The purple bankclimber tends to occur more commonly in deeper water than the fat threeridge. FWS also reported discoveries of 12 new subpopulations of the Chipola slabshell in the Chipola River. FWS reported 12 new subpopulations of the Chipola slabshell in the Chipola River, indicating an improvement in the species' range. Changes in the Apalachicola mainstem and reduced river flow may result in a 2% take of the population, deemed not harmful to the species or its critical habitat. FWS provided measures for reducing fall rates during sturgeon spawning season and required the Corps to evaluate methods for estimating total surface water flow to Woodruff Dam by June 1, 2009. The evaluation aims to integrate water depletion estimates into monthly operational decisions for the basin, with recommendations from FWS to reduce depletions in the ACF. Changes in salinity in Apalachicola Bay affect species, with high flows from the river diluting saltwater and providing nursery habitat for marine species. The salinity levels in Apalachicola Bay are regulated by freshwater flow from the Apalachicola River, affecting the habitat available for aquatic organisms. The variability of salinity influences the tolerance of different species, with the Eastern oyster being of primary concern due to its economic value and sensitivity to salinity changes. Oysters thrive in intermediate salinities, making prolonged high salinity periods ecologically significant. Oysters in Apalachicola Bay thrive in intermediate salinities, with high salinity waters increasing susceptibility to parasites and predators. Factors like high salinity and low-velocity currents contribute to oyster mortality, while reduced river flow could have serious consequences for oyster populations. The benthic survey of Apalachicola Bay found that various species dominated the community, with uncertainties on how they would respond to changes in freshwater inflow. In 2008, conditions similar to an exceptional drought were observed, leading to oyster dieoffs from predators, disease, and low spat. The 2008 BiOp noted various environmental impacts in Apalachicola Bay, including oyster dieoffs, reduced aquatic vegetation, and changes in fish populations. The effects on sea turtles and manatees were deemed insignificant due to their low numbers and occasional presence in the area. The BiOp did not contradict court decisions related to the ACF programs. The Northern District of Alabama BiOp addressed Florida's attempt to enjoin the Corps' water release plan, citing a lack of causal link between Corps actions and harm to mussels. The 2008 BiOp's findings on environmental impacts in Apalachicola Bay did not contradict court decisions related to ACF programs. The disputed Lake Lanier storage contracts from a 2003 agreement have not affected operations yet. These contracts involve reallocating storage space for municipal and industrial water supply, potentially impacting stored volume and in-stream flows. The BiOp outlines an operational regime evaluating stored water volume and basin inflow for releases at Woodruff Dam. The flow amounts from Jim Woodruff Dam are crucial in this regard. The flow amounts from the Jim Woodruff Dam, crucial for the BiOp, are determined by basin inflow quantities rather than Lake Lanier reservoir capacity. Questions about species needs in ESA debates vary, depending on factors like critical life cycle stages, threats from human activities, invasive species, and diseases. In BiOps and species analysis, questions arise about invasive species, diseases weakening species, and species management goals. FWS biologists are cautious about specifying exact requirements for species survival. The recovery status of a species under the ESA is also a key consideration. The recovery status of a species under the ESA is a key consideration. The probability of a population surviving over a particular period is crucial for species management, but setting a standard of recovery is challenging. Ecologist Daniel Goodman highlighted the long-term consequences of this decision. The Upper and Lower Kingdoms of Egypt were united, and a global policy was imagined to manage the environment with a 15% probability of extinction for mammalian species within 100 years. Starting with 4,400 species, compounding the extinction probability over 5,000 years results in a low chance of survival for mammals today. The preferred vision for managing the environment aims for very low extinction probabilities over long time spans. In the context of the ACF, there is no guarantee of any listed species surviving. In the ACF context, determining the minimum flow necessary for species survival is challenging. Instead, the focus is on whether a plan provides sufficient flows to avoid jeopardy to the species. The risk of extinction for listed species over different time spans is considered, with the question of how much risk is acceptable. In the ACF case, FWS limited its opinion to a specific period of months, not years, and requested additional studies and data from the Corps to address risks from cutbacks in flows. The Endangered Species Act prohibits the taking of endangered or threatened species, including actions that harm them. Federal agencies must ensure their actions do not jeopardize listed species or critical habitat. Federal agencies must consult with FWS if their actions may harm a listed species or its critical habitat. If FWS advises the presence of a listed species, the agency must conduct a Biological Assessment to evaluate potential effects. Formal consultation between the agency and FWS is required based on information in the BA. Formal consultation between the agency and FWS is necessary if potential harm to a listed species or critical habitat is identified. The action agency must submit a formal request for consultation, providing scientific data on the action's effects. FWS evaluates the action and cumulative effects, issuing a Biological Opinion to determine if the action poses a threat. The agency must evaluate proposed actions to determine if they may harm listed species or critical habitat. FWS consults with the agency to identify reasonable alternatives to avoid harm. A reasonable and prudent alternative must be feasible and prevent harm to listed species or critical habitat. FWS may not specify alternative solutions that are outside the authority of the action agency, limiting consideration of more desirable options. The BiOp must include a detailed discussion of the effects on listed species or critical habitat and an opinion on whether the agency's action will harm them. The FWS BiOp assesses whether a proposed action will harm a listed species or critical habitat. If jeopardy is unlikely, an incidental take statement with reasonable and prudent measures is issued to minimize harm. The ITS may include mandatory terms and conditions for the action agency, such as reporting requirements and monitoring. If FWS issues a jeopardy opinion without offering RPAs, the action agency has two choices: abandon the action or seek an exemption under the terms of the ESA. Jeopardy opinions without RPAs are rare, and the exemption process may require the applicant to pay for mitigation. The burden of conserving the species may fall more heavily on certain places. The burden of conserving the species may fall more heavily on certain places where the species is still found. Only three exemption applications have been considered under the ESA, with one granted, one partially granted, and one rejected. Federal agencies in conflict can manage the situation in the ACF basin through additional consultation, exemptions in disaster areas, or exemptions for basin management. The ESA allows the President to grant exemptions in disaster areas for repair or replacement of public facilities to prevent natural disasters. However, this provision does not apply to the ACF basin due to factual differences. On October 20, 2007, the Governor of Georgia requested a presidential drought disaster declaration. The last presidential disaster declaration for a drought in the continental United States was in New Jersey in 1980. Federal resources for drought disasters have mainly been limited to agricultural assistance through disaster declarations by the Secretary of Agriculture. As of March 18, 2008, 48 counties in Georgia have been declared disaster areas, making them eligible for emergency disaster loans from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency. The Endangered Species Committee, also known as the \"God Squad,\" can grant exemptions for federal actions that may harm endangered species or their habitats. This committee, chaired by the Secretary of the Interior, has only been convened three times in history due to the rigorous process involved. The option of paying for mitigation to balance the effects of a proposed action has not been used in the past 15 years and is unlikely to be considered in the current debate. The Corps' plan to release less water is being evaluated for compliance with NEPA requirements, which do not mandate choosing the least harmful project. The U.S. Supreme Court has stated that NEPA prohibits uninformed agency action, not unwise decisions. Courts have upheld the NEPA process when agencies thoroughly assess environmental impacts. To comply with NEPA, agencies must demonstrate that environmental reviews informed decision-making. NEPA regulations by the CEQ emphasize the timing of environmental reviews, requiring them to be conducted before agency decisions are made. The NEPA process requires environmental reviews to be conducted before agency decisions are made, to ensure informed decision-making and prevent post hoc rationalization of decisions. Courts have emphasized the importance of conducting NEPA reviews before agency actions are decided upon. The NEPA process requires environmental reviews before agency decisions to prevent post hoc rationalization. Courts emphasize the importance of conducting reviews to inform decision-making. The Ninth Circuit highlighted the need for detailed environmental disclosure to aid in substantive decisions. Failure to consider environmental consequences before deciding on an action may result in a court finding that the agency did not take a thorough look at the effects. The contents of a NEPA document can also influence a court's assessment of whether the agency adequately considered environmental effects. The NEPA process requires environmental reviews before agency decisions to prevent post hoc rationalization. Courts emphasize the importance of conducting reviews to inform decision-making. The regulations provide a general description of the contents of Environmental Assessments (EAs), which are intended to be concise but also consider the need for the project, environmental impacts, alternatives, and agencies consulted. The NEPA process should synchronize with ESA consultation, as the Biological Assessment prepared by the action agency may be undertaken as part of the NEPA review to evaluate endangered or threatened species and significant adverse environmental effects. The NEPA process requires environmental reviews before agency decisions to prevent post hoc rationalization. Courts emphasize the importance of conducting reviews to inform decision-making. The regulations provide a general description of the contents of Environmental Assessments (EAs), which are intended to be concise but also consider the need for the project, environmental impacts, alternatives, and agencies consulted. The NEPA process should synchronize with ESA consultation, as the Biological Assessment prepared by the action agency may be undertaken as part of the NEPA review to evaluate endangered or threatened species and significant adverse environmental effects. There is no timing issue in gathering data for both NEPA review and \u00a7 7 consultation. The NEPA emergency provisions do not allow for unilateral waivers, and agencies must consult with the Council for alternative arrangements in emergency circumstances. The CEQ has the authority to waive its own regulations and interpret NEPA provisions for emergency circumstances. If the Corps requests a waiver from NEPA compliance and the CEQ agrees, alternative arrangements can be authorized. There are few examples of agencies invoking \u00a7 1506.11, with none similar to the current situation involving waiving NEPA for an industrial project. The CEQ has the authority to waive NEPA regulations for emergency situations. Examples include waiving NEPA for an industrial project, night-time use of an Air Force base during Desert Storm, and Navy sonar training. CEQ emphasized post-Hurricane Katrina that NEPA should still be followed. NEPA suits are brought under the APA, requiring plaintiffs to show standing and that agency actions were arbitrary or not in accordance with the law. Plaintiffs must demonstrate standing to sue under NEPA regulations, showing they were adversely affected by the agency action. Economic injury alone does not qualify, but reduced use of a river by a kayaker could suffice. Individuals and groups can sue if they can prove a unique injury separate from the community at large."
