    "content": "Most of the funding for HUD comes from annual appropriations by Congress to address housing problems for low-income households. Rental assistance programs like Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance are key, along with block grant programs like HOME and CDBG for community development. Other specialized grant programs help homeless populations. HUD's Federal Housing Administration insures mortgages for home buyers with low downpayments and developers of affordable rental buildings. Surplus funds from FHA have been used to offset HUD's budget costs, with additional emergency funding provided for disaster recovery and economic stimulus. Total enacted appropriations for HUD over the past five years are shown in Table 1. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2012 provided about $37.3 billion in net budget authority for HUD, which is about 9% less than FY2011. This decrease is partly due to increases in offsetting receipts and rescissions. Total funding for HUD's programs decreased by about 2% in FY2012 compared to FY2011. The House passed a continuing resolution to fund government agencies, including HUD, at their FY2012 levels with a 0.612% increase. Emergency funding provided in FY2012 was not extended, and the bill was signed into law on September 28, 2012. The 112th Congress adjourned without final FY2013 appropriations legislation, but a bill was approved on March 6, 2013, for full-year government-wide appropriations for FY2013. The government passed a continuing resolution in FY2013 to fund federal agencies, including HUD, at FY2012 levels with a 0.098% rescission. The bill maintained funding reductions from the sequester and included anomalies for HUD programs. The Senate later released a substitute amendment to fund agencies through the end of FY2013. The CR in FY2013 funded HUD at FY2012 levels with funding reductions from the sequester. The Senate amended and approved H.R. 933, increasing overall funding for HUD. The final version of H.R. 933 funded all HUD programs at FY2012 levels, except for specific rescissions not extended under the CR. Section 1805 provides $2.033 billion for Homeless Assistance Grants, an increase from FY2012. Section 1806 allocates $12 million for Indian Housing Loan Guarantees, double the amount from FY2012. Section 1807 allocates $18.939 billion for Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance, with a $25 million increase for administrative fees. Section 1809 provides $4.262 billion for Public Housing. Section 1809 allocates $4.262 billion for the Public Housing Operating Fund, with additional provisions for Home Equity Conversion Mortgages and the Housing Certificate Fund. HUD appropriations were subject to a 0.2% across-the-board rescission and further reduced by the sequestration order. After accounting for these reductions, HUD programs received $42.632 billion in new funding. In FY2013, HUD programs received $42.632 billion in new appropriations, $1.6 billion less than FY2012. The net new budget authority required was $31.425 billion, a decrease of $6 billion from FY2012. The draft FY2013 funding bill approved by the House Appropriations Committee included $33.6 billion for HUD, slightly more than requested by the President but less than the Senate version. The House and Senate versions of the FY2013 HUD appropriations bill had significant differences. The House bill included the President's request to reduce funding for the Section 8 project-based rental assistance program. The Senate version proposed a total net budget authority for HUD at just under $35 billion, a decrease of about 7% compared to FY2012. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget request for HUD was just under $34 billion, a decrease of about 7% from FY2012 but an increase of about 4% over the President's requested level. S. 2322 proposed to increase funding for the Section 8 project-based rental assistance program by more than $1 billion above the President's request. The requested level is nearly $4 billion less than the amount enacted for FY2012, largely due to an estimated increase in offsetting receipts from the Federal Housing Administration. The President's budget requested an increase of more than $500 million in new appropriations for HUD programs and activities, with the largest increases proposed for public housing and homeless programs. The FY2013 budget for HUD proposed funding increases for public housing and homeless assistance programs. The Federal Housing Administration insures mortgages for borrowers with low downpayments, making mortgage credit more accessible and affordable. FHA's single-family mortgage insurance programs are administered through the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. The Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF) includes FHA-insured single-family home loans and Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs). There are two risk categories within the MMIF: Purchase and Refinance, and HECM. The MMIF has historically been self-financing, covering claims with premiums. FHA receives an annual appropriation for administrative expenses, with a FY2013 budget request of $215 million, later reduced to $196 million due to sequestration and rescission. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) requires the cost of federal loan insurance to be recorded in the budget as the net present value of expected cash flows. The Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF) cash inflows come from insurance premiums, while outflows are payments for loan defaults. The subsidy rate, expressed as a percentage, reflects the net value of these cash flows. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 mandates that federal loan insurance costs be accounted for in the budget as the net present value of expected cash flows. The subsidy rate, a percentage reflecting the net value of cash flows, is applied to the expected loan volume to determine the credit subsidy needed for federal credit programs. Agencies must periodically update initial subsidy estimates to account for actual cash flow variations over the loan life. For FY2013, HUD estimated a negative credit subsidy rate of -5.38% for the MMIF Purchase and Refinance category, resulting in $8 billion in negative credit subsidy for $149 billion of insured loans. HUD estimated that mortgages insured under the MMIF in FY2013 would generate $8.2 billion in negative credit subsidy for the government. Additionally, the GI/SRI fund would generate $661 million in negative credit subsidy, resulting in a total of nearly $9 billion in negative credit subsidy generated by FHA. The Congressional Budget Office re-estimates these numbers annually, which may differ from the President's budget estimates. According to CBO, FHA's negative credit subsidy in FY2013 is over $10.4 billion, higher than the President's budget estimates. The MMIF has permanent budget authority to cover loan guarantee program costs, allowing it to draw from the U.S. Treasury if needed. The FY2013 budget showed that HUD anticipated needing $688 million from the U.S. Treasury for the MMIF to cover an increase in estimated losses on FHA-insured loans. However, HUD later stated that they no longer expected to draw on Treasury for these funds in FY2012. FHA has about $33 billion in reserves to pay claims before needing additional funds from Treasury. Increases in mortgage insurance premiums and funds from legal settlements allowed the MMIF to cover required transfers without drawing from Treasury in FY2012. However, FHA used $1.7 billion from Treasury in FY2013 for fund transfers between reserve accounts. Premium increases were planned for FHA insurance, including a 0.1% increase mandated by the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 and additional increases for loans over $625,500. The FHA implemented premium increases on loans over $625,500 to boost reserves and generate more credit subsidy. The TBRA account funds the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, providing assistance to 2 million families for housing subsidies. The TBRA account funds the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, providing assistance to families for housing subsidies. The account is funded using current-year appropriations and advance appropriations. The President's budget requested a 4% increase in funding for FY2013 to serve the same number of families as in 2012. Administrative reform language is expected to result in program savings. The President's budget proposed increasing administrative fees for local housing authorities administering the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program. The proposed funding level would increase the \"proration level\" to 81%. S. 2322 suggested providing over $300 million more for the TBRA account than the President's request, with the increase going towards voucher renewals. The House version of the FY2013 bill did not adopt all of the cost-saving legislative proposals requested by the President. The House version of the FY2013 bill (H.R. 5972, H.Rept. 112-541) included the President's requested funding level for voucher renewals, which is more than $200 million below the Senate bill. The final FY2013 year-long continuing resolution allocated $17.964 billion for the voucher program, 2% less than FY2012 post-rescission and 6% less than the President's request. The bill did not include all cost-saving legislative proposals requested by the President, but the committee supports such proposals and encourages consideration by authorizing committees and HUD for administrative and regulatory reforms. The project-based rental assistance (PBRA) account provides funding to administer and renew existing project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts between HUD and private multifamily property owners. HUD provides subsidies to make up the difference between what eligible low-income families pay (30% of their incomes) and the agreed-upon rent. No new contracts have been entered into since the early 1980s, and once contracts expire, new annual appropriations are needed for renewal. The project-based rental assistance account requires new annual appropriations for contract renewals as contracts expire. Some contracts lack sufficient funding to complete their terms, requiring additional funding. The account has become the second-largest in HUD's budget, with the President's budget requesting less funding than in FY2012. The budget acknowledges the funding shortfall and plans to fund contracts for partial terms instead of full 12-month renewals. The budget for the project-based rental assistance account in FY2013 included $1.2 billion more than requested by the President. The House Appropriations Committee adopted the President's request for the account. The final FY2013 continuing resolution allocated $8.851 billion for the account after sequestration reductions and rescissions. The Section 8 project-based rental assistance account in FY2013 received less funding compared to FY2012 (-5%) and fell short of the Senate's estimate for \"fully funding\" contract renewals (-10%). The public housing program, established in 1937, offers subsidized rental units for low-income families and is the oldest federal housing assistance program. Despite no new developments, funds are allocated to over 3,100 public housing authorities maintaining 1 million units. The public housing program, funded by HUD, maintains over 1 million units through operating and capital funds. The President's FY2013 budget requested a 13% increase in total funding, with a 14% increase in the operating fund and a 10% increase in the capital fund compared to FY2012. The President's FY2013 budget requested a 10% increase in the capital fund and a 14% increase in the operating fund compared to FY2012. The budget also proposed new administrative flexibilities for PHAs and a $50 million Jobs-Plus Pilot Initiative. The Senate bill, S. 2322, included slightly less total funding for public housing than requested by the President, with a difference of less than 1%. The funding was allocated differently, with more for the operating fund and less for the Capital Fund. The bill also included funding for the Jobs-Plus Initiative, but not as much as requested in the President's budget. S.Rept. 112-157 noted that some activities for the Jobs-Plus Initiative are eligible for ROSS funding. The House Appropriations Committee-passed version of the FY2013 HUD funding bill did not include funding for the Jobs-Plus initiative requested in the President's budget. P.L. 113-6 resulted in $5.831 billion being made available for public housing operating fund and capital fund programs, about 12% less than the amount requested. The FY2013 HUD funding bill allocated funding for public housing operating and capital funds, which was about 12% less than the amount requested by the President. Additionally, $150 million was allocated for the Choice Neighborhoods program, an increase from the previous year. Choice Neighborhoods provides grants to communities to redevelop distressed housing, replacing the HOPE VI program. The Senate appropriations committee proposed funding Choice Neighborhoods at $30 million below the requested level. S. 2322 proposed setting aside $80 million for PHA applicants. The House Appropriations Committee-passed version of the FY2013 HUD appropriations bill proposed no funding for Choice Neighborhoods. P.L. 113-6 resulted in $114 million being made available for Choice Neighborhoods, 5% less than the FY2012 funding level. The President's budget requested legislative changes to federal assisted housing programs, aiming for program savings in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program. The final FY2013 HUD funding law did not include these proposed changes. The Department proposed changes to federal housing programs to save money, including increasing minimum rents and adjusting eligibility thresholds. These changes were not included in the final FY2013 HUD funding law. The President's budget proposed changes to federal housing programs, including setting flat rents at no less than 80% of fair market rent. Revisions were suggested for allowable deductions for medical expenses, increasing the threshold to 10%. Inspection rules for the Section 8 Voucher program were also proposed to be reformed. The President's budget proposed changes to federal housing programs, including setting flat rents at no less than 80% of fair market rent and increasing the threshold for allowable deductions for medical expenses to 10%. Changes were suggested for inspection rules for the Section 8 Voucher program. S. 2322 included provisions for conducting biennial inspections and expanding the definition of a PHA to include consortia of PHAs. However, it did not include provisions for a rent policy demonstration or a new CORE flexibility program for supportive services. The Community Development Fund (CDF) funds various community development activities, including the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. CDBG provides financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development. Grants are allocated to entitlement communities, states, and insular areas for addressing housing and economic development needs. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2013 included $3.143 billion for activities funded under the CDF account, representing 9% of the total budget authority. The budget proposed a 4.5% increase in funding for CDF activities, including $100 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative. Additionally, funding for the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing program was proposed to be transferred to the CDF account. In FY2012, Congress appropriated an additional $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance to communities in eight states for disaster recovery activities. $100 million of the funds were designated for \"disaster relief,\" exempting it from the original spending caps. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposal for the CDBG program included $3.143 billion for activities funded under the CDF account. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposal for the CDBG program requested $2.948 billion for the CDBG formula component, with $2.059 billion for entitlement communities, $882 million for state-administered programs, and $7 million for insular areas. Additionally, $60 million was requested for Indian tribes, and $100 million for the SCI program activities. The SCI program includes Regional Integrated Planning Grants of $46 million for regional organizations in up to 25 metropolitan areas, Community Challenge Grants of $46 million for up to 50 individual communities, and Housing-Transportation Integration Research with $8 million for research initiatives by HUD, DOT, and EPA. Additionally, the CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows states and entitlement communities to collateralize their annual CDBG allocation to attract private capital. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows communities to borrow up to five times their annual allocation for economic development, housing, and infrastructure projects. The Administration proposed increasing the loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2013 and charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill recommended $3.210 billion for CDF activities. The Senate Committee bill, S. 2322, recommended $3.210 billion for CDF activities, including $3.100 billion for CDBG formula grants. It supported $60 million for Indian tribes and $50 million for SCI activities, with a requirement to allocate over $12 million for communities with populations under 500,000. The bill also called for converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program and increasing the loan guarantee commitment to $500 million for FY2013. The Senate Committee bill recommended $3.210 billion for CDF activities, including $3.100 billion for CDBG formula grants, $60 million for Indian tribes, and $50 million for SCI activities. The House bill recommended $3.404 billion for CDF activities, with $3.344 billion for CDBG formula grants. It also supported the Administration's $60 million funding request for Indian tribes. The bill, H.R. 5972, did not allocate CDBG funds for new SCI activities. Instead, it recommended $2 million for closeout and evaluation of previous SCI awards. An amendment was passed to prohibit funds for SCI awards despite the Administration's objection. The House bill supported CDBGs but objected to lack of funding for SCI activities. It recommended $6 million in loan subsidies for Section 108 loan guarantees and continued funding for Section 4 activities at $35 million. It did not support converting loan guarantees to a fee-based structure or transferring the program from its current account. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-2) provided $50.7 billion in supplemental funding for immediate relief efforts. This act did not convert the Section 108 loan guarantee to a fee-based program, instead continuing the program with $5.4 million in loan subsidies for $240 million in loan guarantees. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 provided $50.7 billion in supplemental funding for Hurricane Sandy losses and future disaster mitigation. $16 billion was allocated to HUD's Community Development Block Grant program with specific terms and conditions. The act also allowed HUD to adjust funding for Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers for public housing authorities affected by the storm. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established discretionary spending limits for FY2012-FY2021, allowing adjustments for various purposes. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set discretionary spending limits for various purposes, including disaster relief and emergency requirements. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction was tasked to develop a deficit reduction plan by January 15, 2012. Failure to enact legislation by that date led to automatic spending reductions through sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps starting on January 2, 2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 made changes to the BCA, delaying the sequester until March 1, 2013, and reducing the total amount to be sequestered for FY2013. President Obama ordered the BCA-mandated sequestration on March 1, 2013, which required a 7.8% reduction in non-exempt defense discretionary funding, a 5.0% reduction in non-exempt nondefense discretionary funding, a 5.1% reduction for most non-exempt nondefense mandatory funding, and a 7.9% reduction for non-exempt defense mandatory funding. HUD's budget, mostly non-exempt discretionary funding, faced a 5% reduction for FY2013. The sequester in 2013 mandated a 5% reduction in funding for HUD's programs and activities, resulting in a $3 billion cut. The reductions were implemented at the program, project, and activity level within each account, and calculated on an annualized basis throughout the fiscal year. The FY2013 Budget Resolution sets enforceable spending and revenue levels for Congress to consider legislation affecting spending and revenue. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees receive discretionary spending allocations to divide among their subcommittees for the 12 regular appropriations bills. The budget resolution for FY2013 sets total discretionary spending at $1,028 billion, lower than the specified $1,047 billion. This resolution provides parameters for funding decisions but does not determine individual account or program funding. The House Appropriations Committee announced 302(b) allocations on April 25, 2012, including $51.61 billion for THUD, a nearly 10% reduction from FY2012. The Senate in the 112 th Congress did not consider a budget resolution for FY2013. The BCA included a provision for enforceable budget levels if the House and Senate had not agreed to a budget resolution for FY2013 by April 15, 2012. Senator Kent Conrad submitted spending and revenue levels, including the 302(a) allocations to the Senate. The Senate Appropriations Committee released its 302(b) allocations, with $53.438 billion for the THUD subcommittee, 7% less than FY2012 but more than 3% above the House-approved level. The House and Senate budget resolutions for FY2013 differed by almost $20 billion in total and over $2 billion for THUD. ATRA (P.L. 112-240) in January 2013 reduced the FY2013 discretionary budget cap by $4 billion to match the FY2012 cap. In FY2013, savings from the law were used to reduce the BCA sequester."
