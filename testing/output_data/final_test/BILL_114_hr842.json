    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Huntington's Disease Parity Act of 2015\". Congress finds that Huntington's Disease is a progressive neurological condition causing physical and mental deterioration in around 30,000 individuals in the US, with 200,000 more at genetic risk. Symptoms include loss of movement control, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. No effective treatment exists to halt or slow the disease progression. Adult-onset Huntington's Disease typically presents symptoms between ages 30-50, while late-onset occurs after 50 with milder symptoms. Juvenile Huntington's Disease affects those under 19 and progresses rapidly. Symptoms include personality changes, irritability, anxiety, and depression, leading to inability to work. The Social Security Administration has not updated its rules for evaluating neurological disabilities since 1985, leading to outdated and inaccurate designations for Huntington's Disease. This impacts individuals relying on Social Security Disability Insurance and Medicare. Individuals with Huntington's Disease face a 24-month waiting period for Medicare benefits after qualifying for Social Security Disability Insurance, despite often becoming incapacitated before the age-eligibility requirement of 65. The Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services waived this waiting period for ALS patients in 2000 due to similarities in conditions. The outdated guidelines for Huntington's Disease highlight the urgent need for updated regulations. Individuals with Huntington's Disease need a revision of medical criteria for disability determination and removal of the 24-month Medicare waiting period, similar to ALS patients. Revision of medical and evaluation criteria for evaluating disability caused by adult-onset and juvenile Huntington's Disease. The Commissioner of Social Security will revise medical and evaluation criteria for Huntington's Disease under titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act in consultation with medical experts. This includes amending sections 11.00 and 12.00 of the Listing of Impairments to provide criteria for Huntington's Disease and remove references to \"Huntington's Chorea.\" The Commissioner of Social Security will amend the Listing of Impairments to include medical and evaluation criteria for Huntington's Disease in adults and children, including Juvenile Huntington's Disease. This will involve revising sections 11.00 and 12.00 of the Listing of Impairments. The Social Security Act is amended to waive the 24-month waiting period for Medicare coverage for individuals diagnosed with Huntington's Disease. This amendment applies to benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act for items and services provided after the enactment of this Act."
