    "content": "The \"Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 1999\" is the short title of this Act. It amends the Controlled Substances Act. Section 303(g) of the Controlled Substances Act is amended to waive requirements for dispensing narcotic drugs in schedule IV or V by practitioners meeting certain conditions. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to waive requirements for dispensing schedule IV or V narcotic drugs by practitioners meeting specific conditions, including submitting a notification to the Secretary before dispensing the drugs for maintenance or detoxification treatment. Under State law, practitioners with the ability to treat opiate-dependent patients must be able to refer them for counseling and ancillary services. The total number of patients a practitioner can treat at one time is limited to 20, unless the Secretary changes this number through regulation. The total number of patients a practitioner in a group practice can treat at one time is limited to 20, unless the Secretary changes this number through regulation. Different numerical limitations may be established based on the number of practitioners in the group practice. Conditions regarding narcotic drugs are specified for this purpose. The conditions for narcotic drugs in schedule IV or V for maintenance or detoxification treatment include approval under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, absence of adverse determination by the Secretary, and compliance with additional standards if required. Detoxification treatment standards for practitioners providing treatment or drug quantities for unsupervised use require specific conditions for a waiver to be in effect, including written notification with practitioner's name, registration identification, and group practice details. The practitioner must notify the Secretary and Attorney General about registrations issued for other practitioners in the practice. If conditions are met, the practitioner can dispense narcotic drugs in schedule IV or V. The Attorney General may consider a practitioner dispensing narcotic drugs in schedule IV or V for treatment as acting against public interest. The term 'group practice' is defined as per the Social Security Act. This provision is effective since the enactment of the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 1999, subject to exceptions. During the 3-year period after the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 1999, the Secretary and Attorney General will determine the effectiveness of treatments provided under waivers for maintenance and detoxification in clinical settings. They will also assess if these waivers have increased the availability of maintenance treatment. The Secretary and Attorney General will assess the effectiveness of maintenance and detoxification treatments provided under waivers for practitioners. Data collection and regulations will be implemented to determine the impact on public health. The Attorney General will determine violations of numerical limitations for individuals, collect data in compliance with relevant provisions, and ensure regulatory analysis and congressional review. The Attorney General will determine if waivers have increased the misuse of narcotic drugs and assess their impact on public health before making a decision. The Attorney General will consult with the Secretary before making a decision on whether a paragraph should remain in effect, with comments from both parties included in the publication. The paragraph will cease to be in effect 60 days after the decision is published in the Federal Register. Enactment of the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 1999 allows practitioners to dispense narcotic drugs in schedule IV or V for maintenance or detoxification treatment, unless a state enacts a law prohibiting it. Amendments to the Controlled Substances Act specify changes in subsections related to dispensing such drugs."
