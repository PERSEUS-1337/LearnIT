    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that there is no Federal program to support family caregivers, most older individuals and persons with developmental disabilities prefer home care, over 22 million family caregivers provide care in the US, and a large portion of care for older individuals is provided by family caregivers. There are an estimated 3,170,000 persons with mental retardation and related developmental disabilities in the United States, with 1,890,000 living with family caregivers. Nearly 75 percent of family caregivers are women, many of whom have other major responsibilities. Family caregivers provide essential support worth billions of dollars, preventing additional older individuals and persons with disabilities from requiring costly care services. The loss in business productivity due to caregiving absences ranges from $11-29 billion annually. Family caregivers spend an average of $2,000 per year on caregiving expenses, which can be physically and emotionally demanding, leading to health problems for 30% of caregivers. They need resources to ease the burden they face daily, especially as millions of baby boomers are set to retire. With millions of baby boomers nearing retirement, it is essential to prepare for the increased long-term care needs of older individuals. The National Family Caregiver Support Program is established under the Older Americans Act of 1965 to provide state grants for caregiver support. The Assistant Secretary implements a grant program for States with approved plans to support family caregivers providing in-home and community care to older individuals. Area agencies on aging offer services like information, access assistance, counseling, support groups, and caregiver training. The State program provides support for caregivers of older individuals, including assistance with decision-making, respite care, and supplemental services. Eligibility criteria must be met for caregivers to receive these services, with priority given to those in need. The State program prioritizes services for older individuals with social and economic needs, as well as caregivers of persons with developmental disabilities. Area agencies on aging must coordinate with other community organizations providing similar services. The State must establish quality standards and mechanisms to ensure the quality of services provided under this subpart. They are required to collect data and maintain records in a standardized format specified by the Assistant Secretary for monitoring and evaluation purposes. The State must submit reports to the Assistant Secretary on data, records, services funded, and quality assurance mechanisms. States must use funds from the State allotment to carry out the program and may use funds for administration of area plans. The Federal share of the cost for State programs under this subpart is 75 percent, with the non-Federal share coming from State and local sources. \"Under this subpart, funds must supplement existing Federal, State, or local funds for services described in section 341(b). Additionally, there is a National Innovation Programs section that includes an Innovation Grant Program.\" The Assistant Secretary will provide grants to entities for developing new approaches to support family caregivers of older individuals, including minority and distant caregivers, and linking family support programs with agencies for persons with disabilities. Evaluation of funded programs' effectiveness will be conducted. The Assistant Secretary will reserve funds for programs and activities under this section, including support for caregivers serving Indians and Native Hawaiians. The Assistant Secretary will carry out activities of national significance to support family caregivers and older individuals, with funds reserved from the amount appropriated. Authorization of appropriations for the national family caregiver support program under the Older Americans Act of 1965 is set at $125,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, with additional funding for fiscal years 2001 through 2004. Allotments to states will be made from the remaining sums after reservations of funds under specific sections. SEC. 4. Availability of funds for reallocation amended to include subpart 1 of part D.
