    "content": "The Central Asian region, bordering Russia, China, and Iran, became independent after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The countries have made progress in building defense and security structures but have been hesitant to embrace democratization and human rights. Internal and external security concerns include social disorder, crime, corruption, terrorism, ethnic conflicts, and border tensions. The Central Asian states face various security threats including disorder, crime, corruption, terrorism, and border tensions. They have sought to strengthen security forces and regional cooperation, with assistance from the United States post-9/11. Questions remain about the extent of U.S. involvement in the region. Central Asian states have expanded relations with neighboring countries and international organizations to address regional security concerns. Central Asian countries seek ties with neighboring countries like Russia, Afghanistan, China, Iran, Turkey, and South Caucasus states, as well as with global powers such as the United States, Germany, France, India, Israel, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and Ukraine. They also engage with international organizations like the World Bank, IMF, ECO, OIC, EU, CIS, SCO, and NATO for assistance and cooperation. After September 11, 2001, Russia, China, and the United States cooperated in combating terrorism in Central Asia. Cooperation has decreased since then, but may improve due to the complex security situation in Afghanistan. Collaboration is necessary to address issues like drug trafficking, arms smuggling, energy development, and infectious diseases. Iran and Russia have worked together to limit US and Turkish involvement in Caspian Sea resources. Concerns arise about increased collaboration among Russia, Iran, and China posing threats to Central Asian sovereignty. The security and independence of Central Asian states are threatened by authoritarian regimes, crime, corruption, terrorism, and ethnic tensions. Kazakhstan has faced separatism in the north, Tajikistan deals with economic mismanagement and separatism in the north, Kyrgyzstan has regional power struggles, and Turkmenistan faces clan tensions and poverty. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan face clan tensions, poverty, and civil discontent. Ethnic clashes have occurred in the Fergana Valley. Both countries are affected by drug trafficking and corruption. Turkmenistan's oil and gas wealth could contribute to stability, while Uzbekistan has resources like oil, natural gas, and gold for development and security. Kyrgyzstan's potential for stable development and security lies in its resources like oil, natural gas, and gold. The country's civil society aims to reduce authoritarianism and improve governance, which could lead to increased budget for defense. Regional cooperation among elites is hindered despite shared language, religion, and ethnicity. Central Asian states faced declining quality of life post-Soviet Union dissolution, widening the gap between rich and poor. The dissolution of the Soviet Union in Central Asia widened the gap between rich and poor, leading to social tensions and instability. Despite some improvements in poverty and health in the new century, the quality of life still lags behind Western countries. Economic challenges from the 2008 financial crisis could worsen social tensions, separatism, and extremism, especially as the agricultural sector struggles to absorb new workers due to population growth. Out-migration to Russia has helped ease some economic pressures in the region. Out-migration of workers to Russia and the decline in remittances have exacerbated economic challenges in Central Asia. Calls for Sharia-based government are gaining support, while the influence of extremist Islamic groups is growing. Government crackdowns, justified by citing conflicts in Tajikistan and Russia, aim to curb potential threats. Islamic extremism in Central Asia is fueled by economic distress, unemployment, and poverty among youth in regions like Uzbekistan's Fergana Valley. Government crackdowns, often disguised as anti-extremism measures, target clan, political, and religious repression. Extremist threats to regimes are supported by external groups providing funding, education, and manpower. Some Central Asian states impose controls on religious freedom, censoring literature and sermons. Uzbekistan is particularly concerned about Islamic extremism and has been proactive in combating the threat. Underground radical Islamic groups may exploit government religious control to fill a spiritual void. In Uzbekistan, strict restrictions on religious freedom have been implemented, including imprisoning alleged Islamic extremists, closing mosques, and banning unregistered faiths. The legislature passed laws censoring religious writings and increasing punishments for involvement in illegal religious groups. Public displays of religiosity are discouraged, with government harassment towards women wearing hijabs and men with beards. Uzbekistan has been designated a \"country of particular concern\" for severe religious and human rights violations. Uzbekistan, labeled a \"country of particular concern\" for severe religious and human rights violations, has arrested members of Hizb ut-Tahrir (HT) for advocating Sharia rule. Despite crackdowns, HT continues to attract followers. Kyrgyzstan also views HT as a terrorist organization due to anti-American and anti-Semitic rhetoric, but some argue it is peaceful. Terrorist activities in Central Asia, including those by the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), were disrupted by U.S.-led coalition actions in Afghanistan. However, there are concerns that terrorist cells have re-formed and are expanding in the region, with elements of IMU infiltrating from Afghanistan and Pakistan. Some actions labeled as terrorism may be driven by economic motives or revenge rather than political purposes. Counter-terrorism efforts may also be used to suppress religious or political opposition to regimes in the region. The IMU and other terrorist groups are infiltrating from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and beyond, becoming closely allied with international terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. They have expanded their activities globally, with explosions in Tashkent in 1999 leading to arrests and trials of suspects, including political oppositionists. Uzbek officials accused Mohammad Solikh of being the mastermind, allegedly supported by the Taliban and Uzbek extremist Tohir Yuldash. The 22 suspects in the coup plot received training in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, and Russia. They were led by Solikh, Yuldash, and Namanganiy, heads of the IMU. Solikh, Yuldash, Namanganiy, and others planned for Solikh to be president and Yuldash defense minister after overthrowing Karimov. The coup plot included an attack on Uzbekistan by Namanganiy and Tajik rebels. In November 2000, twelve persons were convicted of terrorism in Uzbekistan, with sentences ranging from 8 to 15 years. The bombings were linked to the IMU, with Solikh receiving 15.5 years in prison. Yuldash denied involvement but warned of more attacks if Karimov did not step down. President Karimov attributed the violence to a plot against his government by an Islamic Jihad Group. An Islamic Jihad Group of Uzbekistan claimed responsibility for suicide bombings in Tashkent, Uzbekistan in July 2004. Media censorship intensified after the attacks. Fifteen suspects were tried for attempting to overthrow the government, with some confessing to belonging to the group and being trained in Kazakhstan and Pakistan. Over 100 individuals were convicted in various trials. The group's leader was linked to Taliban head Mohammad Omar, Uighur extremist Abu Mohammad, and Osama bin Laden. Suicide bombings in Tashkent, Uzbekistan in July 2004 targeted U.S. and Israeli embassies and the Uzbek Prosecutor-General's Office. The IMU and IJG claimed responsibility, aiming to oppose Uzbek and other governments. In May 2005, Uzbek troops fired on demonstrators in Andijon, resulting in civilian casualties during protests against a trial of local businessmen accused of terrorism. The curr_chunk discusses the aftermath of a group storming a prison in Uzbekistan, releasing inmates who then participated in further unrest. President Islam Karimov restored order, but the international community called for an inquiry, which the Uzbek government rejected. Subsequent attacks occurred in May 2009, including bombings in Andijon. In Andijon, bombings occurred in the commercial district, with alleged deaths and injuries. Uzbek officials blamed the IMU, while the IJU claimed responsibility. President Karimov visited Andijon. In Tashkent, a shooting resulted in the deaths of three alleged IMU members. The Uzbek government accused the group of past attacks. In December 2009, 22 individuals were convicted for involvement in the May 2009 events. Sporadic attacks, including suicide bombings, have targeted the government in recent years. In Kyrgyzstan, terrorist attacks occurred at the Oberon market in Bishkek, a currency exchange outlet in Osh, and targeted policemen in Bishkek. The bombings resulted in casualties and injuries, with suspects linked to the IMU and trained in Chechnya and Afghanistan. The former Bush Administration viewed the ouster of Akayev in 2005 as a popular uprising. Islamic extremists from Uzbekistan settled in Tajikistan to escape repression. In July-August 1999, guerrilla groups from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan entered Kyrgyzstan led by Namanganiy. They seized hostages, including Japanese geologists, and demanded harborage from Kyrgyzstan and the release of jailed extremists from Uzbekistan. The guerrillas aimed to create an Islamic state in south Kyrgyzstan for a jihad in Uzbekistan. By mid-October 1999, Kyrgyzstan's defense minister announced success in forcing most guerrillas into Tajikistan. In August 2000, dozens of IMU and other insurgents invaded Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, with links to terrorists in Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Russia. Observers debated whether the terrorism was driven by Islamic extremism or control of narcotics resources. Uzbekistan criticized Kyrgyzstan for not suppressing the guerrillas, while Tajikistan's relations with Uzbekistan were strained as they allowed the guerrillas to enter Afghanistan instead of eliminating them. In August 2000, insurgents invaded Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, leading to hostage situations and mass fleeing in Kyrgyzstan. Uzbekistan provided support, and Kyrgyz forces defeated the insurgents by late October 2000. The IMU did not engage in major attacks in 2001 due to focusing on bin Laden's agenda after September 11, 2001. Tajikistan was among the Central Asian republics least prepared for independence. In September 1992, a coalition of nationalist, Islamic, and democratic parties in Tajikistan, led by Pamiri and Garmi regional elites, attempted to take over. Kulyabi and Khojenti regional elites, with assistance from Uzbekistan and Russia, launched a successful counteroffensive resulting in casualties and refugees. In 1993, the CIS authorized \"peacekeeping\" forces in Tajikistan, including Russia's 201st Rifle Division and troops from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. In the late 1990s, international terrorist groups like the IMU, Iran's Revolutionary Guards, and Al Qaeda supported the Tajik opposition during the civil war. After a cease-fire agreement in 1994, the UNSC established UNMOT to monitor the situation. In 1996, a National Reconciliation Commission was set up, leading to a comprehensive peace agreement signed in 1997 between President Rakhman and opposition leader Nuri. In 2000, the peace process in Tajikistan saw significant progress with the disbandment of the NRC, withdrawal of UNMOT, and fulfillment of the CIS peacekeeping mandate. However, stability in the country remains fragile, with reports of IMU fighters in Afghanistan and IJU members arrested in Pakistan for targeting the government. In 2007-2008, IMU and IJU members were targeted in northern Pakistan by local tribes and Pakistani forces, leading to casualties. Tohir Yuldash called for a Shariah state in Pakistan in 2008. There were reports linking IJU to al Qaeda and a member carrying out a suicide bombing in Afghanistan. Taliban forces in Afghanistan carried out a suicide bombing, killing two Afghan and two U.S. troops. The IJU is playing a significant role in the fighting in Afghanistan, with members involved in attacks dating back to 1999. Operations were conducted against IMU terrorists in the Konduz province, and Tohir Yuldash was allegedly killed by a U.S. predator missile in Pakistan. Abdur Rakhman became the new leader of the IMU. In September 2009, Abdur Rakhman became the new leader of the IMU. In October 2009, terrorists attacked an army headquarters in Rawalpindi, resulting in 20 deaths. Pakistani armed forces targeted an IMU base in Kaniguram in late October. In February 2010, a U.S. predator missile killed terrorists in North Waziristan linked to Al Qaeda. IMU terrorists attacked a police station in Bannu, Pakistan, killing 15. Some officials warn of terrorists returning to Central Asia due to crackdowns in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Pakistani armed forces targeted an IMU base in Kaniguram in late October. In February 2010, a U.S. predator missile killed terrorists in North Waziristan linked to Al Qaeda. IMU terrorists attacked a police station in Bannu, Pakistan, killing 15. Some officials warn of terrorists returning to Central Asia due to crackdowns in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Other officials have stated that a large-scale influx has not yet occurred. In Germany, four individuals were arrested on September 5, 2007, for planning explosions at the U.S. airbase at Ramstein and other targets. The IJU claimed responsibility, citing reasons related to U.S. and Uzbek policies towards Muslims. The suspects had ties to Gofir Salimov, wanted in Uzbekistan for the 2004 bombings. In July 2009, German media reported that suspects trained at an IJU terrorist camp in Afghanistan confessed to launching attacks against U.S. military camps. In May 2008, French, German, and Dutch authorities detained individuals for funneling money to the IMU in Uzbekistan. In September 2008, German authorities arrested two suspected IJU members and issued wanted posters for two others. In September 2008, German authorities arrested two suspected IJU members and issued wanted posters for two others who allegedly received terrorist training in Pakistani IJU camps. The IJU threatened Germany for supporting NATO operations in Afghanistan and using a base in Uzbekistan. Turkish authorities arrested over three dozen alleged IJU members in April 2009, and a video released by the IJU in June 2009 linked the terrorist organization to al Qaeda. The borders of the five Central Asian states were delineated in 1936 based on linguistic and ethnic groups, with some areas disputed due to Soviet-era decisions. Border disputes also exist over Caspian Sea resources, with Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan having unresolved claims. In August 2009, Turkmenistan called for a resolution on disputed offshore resources. In August 2009, Turkmenistan sought adjudication of disputed offshore resources, with the US offering mediation. Iran rejected US involvement, insisting on littoral states' authority. Russia and Kazakhstan agreed on seabed oil resources, while China settled border disputes with neighboring countries. In Kyrgyzstan, a border agreement with China in 1999 led to protests and threats of impeachment against the president. Despite appeals to the Constitutional Court, the agreement was upheld as legal in 2003. In 2006, the Kyrgyz president reassured China by signing a joint declaration, and in 2009, the Kyrgyz Border Service refuted claims against the agreement. The Kyrgyz Border Service denied claims of territory cession to China and confirmed resolution of border demarcation issues. Border delineation between Russia and Kazakhstan has been a concern, with progress made in the 1990s and ongoing efforts to place border signs and posts. Kazakhstan reorganized borders in the north to limit ethnic Russian influence, leading to emigration. Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan agreed on half of their shared border, resolving disputes in the Fergana Valley. Tensions rise due to demographic shifts and allegations of land encroachment. In January 2010, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan faced border disputes, with Tajik Foreign Minister mentioning the complexity of delineating borders. Uzbekistan also had contentious border talks with all Central Asian states, with 40% of Kyrgyzstan's border with Uzbekistan still needing demarcation. Kyrgyz legislators protested a border agreement that ceded land to Uzbekistan in 2001. In late 2004, Kyrgyz legislators demanded the return of Uzbekistan's Shohimardon enclave in Kyrgyzstan. Border talks between Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan ceased for five years due to various contentious issues. Uzbekistan's unilateral efforts to delineate borders with Kazakhstan in the late 1990s led to tensions, but by September 2002, the border delineation was announced as complete. Some people in disputed border villages began to relocate, while others ignored or were uncertain of the new border, leading to shootings of Kazakh citizens. In late 2004, Kyrgyz legislators demanded the return of Uzbekistan's Shohimardon enclave in Kyrgyzstan. Border talks between Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan ceased for five years due to various contentious issues. Uzbekistan's unilateral efforts to delineate borders with Kazakhstan in the late 1990s led to tensions. Shootings of Kazakh citizens occurred due to uncertainty and disputes over the new border with Uzbekistan. Residents complained about constant arrests by Uzbek border guards, while Kazakh officials called for relocation. Tajik border guard service complained about hindrances in demarcation by Uzbekistan. Tajiks raised concerns about Uzbekistan's intentions to redraw borders to gain control of the Farhod reservoir. Border tensions between Uzbekistan and neighboring countries have escalated due to disputes over redrawn borders, open or closed borders, and the mining of border areas. Uzbekistan's actions, such as mining its borders with Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, have led to civilian casualties and demands for clearance of mines. Kyrgyzstan has also raised tensions by sowing mines and blowing up mountain passes along its borders with Tajikistan. Border tensions between Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan flared in late 2002 after accusations of complicity in a coup attempt. Uzbekistan imposed heavy duties on imports in mid-2002 and closed its borders to \"suitcase trading\" in 2003, leading to heightened tensions with neighboring states. Disagreements with Tajikistan persist on mine clearing, transportation restrictions, clashes between border guards, and visa regulations. Tajikistan began building a railway spur in July 2009 to bypass Uzbekistan after terrorist attacks in Uzbekistan in May 2009. In May 2009, terrorists attacked Uzbekistan, allegedly entering from Kyrgyzstan. Uzbekistan built border fortifications despite objections from Kyrgyzstan. Iran's border disputes in the Caspian Sea hindered the development of oil and gas pipelines. Russia conducted large naval maneuvers in August 2002. In August 2002, Russia conducted its largest naval maneuvers in the northern Caspian. Kazakhstan announced plans to form a navy in 2003 to protect offshore oil fields and maritime borders, despite protests from Russia. Turkmenistan's dispute with Azerbaijan over sea borders and oilfields has hindered trans-Caspian pipeline development. Central Asian states have seen an expansion of organized crime networks involved in drug, arms, and human trafficking, with ties to global crime groups. These states are used as origin, transit, or destination points for human trafficking, with collusion between crime groups and local officials for forced labor. Corruption poses a serious threat to democratization and economic growth in Central Asian states. Factors contributing to corruption include foreign investments, low government salaries, inadequate laws, and weak rule of law. According to the World Bank, Kazakhstan showed little improvement in combating corruption from 1996-2008, ranking at the 16th percentile in 2008. Kyrgyzstan's corruption increased from 1996-2007 but slightly declined in 2008, ranking at the 13th percentile. Tajikistan saw a decline in corruption. In Turkmenistan, corruption remained relatively stable from 1996-2008, ranking at the 5th percentile in 2008. The Turkmen president controls a fund receiving 50% of gas revenues, with unclear transparency on its usage. Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan have been implicated in corrupt practices related to oil and gas exports. In the 1990s, U.S. energy companies in Kazakhstan allegedly funneled payments into Swiss bank accounts linked to Kazakh officials, including Nazarbayev. U.S. and Swiss officials froze the funds in 1999-2000. Kazakhstan established a National Fund in 2001 to manage oil revenues under strict accounting standards. Central Asian states seek economic and defense assistance from Western donors, cooperate with each other, and join international organizations. Regional cooperation in Central Asia faces challenges from differential economic development and divergent interests among states, as well as nationalistic postures. Uzbekistan's dominant role is seen as a hindrance to cooperation. Extra-regional groups like the CSTO, PFP, and SCO further complicate cooperation due to the conflicting interests of Russia, the United States, and China. Despite this, the focus on anti-terrorism could potentially motivate cooperation. Military and border security issues, including financing and training, are significant concerns for all Central Asian states. The Central Asian states heavily rely on military training and equipment ties with Russia, but have also received aid from the U.S. since 9/11. Their military capabilities are limited compared to neighboring states like Russia, China, and Iran. They have sought assistance from various countries and organizations, including the United States, Turkey, China, CIS, NATO's PFP, and SCO. The global economic downturn since 2008 has affected their military and security forces. The global economic downturn since 2008 has impacted the Central Asian states, leading to a halt or reversal in per capita income growth. Factors include reduced remittances, rising food and fuel costs, currency depreciation, and fluctuating commodity prices. The banking sectors have been stressed by non-performing loans, resulting in decreased private sector lending. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have used sovereign wealth funds to support social programs and mitigate budget deficits, while Kyrgyzstan has received budgetary support from Russia and the IMF. Kyrgyzstan has cushioned the economic blow with budgetary support from Russia and the IMF, a large grain harvest, and trade with China. Economic cooperation among Central Asian states faced challenges such as Uzbekistan's price controls, currency restrictions, and tariffs on Kyrgyzstan. A customs union formed between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in 1994, later renamed the Central Asian Economic Community (CAEC), aimed for regional cooperation but faced criticism for limited achievements. Karimov proposed transforming it into a forum for policy discussions in 2001. In late 2001, the Central Asian Cooperation Organization (CACO) was renamed to focus on policy discussions. Kazakhstan joined a common economic space with Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine in 2003. CACO admitted Russia as a member in 2004 and integrated its membership into the Eurasian Economic Community (EEC) in 2005. EEC members Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan concentrated on common customs tariffs. Uzbekistan suspended its membership in the EEC in 2008. The Asian Development Bank launched the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation program (CAREC) in 1997 to improve living standards and reduce poverty in member states through economic collaboration. Participating institutions provided loans and grants to CAREC countries in 2008 and 2009, focusing on transport, energy, and trade development. In 1992, Armenia, Russia, and most Central Asian states signed a Collective Security Treaty for mutual defense. Asian states signed a Collective Security Treaty to mutually defend against security threats and created the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) with a permanent secretariat for military planning and coordination. The CSTO aims to respond quickly to internal and external security threats, intervene in military conflicts, prevent terror acts, stop drug trafficking, and provide disaster relief. The CSTO, created by Asian states under a Collective Security Treaty, aims to fulfill tasks like protecting pipelines and disaster relief. Russia sees it as a key tool against external military threats, but its effectiveness has been questioned in past events like the \"tulip revolution\" in Kyrgyzstan and the Russia-Georgia conflict in 2008. In early 2009, the CSTO announced the creation of an air-assault Collective Operational Reaction Force (CORF), with Uzbekistan expressing concerns and President Medvedev emphasizing its importance. The main participants are Russia and Kazakhstan. In early 2010, it was revealed that there are two CSTO rapid reaction forces - CORF with over 20,000 special operation troops focused on defending borders and an older Collective Rapid Deployment Force being revitalized to address threats from Afghanistan. The CSTO, with main participants Russia and Kazakhstan, announced the creation of an air-assault Collective Operational Reaction Force in early 2009. The force aims to defend borders and address threats from Afghanistan. The CSTO has called for NATO cooperation on counter-narcotics and anti-terrorism, seeking recognition of a Russian sphere of influence in Soviet successor states. Despite attempts to establish formal ties, NATO has not responded to cooperative overtures. The CSTO, with main participants Russia and Kazakhstan, announced the creation of an air-assault Collective Operational Reaction Force in early 2009 to defend borders and address threats from Afghanistan. The CSTO has urged NATO cooperation on counter-narcotics and anti-terrorism, seeking recognition of a Russian sphere of influence in Soviet successor states. The CSTO has also attempted to play a role in global security analogous to NATO, urging greater U.N. cooperation in areas such as regional security, peacekeeping, counterterrorism, and combating illicit trafficking. President Medvedev stated in early 2009 that the CSTO would combat terrorism and offer support for ISAF operations in Afghanistan, despite not sending troops. In 1996, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan signed the \"Shanghai Treaty\" with China to demilitarize mutual borders. In 2001, Uzbekistan joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which was originally a treaty demilitarizing the former Soviet-Chinese border. The SCO signed a convention on joint fighting against separatism, terrorism, and extremism. China has used the SCO to pressure Central Asian states regarding their Uighur minorities and to emphasize economic and trade potential. Both Russia and China have encouraged the regional states to prioritize their ties with the SCO over their security ties with the United States. President Karimov of Uzbekistan joined the SCO to protect Uzbekistan's interests. President Karimov of Uzbekistan joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in 2001 to protect Uzbekistan's interests. He expressed concerns about the SCO's effectiveness in combatting terrorism and indicated a desire to strengthen relations with China. Despite criticizing the SCO at times, Karimov hosted the SCO Regional Anti-Terrorism Structure (RATS) in Uzbekistan. Observers suggested that his shifting stance was a strategy to maximize aid from major powers. This approach seemed successful, as China offered significant financial assistance at the June 2004 SCO summit. In June 2004, China offered $1.25 billion in grants and loans to Karimov and Russia offered up to $2.5 billion in investment at the SCO summit. Karimov endorsed a communique criticizing U.S. foreign policy at the 2006 SCO summit in Shanghai, showing closer ties with Russia and China. In September 2006, Russia's FSB leader became the head of RATS, indicating Russia's increasing role in the SCO. Despite closer security ties, Karimov's distrust of Russia is reflected in the Uzbek security service's oversight of RATS. The SCO military exercise in 2007 included all member countries, with Russian and Chinese forces predominating. Central Asian states view the SCO as a balance to Russian and Chinese influence, preferring its economic and security cooperation over U.S. advocacy of democratic revolutions. Regional leaders may prioritize the SCO's economic prospects over its security aspects, especially after 9/11. The SCO faced challenges in combating terrorism post-9/11 and failed to respond collectively to crises in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan in 2005. Limited water resources in the region could threaten stability and economic development, with Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and part of Kazakhstan relying on rivers flowing from Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan for water. After the Soviet breakup, Central Asian states struggled to manage inherited facilities, leading to disputes over water resources. An agreement between Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan in 1998 to exchange oil and gas for water failed due to lack of oversight. Water mismanagement, irrigation issues, and efforts to boost cotton production led to the depletion of the Amu and Syr Darya Rivers, affecting the Aral Sea. Kyrgyzstan's focus on hydro-electricity generation worsened downstream water shortages and floods. The shrinking Aral Sea has led to environmental problems in the region. Kazakhstan built a dam to separate the northern and southern parts, causing water levels to rise in the north but drying up the south. Lack of regional cooperation is evident in disputes over water resources, such as Tajikistan's construction of a dam affecting Uzbekistan's water flow. Uzbekistan retaliated by cutting off electricity transmission from Turkmenistan. In late December 2008, a dam in Uzbekistan disrupted electricity transmission from Turkmenistan, leading to a power crisis in Tajikistan. Tensions rose as Russian President Medvedev suggested all Central Asian states should agree on dam construction on trans-border rivers, seen as favoring Uzbekistan over Tajikistan. Uzbekistan accused Tajikistan of electricity theft in 2009, withdrawing from the Unified Energy System of Central Asia. Tajikistan warned of releasing more water in winter for power generation, affecting downstream countries in summer. Uzbekistan also opposed Turkmenistan's water diversion plans. Uzbekistan opposes Turkmenistan's planned water diversion from the Amu Darya to create a new lake, which could threaten Uzbek cotton production. In 2003, Uzbekistan seized part of the Karshinskiy Canal in Turkmenistan after water-sharing talks broke down. China's diversion of waters from the Ili and Irtysh Rivers to Xinjiang reduces resources for downstream countries like Kazakhstan and Russia. Kazakhstan's concerns led to the creation of a China-Kazakhstan commission for trans-border rivers in 1999. China only agreed to exchange information on pollution, deflecting water-sharing discussions. China's water diversion could reduce water flows to Kazakhstan by up to 40% by 2050, potentially damaging Lake Balkhash. Afghanistan may also divert more water from the Amu Darya River for economic development. The Caspian region is becoming a significant source of oil and gas for global markets, with proven reserves comparable to Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Kazakhstan has the largest proven oil reserves in the region. Kazakhstan has the region's largest proven oil reserves at 9-40 billion barrels and 100tcf of natural gas. Some foreign investors are discouraged by harsh government terms and alleged corruption. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan also have significant gas reserves. Russia's gas cutoffs to Ukraine and Belarus have highlighted Europe's energy insecurity. The United States supports EU efforts to reduce reliance on Russian oil and gas. Efforts to reduce reliance on Russian oil and gas involve encouraging Central Asian countries to transport energy exports to Europe through pipelines crossing the Caspian Sea. Russia has historically pressured Central Asian states to yield energy wealth at below-market prices. In 2007, Putin secured agreements with Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to strengthen control over export routes for Central Asian energy. In 2007, agreements were made between Russia and Kazakhstan, as well as Turkmenistan, to control energy export routes. China also signed agreements with Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to build oil and gas pipelines to China, challenging U.S. and EU efforts to establish alternative pipelines. The national gas companies of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan plan to raise gas export prices to European levels in the future. They signed a price agreement with Russia's Gazprom. China's entry into the market increased the bargaining power of Central Asian states. Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Iran export electricity to Afghanistan. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency's Central Asian Infrastructure Integration Initiative and USAID's Regional Energy Market Assistance focus on the region's energy sector. The Central Asian Infrastructure Integration Initiative and USAID's Regional Energy Market Assistance Program aim to promote energy, transportation, and communication projects in Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. The Asian Development Bank approved funding for feasibility studies on importing electricity from Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to Afghanistan and Pakistan. An inter-governmental agreement was signed to build a 500-kilovolt electric power transmission line connecting Tajikistan to Afghanistan. The project is estimated to cost $935 million and will be funded by the World Bank and the Islamic Development Bank. The $935 million project to build a 500-kilovolt electric power transmission line connecting Tajikistan to Afghanistan is funded by the World Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, and the International Finance Corporation. The project is expected to provide two-thirds of the electricity to Pakistan and one-third to Afghanistan, with completion planned for 2013. The Asian Development Bank withdrew from the project in 2009 due to concerns about cooperation among Central Asian countries on water-sharing. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have accused Tajikistan of illicitly siphoning electricity from the Central Asian Unified Energy System grid. Tajikistan is accused of illicitly siphoning electricity from the Central Asian Unified Energy System grid, leading to retaliation from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan cut off electricity supply to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, causing issues with power supply. Tajik analysts suggest retaliating against Uzbekistan and warn of potential trust issues in the government due to power shortages. The construction of the Roghun hydro-electric power dam in Tajikistan has strained relations with Uzbekistan due to concerns about water flow. Kazakhstan faces challenges with its main oil export route to Russia, including resistance to increasing pipeline capacity and high transit fees. President Nazarbayev is prompted to address these issues. President Nazarbayev signed a treaty with Azerbaijani President Ilkham Aliyev in June 2006 to transport Kazakh oil across the Caspian Sea to the BTC pipeline. Kazakhstan began shipping oil through the BTC pipeline in October 2008. An agreement in September 2009 allows for up to 500,000 bpd of oil to be transported across the Caspian Sea to the BTC or Baku-Supsa pipeline. Plans for a trans-Caspian pipeline may be considered if volumes exceed 500,000 bpd. Kazakhstan has upgraded its Caspian Sea port facilities despite a Russian pledge to increase the capacity of the CPC pipeline. Kazakhstan has upgraded its Caspian Sea port facilities and ratified a treaty in 2008. It ships oil to Georgia's Black Sea terminal at Batumi and owns two refineries in Romania. Plans to double the capacity of the CPC pipeline by 2014 were finalized in 2009. Kazakhstan also completed an oil pipeline to China from central Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan completed an oil pipeline from Atasu to Xinjiang, China in 2006, with a capacity of 146.6 million barrels per year. By the end of 2008, 92 million barrels had been delivered. Another pipeline from Atyrau to Kerkiyak was finished in 2009, connecting to the Atasu pipeline. Russia can export 10.6 million barrels annually through the pipeline to China. Kazakhstan exports 10.6 million barrels of oil annually from Atasu to China through a pipeline. In 2008, Russia exported 5.5 million barrels through the same pipeline. Plans for a gas pipeline from western Kazakhstan to China are in place, with construction set to start in 2010 and finish by 2015. Kazakhstan's stance on providing gas for the Nabucco pipeline has been contradictory. President Nazarbayev expressed support for the transit of Kazakh gas through Turkey to benefit both countries. However, Kazakhstan's limited gas availability due to existing contracts poses a challenge for supplying gas to the Nabucco pipeline. Kazakhstan may consider becoming a potential supplier if gas production exceeds expectations, but legal issues regarding the Caspian Sea must be resolved first. Turkmenistan signed a gas supply accord with Russia in 2003, but halted shipments in 2004 over pricing disputes. They later agreed on market-based gas prices in 2009. Plans were made for a new gas pipeline to carry Turkmen and Kazakh gas to Russia. Turkmenistan opened a gas pipeline to Iran in 1997, providing gas until 2007 when shipments were suspended due to payment disputes. Gas shipments resumed in 2008 after Iran agreed to a price increase. In 2009, Turkmenistan agreed to increase gas supplies to Iran. Turkmenistan increased gas supplies to Iran up to 706 bcf per year, completed a second gas pipeline to Iran in 2009, signed an agreement with China for a gas pipeline with a capacity of 1.0 tcf per year, and expressed interest in building a trans-Caspian gas pipeline. Turkmenistan signed a memorandum of understanding with the EU in April 2008 to supply 353.1 bcf of gas per year, potentially through a trans-Caspian pipeline. In 2009, a gas pipeline explosion halted Turkmen gas shipments to Russia, leading to negotiations between President Medvedev and President Berdimuhamedow to resume gas exports at a reduced rate of up to 1 tcf per year. The Turkmen gas contract was altered to reduce exports to 1 tcf per year and increase the price. Turkmenistan resumed gas exports to Russia in 2010, validating its diversification policy. US officials emphasized the need for energy export route diversification. Despite some reluctance, Turkmen President pledged to continue diversification efforts. US supported the development of the \"southern corridor\" for gas and oil shipment to Western markets. Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan hesitated to back the Nabucco pipeline. Turkmenistan's President pledged support for the Nabucco pipeline, citing vast natural gas reserves in the country. Despite opposition from Russia and Iran, Turkmenistan's construction of gas pipelines to Iran and China raises doubts about its commitment to a trans-Caspian pipeline for Nabucco. Iran's potential role as a supplier to Nabucco may hinder Turkmenistan's direct access to European customers. Concerns over nuclear proliferation in Central Asia have been raised due to reports of attempted diversions of nuclear materials. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are major producers of yellow cake, with Kazakhstan possessing a significant portion of the world's uranium reserves. Kazakhstan's yellow cake is supplied to the United States and Europe. The country had a fast breeder reactor in Aktau, with enriched uranium and plutonium in storage. The Ulba metallurgical factory provides nuclear fuel pellets to Russia and plans to expand production for different reactors. In 2009, Kazakhstan offered its Ulba facilities to house a low-enriched uranium \"fuel bank\" under IAEA control. Uzbekistan's Navoi facility exports yellow cake through Nukem, while Kyrgyzstan's Kara Balta facility ships low-enriched uranium to Ulba and Russia. The trafficking of illegal narcotics in Central Asia poses security risks and hinders economic and political reforms. Criminal groups use the region as a transit route for smuggling drugs from Afghanistan to markets in Russia and Europe, leading to increased drug use and rising rates of HIV/AIDS due to shared needle use. Drug trafficking in Central Asia, particularly through Tajikistan, is a significant issue. President Berdimuhamedow of Turkmenistan has expressed concern over rising drug trafficking and addiction rates in the country. Despite calls for a tough approach, addicts are often sentenced to treatment instead of jail. The UNODC reports that drug trafficking in Central Asia involves multiple crime groups and drugs change hands several times before reaching Russian markets. This trafficking is less organized compared to Central American drug trafficking to the United States. Drug trafficking in Central Asia is a significant issue due to poorly patrolled borders, lack of cooperation among states, lawlessness, and corruption. Organized crime groups from producer countries have expanded their influence in the region. Various international crime groups use Central Asia as a trans-shipment route for drugs, with reports of Nigerian and Latin American groups smuggling drugs through the region. The Taliban, IMU, and other groups are also involved in drug trafficking in the area. Drug trafficking in Central Asia involves various international crime groups, including the Taliban, IMU, and other Islamic terrorist groups. These groups use the region to traffic drugs and finance their operations. Tajik border troops and Kazakh police are reportedly involved in drug smuggling activities. Counter-narcotics agencies in Central Asian states face challenges such as inadequate budgets and personnel training, but have seen an increase in drug seizures. The Kazakh government's Committee on Combating Narcotics has made progress in drug seizures and trafficking penalties. Security agents cracked down on new drug routes from Afghanistan. Kazakhstan remains a key transit country for drugs. Kyrgyzstan's mountain passes are major drug routes. The State Department reports that Osh is a major crossroads for drug trafficking into Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Russia, Western Europe, and the United States. Tajikistan and Turkmenistan are also significant centers for drug trafficking, with Turkmenistan creating a Counter-Narcotics Service in 2008 to combat drug smuggling. Illicit drugs are often smuggled through Turkmenistan by Caspian Sea ships. After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the Bush Administration focused on enhancing relations with Central Asian countries to prevent them from becoming havens for terrorism. Drug smuggling into Uzbekistan involves families or small groups rather than national rings, leading to increased drug addiction in the country. The National Center for Drug Control in Uzbekistan struggles to coordinate anti-drug efforts among various agencies. Illicit drugs are often smuggled through Turkmenistan by Caspian Sea ships into Russia and Azerbaijan. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the United States shifted its focus to Central Asian countries to prevent them from becoming terrorist havens. Counter-terrorism efforts were undertaken in Afghanistan to combat terrorists aiming to overthrow Central Asian governments and assisting the Taliban. This stance was a reversal from the previous position of not intervening militarily in Central Asia. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the United States focused on Central Asian countries to prevent them from becoming terrorist havens. Counter-terrorism efforts in Afghanistan targeted terrorists aiding the Taliban and aiming to overthrow Central Asian governments. Added security training and equipment were provided to Central Asian states, along with aid for democratization, human rights, and economic reforms to address root causes of terrorism. The US emphasized the importance of Central Asia for security, intelligence, and long-term strategic interests, committing to be a force for change in the region. The United States has prioritized building partnerships and political engagement in Central Asia to ensure security and combat terrorism. This includes working with countries in the region to deny support to terrorists, promote democratization, respect human rights, and develop free markets. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Blake, Jr. emphasized the importance of Caspian security and the need to assure security in the area. The United States has prioritized building partnerships and enhancing political engagement in Central Asia. Initiatives include high-level annual bilateral consultations on various issues, such as counter-narcotics, counter-terrorism, democratic reform, and trade. A working group has been created to encourage water-sharing arrangements in the region. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Krol outlined five objectives of U.S. policy in Central Asia, including maximizing cooperation with counter-terrorism efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The United States aims to enhance political engagement in Central Asia by promoting development, good governance, and respect for human rights. Efforts include fostering competitive market economies and preventing state failure in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. The State Department has included Central Asia in the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs. Defense Secretary Robert Gates urged Asian countries to provide infrastructure support to Central Asia. The United States aims to provide Central Asia with aid in road and rail, telecommunications, and electricity generation to link the region with Asia. Efforts also include combatting terrorism and narcotics trafficking, promoting political and economic reforms, and integrating the regional states into the Asian security structure. Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair warned of challenges due to autocratic leadership, weak institutions, and social inequality in the region, raising concerns about succession politics and the ability of certain countries to combat Islamic extremist influences. The potential for instability in Central Asia is heightened by competition over resources, economic crisis, and food and energy shortages. U.S. ties with the region were generally strong after coalition operations in Iraq in 2003, but there were concerns about civilian casualties and diplomatic efforts. Uzbekistan supported the operations, while Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan expressed some concerns. Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan's involvement in the coalition operations in Iraq in 2003 was met with criticism from some Islamic groups in Central Asia. Uzbek President Islam Karimov initially supported the Iraq operation as part of anti-terrorism efforts but later withdrew plans to send medical aid. Kazakhstan initially expressed support for disarming Iraq but later endorsed Saddam's removal for enhancing regional and global security. Kazakhstan deployed combat engineers to Iraq in 2003, supported by Nazarbayev and the legislature. Tajikistan remained neutral towards the U.S.-led coalition actions in Iraq, benefiting from U.S. aid and improved security after actions in Afghanistan. Kyrgyz expressed concerns about the potential destabilization of Central Asia due to the Iraq conflict. Kyrgyzstan initially expressed concerns about the potential destabilization of Central Asia due to the Iraq conflict. Despite this, there were conflicting statements regarding sending peacekeepers to Iraq. Turkmenistan's late President opposed military action in Iraq and called for U.N. involvement in creating a democratic Iraq. The U.S. government classified various groups in the region as terrorist organizations. The IMU, led by Yuldash, was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the U.S. It aims to overthrow the government in Uzbekistan and has links to bombings in 1999-2000. The IMU is supported by the Taliban and bin Laden. The U.S. supports Uzbekistan's right to defend against the IMU but emphasizes the need to avoid human rights violations. Providing funds or resources to the IMU is illegal for U.S. entities, and deportation or denial of entry to IMU representatives is allowed. The U.S. designated the IMU as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, linked to Al Qaeda. President Bush demanded Taliban to hand over terrorists or face military action. The IJG/IJU was labeled a global terrorist group by the State Department and the U.N. Security Council. On June 1, 2005, the U.N. Security Council added IJG/IJU to its terrorism list. Germany arrested individuals on September 5, 2007, for planning explosions at the U.S. airbase at Ramstein and other targets. The IJU claimed responsibility, citing grievances against the U.S., Uzbekistan, and Germany. Suspects had training at terrorist camps in Pakistan. U.S. officials testified that intercepted communications helped foil the plot. In August 2002, the U.S. froze assets of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) for committing terrorist acts. China, U.S., and other nations requested the U.N. to list ETIM as a terrorist group. China conducted military exercises with Kyrgyzstan to combat ETIM. Hizb ut-Tahrir (HT) has not been classified as a terrorist group by the U.S. according to the State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2006. Hizb ut-Tahrir (HT) advocates for a borderless Islamic state in the Muslim world. The United States has no evidence of HT committing terrorism, but its anti-American and anti-Semitic ideology sympathizes with violence against the US and its allies. HT has urged Muslims to fight Coalition Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. US officials criticize Central Asian governments for imprisoning HT members without proof of terrorist activities. HT has not called for violent overthrow of Central Asian governments, so it is not designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The factsheet urges Central Asian governments to prosecute citizens for illegal acts, not beliefs. Germany outlawed Hizb ut-Tahrir (HT) in 2003 as a terrorist organization advocating violence against Israel and Jews. The United States and Central Asian states signed defense cooperation accords pre-9/11, allowing for enhanced cooperation post-9/11. Former Assistant Secretary of Defense Crouch stated military relationships with Central Asian nations matured significantly post-9/11, with Kyrgyzstan being a critical regional partner. Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan provided various forms of support for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan post-9/11. While the former Bush Administration rejected the idea of permanent military bases in these states, military relationships with Central Asian nations matured significantly. Crouch stated in June 2002 that the US does not plan to establish permanent military bases in Central Asia but seeks long-term security ties and access to military facilities in the region to deter terrorist threats. The US military presence in the region is expected to continue as long as operations in Afghanistan persist, with tents at the Manas airbase being replaced by metal buildings in mid-2004. The Overseas Basing Commission (OBC) supported the usefulness of existing bases in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). They suggested the possibility of establishing cooperative security locations in the region but emphasized the need for further vetting of vital U.S. interests. Prior to 9/11, the U.S. promoted military cooperation through NATO's PFP, with Tajikistan joining in 2002. In February 2002, Tajikistan's support to the coalition against international terrorism was hailed by NATO. Central Asian officers and troops participated in PFP exercises in the US since 1995, with US troops joining exercises in Central Asia since 1997. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan competed for NATO services. Security accords were signed with Central Asian states post-9/11, including a US-Uzbekistan Declaration on the Strategic Partnership in March 2002. The US affirmed its concern for Uzbekistan's security and pledged consultation in case of external threats. The US affirmed its concern for Uzbekistan's security and pledged consultation in case of any external threat. Military cooperation between the two states was intensified, including re-equipping the Armed Forces of Uzbekistan. USCENTCOM became responsible for U.S. military engagement activities in Central Asia, focusing on ties between regional military forces and fostering professional militaries capable of responding to peacekeeping and humanitarian needs. USCENTCOM Commanders visited the region regularly, setting the stage for more extensive military ties post-September 11, 2001. A U.S.-Uzbek Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) was signed on October 7, 2001, allowing for the use of Uzbek airspace and a Soviet-era airbase for up to 1,500 U.S. troops near the Afghan border. The agreement targeted terrorists belonging to the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) fighting alongside Taliban and Al Qaeda forces. The U.S. sought airfield access at Manas International Airport in Kyrgyzstan after facing difficulties in negotiating the U.S.-Uzbek SOFA. The Manas airfield became a key hub for operations in Afghanistan, with U.S. military engineers upgrading runways and establishing an encampment named the Peter J. Ganci airbase. Additionally, Uzbekistan provided a base for German troops at Termez and a land corridor for humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. French troops used the Dushanbe airport in Tajikistan for refueling and humanitarian shipments, while Kazakhstan granted overflight and transhipment rights. Accords were signed with Kazakhstan in 2002 for emergency use of the Almaty airport and military relations. Turkmenistan also played a role in the region. The Central Asian countries, including Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, have allowed the use of their bases for military operations and humanitarian aid. Despite a declaration at an SCO summit calling for a deadline on the temporary use of infrastructure facilities, none of the leaders immediately called for closing the coalition bases. The United States ceased operations at K2 in Uzbekistan on November 21, 2005, following demands to vacate the base within six months. Former pro-U.S. defense minister Qodir Gulomov was convicted of treason, shifting activities to the Manas airbase in Kyrgyzstan. The closure of K2 was seen as a setback for U.S. influence in the region, benefiting Russian and Chinese influence. However, U.S. ties with other regional states may still provide influence, especially through criticism of human rights abuses. The closure of K2 in Uzbekistan led to a shift in U.S. focus towards Kazakhstan, strengthening strategic partnership in various areas such as fighting terrorism, enhancing regional security, and developing energy resources. The U.S. supported Kazakhstan's goal of becoming an economic powerhouse in the region. Defense analyst Roger McDermott warns of increasing Russian military influence over Kazakhstan despite closer U.S.-Kazakh relations. He suggests the U.S. should provide monitored defense aid to combat corruption in Kazakhstan's armed forces. In 2006, Kyrgyz President Bakiyev requested higher lease payments for the Manas airbase, leading to negotiations with the U.S. and a resolution in July 2006. The United States announced $150 million in total assistance and compensation for the next year, with a portion designated for basing payments. A Protocol of Intentions was signed to compensate Kyrgyz government and businesses for supporting coalition operations. Increased terrorist activities in Afghanistan and a 2006 terrorist incursion from Tajikistan into Kyrgyzstan may have influenced Kyrgyzstan's decision to maintain the U.S. coalition presence. Gen. John Abizaid mentioned a potential reduction in the U.S. military presence in Central Asia during his visit in July 2006. Abizaid mentioned a potential reduction in the U.S. military presence in Central Asia. After a civilian was shot at the Manas airbase in Kyrgyzstan, President Bakiyev ordered a review of the status of forces agreement. Despite Kyrgyzstan's insistence on trial in local courts, the U.S. serviceman was sent back to the U.S. Bakiyev later announced the closure of the Manas airbase due to inadequate compensation and public pressure. At a meeting, Medvedev offered financial assistance to Kyrgyzstan in exchange for closing the airbase. Despite speculation of a quid pro quo, both Russian and Kyrgyz officials denied any link. Medvedev stated that regional anti-terrorist operations would still be supported. The Kyrgyz legislature approved canceling the status of forces agreement with the US for the airbase, leading to its closure within 180 days. A new agreement was reached to continue supplying troops in Afghanistan for regional security. The Kyrgyz government approved a new agreement with the United States for a transit center at Manas airport, citing concerns about the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The yearly rent payment was increased to $60 million, with additional funding pledged for infrastructure improvements and counter-terrorism efforts. The new agreement with the United States for a transit center at Manas airport includes increased rent to $60 million, funding for infrastructure improvements, counter-narcotics, and counter-terrorism efforts. Stricter host-country conditions on U.S. military personnel are also part of the agreement. Undersecretary William Burns welcomed President Bakiyev's decision and emphasized deepening bilateral relations with Kyrgyzstan. In early 2010, more facilities were being constructed at the transit center in Kyrgyzstan to accommodate increased numbers of U.S. troops deployed to Afghanistan. French and Spanish troops deployed at Manas had to leave, with negotiations ongoing for their return. Dushanbe and Herat are being used temporarily for troop relief flights due to security concerns in Pakistan. In early 2010, additional facilities were being built at the transit center in Kyrgyzstan to support more U.S. troops heading to Afghanistan. French and Spanish troops stationed at Manas had to depart, with talks ongoing for their comeback. Dushanbe and Herat are serving as temporary locations for troop relief flights due to security issues in Pakistan. Gen. David Petraeus negotiated alternative transit routes through Central Asia for supplies to support NATO and U.S. operations in Afghanistan. Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan agreed to allow transit, with Georgia, Russia, and Azerbaijan already permitting it in previous years. In 2005, Georgia, in 2008, Russia, and in March 2009, Azerbaijan granted permission for transit of supplies to Afghanistan. Uzbekistan's Navoi airport is used for transportation. U.S. military aircraft have overflight privileges for weapon transport. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense reported that 4,769 containers had been moved through Central Asia to Afghanistan by November 2009. Most containers entered from Uzbekistan, with some from Tajikistan. Some containers transited Caucasus countries, the Caspian Sea, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, while others transited Russia and Kazakhstan. The United States supported building a railroad from Uzbekistan to Afghanistan. Richard Holbrooke visited Central Asia to discuss regional assistance for stabilization operations in Afghanistan. Concerns have been raised about the US's reliance on the Northern Distribution Network affecting its criticism of participating governments for democracy and human rights abuses. In early September 2009, Taliban insurgents hijacked tanker trucks delivering fuel to NATO forces in Kunduz Province, Afghanistan. German forces called in a U.S. airstrike, resulting in civilian and insurgent casualties. Recent battles between Taliban insurgents and U.S., NATO, and Afghan government forces have occurred in Kunduz Province. U.S. peace and security assistance totaled $1.5 billion through FY2008, with Kazakhstan receiving the largest amount. U.S. peace and security assistance to the region declined after FY2002 but saw a boost in FY2007 and FY2008, reaching a high of $213 million. Kazakhstan received the largest amount of funding for Comprehensive Threat Reduction programs. Assistance included aid for coalition and stability operations, proliferation prevention, global threat reduction, law enforcement, and counter-narcotics efforts in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. In FY2007 and FY2008, U.S. peace and security assistance to Central Asia increased significantly to $213 million. Kazakhstan received the most funding for threat reduction programs, including aid for security training, counter-terrorism efforts, and stabilization operations in the region. Peace and security aid to Central Asia rose from 34% in FY2002 to 78% in FY2007, highlighting its importance in the region. The bulk of regional CTR and Department of Energy (DOE) aid for de-nuclearization, enhancing the \"chain of custody,\" and demilitarization in Kazakhstan. Aid includes material physical protection for Ulba Metallurgical Plant and decommissioning of the Aktau reactor. Agreements were signed in 1997 to study safe storage of highly-enriched uranium and plutonium. Enhanced aid for export controls and border security followed reports of arms smuggling. Kazakhstan also received CTR funds for various security measures. On May 19, 2009, CTR funds were used to remove highly enriched uranium from Kazakhstan, originally provided by Russia. The material was returned to Russia for storage. In 1999, an agreement was signed to secure and dismantle the Nukus chemical research facility in Uzbekistan. Additional aid supported Uzbek weapons scientists in peaceful research. The United States provided CTR assistance to Uzbekistan, including cleaning up a Soviet-era CBW testing site in the Aral Sea, transferring enriched uranium fuel to Russia, and transferring uranium from Uzbekistan to Russia. The National Defense Authorization Act allowed the president to waive prohibitions on CTR aid to former Soviet states for national security reasons. The President waived restrictions on CTR aid to Uzbekistan due to human rights issues, with the waiver authority extended indefinitely by the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2006. Senator Sam Nunn introduced a bill in the 110th Congress to eliminate restrictions on CTR aid, including human rights conditions. The lengthy process of making determinations and exercising waivers threatens the primary U.S. national security goal of combating WMD. Language similar to S. 198 was included in H.R. 1, Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007. Rising U.S. concern over drugs produced in Central Asia due to involvement of international organized groups. U.S. policy emphasizes the threat of rising terrorism, crime, corruption, and instability posed by illegal narcotics production in Central Asia. The FBI, DEA, and Customs provide counter-narcotics training in Central Asia as part of the Anti-Crime Training and Technical Assistance Program. U.S. aid supports the establishment of the Central Asian Regional Information and Coordination Center in Almaty to share narcotics trafficking intelligence among law enforcement agencies. The United States provided significant funding for the Central Asian Regional Information and Coordination Center (CARICC) in Almaty to enhance regional cooperation in combating drug trafficking. Bilateral programs with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan included providing counter-narcotics training and equipment for law enforcement agencies. In 2004, Kyrgyzstan established a Drug Control Agency with U.S. assistance. In 2007, US agencies trained Kyrgyz police, Customs Service, and Border Guards to form Mobile Interdiction Teams. In Tajikistan, a cooperation agreement on narcotics control was signed in 2003, with the DEA setting up an office in 2007. The U.S. Embassy provided an additional $9.43 million in funding in 2009. The U.S. Embassy signed an amendment to the 2003 agreement, providing $9.43 million for narcotics control in Tajikistan's Gorno Badakhshan region. The DEA has been working with UNODC in northern Afghanistan since 2007. Continued funding is deemed necessary as Tajikistan may not sustain the costs of ongoing programs. In Uzbekistan, U.S. assistance was given under a 2001 agreement on Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement Assistance. Training and assistance for investigating and prosecuting narcotics trafficking cases were provided under a 2001 U.S.-Uzbek Agreement. U.S. counter-narcotics cooperation with Uzbekistan declined after 2005, but programs like USAID's Drug Demand Reduction Project and provision of customs and border control equipment continued. Cooperation with USCENTCOM on counter-narcotics revived in FY2008. Emergency supplementals recommended funding for Central Asia and Afghanistan to counter drug trafficking from Afghanistan. The U.S. provided military assistance to Central Asia, including Foreign Military Financing (FMF), International Military Education and Training (IMET), and transfers of Excess Defense Articles (EDA). FMF aid supported military interoperability with NATO and included equipment and training. Aid to the region increased after September 11, 2001, reaching $55.7 million in FY2002. After a boost in FMF aid to Central Asia post-9/11, funding dropped significantly from $55.7 million in FY2002 to $2.55 million in FY2008. The IMET program provides English language training and promotes democratic civil-military relations. The CTFP focuses on special operations training for officers, and Central Asian officers also train in Germany to enhance security cooperation. In FY2004-2007, Central Asia received training assistance. IMET aid to Uzbekistan was blocked in FY2004 but restored in FY2010. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 allows procurement from countries aiding Afghanistan. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 allows procurement from countries aiding Afghanistan, including reimbursement for logistical support. Observers suggest this could be a new form of U.S. assistance to Central Asia, but some warn it may lead to increased corruption. The Secretary of State reported progress in meeting human rights commitments under the Declaration on Strategic Partnership and Cooperation with Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Despite reports of torture in Uzbekistan, progress in democratization and human rights was noted. Kazakhstan was also reported to be making progress in the following year. The State Department reported progress in respecting human rights in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, but withheld up to $18 million in aid to Uzbekistan due to lack of democratic reform. Funds were reprogrammed, with $8.5 million ultimately withheld. Gen. Richard Myers criticized the cutoff of military programs as \"shortsighted.\" In May 2005, Secretary of State Rice reported to Congress that Kazakhstan failed to improve its human rights record, but aid restrictions were waived for national security reasons. Uzbekistan did not show significant progress in human rights, so aid restrictions remained. In FY2006, H.R. 3057 introduced a condition for an international investigation of violence in Andijon. In May 2006, Rice reported that Kazakhstan still had not improved its human rights record, but aid restrictions were waived for national security reasons. In FY2008, aid restrictions on Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan were maintained due to lack of progress in human rights. Conditions were added for U.S. assistance to Kazakhstan based on human rights commitments. The Secretary of State could waive ineligibility for Uzbek officials linked to human rights violations for certain circumstances. Waivers were issued for Kazakhstan in FY2008 and FY2009. In FY2008 and FY2009, the State Department issued waivers for Kazakhstan but conditions remained for Uzbekistan limiting U.S. military ties. The Consolidated Appropriations for FY2010 retained provisions for both countries, with language excluding IMET from assistance restrictions. A cooperation plan for U.S.-Uzbekistan in 2010 included provisions for FMF and EDA subject to assistance restrictions. The State Department warns of terrorism risks in the region from groups like ETIM, IMU, Al Qaeda, and Hizb ut Tahrir (HT). The Peace Corps re-deployed personnel in Central Asia to foster pro-U.S. views among Islamic peoples after 9/11. U.S. military personnel in the region prioritize safety by staying on base and traveling in groups. The State Department advised caution in traveling to Turkmenistan after a coup attempt in 2002. Uzbekistan had no incidents of politically-motivated violence against U.S. personnel until the bombing of the U.S. embassy in 2004. The State Department advises against travel to certain areas in Tajikistan due to high risks of political violence and kidnapping. Kazakhstan is considered low risk for political violence but has seen economic protests. U.S. policies, such as the invasion of Iraq, may increase dangers to U.S. citizens in the region. An Uzbek court sentenced sixteen people for plotting against U.S. military targets in 2004. In November 2004, an Uzbek court sentenced sixteen people to 12-17 years in prison for planning to bomb the U.S. coalition airbase at Karshi-Khanabad. Kyrgyz officials also arrested individuals trained in Afghanistan and Pakistan for planning to bomb the U.S. Manas airbase. The outgoing U.S. Manas base commander thanked Kyrgyz authorities for thwarting three planned terrorist attacks. Corruption is a major obstacle for U.S. firms seeking to invest in Central Asian states, particularly in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. The State Department warns of increasing crime rates in all the states, with Tajikistan being particularly unsafe for Western investment. After September 11, 2001, U.S. embassies in Central Asia were on high alert due to terrorism threats. The U.S. Embassy in Uzbekistan faced danger after a suicide bombing in 2004, and in Kyrgyzstan, official travel was restricted due to terrorism threats. Tajikistan is considered unsafe for Western investment due to increasing crime rates. The U.S. Embassy in Tajikistan faced threats during the civil war and bombings in neighboring countries. Diplomatic staff were evacuated to Kazakhstan due to security concerns. Embassy personnel often travel in armored cars with bodyguards and face restrictions in certain areas. The embassy is deemed highly vulnerable to terrorism from groups like the IMU and Al Qaeda. The 2007 Crime and Safety Report warns of potential threats to U.S. commercial interests in Tajikistan from groups like the IMU and Al Qaeda. Security measures have been increased at the U.S. Embassy in Tajikistan. Pakistani police apprehended three Uighurs with plans of U.S. embassies in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing accused ETIM of collaborating with Al Qaeda to plan an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Kyrgyzstan. Warnings of possible future attacks against U.S. interests in Kyrgyzstan have been issued, leading to heightened security measures at the U.S. Embassy in Bishkek. In Bishkek, there is a heightened security posture. A U.S. military officer was allegedly kidnapped in Kyrgyzstan but later released. The 2007 Crime and Safety Report for Kazakhstan notes an increase in crime against U.S. diplomats and officials. Congress approved funding for diplomatic posts in Tajikistan and Afghanistan. New embassy facilities were built in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, and Astana, Kazakhstan. The U.S. Embassy in Bishkek has increased security measures due to warnings of potential attacks. In November 2006, a new embassy facility was dedicated in Astana. Congress has supported U.S. assistance for independence and reforms in Central Asia and other NIS through hearings, legislation, and aid conditions. Many policymakers argue for stronger ties with Central Asian states to influence democratization and human rights. The U.S. is in a strong position to influence democratization and human rights in Central Asia by providing aid and investment to alleviate social distress and prevent Russian or Chinese influence. Some argue for limited U.S. involvement, citing historical lack of interest and potential decreased importance if peace is established in Afghanistan. Some argue for limited U.S. involvement in Central Asia, advocating cooperation with Turkey and other partners to achieve goals of preventing strife, promoting democratization, and improving human rights. The consensus on fostering objectives like democratization, free markets, and responsible security policies exists, but there are differing views on the extent of U.S. involvement. The U.S. position to influence democratization and human rights in the region through aid and investment is emphasized, especially to counter Russian or Chinese influence. Some analysts argue for limited U.S. involvement in Central Asia due to concerns about civil conflict, terrorism, and risks to U.S. personnel. They suggest withdrawing military personnel and relying on rapid deployments from bases outside the region. Many argue for continued U.S. support in Central Asia to prevent terrorism and instability, maintain supply routes for Afghanistan and Pakistan, and prevent illicit acquisition of nuclear materials by terrorist groups. Senator Sam Brownback introduced \"Silk Road\" legislation in Congress to emphasize democratization, free markets, and energy development in Central Asia and South Caucasus to counter global forces and bolster independence and pro-Western orientations. The Silk Road language, enacted in H.R. 3194 (Istook) and signed into law on November 29, 1999 (P.L. 106-113), calls for enhanced policy and aid to support conflict amelioration, humanitarian needs, economic development, transport, border controls, democracy, and civil societies in South Caucasian and Central Asian states. U.S. policymakers believe aid and investment strengthen independence and prevent dominance by Russia, Iran, and China. Concerns exist about a more authoritarian Russia reabsorbing Central Asia, but some dismiss this due to internal issues in Russia. Close monitoring of Russian activities is endorsed. Some observers endorse close monitoring of Russian activities in Central Asia to prevent dominance by Russia, Iran, and China. U.S. policy aims to maximize the independence of Central Asian states and protect U.S. interests, which may align with other outside states' interests in stability and improved transport in the region. However, conflicts with Russia, Iran, or China could lead to compromises or deadlock. The U.S. interest in restricting Iran's financial ability to sponsor international terrorism may conflict with Central Asian-Iranian energy cooperation. U.S.-Iranian rapprochement could lead to a less hostile Iranian attitude towards U.S. regional investment. Poor U.S.-Iranian relations and questions about Russia's role influenced U.S. support for the BTC pipeline and the SCP. The United States and Russia established a working group on Afghanistan in June 2000, gaining importance after September 11, 2001. The U.S. and Russia established a working group on Afghanistan in June 2000, gaining importance after September 11, 2001. Headed by Richard Armitage and Vyacheslav Trubnikov, it facilitated Russian acquiescence to U.S. military use in Central Asia. The group's mandate expanded to cover counter-terrorism in Central Asia, the South Caucasus, and South Asia. Accomplishments included providing Russian military materiel to the Afghanistan National Army and supporting the NATO-Russia Council Counternarcotics project. OSCE projects in Afghanistan and Central Asia for customs and borders officials training and mentoring; agreement to expedite approval of framework documents for Central Asia Regional Information Coordination Center. Cooperation affected by 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict. Counter-Terrorism Working Group retained by Obama Administration as part of U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission. State Department Coordinator for Counterterrorism met with Special Presidential Representative to strengthen international counterterrorism norms, increase capacity building, counter violent extremism, improve transportation security, and discuss Afghanistan. Oil exports from Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan significant. Oil exports from Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan accounted for 2.1% of world oil exports and 7.4% of gas exports in 2007-2008. These exports are projected to increase, making these countries more significant as world suppliers. The U.S. has shown cooperation with Russia in developing Caspian oil resources, but also supported the construction of the BTC oil pipeline and SCP for gas as a hedge against uncooperative Russia. Developing energy resources in the region is seen as beneficial for regional stability and conflict resolution. The U.S. aims to encourage oil and gas development in the Caspian region, support energy security in Europe, and assist Caspian countries in expanding export routes. The U.S. plays a supporting role in implementing these goals through various initiatives like the U.S.-EU Energy Council and the U.S.-Russia Energy Working Group. The U.S. supports diversifying supply routes to Europe through projects like the Turkey-Greece-Italy gas pipeline, Nabucco gas pipeline, and Kazakhstan's oil shipments through the South Caucasus. They urge agreements for gas transit from Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Iraq. The U.S. also calls for European energy integration and development of other supply sources like gas from North Africa and LNG from Qatar and Nigeria. They are not opposed to Russia's pipeline projects but focus on diversified sources and routes. Critics question the economic viability of various pipeline routes in the region, doubting their importance to U.S. security. Some argue that energy development neglects broader economic reforms needed in the region. Analysts like Amy Jaffe suggest that the risks of enhanced U.S. presence in Caspian energy may not be worth it. The U.S. policy opposition to energy routes involving Iran may lead Central Asian states to rely on transit routes through Russia and China. The events of September 11, 2001, changed the U.S. security relationship with Central Asia, as the region supported anti-terrorism efforts in Afghanistan. The question remains on how the region will be viewed if Afghanistan stabilizes, with some advocating for maintaining the security relationship due to past Soviet-era weapons of mass destruction in Central Asia. The U.S. policy opposes energy routes involving Iran, potentially leading Central Asian states to rely on transit routes through Russia and China. The events of September 11, 2001, changed the U.S. security relationship with Central Asia, as the region supported anti-terrorism efforts in Afghanistan. Concerns arise about the region's future stability post-Afghanistan, with arguments for maintaining security relationships due to past Soviet-era weapons of mass destruction. Additionally, there are discussions on the potential risks of research and development facilities falling into the hands of terrorist states or groups, and the importance of military education and training programs in fostering professional military and democratic civil-military relations. The multinational training programs through PFP aim to encourage regional military cooperation. As Iran enhances its military capabilities, Central Asian states may seek closer ties with the United States as a counterbalance. The U.S. faces a dilemma in balancing its proclaimed vital interests in the region with military basing arrangements and deployments in Afghanistan. The U.S. faces uncertainty in military basing arrangements in Central Asia, leading to the region seeking long-term security ties elsewhere. The debate on partnering with Uzbekistan or Kazakhstan highlights strategic importance and resources. Uzbekistan's central location and authoritarian government raise concerns about stability, while Kazakhstan's vast territory and resources are emphasized. After the U.S. faced uncertainty in military basing arrangements in Central Asia, there was a debate on partnering with Uzbekistan or Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan's long border with Russia may lead to continued close security ties with Russia. Critics argue for assisting states in bolstering counter-terrorism capabilities instead of formal security guarantees. Increased U.S. engagement in the region may not quickly lead to free market democracies and could fuel anti-American Islamic extremism. The former Bush Administration's emphasis on democratization in Central Asia led to tensions with Uzbekistan and the loss of U.S. military access to K2. Critics argued that focusing on both democratization and security ties was counterproductive. The United States should have engaged with Central Asian states to maintain security relationships and encourage gradual political change, rather than emphasizing democratization and security simultaneously. Critics of the former Bush Administration's approach warned that supporting authoritarian leaders in the region could fuel Islamic fundamentalism. Observers recommended reducing aid to repressive governments violating human rights, prioritizing support for grass-roots democracy and human rights organizations in Central Asia. Concerns over Russian influence in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan were highlighted, with Tajikistan relying on Russian assistance for stability. After September 11, 2001, Uzbekistan reaffirmed its assertive policy by granting support to the U.S.-led coalition, prompting Russia to allow increased coalition presence in the region. Russia's behavior in Central Asia is influenced by its domestic politics, but it will maintain economic and other influence in the region due to historical ties. Russia permitted increased coalition presence in Central Asia to combat the Taliban, citing interests in boosting ties to the West and regaining influence in post-Taliban Afghanistan. Russian officials emphasized strategic security, economic ties, and concerns over the treatment of ethnic Russians in the region. They quickly sent military equipment and advisors to assist the Northern Alliance in attacks on the Taliban, cooperating with Central Asia in supporting U.S. and coalition efforts. President Putin acceded to cooperation between these states and the United States, focusing on strategic concerns such as drug trafficking and regional stability. Russia's economic decline in the 1990s led to a reduction in its security presence in Central Asia. Former President Putin and current President Medvedev may have reversed this trend, with Russian border forces largely phased out in Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan. Uzbekistan temporarily withdrew from the CSTO in 1999, citing ineffectiveness. Russia justified a military base accord with Tajikistan in 1999 due to the Islamic extremist threat to the CIS. In 2000, Russia approved a \"national security concept\" citing foreign efforts to weaken its position in Central Asia as a security threat. They called for the creation of rapid reaction forces in Central Asia to combat terrorism from Afghanistan. A Central Asian Rapid Deployment Force was approved in 2001, composed of troops from Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. This initiative aimed to protect Russian regional influence against U.S. and NATO anti-terrorism efforts. Russia's efforts to protect regional influence in Central Asia against U.S. and NATO anti-terrorism moves included the creation of a Central Asian Rapid Deployment Force. Despite threats from the Taliban and the establishment of a regional branch of the CIS Anti-Terrorism Center in Kyrgyzstan, the effectiveness of these measures was limited. Collaboration between the U.S. and Russia on Afghan-related terrorism prior to September 11, 2001, paved the way for Russian and Central Asian support to the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan. Russia increased its troop presence in Tajikistan by 1,500 after September 11, 2001. They also signed military accords with Kyrgyzstan, allowing the use of Kant airfield as a base for the Central Asian Rapid Deployment Force. This marked a major re-deployment of Russian forces into the country, with the intention of combating terrorism and monitoring weapons of mass destruction proliferation. Russia increased its troop presence in Tajikistan after September 11, 2001, and signed military accords with Kyrgyzstan to use Kant airfield as a base for monitoring weapons of mass destruction. This deployment was partially to counter U.S. military influence in the region and support for the closure of U.S.-led coalition bases in Central Asia. Additionally, Russia signed a Treaty on Allied Relations with Uzbekistan in 2005, similar to provisions in the CSTO, for mutual defense consultations in case of a threat. Uzbekistan rejoined the CSTO in 2006. In 2009, Kyrgyz President Bakiyev announced the closure of the U.S. Manas airbase in Moscow, citing inadequate compensation and the completion of counter-terrorism operations in Afghanistan. Russian President Medvedev offered financial assistance to Kyrgyzstan in exchange for closing the base, including a $1.7 billion loan for infrastructure projects. Many saw this as a quid pro quo arrangement. Russia's economic policy in Central Asia involves contradictory actions, including cutting off subsidies and demanding repayment of debts. They have exchanged debt for equity in energy and military industries in the region. Russia opposes US and Western private investment, insisting on shared Caspian Sea resources and oil pipeline routes through Russian territory. Russia's economic policy in Central Asia involves contradictory actions, including cutting off subsidies and demanding repayment of debts. They have exchanged debt for equity in energy and military industries in the region. Russia opposes US and Western private investment, insisting on shared Caspian Sea resources and oil pipeline routes through Russian territory. Russian energy firms have partnered with U.S. and Western firms in regional oil and gas development consortiums, but Russia continues to lobby for pipeline routes through its territory. Former President Putin called for a Eurasian Gas Alliance to counter U.S. energy influence in the region. Kazakhstan is an observer state in the International Gas Exporter Organization, formed in 2008 with Russia's leadership. Some Russians argue that enhanced cooperation with U.S. and Western private investment would best serve Russian interests. Some Russians argue that enhanced cooperation with U.S. and Western private investment would best serve Russian national interests and its companies in Central Asia. Russia is wary of growing Chinese economic influence in the region, but the Central Asian states have tried to resist or modify various Russian policies viewed as diluting their sovereignty. Karimov and Nazarbayev have criticized Russian tendencies in treating Central Asia. Critics view Russian treatment of Central Asia as unequal, with concerns about the safety of Russians in the region serving as a political tool for advocating reintegration of former Russian lands. Ethnic Russians in Central Asia face employment and discriminatory policies, leading to a decline in their population. The stability of Afghanistan is a major concern for Central Asia, China, and Russia, with a focus on drug exports and Islamic extremism. Central Asia's leaders are concerned about drug smuggling and Islamic extremism from Afghanistan, as historical trade routes facilitate the movement of contraband to Russian and European markets. They are worried about Islamic extremists using bases in Afghanistan, like the Taliban did for groups like the IMU and Osama Bin Laden. There are also concerns about the fate of Central Asian ethnic groups in northern Afghanistan, particularly the 6.2 million ethnic Tajiks and 1.5 million ethnic Uzbeks. Karimov has supported ethnic Uzbek paramilitary leader Abdul-ul-Rashid. Uzbekistan's Karimov supported ethnic Uzbek paramilitary leader Dostum in Afghanistan, who later helped lead Northern Alliance forces to victory post-9/11. Iran and Tajikistan supported ethnic Tajik Masood, who was killed by Al Qaeda. Turkmenistan had concerns about ethnic Turkmen in Afghanistan and hoped for energy pipelines. Tajikistan was challenged by the Taliban's growing power. The Taliban's increasing influence in Afghanistan poses a threat to neighboring countries like Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Iran and Uzbekistan supported different sides in the Tajik civil war but opposed the Taliban. Tajikistan's instability led to closer ties with Russia, causing tension with Uzbekistan and the Taliban. Central Asian states hope for increased trade opportunities if Afghanistan stabilizes, including a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to Pakistan. The issue of drug production and trafficking in Afghanistan remains a concern. The problems of drug production in Afghanistan and trafficking through Central Asia have increased due to the weak Afghan government. Regional stability efforts led to a \"Declaration of Good Neighborly Relations\" signed by Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, China, Iran, and Pakistan in Kabul in December 2002. Russia's influence in Afghanistan is facilitated by its basing arrangement with Tajikistan, but its favored warlords were excluded from the new Karzai government in December 2004. China's objectives in Central Asia include ensuring border security, non-belligerent neighbors, and access to trade and natural resources. In April 1996, presidents of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan signed a treaty with China pledging border demilitarization and not supporting separatists. China faces criticism for human rights abuses against Uighurs. In April 1997, a follow-on treaty demilitarized the former Soviet border with China. In May 2001, Uzbekistan joined to form the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) for common antiterrorist actions. China's involvement in Central Asia through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) aims to combat terrorism and extremism. The SCO serves as a platform for China to advance its regional goals and counter U.S. influence. Despite some cooperation with the U.S., China benefits from the U.S.-led actions in Afghanistan against extremist groups that threaten its interests. However, the U.S. presence in Central Asia poses a challenge to China's aspirations. China's economic influence in Central Asia is growing, with trade exceeding $1 billion annually by the late 1990s. Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have built strong relations with China, cooperating on border delineation, infrastructure projects, and trade. China's construction of oil and gas pipelines in the region further solidifies its economic presence. However, concerns exist among Central Asian officials regarding Chinese intentions and potential tensions. Some Central Asian states are concerned about Chinese intentions and tensions in Xinjiang. Issues include Chinese traders, immigrants, water resources, and crackdown on dissidence. Kazakhstan worries about Uighur separatism spreading to its territory. China's relations with Tajikistan improved with a border agreement in 2002. China's interest in Central Asia's energy resources is also a factor. China's interest in Central Asia's energy resources led to Kazakhstan granting CNPC production rights in 1997. CNPC later purchased PetroKazakhstan in 2005, prompting the Kazakh government to pass a law giving it preemptive rights over such transfers. China acquired PetroKazakhstan in 2005, leading to Kazakhstan transferring shares to KazMunaigaz and giving up control of the Shymkent refinery. A 600-mile oil pipeline was completed in 2006, connecting Atasu to Xinjiang. Xinjiang reported importing 92 million barrels of oil through the pipeline in two years. CITIC Group acquired Kazakh oil assets from Nations Energy Company to gain access to western Kazakhstan's oil reserves. CITIC Group acquired Kazakh oil assets from Nations Energy Company for $1.91 billion in 2006, gaining rights to develop the Karajanbas oil and gas field near Aqtau on the Caspian Sea until 2020. Concerns were raised in Kazakhstan about China acquiring national energy assets, leading to a concession giving KazMunaiGaz a 50% stake in the operating company. China also provided financial support to Turkmenistan's energy industry in the late 1990s and 2003. In 2006, then-President Niyazov of Turkmenistan visited China to sign agreements for a gas pipeline exporting 30 billion cubic meters of gas. China also pledged new loans and signed a service contract for drilling at the Gunorta Eloten oil and gas field. Estimates suggest the field may hold 247 trillion cubic feet of gas. In 2007, a gas sales agreement was signed for the supply of 1.1 trillion cubic feet of gas per year until 2038. CNPC signed a production sharing agreement with Turkmenistan for the Bagtyyarlyk area. Iran has limited economic interests in Central Asia and good ties with Turkmenistan. Kazakhstan's relations with Iran have improved in recent years. Iran's relations with Central Asian countries have been complex. Kazakhstan seeks a median-line delineation of Caspian Sea borders with Iran, offering energy pipelines and trade incentives. Uzbek-Iranian relations have been strained due to alleged harboring of IMU elements by Iran, but improved after 2003 with cooperation on rebuilding projects in Afghanistan. The U.S. military presence in the region post-9/11 has challenged Iran's security interests. Iran has conflicting relations with the U.S. and its allies, as they view the U.S.-backed BTC pipeline and military presence in the region as anti-Iranian efforts. Iran and Russia shared interests in hindering Western influence in the Caspian region during the 1990s. Iran's stance on the Caspian Sea's status has isolated them, leading to opposition from the U.S. and restraining Kazakhstan's interests in the region. Turkey's strategic interests in enhancing economic and security relations with South Caucasian and Central Asian states along the \"Silk Road\" to bolster access to regional oil and gas. Turkey's role as an energy conduit would also increase its influence and appeal as a potential EU member. Turkey aims to reduce ethnic conflict in the Caspian region to support energy development, despite internal political struggles between secularists and Islamic forces. Turkey has been focused on its economic and ethnic issues, with authoritarian leaders in Central Asia hesitant to adopt the \"Turkish model\" of free markets and democracy. In 2006, Turkey revived meetings of Turkic heads of state, attended by leaders from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan. In 2009, a Turkic-speaking Countries Cooperation Council was established, similar to the CIS or Arab League, with sub-groups like a Foreign Ministers Council and a secretariat in Istanbul. In 2009, a Turkic academy, secretariat in Istanbul, and parliamentary liaison headquarters in Baku were established. Turkey and Russia improved ties, with agreements on strategic cooperation and permitting the construction of Russia's South Stream gas pipeline. During Prime Minister Erdogan's visit to Moscow in January 2010, the formation of a strategic council was discussed, with plans for President Medvedev to establish it during a mid-2010 visit to Istanbul. Prime Minister Putin urged Turkey not to link the settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict over Nagorno Karabakh to protocols signed by Armenia and Turkey. The South Caucasus Central Asia transport corridor is crucial for economic security, with concerns from authoritarian Central Asian leaders about democratization in Georgia inspiring change. Central Asian leaders are worried that democratization in Georgia could spark dissent against their rule."
