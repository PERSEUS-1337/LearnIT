Geological features of exceptional value to illustrate this phenomenon are present on various types of land in the region. In 2001, a study team endorsed the establishment of an Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail. The Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail was designated to recognize the national significance of the cataclysmic floods at the end of the last Ice Age in the northwest region of the United States. Its purpose is to enable the public to view, experience, and learn about the features and story of the floods through collaborative efforts of public and private entities in Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. The Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail recognizes cataclysmic floods in the northwest US during the last Ice Age. It allows public access to learn about the floods through collaborative efforts in Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. The Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail is designated to showcase the significant natural and cultural features of the Ice Age floods. The trail follows public roads and highways, with the route depicted on a map that can be revised by the Secretary. The map for the Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail must be available for public inspection at National Park Service offices. SEC. 5. ADMINISTRATION.
