This report examines DOD's contract obligations, what is being purchased, and where the money is being spent. It also assesses the reliability of the data for policy development and government operations analysis. In FY2017, the U.S. federal government obligated $507 billion for contracts for goods, services, and research and development, equal to approximately 13% of total federal budget outlays. In FY2017, the U.S. federal government obligated $507 billion for contracts, with the Department of Defense (DOD) spending $320 billion on federal contracts, equal to 8% of all federal spending. DOD's contract obligations increased from $189 billion in FY2000 to $320 billion in FY2017, with fluctuations in spending over the years. Contract obligations from FY2008 to FY2017 followed a trend of rapid increases and sharp cuts, potentially risking long-term harm due to short-term budget decisions aimed at meeting budget caps. The Budget Control Act imposed significant spending cuts on the Department of Defense, leading to unplanned reductions in spending. The Department of Defense (DOD) could benefit from a more gradual reduction in spending or additional funding in specific budget categories to make more considered choices and minimize long-term effects of budget cuts. DOD's contract spending fluctuates, making budgeting challenging compared to the rest of the federal government. In FY2017, DOD allocated 41% of contract obligations to services, 51% to goods, and 8% to research and development (R&D). Over the years, DOD has decreased its share of contracting dollars for R&D from 17% in FY1999 to 8% in FY2017. Despite increased spending on R&D from FY2000 to FY2007, DOD obligated less money on R&D contracts in FY2017 ($25 billion) than it invested more than 15 years earlier ($28 billion in FY2000). Research and Development contracting is but a portion of overall DOD investment in developing technology, with more than half of DOD's basic research budget spent at universities. The budget for R&D at universities is a major contribution in science and technology. Total RDT&E outlays increased by 67% from FY1999 to FY2009, then dropped by 24% from FY2009 to FY2017. DOD relies on contractors for global operations, with obligations divided by geographic region and domestic vs. overseas spending. In FY2017, DOD contract obligations are categorized by place of performance, not by the DOD component that signed the contract. For example, most contracts were performed in NORTHCOM. In FY2017, DOD contract obligations decreased for overseas contracts, primarily due to drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan. The share of DOD contract obligations performed in the United States increased to 93%, the highest percentage since FY2002. In FY2017, DOD contract obligations for work performed overseas were mainly directed to CENTCOM (48%), EUCOM (26%), INDOPACOM (20%), NORTHCOM (3%), AFRICOM (2%), and SOUTHCOM (1%). There has been a shift in contracting dollars allocation, with a decrease in CENTCOM and EUCOM obligations since FY2008, while INDOPACOM and AFRICOM funding has increased, aligning with the 2018 National Military Strategy. The 2018 National Military Strategy prioritizes long-term strategic competitions with China and Russia, emphasizing the need for increased investment. DOD's share of government obligations for contracts performed abroad has decreased, while Department of State and USAID obligations have increased. Analysts suggest that DOD takes on civilian missions due to its larger budget and workforce, advocating for more resources to be invested in civilian agencies. In 2010, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee highlighted the fragmented civilian capacity of the U.S. Government for conflict prevention and post-conflict stabilization. Analysts argue for a whole-of-government approach involving DOD, Department of State, USAID, and government contractors to achieve foreign policy goals. Contract obligations since FY2000 suggest a shift towards this approach. The GAO, CRS, and other organizations have concerns about the accuracy of procurement data from the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). FPDS is used to measure the impact of federal contracting on the economy and meet transparency requirements. Congress, agencies, analysts, and the public rely on FPDS for information. FPDS is crucial for understanding federal spending and making informed policy decisions. Data reliability is essential for accurate analysis and oversight. Reliable information is necessary for planning contracts and tracking taxpayer dollars. The Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) is vital for tracking how tax dollars are spent. If the data in FPDS is unreliable, it can lead to ineffective policy decisions and wastage of resources. Federal agencies are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the information in the database. FPDS was established in 1974 to collect and disseminate procurement data to promote transparency and efficiency in government spending. The Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) was established in 1974 to track procurement data and promote transparency in government spending. In 1978, the Department of Defense was designated as the executive agent to operate FPDS, which is now managed by the GSA. FPDS is the only government-wide system containing federal procurement data used by resources like USASpending.gov. Concerns about data accuracy led to the introduction of the Federal Procurement Data System-Next. The Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) was updated to FPDS-Next Generation in 2003 to improve data accuracy and reliability. Despite the system update, GAO found that FPDS-NG still contains inaccurate data, as reported in a 2012 GAO report. The 2012 GAO report highlighted data quality issues with FPDS-NG, emphasizing the need for better data to make strategic workforce decisions. The 2015 Inspector General report also noted the Department of Commerce's need to improve data accuracy in FPDS-NG. Agencies are required to validate their data annually, with DOD components submitting annual certifications of data accuracy to DPAP. The reliability of data in FPDS-NG has raised concerns, leading analysts to use it for broad trends and rough estimations. Limitations include not providing contractor FTEs per service, requiring activity identification, or all services procured. Despite data errors, officials aim to improve data integrity in the system. In early 2016, discrepancies in reported contract obligations were noted in FPDS, specifically related to public-private competitions under OMB Circular A-76. Despite a prohibition on new competitions, FPDS continued to report a large number of contracts in this category. DOD attributed these errors to coding mistakes in FPDS, with A-76 obligations being restated to approximately $150 million per year from FY2013 to FY2015. FPDS data, despite limitations, is valuable for tracking government procurement trends. Product and service codes are used to categorize federal government purchases. Understanding data limitations can help policymakers use FPDS data effectively in decision-making. The nine product codes are represented by numbers 1-9, while service codes are represented by a single letter, with R&D represented by \"A.\" Changes in DOD contract obligations by PSC from FY2008-FY2015 are depicted in Figure B-1. PSCs for services have descriptions, but those for products do not. Without a clear system for categorizing products, sorting data is limited in value. For more details on product categories, refer to the notes in Figure B-1 Appendix C. Top 20 Foreign Countries Where DOD Obligates Contracting Dollars."
