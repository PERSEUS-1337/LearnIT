It includes rules for actions under false claims provisions based on claims submitted under certain health care programs. The \"Health Care Claims Guidance Act\" adds rules for actions under false claims provisions related to federally funded health care programs. It specifies that actions must only be brought if damages to the government are a material amount. The \"Health Care Claims Guidance Act\" prohibits actions under false claims provisions for claims submitted in reliance on erroneous information from a Federal agency or in compliance with a model compliance plan issued by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The \"Health Care Claims Guidance Act\" prohibits false claims actions for claims submitted to federally funded health care programs, with a higher standard of proof required. The Act does not limit the Government's authority to recover damages for such claims. The \"Health Care Claims Guidance Act\" defines damages as overpayments made by the government in federally funded health care programs. Damages are considered material if they exceed a specified proportion. The \"Health Care Claims Guidance Act\" specifies that damages in federally funded health care programs are considered material if they exceed a certain proportion, based on the definition of 'material' by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The \"Health Care Claims Guidance Act\" states that damages for multiple claims can only be aggregated if they are part of a related pattern of acts or omissions by a person. The proportion of aggregated damages is determined by comparing them to the total amounts of claims submitted to federally funded health care programs in the same calendar years. The amendment made by subsection (a) regarding actions under subchapter III of chapter 37 of title 31, United States Code, applies to claims submitted before, on, and after the enactment of this Act."
