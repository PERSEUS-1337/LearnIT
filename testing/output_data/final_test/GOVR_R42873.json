    "content": "In 1996, Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA, P.L. 104-199) to define and protect the institution of marriage. DOMA allows states to refuse recognition of same-sex marriages and limits federal recognition of these partnerships. Section 3 of DOMA defines marriage as between one man and one woman and spouse as a person of the opposite sex who is a husband. The federal government provides benefits to its workforce, including health care, life insurance, pensions, and paid time off. Federal employees can extend certain benefits to their spouses, but DOMA prohibits spousal benefits for same-sex partners. However, benefits can be extended to partners in same-sex relationships in some cases. President Obama directed agencies to explore extending benefits to federal employees in same-sex domestic partnerships or marriages. President Obama directed federal agencies to review benefits offered to opposite-sex partners of federal employees, leading to the extension of specific benefits to same-sex partners. This included benefits where the term spouse was not specified in the authorizing language. The memorandum extended certain childcare and sick leave benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees, including the authority to take unpaid leave when a partner or partner's child is ill. Two bills were introduced in Congress to allow federal employees to provide benefits to their same-sex partners. On May 16, 2012, S. 1910 and H.R. 3485 were introduced in Congress to provide benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees. Congress has the authority to determine which benefits should be available to same-sex partners. The federal government provides benefits to federal employees, including health insurance, dental and vision benefits, retirement plans, and leave. DOMA restricts benefits to opposite-sex spouses of federal employees. DOMA prohibits federal spousal benefits for same-sex partners of federal employees, defining spouse as opposite-sex only. It aims to protect states' rights on same-sex marriage and benefits eligibility, anticipating legal issues. H.R. 3396 lays down clear rules for resolving federal benefits for married couples, preserving each State's policy decision-making. The federal government's interests in drafting DOMA include defending traditional marriage, morality, state sovereignty, and preserving government resources by promoting marriage through material benefits. While not exhaustively examined, federal benefits for married couples impose fiscal obligations on the government. For example, survivorship benefits for veterans' spouses cost money. Allowing same-sex marriage could increase these costs, preserving government resources by denying federal recognition to such marriages. Some federal employee benefits are explicitly for spouses, while others are not. The Obama Administration has extended benefits to spouses. The Obama Administration has extended benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees, arguing it is within the parameters of existing law. Some organizations, like the Family Research Council, believe this could be costly and undermine the federal definition of marriage. President Obama issued memoranda directing agencies to offer specific benefits to domestic partners of federal employees. Obama released a memorandum directing executive departments and agencies to review existing employee benefits for same-sex partners. He stated that the Administration was not authorized by Federal law to provide same-sex couples with the same benefits as heterosexual married couples. The President emphasized the need for the Federal Government to offer benefits to same-sex partners to compete for talented employees. The Obama administration directed agencies to review benefits for same-sex partners to determine authority to extend benefits. Agencies had 90 days to complete reviews, with guidance on compliance with anti-discrimination policies. OPM and DOJ recommended extending federal benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees. President Obama released a memorandum detailing the recommended benefits on June 2, 2010. Obama released a memorandum detailing benefits recommended by OPM and DOJ for extension to same-sex partners, including insurable interest in survivor annuities, elimination of affidavit requirement for financial dependency, and eligibility for unpaid leave for family-related reasons. The memorandum issued by Obama extended benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees, including travel and relocation payments, access to credit unions and fitness facilities, and participation in counseling services. Gay rights groups had a lukewarm reaction to the extension of these benefits. The Obama Administration extended benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees, including travel, relocation payments, access to credit unions, fitness facilities, and counseling services. Some benefits can be transferred to spouses or designated persons, with some explicitly authorized for spouses and others designated by the employee. Table 1 summarizes benefits available to federal employees and their spouses, indicating whether they are also available to same-sex partners. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) offers health benefits to federal employees and their eligible family members. The program covers nearly 300 different health care plans, with costs shared between the government and the employee. However, same-sex domestic partners of federal employees and their children are not eligible to enroll in FEHBP. Federal employees' children can enroll in FEHBP, but same-sex partners are not eligible. The law defines family members as a spouse and unmarried dependent child under age 22. Federal employees can also opt for FEDVIP, which offers vision and dental benefits with the enrollee covering all premium costs. Family members can also receive FEDVIP benefits, with eligibility rules similar to FEHBP. Federal employees may extend FEDVIP benefits to family members, with eligibility rules identical to FEHBP regulations. The Enhanced Dental Benefits and Enhanced Vision Benefits programs are not extended to same-sex partners of federal employees eligible for the benefits. If disabled while performing their job, employees can receive up to $100,000 in compensation under FECA. In the case of death, payment goes to the deceased employee's spouse, children, parents, or siblings, but not to the same-sex partner. Certain federal benefits are explicitly extended to same-sex partners of federal employees or allow employees to designate same-sex partners as beneficiaries. Under the Family and Medical Leave Act, federal employees can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for various reasons, including caring for a spouse, child, or parent. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows federal employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for reasons such as caring for a foster child, an ailing spouse, child, or parent, or due to the employee's own illness. However, FMLA regulations explicitly define spouse as a legal union between one man and one woman, excluding same-sex domestic partners from using FMLA leave. The Department of Labor (DOL) interpreted the FMLA to allow employees in same-sex partnerships to use FMLA-approved leave to care for their partner's child. This interpretation applies to all employees in both public and private sectors. Additionally, OPM released a final rule clarifying definitions of family members for eligibility for various types of leave. The Department of Labor (DOL) and OPM have expanded the definition of \"family member\" for FMLA-approved leave to include grandparents, grandchildren, domestic partners, and their parents. The new regulation also includes criteria for same-sex partners to be eligible for leave benefits. The regulation, effective June 14, 2010, extends leave benefits to same-sex and opposite-sex partnerships recognized by a government entity. Federal employees can designate any individual, including a same-sex partner, as a beneficiary for benefits like life insurance through the SF 2823 form. Federal employees can designate a beneficiary for life insurance benefits using the SF 2823 form. If no beneficiary is designated, the benefit would go to the spouse as per federal law. However, same-sex domestic partners may not qualify as a widow or widower under DOMA. Federal employees with permanent appointments are eligible for retirement benefits under CSRS or FERS. CSRS covers employees hired before January 1, 1984, while FERS covers those hired after. Both plans offer a defined benefit pension and access to the Thrift Savings Plan. Workers receive a monthly retirement annuity for life. Federal employees under CSRS or FERS receive a monthly retirement annuity based on years of service and salary. CSRS has a higher accrual rate than FERS. Spouses may receive benefits if the worker dies during or after federal service. Surviving spouses may be entitled to a survivor's benefit. When a married federal worker retires, the couple receives a monthly retirement benefit for the longer of the worker or spouse's lifetime. The benefit is reduced to account for the longer payment period. Spousal benefit is the default option, defined without gender reference in Title 5 of the U.S. Code. Marriage for federal retirement benefits is recognized based on the jurisdiction's law. Under both FERS and CSRS, a federal employee can designate anyone, including a same-sex partner, as a beneficiary for a lump-sum refund of retirement contributions. If no survivor benefit is payable and no beneficiary is designated, the contributions may be returned. If a survivor benefit is payable and no beneficiary is designated, contributions will be distributed based on order of precedence: widow/widower, children, parents, executor/administrator of estate, or next of kin. A federal employee cannot name a domestic partner as a beneficiary, but can elect an Insurable Interest Annuity for a financially dependent individual at the time of non-disability retirement. The Insurable Interest Annuity (IIA) must be elected at the time of retirement, with the employee providing affidavits to justify the beneficiary's potential loss of financial support. The cost of an IIA can result in a reduction of the retirement annuity, ranging from 10% to 40% based on the age difference between the employee and beneficiary. Federal employees covered by FERS can contribute to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) with agency matching contributions, while those covered by CSRS do not receive matching contributions. Contributions to TSP are tax-exempt, with taxes paid upon withdrawal in retirement. A federal employee can name anyone, including a domestic partner, as the beneficiary under the TSP. Spouses who are beneficiaries of a deceased TSP participant with an account of $200 or more will have a beneficiary participant account automatically invested in the Government Securities Investment (G) Fund. Non-spouse beneficiaries cannot retain a TSP account and will receive the funds directly or to an inherited IRA. If an employee does not designate beneficiaries under FERS, CSRS, or TSP, the funds will be distributed accordingly. If an employee does not designate beneficiaries under FERS, CSRS, or TSP, the funds will be distributed based on the order of precedence, bypassing a same-sex partner unless specifically designated. Federal employees can opt into the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program (FLTCIP) for medical services for chronic conditions. Employees can opt into the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program (FLTCIP) for medical services for chronic conditions. Qualifying federal employees, members of the uniformed services, federal annuitants, and their family members are eligible to enroll in FLTCIP, including same-sex domestic partners of eligible federal employees and annuitants. As of July 1, 2010, same-sex partners of federal employees became eligible for FLTCIP benefits. Opposite-sex domestic partners were not included in the eligibility criteria due to the option of obtaining eligibility through marriage. Bills introduced in the 112th Congress aimed to provide benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees. Senator Joe Lieberman and Senator Susan Collins introduced S. 1910, the Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act of 2011, to provide benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees. Representative Tammy Baldwin introduced a companion bill, H.R. 3485. The bills aimed to extend benefits such as health insurance, dental, and vision benefits. S. 1910 was favorably reported by the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, but no further action was taken on the bills. The benefits proposed in S. 1910 for same-sex domestic partners of federal employees included health insurance, dental and vision benefits, retirement plans, family leave, life insurance, long-term care insurance, work injury compensation, disability benefits, and travel-related benefits. In a federal benefit program, a domestic partner would need to file an affidavit of eligibility with OPM, attesting to being in a committed domestic partnership with specific conditions such as sharing a common residence, being mentally competent, sharing financial obligations, and not being married to anyone else. The bills S. 1910 and H.R. 3485 proposed that domestic partners of federal employees would be subject to ethical standards, financial disclosures, and conflict of interest requirements. They would also need to file a statement of dissolution within 30 days of the partner's death or relationship dissolution, with penalties for violating legal obligations. Benefits would be provided to the living partner as if they were a widow or widower. The bills S. 1910 and H.R. 3485 proposed benefits for domestic partners of federal employees, similar to those of widows or widowers. Former partners and children would also be entitled to benefits. No bills in the 113th Congress sought to rescind these benefits. Congress may consider potential policy changes related to extending health and other benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees. The Obama Administration supports this extension of benefits, while current policies do not provide benefits like health care, dental care, and eye care to same-sex partners. DOMA defines spouse as a person of the opposite sex, but the Administration argues its actions are within existing laws. The Clinton Administration requires agencies to define spouse as opposite-sex for federal benefits distribution. Providing same-sex partner benefits is seen as crucial for federal government to attract top talent. Obama Administration argues that not extending these benefits hinders recruitment and retention of high-performing employees in same-sex relationships. Estimates show 34,000 federal employees in same-sex relationships. When Congress enacted DOMA, it did not address whether denying benefits to same-sex partners could affect federal hiring. Few employers offered same-sex benefits at that time, and there is no federal data tracking the availability of such benefits over time. Private and public-sector employers do offer benefits to same-sex partners, but the types and scope vary. Some employers offer benefits to domestic partners, with variations in the types and scope of benefits provided. Studies show a limited number of employers offering same-sex partner benefits in the past, with data indicating an increase over time. For example, in 1997, 10% of large U.S. employers offered domestic partner benefits. In 2000, the percentage of companies offering domestic partner benefits increased to 22%. By 2011, 46% of corporations with 500 or more employees included same-sex domestic partners as eligible dependents. In the private sector, almost two-thirds of the Fortune 1000 companies provide benefits to same-sex partners of their employees. Many employers, including Walmart and Exxon Mobil, do not provide benefits to same-sex partners. Some companies like I.B.M., Corning, and Raytheon require same-sex couples to marry for eligibility. In 2011, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released data on benefits for domestic partners, updating it in 2012. The survey asked about access to pension plans, survivor benefits, and health benefits for unmarried domestic partners. According to surveys, public-sector workers were more likely to have access to domestic partner benefits than private-sector workers. In 2011, 35% of private-sector workers with a defined benefit pension plan had access to survivorship benefits for unmarried domestic partners, increasing to 42% in 2012. Additionally, 29% of private sector civilian workers had access to health benefits for unmarried domestic partners in 2011. In 2012, 30% of private industry employees had access to health benefits for same-sex partners. In 2012, 33% of state and local government employees had access to benefits for same-sex partners. The CBO projected that extending benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees would cost $144 million over 10 years. The CBO estimated that extending benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees would cost $159 million to $211 million less than similar bills from the 111th Congress. The estimate assumed less than 1% of federal employees would enroll their same-sex partners in benefits programs, with potential savings of $13 million in federal health care premiums over ten years. This savings would come from required recoveries of payments when a third party is liable for health care costs, which was not included in previous analyses. The cost of extending same-sex partner benefits to federal employees and annuitants was estimated at $41 million in the first year and $675 million over 10 years. Office of Personnel Management Director Berry estimated it would cost $56 million in 2010. Current budgetary circumstances may deter Congress from extending these benefits, as the primary goal of DOMA was to \"preserve scarce government resources.\" Extending benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees is controversial due to moral and ethical concerns. Some Members believe it violates laws on marriage definition, while others argue it results in unequal treatment. Representative Chaffetz highlighted these issues at a House Committee hearing in July 2009. Representative Chaffetz expressed concerns about the discriminatory nature of extending benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees during a House Committee hearing in July 2009. He questioned the unequal treatment of heterosexual couples and highlighted unintended consequences. The report does not address the ethical and legal debates surrounding DOMA and same-sex marriage, but mentions President Obama's directive for agencies to report on progress towards extending benefits to same-sex domestic partners. Congress has the authority to enact legislation prohibiting the extension of same-sex partner benefits. The definition of \"domestic partner\" is disputed, with DOMA defining marriage as between one man and one woman for federal benefit programs. State and local governments or companies providing domestic partner benefits must define the term. Some state and local governments and companies require same-sex partners to be married for domestic partner benefits. Defining the start and end of same-sex partnerships can be challenging due to varying recognition across jurisdictions. This poses a problem for the federal government as it has employees in states with different recognition of same-sex marriages and partnerships. Congress would need to define same-sex partnerships to extend benefits, considering varying state recognition. Married couples have a license to verify their relationship, while same-sex couples lack official documentation. Verification of committed same-sex partnerships may be required for federal benefits. Congress may consider designating OPM as the central clearinghouse for affidavits required to qualify for same-sex partner benefits to ensure employee privacy and prevent information leaks. Giving individual agencies the authority to file the affidavits for same-sex partner benefits may make the process less anonymous for federal employees, who may be hesitant to identify themselves as gay or lesbian in front of co-workers. OPM could serve as a central clearinghouse for benefits processing to streamline the process for employees moving between agencies, but some have concerns about OPM's capacity for this role. Some concerns have been raised about the potential for abuse in recognizing domestic partnerships for federal benefits, especially if the requirements are less stringent than those for marriage licenses. Federal employees living with opposite-sex domestic partners currently do not qualify for many federal benefits because they are not considered spouses under federal law. Currently, federal employees living with same-sex partners, even if married in certain states, are ineligible for spousal benefits due to the Defense of Marriage Act. H.R. 2517 does not impact this. Congress may consider extending benefits to legally recognized same-sex domestic partnerships to control costs, or to all domestic partners regardless of gender to attract more candidates to federal jobs. Extending benefits to domestic partners regardless of gender could attract more candidates to federal jobs and allow employees to qualify for federal benefits without disclosing their partner's gender. However, this may increase costs. DOMA prevents same-sex partners from being recognized as married under the IRC, impacting tax implications for health benefits. Same-sex couples may face a larger tax liability when one partner's health insurance benefits are extended. Unlike opposite-sex spouses, same-sex partners must pay taxes on employer contributions covering their health insurance, leading to increased taxable income and tax liability. This is due to the impact of DOMA on tax implications for health benefits. Same-sex couples may face higher tax liability when health insurance benefits are extended, as they must pay taxes on employer contributions. If federal health benefits are extended to same-sex couples without repealing DOMA, federal employees extending coverage to their same-sex partner would also face additional taxation on \"imputed income.\""
