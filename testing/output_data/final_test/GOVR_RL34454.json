The U.S. Constitution in 1787 included provisions for promoting science and technology, leading to the creation of the Patent and Trademark Office and the National Institutes of Standards and Technology. The origin of the U.S. Census Bureau can be traced back to the constitutional proposition regarding taxes being in proportion to the census. Other propositions included Congress's power to establish universities and promote useful knowledge. Science and technology policy encompasses facets such as science for policy, technology for policy, policy for science, and policy for technology. Science for policy and technology for policy involve scientists, engineers, and health professionals providing analysis and data to inform policymakers in making decisions, such as addressing global climate change and its potential impacts. Policymakers consider advice from the scientific and technical community to enhance their decision-making abilities. Possible impacts of global climate change on the United States and other countries include the need for policymakers to take action to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change. Policymakers rely on guidance from the science, engineering, and health communities to make decisions on investing in research, establishing programs, and prioritizing technologies related to climate change. In the early days of the United States, science and technology policy focused on providing scientific and technical advice for public health, agriculture, and geography. President Jefferson commissioned the Lewis and Clark expedition, leading to significant scientific discoveries in the life sciences. As the nation grew, scientific knowledge became important for military and welfare state issues. Research was primarily supported by wealthy individuals during the Civil War. During the Civil War, research shifted to military focus and the federal government became more involved in science policy, establishing the land-grant college system and the Weather Bureau. In 1884, the Allison Commission discussed proposals for a Department of Science and a national university, emphasizing the need for government-university cooperation and avoiding duplication. During the early 20th century, the Allison Commission supported federal funding for science but did not recommend a separate department. The focus shifted to conservation, medicine, and public health, leading to the establishment of new science organizations like the Food and Drug Administration. Industrial research labs and mechanized industry began, and World War I saw increased use of science and technology in weapon development. The period between World War I and World War II highlighted the importance of research for military and economic purposes, shifting away from reliance on philanthropists for funding R&D. During World War II, federal government became the primary funder of research and development, leading to a shift in the relationship with the science and technology community. This policy focused on areas like weaponry, communications, and medical advancements. President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Office of Scientific Research and Development in 1941, and the Manhattan Project began to develop an atomic bomb. The utility of science and technology was widely recognized during this time. Following World War II, the importance of science and technology to society was highlighted in the 1945 report \"Science, the Endless Frontier\" by Vannevar Bush to President Franklin Roosevelt. The report emphasized the need for scientific progress in areas such as disease, national security, and public welfare. It recommended that the federal government take responsibility for fostering scientific talent and proposed the creation of a new federal agency to promote the flow of scientific knowledge and develop young talent. The recommendation from the 1945 report \"Science, the Endless Frontier\" by Vannevar Bush led to the establishment of the National Science Foundation (NSF). Today, science and engineering research are crucial for societal needs and the economy in various areas. Policymakers are interested in science and technology policy, with R&D defined as creative work to increase knowledge and devise new applications. Basic research aims to gain comprehensive knowledge without specific applications in mind, while applied research focuses on meeting specific needs. Development involves using research knowledge to create useful materials, devices, or systems. The definitions of basic and applied research focus on gaining comprehensive knowledge and meeting specific needs, respectively. Innovation is seen as more nuanced, with no need for a distinction between the two. Industries with strong links to science and technology are categorized by the OECD into knowledge-intensive service industries. Service industries and high-technology manufacturing industries are categorized by the OECD based on their incorporation of science, engineering, and technology. Knowledge-intensive service industries include communications, financial, business, education, and health services. High-technology manufacturing industries include aerospace, pharmaceuticals, computers, communications equipment, and scientific instruments. The complexity of science and technology policy generates differing perspectives that are discussed in this section. The curr_chunk discusses the differing perspectives of the science and technology community and policymakers on science and technology policy, federal funding of research, and the utility of scientific advice to policymakers. Conflicts can arise if criteria such as relevance, disinterest, and credibility are not met. The S&T community and policymakers may have different views on science and technology policymaking. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges in communication and decision-making between the science and technology community and policymakers. Different perspectives on the urgency of decisions, the influence of knowledge, and the consideration of various factors can lead to conflicts. An analyst identifies four levels of interaction between scientists and policymakers, ranging from no interaction to substantial interaction. The curr_chunk discusses the different roles scientists, engineers, and health professionals play in S&T policymaking, including the Science Arbiter, Issue Advocate, and Honest Broker of Policy Options. It highlights the complexity of interactions between the S&T community and policymakers, where individuals advocate for policies affecting the S&T field. Scientists and engineers involved in research and development may have personal preferences influencing their political actions on issues like climate change or stem cell research. Terminology is crucial in understanding the federal funding of research, as some believe the distinction between research and non-research funding is important. The federal funding for research is a significant focus, with Department of Defense (DOD) R&D funding primarily allocated to major systems development. Civilian R&D funding, on the other hand, is mainly directed towards research, especially basic research. The federal science and technology (FS&T) budget provides another perspective on research funding, highlighting the creation of new knowledge and technologies. The federal FS&T budget emphasizes creating new knowledge and technologies more accurately than overall R&D data. It is generally less than half of the federal R&D budget. Policy issues in science funding include determining sufficient federal funding for national goals and assessing the benefits of research investments. Different perspectives within the S&T community influence policy decisions. Junior researchers may support set-aside programs for early-career researchers to enhance funding opportunities without competing with senior researchers. Science for policy can be contentious due to differing perspectives on policy actions and consensus within the S&T community. Minority views in the S&T community may strongly disagree with the majority on scientific evidence. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that R&D could have accounted for 5% of real GDP growth between 1959 and 2004. A study from Stanford University found that improving science and math education could increase U.S. GDP. Policymakers are interested in the innovation process and the relationship between science, engineering, economics, education, and job creation. Different perspectives on policy for technology may arise due to varying views of the innovation model. Different perspectives on innovation policy may arise due to differing views of the innovation model. One perspective, based on the linear model of innovation, suggests that federal resources should not be used for technological development, as private entities will benefit from the investment. Another perspective argues that research and innovation are interconnected, making it appropriate to invest federal resources in technological innovation. Figure 3 illustrates the linear model of innovation, showing the federal government's investment in research and development to create intellectual property. The linear model of innovation suggests that federal resources should not be used for technological development, as private entities will benefit from the investment. The responsibility then falls to the private sector to use intellectual property to create technology, moving it through stages to commercialization. The gap between these stages is known as the \"valley of death,\" where challenges arise in transferring ideas to private entities. Some argue that the linear model is insufficient for S&T policy decision-making, as the linkage between science and technological innovation is more complex. The \"Pasteur's Quadrant\" model describes a closer link between research and its intended outcome, with four types of research: Pure basic research, Pure applied research, Use-inspired basic research, and Phenomena. This model highlights the dual goals of basic understanding and use in research, as exemplified by Louis Pasteur's work on combating various diseases. Phenomena exploration is driven by research curiosity and can lead to various types of research. The boundaries between basic research, applied research, and commercialization are often porous, with research easily transitioning between categories. Some policymakers believe that distinctions between different types of research are not always clear-cut. Some policymakers argue that federal investment in R&D should focus on both fundamental understanding and practical applications in a knowledge-based economy. They believe that federal investment should not only stop at the research stage but also support prototype and product development to ensure economic and societal benefits. Concerns exist about the government potentially favoring certain industries or technologies, which could lead to picking \"winners and losers\" in the market. Some argue that federal investment in information technology R&D can benefit the country by setting industry standards, while others believe it is inappropriate for the government to determine technological \"winners and losers.\" Different views exist on the appropriateness of federal government focusing on specific technologies for policy, with some advocating for policies to encourage technology implementation and others concerned about market influence. Some policymakers argue against government influence in favoring specific technologies, such as hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, or enhancing current vehicles, to avoid creating winners and losers. However, others believe government intervention is necessary to incentivize companies to invest in technologies that reduce fossil fuel consumption. Congress plays a role in decisions regarding science and technology policy facets, including science for policy, technology for policy, policy for science, and policy for technology. Congress plays a crucial role in shaping science and technology policy decisions, influencing funding for research and development, setting priorities, and supporting STEM education. Congressional decisions are informed by advice from internal sources like staff and hearings, as well as external sources. Various congressional committees are involved in S&T policy decision-making, focusing on science for policy and technology for policy issues such as nutrition in schools and endangered species. The House Committee on Science and Technology focuses on various policy areas related to science and technology, including energy, aviation, environmental research, and technology applications. It is responsible for authorizing non-defense research activities of federal agencies and conducting ongoing reviews and studies. The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation focuses on science, engineering, and technology research and development. Biomedical research policy issues are discussed by different committees, such as the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Defense research is handled by committees other than those focused on science. The Senate Committee on Armed Services and House and Senate Committees on Appropriations play a key role in discussing military research and development funding. Appropriated research funding competes for limited discretionary funding with other federal programs, posing a challenge. Various Appropriations subcommittees may also address science and technology policy issues, including funding for NSF, NASA, NIST, and the White House OSTP. Energy research activities funding is also discussed by these committees. Funding for energy research activities is discussed by House and Senate Committees on Appropriations' Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, NIH funding by House and Senate Committees on Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, and DOD funding by House and Senate Committees on Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. Committees conduct oversight and investigations within their purview. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs are also involved in S&T policy. Science and technology policy caucuses organize public symposia on relevant topics. The Senate Science and Technology Caucus organizes events on scientific and technical topics of interest to Members of Congress, providing networking opportunities and a better understanding of S&T policy. These voluntary alliances operate without direct recognition in chamber rules or line item appropriations, with financial support from interested groups. The Senate Science and Technology Caucus sponsors events related to S&T policy, along with other bicameral caucuses. Some of the caucuses listed include the Biomedical Research Caucus, Congressional High Technology Caucus, and Senate Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education Caucus. The Senate Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education Caucus is one of the many caucuses in the U.S. Senate that reflects Member interest. Science and technology policy issues can reach the Presidential level if they involve multiple agencies, have budgetary, economic, national security, or foreign policy dimensions, or are highly visible to the public. Presidents have historically obtained S&T advice through federal scientists, engineers, or advisory boards and committees. During World War I and World War II, the importance of applying research for military and economic purposes became clear. President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) in 1941. Subsequent Presidents utilized various mechanisms to receive S&T advice within the Executive Office of the President (EOP). This included the Office of the Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology under Eisenhower, and the Office of Science and Technology under Kennedy and Johnson. During the Nixon Administration, the S&T policy office in the White House, OST, was abolished and relocated within NSF. President Nixon decided not to appoint new members to PSAC after its members resigned. President Ford supported the return of a science advisory mechanism to the White House, signing the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 into law on May 11, 1976. The Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 (P.L. 94-282) established the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and OSTP Director within the Executive Office of the President (EOP). All Presidents since Ford have had an OSTP with a stable organizational structure and a science advisor. The OSTP, along with other EOP offices, advises the President on science and technology policy. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) within the Executive Office of the President advises the President on science and technology policy. It serves as a source of scientific and technological analysis for major government policies and programs. The influence of OSTP and other EOP organizations in science and technology policy decision-making varies with each President. Their objectives include advising on the impacts of science and technology on domestic and international affairs, developing sound policies and budgets, and collaborating with the private sector for economic prosperity. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) advises the President on science and technology policy, aiming to ensure Federal investments in science and technology contribute to economic prosperity, environmental quality, and national security. The Director of OSTP is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, along with up to four Associate Directors. Congress confirms the director of OSTP, who can be required to testify before Congress. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Director may not be required to testify due to executive privilege. The Director co-chairs the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) and supports the President's National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), both established by executive order. The NSTC coordinates science and technology policy across the federal government, setting national goals for investments and research strategies. OSTP staff manage NSTC activities in collaboration with federal agency staff. The role of the science advisor to the President has been debated within the S&T community. Past advisors have served as advocates for the President's policies or as representatives of the S&T community's views. George Keyworth advocated for the Reagan Administration, while Frank Press represented the S&T community during the Carter Administration. The S&T community discusses the size, budget, organization, and staffing of OSTP, including advisory mechanisms like NSTC and PCAST. Some suggest additional advisory mechanisms for education and federal-state S&T policy. There are proposals for a permanent staff at OSTP similar to OMB, which assists the President in budget preparation and administration. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) play crucial roles in formulating the President's spending plans, evaluating agency programs, setting funding priorities, and ensuring consistency with the President's Budget and Administration policies. The OMB staff implements budgetary priorities, including decisions on federal science and technology programs. Other White House organizations involved in science and technology policy include the National Security Council (NSC) and the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA). The National Security Council (NSC), Council of Economic Advisors (CEA), and Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) provide the President with advice on national security, economic analysis, and environmental policies. The President may also seek advice from cabinet members, White House staff, and Presidential appointees. Fewer than 100 Presidential appointees and others hold leadership positions in science and technology-related agencies that support research and development, manage defense, space, energy, health, and environment programs, and regulate activities with technology components. These leaders play a crucial role in S&T policy decision-making, with many requiring Senate confirmation before taking office. Some positions, like the director of the National Science Foundation, are \"term appointments\" allowing individuals to serve across Administrations. Executive branch positions are often retitled. Federal agencies are categorized into those that conduct or sponsor research and those related to science and technology. The \"Plum Book\" lists presidentially-appointed positions across Administrations. Key agencies include the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, NASA, and National Institute of Standards and Technology. Key federal research agencies include NASA, NIST, NOAA, and USGS, along with other departments like DOD, DOE, HHS, USDA, DHS, DOT, VA, ED, DOJ, DOI, and DOL. For example, HHS includes NIH, FDA, CDC, ATSDR, and AHRQ. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) includes NIH, FDA, CDC, ATSDR, and AHRQ. Other federal organizations supporting research and development are EPA, SSA, USAID, CPSC, and Smithsonian Institution. Federal agencies collaborate on issues like nanotechnology and climate change. Science.gov is a search engine for government science information. Federal agencies fund external researchers at universities (extramural) and internal researchers at national laboratories (intramural), operated by DOE, DOD, NIH, NASA, and USDA. The S&T community provides scientific and technical knowledge to the judiciary for cases like product liability, medical malpractice, and environmental litigation. The judiciary must make decisions based on scientific \"facts\" at a particular point in time, influencing the science and engineering community. The judiciary relies on scientific knowledge for cases like product liability and medical malpractice, impacting the science and engineering community. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer emphasizes the importance of sound law supporting science and the increasing need for access to sound science in legal issues related to complex technology. The U.S. Supreme Court has addressed the reliability of scientific methodology in expert testimony. Experts have raised concerns about the judiciary's use of scientific evidence and whether minority views are adequately recognized. The Federal Judicial Center provides resources for judges on managing cases involving science and technology, including expert evidence, statistics, DNA evidence, and engineering practices. The American Association for the Advancement of Science offers a Court Appointed Scientific Experts (CASE) service to assist with scientific issues in court. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) offers a Court Appointed Scientific Experts (CASE) service to help judges find qualified scientists, engineers, and healthcare professionals for scientific cases. The judiciary system can impact science and technology, including cases of scientific misconduct and issues related to technology like patent policy for emerging technologies. The Supreme Court decision allowed patenting of a genetically engineered microorganism, showcasing the importance of scientific and technical knowledge. Organizations providing scientific advice help synthesize data and offer consensus views from the science and engineering community, which is consensus-based and involves debates among scientists and engineers from different perspectives. The consensus-based scientific advice provided to policymakers is crucial for decision-making. Various organizations offer formal science and technology policy advice, including federal advisory committees, congressionally chartered honorific organizations, and federally funded research and development corporations. These entities play a key role in conveying knowledge and recommendations to policymakers, influencing potential policy actions. The Federal Advisory Committee Act governs FFRDCs funded by the federal government. International organizations and intergovernmental organizations also provide knowledge and advice to policymakers. Various organizations and individuals contribute their thoughts on S&T policy, sometimes agreeing on knowledge but differing on proposed actions due to varying values. Various organizations and individuals contribute their thoughts on S&T policy, sometimes agreeing on knowledge but differing on proposed actions due to varying values. Federal advisory committees provide independent advice and recommendations on S&T policy, using mechanisms like papers, reports, and events to convey information to policymakers. These committees fall into five categories according to a National Academies report. Policy related advisory committees fall into five categories, with the two major federal advisory committees being the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) and the National Science Board (NSB). PCAST and NSB draw members from various sectors and issue reports on S&T policy. Presidents decide whether to have a science advisory council, with many opting to do so starting in the 20th century. PCAST was established by President George H. W. Bush and has been reestablished in subsequent administrations by executive order. The National Science Board (NSB) was created by Congress in 1950 to recommend and encourage national policies for research and education in science and engineering. NSB provides oversight, establishes NSF policies, and serves as an independent body of advisors on science and engineering issues. Every two years, NSB collects information to develop its Science and Engineering Indicators report. The government uses Science and Engineering Indicators report as a primary resource guide for S&T policy. Various federal departments have advisory committees for scientific and technical advice, such as NIH's ACD, EPA's SAB, and DOD's DSB. The GSA conducts reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of advisory committees, which can range from 900-1,100 committees with over 50,000 members providing advice. The government utilizes advisory committees for scientific and technical advice, with over 900-1,100 committees and 50,000 members. Committee members typically do not receive Federal compensation aside from travel expenses. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is a key organization providing independent advice on S&T matters, issuing around 200 reports annually. The National Academies issue reports on various science and technology topics in response to congressional requests. Reports are developed through a committee process, with members serving pro bono. Funding is needed for staff and support before a congressionally-requested study can proceed. The National Academy of Public Administration also issues reports related to S&T policy. The National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) was chartered in 1984 and includes policy makers, scholars, business executives, and government officials. NAPA focuses on improving government effectiveness in response to congressional requests, similar to the National Academies. NAPA conducts studies on government administration and performance, such as NASA, in response to congressional committees. NAPA is funded by federal agencies and administered by industrial firms, universities, or nonprofit institutions. FFRDCs are sponsored by federal agencies like DOE, DOD, HHS, DHS, NASA, NSF, NRC, DOT, and Treasury. Examples include Los Alamos National Laboratory, Lincoln Laboratory, Homeland Security Institute, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and National Center for Atmospheric Research. Nonprofit organizations like Battelle, Mitre, Aerospace Corporation, and Institute for Defense Analysis manage FFRDCs, providing advice on energy, national security, defense, information technology, and aviation issues. Mitre focuses on defense, information technology, and aviation issues, while The Aerospace Corporation specializes in space and launch systems. IDA manages an FFRDC called the Science and Technology Policy Institute (STPI), which provides advice and analysis for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and other government users. STPI, originally known as the Critical Technologies Institute, was created by Congress in 1991 and was managed by Rand from 1993 to 2003 before IDA took over. Additionally, international intergovernmental organizations like the OECD also offer S&T policy advice to support sustainable economic growth and other global initiatives. The OECD, UNESCO, and UNOOSA are international organizations involved in S&T policy. OECD provides data and analysis for member countries, UNESCO promotes cooperation in education, science, and culture, while UNOOSA focuses on space policy through COPUOS. UNOOSA, through COPUOS, manages international treaties related to outer space and assists developing countries in using space technology for development. The IPCC, awarded a Nobel Prize in 2007, assesses man-made climate change and provides mitigation options. A policy institute, also known as a \"think tank,\" provides policy analysis and advice. Think tank reports are authored by scholars or committees, funded by interest groups, and may have a specific policy perspective. Think tanks vary in size and funding, influencing the analysis in their reports. Some think tanks focused on S&T policy include Resources for the Future, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Public Citizen, and the World Resources. Public opinion about science and technology influences S&T policy decision-making, reflecting trust in scientists, engineers, and health professionals. The public's willingness to invest federal funds in research with uncertain outcomes also plays a role in shaping research priorities and methods. Think tanks like the American Enterprise Institute, Center for American Progress, and the Heritage Foundation comment on various policy areas, including S&T policy. Public attitudes can influence public policies related to technology applications like genetically-modified organisms and irradiated foods. NSF surveys show that most Americans believe in the benefits of scientific research, with confidence in scientific leaders at 41%. However, many Americans lack basic factual knowledge. Many Americans lack basic factual knowledge about science and are receptive to including nonscientific views in science classrooms. Individual opinion leaders, like Colin Powell, who have held leadership positions in government or industry, often become major spokespersons on S&T policy topics. Scientific and engineering professional organizations play an active role in S&T policy decision-making. Scientific and engineering professional organizations are active in S&T policy decision-making, representing their members in Congress. Over 3,000 such organizations exist worldwide, advancing research in their fields. Despite self-interest, their advice, like the ASCE's warning on infrastructure, should not be dismissed. Professional organizations, such as NSTA, NSTM, and NSPE, aim to advance specific professions. Professional organizations like the American Physical Society (APS) and the American Chemical Society (ACS) aim to advance their respective fields by promoting research, improving qualifications, and fostering public welfare and education. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) represents the science and engineering community broadly and works to advance these fields. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) represents the science and engineering community broadly in Washington DC, along with other disciplinary societies like FASEB, AMS, AGU, ASCE, IEEE, and ASME. There are also organizations focusing on enhancing the status of women and underrepresented groups in science and engineering, such as AWIS, SWE, NACME, and the Center for the Advancement of Hispanics in Science and Engineering Education. Many science and engineering societies sponsor congressional fellowships for individuals to learn about policymaking and provide expertise to Members of Congress. Fellowships typically last one year, with fellows assisting in legislative and policy areas requiring scientific input. The most prominent fellowship program is sponsored by AAAS in collaboration with national scientific and engineering societies. Universities and colleges also play an active role in science and technology policy. Many universities have Washington DC offices or representatives to monitor Congressional activities. Over 50 organizations represent post-secondary institutions, including ACE, AAU, NASULGC, AAC&U, CGS, and AAMC. ACE acts as an umbrella organization, developing consensus on higher education policy among these groups. Many organizations, such as AAU, NASULGC, AAC&U, CGS, and AAMC, focus on different aspects of education policy. Some groups, like COGR, concentrate on specific topics like financial aspects of research. Advocacy groups aim to influence public policy, with examples like the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, which won the Nobel Prize in 1995. Advocacy groups in science and technology policy work to reduce the role of nuclear arms in international politics. Organizations like the Union of Concerned Scientists and Research! America advocate for increased funding in health research and environmental policy. Coalitions, such as the Task Force on the Future of American Innovation, push for more federal support in physical sciences and engineering research. Scientists and engineers in these groups base their positions on scientific evidence rather than rhetoric. Some believe scientists and engineers should separate personal views from professional obligations to remain neutral. Professional organizations may take positions on issues but separate lobbying from educational activities. Industrial companies in Washington, DC can represent their views individually or through trade associations. Trade associations, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, advocate for common business interests. Labor groups, like professional associations and unions, also influence decision-making on safety issues for workers. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of is an example of a labor union active in this area. Labor unions like the AFL-CIO and professional organizations such as the Programmers Guild and IEEE are active in influencing decisions on job market issues like immigration and H-1B visas. Other active labor unions include the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers and the Communication Workers of America. Additionally, faculty, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars advocate for their views in Washington, DC, and on university campuses through labor groups and professional organizations like the National Postdoctoral Association. The National Postdoctoral Association and the American Association of University Professors represent postdoctoral scholars and faculty viewpoints. Graduate students at Columbia University are represented by the UAW. This primer discusses how science and technology influence policy and vice versa, as well as the sources of knowledge for policymakers. Science and technology policy decision-making involves various organizations and individuals with diverse ideas and opinions. Many organizations and individuals with diverse ideas and opinions participate in science and technology policy decision-making. Policymakers face challenges in sorting through overwhelming information to determine relevance, and communication difficulties arise due to differing perspectives between policymakers and the science and engineering community. The information provided by the science and engineering community is just one factor in a policymaker's decision process, which also considers cultural, economic, and other values. Many federal government agencies can influence science and technology policy issues, with overlapping roles in risk assessment, responsibility allocation, and problem-solving. For example, decision-making on nuclear power involves various agencies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Occupational Safety & Health Administration, and Department of Energy. Critics argue that the current science and technology policy decision-making process is challenging due to differing perspectives from federal agencies, Congress, judiciary, and other stakeholders. This diversity leads to incoherent and inconsistent policy decisions, with public policies sometimes not reflecting scientific knowledge. Policymakers and the public may lack sufficient understanding to make informed decisions, relying on experts for guidance. Experts may help policymakers make decisions, but concerns exist about their personal biases affecting independent analysis. Disagreements among experts due to scientific uncertainty can make decision-making challenging. Policymakers must weigh imperfect information to decide on taking action or waiting for more scientific input. While scientific knowledge and technological development evolve rapidly, public policy often lags behind. Critics argue that accountability in political decision-making is challenging due to the decentralized nature of S&T policy decision-making. This can make it difficult to trace sources of advice and hold them accountable for their guidance. Despite these challenges, scientific and technical advancements continue to shape policy decisions. Scientific and technical knowledge can be valuable in policymaking by helping assess risks and benefits to enhance societal and economic outcomes. Policymakers should consider the guidance available alongside other factors when making decisions."
