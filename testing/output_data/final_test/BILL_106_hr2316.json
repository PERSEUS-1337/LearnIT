    "content": "SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. The \"Safe Motherhood Monitoring and Prevention Research Act of 1999\" highlights the stagnant maternal mortality rates in the United States since 1982, with a significant disparity in risk between black and white women. Data suggests that between 1987 and 1996, at least 3,086 women died due to pregnancy-related complications, with potential underestimation of maternal deaths on vital statistics records. Investing in public health surveillance and prevention research can help reduce maternal mortality by improving monitoring and identifying causes. Early diagnosis and treatment of pregnancy complications are crucial. Underserved populations often lack support systems and financial resources for quality healthcare. By promoting maternal health programs, the risk of maternal mortality and morbidity in the United States can be decreased. Title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on Safe Motherhood Promotion, specifically focusing on Safe Motherhood Monitoring. The Safe Motherhood Promotion section of the Public Health Service Act aims to develop monitoring systems at local, State, and national levels to understand maternal complications and mortality better, reducing disparities among at-risk populations. The Secretary can establish a national surveillance program and expand the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System to collect data in all 50 States. The Secretary can expand the Maternal and Child Health Epidemiology Program to provide support to maternal and child health programs in all 50 States. Authorization of appropriations is provided for each fiscal year. \"SEC. 399M. Prevention research for safe motherhood.\" The purpose of this section is to authorize the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand research on risk factors, prevention strategies, and the roles of family, healthcare providers, and the community in safe motherhood. Research activities may include preconception counseling, identifying critical components of prenatal and postpartum care, outreach services for pregnant women, identifying high-risk women, and preventing preterm delivery. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is authorized to expand research on risk factors and prevention strategies for safe motherhood. This includes preventing preterm delivery, urinary tract infections, unnecessary caesarean sections, maternal mortality among African American women, domestic violence's impact on maternal health, substance use prevention during pregnancy, and other relevant areas. Authorization of appropriations is provided for each fiscal year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may conduct activities to promote safe motherhood, including public education campaigns, education programs for healthcare providers, and community support services for pregnant women. Appropriations are authorized for each fiscal year."
