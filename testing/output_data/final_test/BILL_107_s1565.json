The Senate findings highlight the importance of the ABM Treaty signed by President Nixon and General Secretary Brezhnev in 1972 to limit anti-ballistic missile systems and prevent a nuclear arms race between the US and the Soviet Union. The ABM Treaty, signed in 1972, is crucial for arms control, nuclear nonproliferation, and US national security. It promotes strategic stability, reduces offensive nuclear weapons, and encourages secure nuclear alert postures. Parties can withdraw with six months notice if their supreme interests are threatened by extraordinary events. The national missile defense system is in early research and development stages. The fourth research and development intercept test of the national missile defense system was conducted on July 14, 2001. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld stated that the United States will not violate the ABM Treaty but may withdraw if necessary. Unilateral withdrawal from the treaty by the US will have significant implications for global security and national interests. President Bush and President Putin discussed potential modifications to the ABM Treaty in 2001 to address emerging threats while preserving its effectiveness with respect to Russia. They agreed on the need for discussions on offensive and defensive systems in light of major global changes. The Senate expresses its view on the US adherence to the ABM Treaty. The Senate emphasizes the importance of the US adhering to the ABM Treaty, including pursuing consultations with Russia for necessary modifications and not deploying a national missile defense system unilaterally. The Senate requires operational tests of a fully integrated defense system to demonstrate operational effectiveness and suitability for combat before deployment. SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES. Limitation on funds for National Missile Defense system testing, evaluation, or deployment that would violate ABM Treaty or future agreements with Russia. The limitation on funds for testing, evaluating, or deploying a system that would violate the ABM Treaty or future agreements with Russia includes any construction necessary for these activities. SEC. 4. REPORTS ON DECISIONS RELATING TO DEPLOYMENT OF A NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM. Before any decision by the President regarding the deployment of a national missile defense system, the Secretary of State must submit a report to Congress detailing the specific national security threat justifying the decision and assessing how testing or deployment not compliant with the ABM Treaty will enhance overall US national security. This assessment includes considering the likelihood of the missile threat being countered and the impact on US relations. Before a decision by the President on deploying a national missile defense system, the Secretary of Defense must certify to Congress that operational tests have been conducted successfully. This includes testing a fully integrated version of the missile system with realistic parameters, countermeasures, and decoys to ensure its effectiveness. Before a decision on deploying a national missile defense system, the Secretary of Defense must certify to Congress that operational tests have been successful. This includes testing the missile system for operational effectiveness and suitability for combat. The certification must be submitted in both classified and unclassified form. Covered decisions include deploying a missile system to defend the US against ballistic missile attacks and notifying Russia of the intention to withdraw from the ABM Treaty. SEC. 5. ANNUAL ASSESSMENTS ON THREAT OF ATTACK ON THE UNITED STATES USING WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. The President must provide Congress with an annual report assessing the threat of a weapon of mass destruction being used against the United States and its allies by foreign states and transnational groups. This includes evaluating the delivery methods of such weapons, comparing the threat posed by ballistic missiles to other delivery systems. The annual report to Congress evaluates the threat of weapons of mass destruction by foreign states and transnational groups, including delivery methods like ballistic missiles. It also includes the cost of research, development, and deployment activities for the national missile defense system from 2002 to 2020, and assesses if funding allocation will impact priority programs of the Department of Defense. The annual report to Congress evaluates threats of weapons of mass destruction by foreign states and transnational groups, including delivery methods like ballistic missiles. It also assesses the cost and impact of research, development, and deployment activities for the national missile defense system from 2002 to 2020. The ABM Treaty, defined in this Act, refers to the agreement between the US and USSR on limiting Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems, signed in 1972 and includes a protocol signed in 1974."
