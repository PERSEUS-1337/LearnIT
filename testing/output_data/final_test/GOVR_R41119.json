    "content": "GEPA includes provisions related to the powers and responsibilities of ED, covering topics such as appropriations, evaluations, privacy, and enforcement. Key provisions include extension of appropriation funds, automatic extension of program authorization, prohibition on using funds for transportation to overcome racial imbalance, prohibition on federal control of education, and privacy requirements for educational agencies receiving federal funds. Privacy provisions in GEPA require educational agencies receiving federal funds to provide parents access to children's educational records and prohibit the release of records without written consent. There is a general prohibition on using funds for a national test without explicit authorization. GEPA is organized into four parts: Functions of the Department of Education, Appropriations and Evaluations, General Requirements and Conditions, and Enforcement. The act includes provisions on the applicability of GEPA to education programs. Section 400 of GEPA applies to all applicable programs of the Department of Education, excluding contracts made by ED. It defines terms like \"applicable program\" and clarifies that GEPA does not affect statutes prohibiting discrimination. Part A of GEPA includes sections addressing general provisions. Part A of GEPA, enacted in 1975, consists of two sections. The first section pertains to the Secretary's general authority, while the second section focuses on education impact statements. This section grants regulatory authority to the Secretary, allowing them to establish rules and regulations for the Department of Education and its programs. Regulations affecting higher education institutions must include an educational impact assessment statement published in the Federal Register. Part B is divided into two subparts, with the first addressing appropriations. The second subpart of Part B of GEPA addresses the planning and evaluation of federal education activities, including appropriations for ongoing projects in advance. This allows for separate appropriations for an applicable program for two consecutive years in the appropriations act. The FY2010 appropriations act allows funds to be obligated in different fiscal years for applicable programs. Unspent funds can be carried over for one additional fiscal year and must be used according to program requirements for that year. The FY2010 appropriations act allows funds to be obligated in different fiscal years for applicable programs. If Congress does not pass legislation extending a program, it is automatically extended for one additional fiscal year with the same level of appropriations. The Secretary must carry out necessary acts or determinations during this automatic extension period. During the automatic program extension period, payments can be made in installments or in advance/reimbursement. States must submit a report every two years to the Secretary detailing the use of federal funds for applicable programs. The Secretary is required to include specific information in reports on grants and contracts with LEAs and agencies, provide data to the National Center for Education Statistics, submit a summary report to Congress, and evaluate program effectiveness every two years. The report for applicable programs must include program profiles, progress towards objectives, and significant activities. Funds cannot be used for transportation to address racial imbalance or segregation, except for Impact Aid. Applicants must outline steps for equitable access and participation, addressing special needs to overcome barriers. The National Assessment Governing Board and other education boards must coordinate efforts to assist states with education reform. Disclosure requirements apply to educational organizations providing fee-based programs, but not to LEAs, SEAs, or schools defined by ESEA or IHEs defined by HEA. Covered educational organizations must meet disclosure requirements before enrolling a minor in an educational program. The disclosure must address how participants were selected, program costs, and enrollment fee distribution. Organizations must include a statement in recruitment materials stating non-discrimination policies. The section prohibits discrimination based on race, disability, or low-income status in educational programs. It does not guarantee participation or fee waivers. It includes enforcement provisions and is divided into four subparts addressing the Secretary's authority, administrative requirements, state and LEA administration, and records. The final subpart of the section addresses records, privacy, and limitations on withholding federal funds. The Secretary is authorized to enter into arrangements with other federal agencies for joint projects and transfer funds appropriated under any applicable program. Funds transferred for joint projects must be used in accordance with the statutes authorizing them. The Secretary can use a single set of criteria and application to select grantees for joint funding agreements with other agencies. Joint applications may be required for competitive grants under multiple programs if the Secretary deems it necessary to address special needs. Applicants must meet eligibility criteria for each program involved. The Secretary must disseminate information about applicable programs to states, LEAs, and institutions, cooperate with federal officials, inform the public about education programs, collect data on program effectiveness, and establish an appeals process for challenging SEA actions. An aggrieved party can request a hearing within 30 days of an SEA's final action on an aid program. The SEA must hold the hearing within 30 days and issue a ruling within 10 days. If the final action is found to be contrary to laws or regulations, it must be rescinded. If dissatisfied, the party can appeal to the Secretary within 20 days. The Secretary may issue interim orders if necessary, and if the SEA's action is deemed contrary to laws, the Secretary will order changes. The Secretary has the authority to order the SEA to modify its actions if they do not comply with federal law or program rules. SEAs must provide all relevant records to applicants or recipients, and failure to comply may result in termination of assistance or other corrective actions by the Secretary. The Commissioner can offer advice, counsel, and technical assistance to SEAs, IHEs, and schools to help them access benefits, meet program requirements, and enhance program activities. The Commissioner can increase the depth of activities under programs, simplify administrative procedures, and allow LEAs to use organized approaches for cost allocation. Contracts and grants for curriculum development should encourage dissemination and include consultation fees. Grants for publication should be awarded competitively. The Secretary's regulations encourage parental participation in programs to increase effectiveness. Applications for payments to LEAs must involve parents in planning and dissemination of program plans and evaluations. The Secretary's regulations promote parental involvement in program planning and evaluation. If an LEA loses federal funding due to discrimination, funds may be reallocated to eligible LEAs or used for desegregation training. The Secretary is authorized to provide applications for assistance under programs designed to enhance equity in education or redress discrimination. Uniform dates for submission and approval of applications are required, along with common applications for different types of grant programs. The Secretary is authorized to provide applications for assistance under programs designed to enhance equity in education or redress discrimination. A common application is required for different types of grant programs, with regulations defined as legally binding rules prescribed by the Secretary or ED. Regulations must be uniformly applied and enforced in all 50 states, with exemptions for matters pertaining to public property, loans, grants, and benefits specified in GEPA. The Secretary can exempt certain regulations for new grant competitions or in cases of \"extreme hardship\" for program beneficiaries. Final regulations must be submitted within 360 days of an act's enactment, with a schedule provided to relevant committees. Regulations must be uniformly applied and enforced nationwide. This section clarifies that no provision of any applicable program is intended to authorize the federal government to exercise any \"direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum, program of instruction, administration, or personnel of any educational institution, school, or school system,\" or over the selection of \"library resources, textbooks, or other printed or published instructional materials by any educational institution or school system.\" Additionally, no provision of any applicable program shall be construed to authorize the federal government to require \"the assignment or transportation of students or teachers in order to overcome racial imbalance.\" All laborers and mechanics employed in construction projects and minor remodeling projects assisted under any applicable program shall be paid at wage rates not less than those prevailing. The Secretary of Labor determines wage rates for construction projects assisted under federal programs. A monitoring mechanism is established for compliance with federal education laws, including state visits and audits. States must investigate and resolve complaints regarding federal requirements. The state must investigate and resolve complaints regarding federal requirements for program administration. States have the authority to withhold approval or payments to local agencies until compliance is met. States must submit a general application with assurances for all applicable programs providing federal funds to LEAs through SEAs. The application must include assurances for program administration, fiscal control, and evaluation of statutory objectives. States must cooperate in federal evaluations and maintain records as required. The state must maintain records and provide access as required by the Secretary for program implementation, involve local agencies and individuals in planning and operation, consult with relevant groups in developing program plans, publish proposed plans at least 60 days prior to submission, allow 30 days for public comments, and ensure funds are not used for equipment that benefits the purchasing entity or its employees. The purchasing entity or its employees must be represented in the general application for federal aid programs, covering the entire duration unless significant changes occur. LEAs must submit a general application with assurances for all programs they participate in, similar to state applications. Assurances include compliance with laws, regulations, and program plans, as well as proper control of funds and property. The property acquired with program funds will be maintained by the public agency, using fiscal control procedures for proper disbursement of federal funds. The LEA will report to the state agency and Secretary as needed, maintain records, and allow access to records. Opportunities for participation in program planning will be provided to teachers, parents, and other agencies. Applications, evaluations, and reports will be available to parents and the public. Facilities constructed under the program will align with overall goals. The LEA ensures that facilities built under any program are accessible to individuals with disabilities and follows state construction plans and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Effective procedures are in place for acquiring and sharing information on programs and adopting promising educational practices. Funds will not be used for equipment that financially benefits the purchasing entity. The section imposes record-keeping requirements on recipients of federal education funds, including disclosing fund amounts, activity costs, and maintaining records for three years. Records must be accessible for audit examination by the Secretary and the Comptroller General. This section also establishes the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), also known as the Buckley Amendment, guarantees parental access to student education records and limits disclosure to third parties. Educational agencies receiving federal funds must provide parents access to their children's records and cannot release them without parental consent, except in certain cases. For more details on FERPA's privacy protections and exceptions, refer to CRS Report RS22341. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) ensures parental access to student education records and limits disclosure to third parties. Instructional materials used in programs must be available for inspection by parents or guardians. Students cannot be required to participate in surveys revealing sensitive information without consent. An LEA receiving funds must develop policies with parent consultation regarding the right to inspect surveys, protect student privacy, and inspect instructional materials. The LEA must develop policies regarding the administration of physical examinations, collection of students' personal information for marketing purposes, and the right of parents to inspect instruments used for data collection. Parents must be notified annually and given the option to opt their child out of certain activities. The LEA must notify parents annually of scheduled activities involving the collection, disclosure, or use of students' personal information for marketing purposes, surveys revealing sensitive information, and nonemergency physical examinations. The use of students' personal information for educational purposes is exempt from disclosure regulations. This includes developing educational products, conducting assessments, and fundraising for school-related activities. The provisions do not override state laws requiring parental notification or physical examinations mandated by the state. The rights provided to parents under this section transfer to a student when they turn 18 years old or are considered an emancipated minor. Educational agencies must inform parents and students of their rights under Section 445. The Secretary can enforce the provisions of this section and may terminate assistance if there is a failure to comply with the requirements. The Secretary is required to establish an office at ED to investigate violations of rights under Section 445. Refusal to provide student data to federal entities does not warrant suspension of federal assistance. Assistance to an LEA cannot be limited due to such refusal. The Secretary cannot limit or terminate assistance to an LEA without due process of law based on noncompliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It is also unlawful to base financial assistance on quotas for student admissions. Federal funds cannot be used for certain national tests unless explicitly authorized by law. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of an Office of Administrative Law Judges in the Department of Education for conducting hearings on various agency actions. This includes the recovery of funds, withholding of funds, and other proceedings designated by the Secretary. Judges must meet specific requirements and be appointed in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. The Office of Administrative Law Judges in the Department of Education conducts hearings on agency actions, including fund recovery and withholding. Judges must meet APA requirements and have experience in SEAs or LEAs. The chief judge assigns cases, ensuring no conflicts of interest. Proceedings follow rules set by the Secretary. The Office of Administrative Law Judges in the Department of Education conducts hearings on agency actions, including fund recovery and withholding. Judges must meet APA requirements and have experience in SEAs or LEAs. The chief judge assigns cases, ensuring no conflicts of interest. Proceedings follow rules set by the Secretary. Hearings are conducted according to APA rules, with costs and fees regulated. Discovery may be ordered by the judge for relevant information, limited to 90 days but extendable for cause. The Secretary must establish a mediation process for disputes, limited to 120 days with an independent mediator. The Secretary must ensure an independent mediator for disputes, limited to 120 days with possible extensions. Procedures for fund recovery from recipients are established, with the Secretary providing written notice of a preliminary decision and offering mediation. The Secretary must establish a prima facie case for fund recovery, based on audit, investigative, or monitoring reports. Failure to maintain records or grant access to the Secretary automatically creates a prima facie case. Recipients can request a review of the decision by submitting an application to the Office of Administrative Law Judges within 60 days of receiving notice. If the Office determines that the Secretary has failed to establish a prima facie case for fund recovery, the Office must notify the Secretary promptly. A state recipient cannot recover funds from an affected LEA without consulting with the subrecipient and seeking review by the Office. The burden of proof lies with the recipient in any proceeding before the Office, and hearings must take place within 90 days of a review request. Hearings before the Office must occur within 90 days after a request for review of a preliminary departmental decision. The Secretary may review a decision but cannot alter the Office's findings of fact if supported by substantial evidence. The Secretary can remand the case for further evidence, and new findings of fact must be supported by substantial evidence. No collection action can be taken until the Office upholds ED's preliminary decision. The Secretary may not take collection action until the Office upholds ED's preliminary decision, which becomes final agency action 60 days after the recipient is notified. The Secretary's decision becomes final agency action if modified or set aside, and must be published within 60 days. No collection action is allowed if a recipient seeks judicial review under Section 458. The Secretary may compromise a preliminary departmental decision if the collection of the amount is not practical or in the public interest, and the issue has been corrected. A notice must be published in the Federal Register at least 45 days before any compromise, allowing for public comment. Recipients are not required to return funds expended in an unauthorized manner more than five years before receiving notice of a departmental decision. If a recipient misuses funds, they must repay an amount proportional to the harm caused to federal interests. Recipients must comply with authorized services and expenditure requirements to maintain accountability for fund usage. Recovery of funds may be reduced based on mitigating circumstances, with judges authorized to waive recovery if justified. SEAs and LEAs must demonstrate mitigating circumstances to avoid fund recovery, such as reliance on erroneous guidance from ED or engaging in practices after seeking guidance from ED. The ED must respond within 90 days to requests for guidance on expenditures or practices. SEAs and LEAs can demonstrate mitigating circumstances to avoid fund recovery by providing accurate descriptions, certifications, and a belief in legality. ED must disseminate significant interpretations of applicable law or policy in their responses. The Secretary of Education must respond to guidance requests within 90 days. If there are concerns about non-compliance with legal requirements, the Secretary can withhold payments, issue a cease and desist order, or take other authorized actions. Recovery of funds can still be pursued under Section 452 regardless of the actions taken. The Secretary may withhold further payments from a recipient if there is substantial non-compliance with legal requirements. The recipient must be notified in writing with the reasons for withholding payments and given an opportunity for a hearing. The hearing will be conducted by the Office of Administrative Law Judges in accordance with Section 451. The Secretary may suspend payments to a recipient after providing notice and an opportunity to show cause. The decision of the judge, supported by substantial evidence, is conclusive. The Office may collect additional evidence and make new findings, which become final agency action unless modified by the Secretary. The Secretary may issue a complaint if a recipient fails to comply with legal requirements, offering a hearing opportunity. The recipient can defend before the Office of Administrative Law Judges. If found in violation, the Office must issue an order to cease and desist. The Office issues a report and order to cease and desist if a recipient violates legal requirements. The Secretary can enforce the order by withholding funds or involving the Attorney General. Compliance agreements may be entered into to bring the recipient into full compliance quickly. A hearing is required before entering into a compliance agreement. The Secretary is required to hold a hearing for recipients entering into a compliance agreement, where the recipient must prove full compliance is not immediately possible. If agreed upon, the Secretary must publish the findings and agreement in the Federal Register. The agreement cannot exceed three years and outlines the terms for compliance. Failure to comply may result in the agreement being terminated, with recipients having the right to judicial review. Funds under a program may be affected by recovery, fund withholding, or a \"cease and desist\" order. States denied funding can petition for review by the U.S. Court of Appeals, with findings of fact considered conclusive if supported by evidence. The Court can remand for further evidence, leading to new conclusive findings. The judgment is reviewable by the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court can review the judgment of the court regarding recovered funds from non-allowable expenditures. Up to 75% of the recovered amount may be returned to the recipient if certain conditions are met, including correcting the practices that led to the recovery and submitting a plan for the use of the funds. The Secretary may make payments to recipients who were adversely affected by non-compliance, with funds to be used according to the program's original purposes. Recipients must adhere to terms set by the Secretary, submit reports on fund usage, and consult with beneficiaries. These payments are available for up to three fiscal years after final agency action or judicial review. The Secretary may make payments to recipients affected by non-compliance, with funds used for original program purposes. Recipients must follow terms, submit reports, and consult with beneficiaries. Payments available for up to three fiscal years after final agency action or judicial review. Recipients defined as grant or cooperative agreement recipients under applicable programs, excluding certain programs authorized by the HEA and specific assistance programs. The Acts of September 30, 1950 and September 23, 1950 have been repealed, affecting the Secretary's enforcement authority under GEPA. Most appropriations are available for obligation during the federal fiscal year. Some programs have funding flexibility for program years different from the federal fiscal year. Forward funding allows appropriations for elementary and secondary education programs to be available for obligation from July 1 of the fiscal year until the end of the following fiscal year, providing additional time for budget planning. This funding method is achieved through provisions in the annual L-HHS-ED appropriations bill. Pell Grants for undergraduates have uncertain program costs, with appropriations from one fiscal year supporting grants for the following academic year. Unlike elementary and secondary education programs, Pell Grant funds are available for two fiscal years. Advance appropriations allow funds to be provided for a fiscal year beyond the enacted year. In the case of FY2010 appropriations, funds may not become available for some programs until July 1, 2010, under forward funding provisions. If the forward funding date is postponed by three months to October 1, 2010, the appropriation would be reclassified as an advance appropriation for FY2011. There is no difference at the appropriations level between forward funded and advance appropriations, except for the period available for obligation. Forward funding for education programs allows for funds to be available after October 1, shifting the scoring of discretionary appropriations to the following fiscal year. This enables Congress to provide funding without impacting the total amount available for appropriations in the current fiscal year. Section 421 of GEPA extends the availability of appropriations by one fiscal year. Section 421 of GEPA extends the period of availability of appropriations for education programs, allowing funds to be obligated and expended for 24 or 27 months, depending on forward funding. This provides additional time for funds to be spent and can aid in program planning and budgeting for SEAs and LEAs. Statutory language may need to override Section 421 of GEPA to expedite fund expenditure. For instance, ARRA funds for education programs were extended by Section 421, but could have been spent in the year appropriated with different language. Section 422 of GEPA allows for one-year program authorization extensions. Section 422 of GEPA allows for a one-year extension of program authorizations, such as those under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and Higher Education Act. If Congress fails to reauthorize a program within this extension period, it technically becomes unauthorized, but can still operate if it receives appropriations. For example, current ESEA program authorizations were extended through September 30, 2008 under this provision. The period for current ESEA programs was extended through September 30, 2008, with authorizations remaining the same as FY2007. While not specifically authorized, the programs have continued to receive appropriations, with restrictions on federal control over curriculum and school operations. The federal government provides funding for education programs at the state and local levels but cannot condition it on adopting specific curricula or instructional programs. Prohibitions are in place to maintain state and local control over education, particularly in elementary and secondary education programs. Federal funding can require implementing instructional programs to improve English language acquisition, but cannot specify which programs or curricula to use. Section 444 of GEPA, also known as FERPA, addresses privacy requirements for educational records. FERPA allows schools to release records without consent in emergencies to protect student or others' health and safety. Recent amendments require clarification on disclosure rules for students posing harm to themselves or others. The Department of Education (ED) issued new regulations clarifying disclosure requirements for students posing a risk of harm to themselves or others. Efforts to expand disclosure of disciplinary proceedings involving crimes of violence or nonforcible sex offenses have been proposed, overriding FERPA's optional disclosure rule. The Department of Education issued regulations clarifying disclosure requirements for students posing a risk of harm. Efforts to expand disclosure of disciplinary proceedings for crimes of violence or nonforcible sex offenses have been proposed, overriding FERPA's optional disclosure rule. Funding for federally sponsored national tests in subjects like reading or math is prohibited unless specifically authorized by Congress. The Secretary can provide federal funds to support efforts to develop a national or common test, such as through Race to the Top grants. The National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers are leading a project to develop common standards and assessments in reading and math."
