    "content": "The United States restricts the export of defense articles, dual-use goods and technology, certain nuclear materials, and items related to nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons or missile technology. Dual-use goods have both civilian and military applications. Export controls are also imposed on countries under economic sanctions like Cuba, Iran, and Syria. The U.S. export control system, governed by various acts and authorities, has been criticized for being too restrictive or inefficient. Some argue that controls hinder competitiveness, while others prioritize defense and foreign policy over commercial interests. In 2007, the Government Accountability Office identified programs aimed at safeguarding critical technologies. The U.S. export control system, criticized for being restrictive or inefficient, is considered a \"high-risk\" area needing a strategic reexamination. Poor coordination among agencies, delays in the license application process, and lack of evaluative mechanisms were highlighted in a GAO report. Progress has been made in improving the system, but challenges remain, such as the need for consistent leadership, improved coordination, addressing weaknesses, and implementing reform. The 2019 GAO report noted improvements but emphasized the need for further action. President Obama initiated a review of the U.S. export control system in 2009, with Secretary Gates proposing a four-pronged reform approach in 2010. This included establishing a single licensing agency, a unified control list, a coordination agency, and an integrated IT system. The system covers dual-use, munitions, and nuclear controls. The Export Controls Act of 2018 (ECA; P.L. 115-232) provides legislative authority for the President to implement dual-use export controls, replacing the expired Export Administration Act of 1979. The ECA requires the President to control the export, reexport, and in-country transfer of items subject to U.S. jurisdiction. The Export Controls Act of 2018 (ECA) authorizes the control of items subject to U.S. jurisdiction, including nuclear devices, missiles, chemical or biological weapons, and more. The Act requires the Secretary of Commerce to maintain a list of controlled items and foreign persons posing a threat to national security. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) administers export licensing and enforcement functions. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in the Department of Commerce administers export licensing and enforcement functions, including enforcing U.S. antiboycott regulations. The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) set licensing policy for goods and destinations, the application process for exporters, and the Commerce Control List (CCL) of controlled commodities, technologies, and software. The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in the Department of Commerce control the export of various items such as facilities, equipment, materials, organisms, electronics, computers, telecommunications, lasers, sensors, navigation, avionics, marine, and propulsion systems. Each item is classified with an export control classification number (ECCN) based on categories and functional groups, with restrictions based on end-use or end-user. The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) control the export of various items for national security, foreign policy, or short supply reasons. Controls are based on a common multilateral list, with designations based on U.S. policy. Antiterrorism controls restrict exports to North Korea and state sponsors of terrorism. Foreign policy controls apply to encryption items and hot section technology. The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) control the export of items for national security and foreign policy reasons. Enhanced controls are placed on hot section technology, requiring a license for exports to all destinations except Canada. The U.S. government reviews license applications on a case-by-case basis to ensure consistency with national security and foreign policy interests. Foreign policy controls are also based on adherence to nonproliferation control regimes. The EAR sets timelines for dual-use licenses and interagency dispute resolution processes. The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) control the export of items for national security and foreign policy reasons. Commerce must refer license applications to other agencies for review within nine days. The entire licensing process, including dispute resolution, aims to be completed within 90 days. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) faces increased responsibilities due to export control reform. The Export Control Act (ECA) imposes criminal penalties of up to $1 million or 20 years imprisonment for violations. The Export Control Act (ECA) imposes criminal penalties of up to $1 million or 20 years imprisonment for violations, with civil penalties of up to $300,000 per violation. Enforcement is carried out by the Office of Export Enforcement (OEE) at BIS, which conducts investigations domestically and overseas. OEE also works with DHS and U.S. embassy officials for prelicense checks and postshipment verifications. The AECA of 1976 provides the President with authority to control the export of defense articles and services, including the Foreign Military Sales program and Direct Commercial Sales. It sets criteria for international defense cooperation and military export controls. Section 3(a) specifies eligibility criteria for countries to receive U.S. defense articles and services. The AECA of 1976 authorizes the export of defense articles and services with specific conditions on their use. It allows sales for internal security, self-defense, participation in UN measures, and economic development in less developed countries. Congressional approval is required for certain foreign defense sales. The AECA of 1976 authorizes foreign defense sales with specific conditions. Congressional approval is required for certain sales proposed by the President, triggered by a formal report to Congress. The executive branch can proceed with the sale unless Congress passes legislation prohibiting or modifying it. Congress must be formally notified 30 days before finalizing a government-to-government foreign military sale or issuing an export license for certain defense equipment valued at specified amounts. The Arms Export Control Act (AECA) of 1976 requires Congressional approval for foreign defense sales over certain thresholds. For sales to NATO member states Japan, Australia, or New Zealand, Congress must be notified 15 days in advance. Higher thresholds apply to these countries for sales of defense equipment, articles, and services. The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) govern the export of U.S. Munitions List items. The policy for exports of U.S. Munitions List (USML) items requires a license for nearly all items, with exemptions for Canada, the UK, and Australia. Licensing is based on the nature of the article, not the end-use or end-user. The U.S. implements prohibitions on munitions exports to certain countries and firms engaged in USML items must register. Firms dealing with USML items must register with DDTC and pay a yearly fee. DDTC oversees defense exports and consists of four offices. Critics have raised concerns about delays in license processing. NSPD-56 mandates completion of license reviews within 60 days, with exceptions for national security. The AECA mandates completion of license reviews within 60 days, with exceptions for national security. DDTC enforces penalties for violations, including criminal penalties of up to $1 million or 20 years imprisonment, civil penalties up to $500,000, and debarment from future exports. DDTC collaborates with various agencies for enforcement and assists in criminal investigations and prosecutions. The Department of Defense's Defense Security Cooperation Agency manages the Golden Sentry program for FMS transfers, while the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulates exports of nuclear facilities and material. Controls on nuclear exports are divided among several agencies based on the product or service being exported. The NRC licensing policy and control list are located at 10 C.F.R. 110. BIS licenses civilian power plant equipment and maintains the Nuclear Referral List as part of the CCL. DOE authorizes nuclear technology exports. DDTC oversees nuclear items in defense articles under ITAR. DTSA coordinates technical and security reviews of export licenses and commodity jurisdiction requests. It represents DOD in the interagency dispute resolution process. Not all licenses from DDTC or BIS are referred to DTSA. DTSA coordinates DOD's position on ITAR and EAR changes, represents DOD in interagency compliance with export control regimes. Enforcement is carried out by DHS, DOJ, FBI, and DCIS. OEE of BIS investigates violations of dual-use export controls. The Office of Defense Trade Compliance (ODTC) in DDTC, Department of State, primarily handles civil enforcement actions for export control violations. ODTC supports investigations and criminal enforcement actions conducted by ICE and the FBI. The Office of Enforcement at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) investigates export control violations related to nuclear facilities and materials licensed by the NRC. ICE, under the Department of Homeland Security, is the lead agency for criminal export enforcement. ICE is the lead agency for criminal export enforcement activities, investigating violations of export controls, exports to sanctioned countries, and economic embargoes. They work with other agencies like BIS, DDTC, and FBI to enforce export controls at ports of departure. The National Security Division of DOJ handles criminal prosecutions resulting from these investigations. Task forces were established in 20 cities to coordinate export control prosecutions. The U.S. Attorney's Offices in 20 cities coordinate export control prosecutions and enhance counterproliferation coordination among law enforcement agencies, export licensing agencies, and the intelligence community. The FBI's Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate analyzes intelligence on proliferation networks, provides training on counterproliferation, and collaborates with investigative partners and export licensing agencies. DCIS, the criminal investigative arm of the Department of Defense, investigates the transfer of sensitive defense technologies to prohibited nations and criminal elements. Internationally, there are four major multilateral control regimes. The Commerce Department noted that most items on the CCL are controlled in accordance with the US' commitments to major export control regimes like MTCR, NSG, and Wassenaar Arrangement. These regimes have catch-all controls for nonlisted items used for military or proliferation purposes. The Arms Export Control Act requires the control of MTCR Annex items not listed as dual-use, while the AECA mandates control of nuclear-related items without specifying alignment with NSG controls. President Obama initiated a review of US export policies in 2009. President Obama initiated a comprehensive review of the U.S. export control system in 2009. Former Defense Secretary Gates proposed a four-pronged reform agenda, including creating a single primary export control licensing agency, adopting a unified control list, establishing a single enforcement coordination agency, and implementing a single integrated information technology system. The changes were planned to be implemented in three phases, with Phase I focusing on harmonizing the Commerce Control List with the U.S. Munitions List. Phase II of the export control reform proposal aims to implement a harmonized licensing system with two identically-structured control lists, potentially reducing the number of required licenses. This phase involves transferring certain items from the USML to the CCL, examining unilateral controls, and consulting with multilateral partners on control adjustments. The export control reform proposal aims to merge agencies, control lists, and IT systems to streamline licensing and enforcement. Changes would require legislation. Seven principles include focusing on key items, coordinating with multilateral regimes, and updating control lists as needed. The U.S. export control reform proposal aims to streamline licensing and enforcement by merging agencies, control lists, and IT systems. The bureaucratic structure of the current system is described as complex and scattered among different government entities. Licensing is divided among various departments for different types of items. The Obama Administration proposed creating an independent licensing agency to streamline the export control system by merging agencies and resolving disputes among different entities responsible for licensing. This new agency would likely take over the licensing functions of BIS, DDTC, and OFAC, as well as house civil and administrative enforcement functions. The Obama Administration proposed creating an independent licensing agency to streamline the export control system by merging agencies and resolving disputes among different entities responsible for licensing. This agency would likely house the civil and administrative enforcement functions of BIS and DDTC. General Jones argued for a unified licensing structure to improve oversight of export licenses granted or denied by the U.S. government. Dual-use and certain military items licenses are currently referred by BIS to various agencies for review, but not to DDTC. The Obama Administration proposed creating an independent licensing agency to streamline the export control system by merging agencies and resolving disputes among different entities responsible for licensing. BIS licenses are not referred to DDTC, which refers munitions licenses to DOD and State bureaus. Some OFAC licenses are only referred to State's EEB. Interagency policy differences may persist despite efforts to improve visibility of license information. The White House announced plans to harmonize conflicting standards used by the Departments of Commerce and State regarding dual nationals' nationality for export control decisions. Commerce determines nationality based on citizenship or residence, while State considers birth country if different. This effort aims to eliminate obstacles to exporting to companies employing dual nationals. The State Department considers not only current citizenship status but also country of birth if different. Approval for transfer of technical data to dual nationals and third-party nationals from prohibited countries like China, Iran, and North Korea requires additional scrutiny. The State Department no longer uses \"country of birth\" since 2015 but considers all current and former citizenships for export control decisions. The State Department amended ITAR regulations in 2011 to allow transfer of defense articles to dual or third-party nationals employed by foreign entities, with restrictions on where the transfer can take place. The State Department amended ITAR regulations in 2011 to allow transfer of defense articles to dual or third-party nationals employed by foreign entities, with restrictions on where the transfer can take place. The end user or consignee must take measures to prevent export diversion, including screening employees for contacts with restricted countries. The rule, effective since August 15, 2011, presumes a risk of diversion if employees have substantive contacts with prohibited countries. Most diversions of U.S. Munitions List items occur outside approved licenses. The Obama Administration focused on rationalizing control lists to transition from a \"negative list\" to a \"positive list\" for dual-use items. This process involves determining a \"bright line\" at the commodity level based on technical specifications and military needs, not as an overarching concept. The Obama Administration argued for a \"bright line\" at the commodity level to rationalize control lists for dual-use items, moving away from a \"negative list\" approach. The USML's reliance on design intent and catch-all controls are key factors in this transition. Proposed rewrites to USML categories, including potential moves to the CCL, have been published as rulemakings. Three tiers were created to categorize items for control levels on both the CCL and USML. The Obama Administration created three tiers to categorize items for control levels on both the CCL and USML. They prioritized revising categories with the greatest impact on U.S. military interoperability with allied governments. Items from categories IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII have been transferred from the USML to the CCL. The State Department reorganized the USML into various categories, including tanks, aircraft, military training equipment, protective gear, military electronics, toxicological agents, spacecraft, nuclear weapons, directed energy weapons, and submersible vessels. They also added a new category for gas turbine engines. Items from certain categories were planned to be moved to the CCL in 2018. The executive branch proposed rules in 2018 to move certain weapons and combat items from the USML to the CCL. Legislation introduced in 2019 by Representative Norma Torres and Senator Robert Menendez aims to prevent the removal of firearms from the USML. Additionally, a new \"0Y521\" classification series was established in 2013 for items not covered by existing export control regimes. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has added new items to the \"0Y521\" classification series for items that may not fall under existing export control regimes. These items must be re-classified within one year, or they will be designated as EAR99 items. BIS can extend this classification for up to two one-year periods if a proposal is submitted to obtain multilateral controls. The Obama Administration reconstituted the Munitions List to align with the Commerce Control List (CCL) by adding two new categories: F and G for ITAR specific controls. This alignment divided each USML category into seven groups: A\u2014equipment, assemblies, and components; B\u2014test, inspection, and production equipment; C\u2014materials; D\u2014software; E\u2014technology; F\u2014defense services; and G\u2014manufacturing and production authorizations. Some USML items were moved to the CCL as a result of this process. The Obama Administration reconstituted the Munitions List by adding new categories F and G for ITAR controls, aligning it with the Commerce Control List (CCL). Some USML items were moved to the CCL. The transfer of USML items to the CCL involves creating a \"600 Series\" subcategory of ECCNs for each CCL category, as described in a proposed rulemaking on July 15, 2011, and part of the \"mega rule\" issued on April 16, 2013. The Obama Administration reconstituted the Munitions List by adding new categories F and G for ITAR controls, aligning it with the Commerce Control List (CCL). Some USML items were moved to the CCL under a new \"600 Series\" subcategory of ECCNs. Items in the 600 Series require a license for all destinations except Canada and are subject to restrictions on Defense Department procurement from Communist Chinese military companies. The recently announced Strategic Trade Authorization (STA) license exception allows for automatic eligibility for exports to STA-eligible countries. \"600 Series\" items and parts/components with over 25% controlled U.S. content are addressed under the EAR. License exceptions are available for less significant items and destinations not controlled for antiterrorism reasons. The Obama Administration proposed a new definition of \"specially designed\" to facilitate the transfer of items from the USML to the CCL. This includes a \"see-through\" rule for ITAR-controlled items and a 25% rule for items migrating to the 600 Series. Foreign products with over 25% controlled U.S. content may require a reexport license. The Obama Administration proposed a new definition of \"specially designed\" to transfer items from the USML to the CCL for military use under ITAR jurisdiction. The final rule was published on April 16, 2013, with a two-part definition that some have called a \"catch and release\" approach. The first part captures items as specially designed, while the second part may release them if they do not meet certain parameters. An item is considered specially designed if it meets specific criteria outlined in the regulation, such as having properties responsible for achieving certain performance levels or being a part of a commodity listed on the CCL or USML. If an item does not meet these criteria, it is not considered specially designed. There are six exclusions that may apply to determine if an item is specially designed, including being identified in an ECCN paragraph without the control parameter or being classified as an EAR99 item. The item in question must meet specific criteria to be considered specially designed, such as being part of a commodity listed on the CCL or USML. It should have the same function and performance capabilities as a commodity or software in production and developed with the knowledge of its use with commodities or software described in an ECCN. The item in question must meet specific criteria to be considered specially designed, such as being part of a commodity listed on the CCL or USML. It should have the same function and performance capabilities as a commodity or software in production and developed with the knowledge of its use with commodities or software described in an ECCN. The Commerce regulations apply to the \"600 series\" of items moved from the USML. The proposed regulation to define specially designed in the ITAR as a replacement for the currently utilized criteria. The proposed regulation aims to define \"specially designed\" in the ITAR as a replacement for the current criteria. BIS sought feedback on positively identifying items classified as specially designed on the CCL. The Obama Administration introduced the Strategic Trade Authorization (STA) to facilitate transfers to low-risk countries and promote interoperability with allies. Exporters must notify BIS to be eligible for STA. The final rulemaking for the Strategic Trade Authorization (STA) allows exporters to transfer items to eligible allies with safeguard requirements. Recipients must comply with license exception rules and are restricted from reexporting STA-eligible items outside designated countries. STA is available to 44 countries, including NATO partners and members of nonproliferation control regimes. The Strategic Trade Authorization (STA) allows for the transfer of items to eligible allies for national security purposes. Eligible items include those related to chemical or biological weapons, nuclear nonproliferation, and regional stability. The United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014 aims to move Israel to the first list of countries eligible for STA. India was recently moved to the first list of countries. The Strategic Trade Authorization (STA) excludes certain items like missile technology, chemical weapons, and encryption from export. A new export enforcement system was created with a fusion center to coordinate investigations and enforcement. Executive Order 13558 established the Export Enforcement Coordination Center (EECC) in 2010. The Export Enforcement Coordination Center (EECC) was established in March 2012 within the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate export control enforcement efforts among various government departments and resolve conflicts. It screens all license applications and expands on the functions of the existing National Export Enforcement Coordination Network in ICE. The Export Enforcement Coordination Center (EECC) was established in March 2012 to coordinate export control enforcement efforts among government departments. A March 2019 GAO report highlighted weaknesses in the center's mission execution, citing a lack of formal coordination with the intelligence community, hindering its effectiveness and development of standard operating procedures. The Export Enforcement Coordination Center (EECC) has stalled its efforts to develop standard operating procedures, limiting its ability to facilitate coordination and intelligence sharing. The National Export Control Coordinator, responsible for coordination between the Justice Department and other US agencies, may see the BIS Office of Export Enforcement moved to ICE under the Trump Administration. ICE currently handles investigations and enforcement for DDTC and OFAC. The Obama Administration's reform efforts aim to consolidate licensing agencies, create a single information technology system for export control, and utilize the USXPORTS database for a proposed single export license application form to be used by multiple departments and agencies. This includes transferring the Office of Export Enforcement from the Bureau of Industry and Security to Immigration and Customs Enforcement to eliminate overlap of authority. The Obama Administration's plan involved the adoption of USXPORTS for internal communications and the development of a single license application form. Standardized definitions were implemented to ensure compliance with U.S. export regulations. The Obama Administration compiled a consolidated screening list of over 24,000 entities to comply with U.S. export regulations. This list included various screening lists from different departments. Additionally, the Administration proposed reforming encryption controls as part of the export control reform process. The Commerce Department is amending export regulations to streamline the process for encryption products, aiming to replace the current 30-60 day review with a one-time notification-and-ship process to facilitate exports and innovation while meeting national security requirements. The Commerce Department is amending export regulations to streamline the process for encryption products, allowing immediate authorization for export after submitting an electronic encryption registration. This change eliminates controls on many items where encryption is ancillary to the primary function and makes most encryption technology eligible for export to nongovernmental end-users in certain countries. The United States will also review other encryption control issues. The Commerce Department is amending export regulations to streamline the process for encryption products, allowing immediate authorization for export after submitting an electronic encryption registration. Decontrolling additional items would require approval by the members of the Wassenaar Arrangement.
