    "content": "Decentralization is a key feature of the congressional committee system, dividing legislative tasks among committees and subcommittees. They gather information, evaluate alternatives, propose solutions, report measures, oversee executive branch duties, and investigate wrongdoing. The committee system was established in 1946 by the Legislative Reorganization Act, with the House and Senate each having their own committees and rules. The congressional committee system operates with decentralization, dividing tasks among standing, select, and joint committees. Each committee has its own rules and jurisdiction, independently addressing organizational and procedural issues. Standing committees have legislative jurisdiction, considering bills, recommending measures, and overseeing agencies. Integration of policy and coordination among committees are managed by party leadership within the chambers. Standing committees have oversight responsibility to monitor agencies, programs, and activities within their jurisdictions. They recommend authorized levels of funds for government operations and have jurisdiction over appropriations, taxation, and direct spending. Select committees are established to address issues not covered by standing committees. Standing committees oversee agencies, programs, and activities within their jurisdiction, recommending funding levels and having authority over appropriations and taxation. Select committees are formed to address specific issues, while special committees are similar in function. Joint committees consist of members from both chambers and typically handle studies or housekeeping tasks. Conference committees resolve differences between Senate and House versions of a bill. Committees create subcommittees with legislative jurisdiction to focus on specific issues and tasks. Subcommittees operate under the guidelines of parent committees, with varying levels of independence. Party leaders determine committee size and member ratios. Members specialize in committee issues, with chairs holding authority. The committee's authority is centered in its chair, who determines the agenda, presides over meetings, and controls allocated funds. Rules allow others to have a share in committee business, with the ranking minority member also participating in regulation. Each subcommittee has a chair and ranking minority member. Chamber and party caucus rules limit the number of leadership positions a member may hold. Only Republicans have committee leadership term limits. Committees have leadership term limits for Republicans, with no House Republican serving as chair for more than three consecutive terms and no Senate Republican serving more than six years as chair or ranking member. Approximately 2,000 aides support committees in various roles, including writing, analyzing, amending, and overseeing laws and programs. Committees receive operating funds for expenses and staff hiring. Committees receive operating funds to hire staff who support them in various roles. The chair of a committee controls most staff and resources, with some shared with minority-party members. Committees conduct oversight to ensure legislators' policy intentions are carried out and assess program adequacy. Some committees establish separate oversight subcommittees, and each chamber assigns oversight responsibility to specific committees. Each chamber assigns oversight responsibility to specific committees, which have the exclusive right to consider measures within their jurisdiction. Committees are not required to act on every measure, and a measure cannot proceed to the floor without committee action or concurrence. Measures are typically referred immediately to a committee upon introduction, with some being referred to multiple panels in the House. A primary committee is usually designated when multiple committees receive a referral. In the Senate, referral of legislation is based on the predominant subject matter. Singly referred measures are more likely to pass and be enacted into law. Committees receive various measures but only select a small percentage for action, often choosing one measure as the primary vehicle in each policy area. Measures not chosen may still influence others through the amendment process. Committees play a powerful role in determining the fate of measures and setting a chamber's agenda. They may send measures to subcommittees for initial consideration, but only a full committee can report a measure to the floor for consideration. Committees often request written comments from executive agencies and hold hearings for legislative, oversight, or investigative purposes. Committees hold hearings for legislative, oversight, or investigative purposes. Legislative hearings address policy issues, oversight hearings focus on program implementation, and investigative hearings investigate wrongdoing or disasters. Hearings gather information, identify problems, and may lead to legislative proposals. Most hearings are held in Washington, DC. Most hearings are held in Washington, DC, but field hearings can take place outside the capital. Committees invite experts, federal officials, interest group representatives, and private citizens to testify. Witnesses may testify willingly or be summoned under subpoena. Before testifying, witnesses submit written statements and summarize orally. Committees must give at least one week public notice of hearings, which are usually open to the public and may be broadcast. After legislative hearings, committees decide whether to report a measure and hold a markup session to amend and improve it. A minimum quorum is required for a markup session, and the amending process can be formal or informal depending on the measure's contentiousness. The chair typically leads the markup, choosing the legislative vehicle for consideration and amendment. Senate committees may allow absent members to participate. Senate committees may allow absent members to vote by proxy, with a majority quorum needed to approve a measure. Committees often report measures with changes, either through various amendments or as an entirely new text. The amended measure requires approval from the chamber, accompanied by a written report. The report accompanying a measure describes its purposes, provisions, and reasons for passage. It reflects the committee's majority views and may include minority opinions. It provides cost estimates, impact statements, a section-by-section analysis, and a comparison with existing law. The executive and judicial branches use these reports to understand legislative history and Congress's intent. Measures can reach the floor through unanimous consent or suspension of rules. A measure can be extracted from a committee without its approval, such as through a motion to discharge in the House or offering it as an amendment in the Senate. The Committee on Rules in the House establishes terms for debating complex measures, including restrictions on amendments. Some measures are considered with little debate or amendment. In the Senate, noncontroversial measures are typically disposed of quickly with little debate or amendment, often through unanimous consent. More complex measures may be subject to time agreements or motions to proceed, which can limit debate and amendment. Committees play a significant role in guiding measures through the legislative process, with the chair and ranking member managing floor debate for their respective parties. Committees play a crucial role in guiding measures through the legislative process, with managers controlling debate time, responding to questions, and building coalitions. Committee members have priority in offering floor amendments, and their responsibilities extend to enacting laws. If chambers disagree on a measure, reporting committee leaders may facilitate its transmittal or negotiate at a conference committee. Chair and ranking members choose party colleagues for committees. The chair and ranking member of the reporting committee select party colleagues to serve as conferees in conference committees."
