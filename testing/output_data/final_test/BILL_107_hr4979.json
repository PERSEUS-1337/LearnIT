    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Peace Corps Charter for the 21st Century Act\" and includes findings. The Peace Corps was established in 1961 to promote world peace and friendship through American volunteers abroad. It has operated in 135 countries with 165,000 volunteers and aims to help people in developing nations, promote American values, and foster understanding between cultures. The Peace Corps, established in 1961, remains dedicated to promoting grassroots development and world peace through well-trained volunteers. It is an independent agency that prohibits any involvement with US intelligence agencies. The Crisis Corps, utilizing skills of returned volunteers, should be expanded. The Peace Corps, with an annual budget of $275,000,000, operates in 70 countries with 7,000 volunteers. There is a need to expand the Peace Corps to sponsor a minimum of 10,000 volunteers, especially in areas with substantial Muslim populations to promote understanding and tolerance. President George W. Bush has called for doubling the number of volunteers in service. The Peace Corps aims to increase the number of volunteers to 15,000 by the end of fiscal year 2007. This expansion should not compromise the quality of the volunteer experience and requires additional support staff. Establishing an office of strategic planning is recommended for program evaluation and long-term planning. The Peace Corps would benefit from bipartisan advice for its expansion. The Peace Corps plans to expand to 15,000 volunteers by 2007 and seeks bipartisan advice for its growth, including a streamlined National Peace Corps Advisory Council of returned volunteers. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Defines key terms like \"appropriate congressional committees,\" \"Director,\" \"Peace Corps volunteer,\" and \"returned Peace Corps volunteer.\" SEC. 4. RESTATEMENT OF INDEPENDENCE OF THE PEACE CORPS. SEC. 4 of the Peace Corps Act emphasizes the independence of the Peace Corps in recruiting volunteers and ensuring that volunteers remain separate from foreign policy-making and intelligence collection. The Peace Corps Act is amended to require consultations and reports on new initiatives. The Director must consult with the Peace Corps National Advisory Council and submit a report to the Senate and House Committees on Foreign Relations and International Relations before implementing any new initiative. The report must include objectives, cost estimates, impact on existing programs, and volunteer safety. The Peace Corps Act is amended to require annual reports on security procedures in countries where the Peace Corps operates programs. Recommendations may include colocating volunteers with organizations or placing multiple volunteers in one location. The Peace Corps Act now requires a report on student loan forgiveness programs available to volunteers, comparing them with other government programs. Special volunteer recruitment and placement for countries seeking to foster greater understanding by and about their citizens. The Director of the Peace Corps will submit a report to congressional committees detailing initiatives to recruit volunteers with language skills for countries aiming to promote understanding among diverse cultures, including those with substantial Muslim populations. The Director of the Peace Corps is urged to prioritize recruitment of volunteers with language and cultural expertise, especially those with experience in countries with significant Muslim populations. Additionally, $5,000,000 is authorized annually for recruiting, training, and placing Peace Corps volunteers. The Peace Corps focuses on recruiting, training, and placing volunteers in countries to promote understanding among citizens. SEC. 7. GLOBAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES INITIATIVE. The Director, in collaboration with various health organizations, will develop a training program for Peace Corps volunteers on infectious diseases to support global efforts. Definitions for AIDS, HIV, and HIV/AIDS are provided in the section. The term \"infectious diseases\" includes HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, affecting individuals infected with HIV or living with AIDS. SEC. 8. PEACE CORPS ADVISORY COUNCIL. Section 12 of the Peace Corps Act is amended to make recommendations for utilizing the expertise of returned Peace Corps volunteers in fulfilling the goals of the Peace Corps. The Peace Corps Act is amended to specify that all members of the Council must be former Peace Corps volunteers, with a limit of four members from the same political party. The members will serve 2-year terms, and the President will designate a Chair. The President designates a voting member of the Council as Chair for up to two years. The Council must hold regular quarterly meetings, and submit an annual report to the President and Director of the Peace Corps. SEC. 9. READJUSTMENT ALLOWANCES amended to increase from $125 to $200. SEC. 10. Programs and projects for returned Peace Corps volunteers to promote Peace Corps goals. The section aims to support returned Peace Corps volunteers in developing programs and projects aligned with the Peace Corps objectives. Grants will be awarded to nonprofit corporations in the District of Columbia to serve as incubators for volunteers pursuing community-based projects. Eligibility for grants is based on competitive criteria. Nonprofit corporations seeking grants must have a board of directors composed of returned Peace Corps volunteers with relevant backgrounds. The director must also be a returned Peace Corps volunteer with management expertise. The corporation's purpose is to facilitate funding for projects by individual volunteers in line with Peace Corps goals. The corporation may also handle accounting for tax purposes. Grants for nonprofit corporations supporting Peace Corps projects must adhere to specific requirements, including using funds for approved programs, limiting administrative expenses to 20%, and not exceeding $100,000 per project. Nonprofit corporations receiving grants must raise private funds for 40% of their annual budget to qualify for funding under this section. Up to $10,000,000 is available annually for the grant program. Supported corporations are not considered part of the US government, and factors are considered when awarding grants. The Director balances the number of nonprofit corporations awarded grants with overhead costs. Grant recipients are subject to Congressional oversight procedures. SEC. 11 of the Peace Corps Act authorizes appropriations of $465 million for fiscal year 2004, $500 million for fiscal year 2005, $560 million for fiscal year 2006, and $560 million for fiscal year 2007.
