This includes developing methods of hydrogen production that minimize greenhouse gas emissions and fostering the use of hydrogen as a major energy source. The Secretary is directed to develop a program for technology assessment, information transfer, and education on hydrogen use in isolated areas and foreign economic development to reduce environmental damage from fossil fuel use. The Secretary is directed to develop a program for technology assessment, information transfer, and education on hydrogen use in isolated areas and foreign economic development to reduce environmental damage from fossil fuel use. Additionally, a report to Congress is required. Section 103 of the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 is amended to include an analysis of hydrogen-related activities in the US government, recommendations from the Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel, and an analysis of State involvement. The Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 is amended to include a comprehensive coordination plan for hydrogen energy prepared by the Secretary in consultation with other Federal agencies. The Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 is amended to include a comprehensive coordination plan for hydrogen energy. Section 104 of the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 is amended to include provisions for cost-sharing in proposals from industry, requiring efforts to obtain non-Federal funding for projects. The Secretary shall require a commitment from non-Federal sources of at least 25 percent of the project cost, with the possibility of reducing or eliminating this requirement for specific project components. The Secretary shall require a commitment from non-Federal sources of at least 25 percent of the project cost, with the possibility of reducing or eliminating this requirement for specific project components. In subsection (i), the text is amended to replace \"this chapter\" with \"this Act.\" SEC. 5. DEMONSTRATIONS.\n\nAmends Section 105 of the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 by requiring a commitment from non-Federal sources of at least 50 percent of the costs for a demonstration project, with the possibility of reducing this requirement based on technological risks and project objectives.\n\nSEC. 6. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER. Section 106 of the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 is amended to accelerate wider application of hydrogen technologies in foreign countries to increase the global market and foster global economic development. Section 106 of the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 is amended to provide advice and assistance to accelerate economic development without harmful environmental effects. Subsection (b) is also revised to reorganize paragraphs and clarify the Secretary's role in providing information. The Spark M.

Subsection (b) is revised to reorganize paragraphs and clarify the Secretary's role in providing information, including developing an information exchange program with relevant federal agencies and industry. SEC. 7. TECHNICAL PANEL REVIEW. The Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 is amended to change the membership and terms of the technical panel, with members serving staggered terms of up to 3 years. The technical panel members' terms are staggered to ensure continuity, allowing for reappointment. The panel now has a chairperson, and the items under subsection (d) have been revised. The Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel will review its membership composition and may appoint new members within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The panel's structure has been updated to include a plan developed under the Hydrogen Future Act of 1996. SEC. 8 of the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 2002 to 2006, starting at $60,000,000 and increasing annually. SEC. 9 focuses on fuel cells. Integration of Fuel Cells With Hydrogen Production Systems is amended to incorporate fuel cells into government facilities for various applications. Subsection (b) is modified for a different basis, while subsection (c)(2) is adjusted for proposed projects. Subsection (d) is replaced with new provisions. The Hydrogen Future Act of 1996 is amended to require a 50 percent non-Federal share for demonstration projects, with the Secretary having the discretion to reduce this requirement based on technological risks and project objectives. Additionally, cooperative and cost-sharing agreements are updated to integrate technical information, with section 202 being redesignated as section 205. The Hydrogen Future Act of 1996 is amended to require a 50 percent non-Federal share for demonstration projects, with the Secretary having the discretion to reduce this requirement based on technological risks and project objectives. Section 202 is redesignated as section 205, and a new section 201 is inserted.
