    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"21st Century Classrooms Act for Private Technology Investment.\" The Congress finds that America's schools need to be equipped for the 21st Century with rigorous academic instruction and technological literacy to prepare students for future jobs requiring technology skills. Many classrooms lack essential technology despite the dedication of teachers, families, and students. Our Nation's classrooms lack important technological resources needed to prepare teachers and students for a technologically advanced future. Despite the transformative impact of advanced technology on America's economy and quality of life, schools have not fully embraced technology in education. Only a small percentage of classrooms are connected to the Internet, with outdated computers like the Apple 2c still in use. Bringing America's classrooms into the 21st Century requires a major national investment in technology, including computers, software, and interactive interconnectivity. Congress has authorized and funded programs for education technology, but the scale of the need extends into the tens of billions of dollars. The purpose of this Act is to bring classrooms into the 21st Century by encouraging businesses to invest in technology for education, expanding technological literacy, and directing private enterprise towards the education of young people. SEC. 3. CONTRIBUTIONS FOR COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT FOR ELEMENTARY OR SECONDARY SCHOOL PURPOSES. Contributions of computer technology and equipment for elementary or secondary school purposes are subject to a special rule limiting the reduction in charitable contributions. The term \"qualified elementary or secondary educational contribution\" refers to a charitable contribution made for these educational purposes. A corporation can make a charitable contribution of computer technology or equipment to educational organizations or entities supporting elementary and secondary education to qualify for a special rule limiting the reduction in charitable contributions. To qualify for a special rule limiting the reduction in charitable contributions, a corporation can make a contribution of computer technology or equipment to educational organizations or entities supporting K-12 education in the United States. The contribution must be made within 2 years of acquiring the property, with the property primarily used for educational purposes and not exchanged for money or other property except for shipping. The contribution of computer technology or equipment to educational organizations or entities supporting K-12 education in the United States must meet specific criteria, including being used for educational purposes, not exchanged for money, and fitting into the entity's education plan. Contributions to private foundations must also meet certain requirements to be considered qualified elementary or secondary educational contributions. The contribution of computer technology or equipment to educational organizations or entities supporting K-12 education in the United States must meet specific criteria, including being used for educational purposes, not exchanged for money, and fitting into the entity's education plan.

The term 'computer technology or equipment' includes software, hardware, and fiber optic cable related to computer use. The term 'corporation' is defined as in paragraph (4)(D). Contributions of cash for computer technology and equipment for elementary or secondary school purposes by corporations are subject to specific criteria. The charitable contribution of cash for acquiring computer technology or equipment will be treated as 110 percent of the contribution amount. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years starting after the enactment of this Act."
