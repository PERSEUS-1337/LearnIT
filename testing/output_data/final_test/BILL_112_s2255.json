Congress finds that the Vietnam War was fought in South Vietnam from 1961 to 1975, involving North Vietnamese forces, Viet Cong guerrillas, and US Armed Forces. The US got involved to support South Vietnam against the Communist threat. US military advisors were sent in 1961, and the Gulf of Tonkin incidents in 1964 led to increased US involvement. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964 gave the President authority to prosecute the war in Vietnam. US ground combat units arrived in 1965, with troop numbers peaking at 543,000 in 1969. The Treaty of Paris in 1973 required the release of US prisoners-of-war and the withdrawal of all US Armed Forces from South Vietnam by March 29, 1973. The Vietnam War ended with North Vietnamese forces capturing Saigon in 1975, leading to South Vietnam falling under Communist control. Over 58,000 US Armed Forces members died and 300,000 were wounded. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial was dedicated in 1982 to honor those who served. The war was divisive in the US, with veterans waiting for recognition and acknowledgment. The establishment of a \"Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day\" on March 29 is proposed to honor the US Armed Forces members who served bravely during the Vietnam War, despite being wrongly criticized for policy decisions made by presidential administrations. The President may proclaim March 29 as Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day to honor and recognize the contributions of veterans who served in Vietnam. States and local governments are encouraged to establish this day, and the people of the United States are urged to observe it with appropriate ceremonies to show appreciation and resolve. The text chunk promotes awareness of the faithful service and contributions of Vietnam War veterans, emphasizes the importance of communities empowering veterans and their families for readjustment to civilian life, and encourages opportunities for Vietnam War veterans to support younger veterans in rehabilitation and reintegration into civilian life after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. The text chunk amends the table of sections for chapter 1 of title 36, United States Code, to support the reintegration of younger veterans into civilian life. The text chunk establishes \"Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day\" to aid in the reintegration of younger veterans into civilian life."
