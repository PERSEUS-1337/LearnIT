    "content": "The \"Taxpayer Empowerment Act\" includes a new section called \"Taxpayer Empowerment Form\" in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. An eligible individual can file a taxpayer empowerment form with the Secretary by April 15 each year. The form can be submitted with Form 1040, 1040A, or 1040EZ. The term 'eligible individual' refers to someone eligible to vote in a Federal election by April 15, determined without registration requirements. The Secretary uses state data to determine eligibility based on disenfranchisement due to mental incompetency or criminal record. The taxpayer empowerment form includes the name, address, and TIN of the eligible individual, a certification statement of eligibility, major outlay categories for the ending fiscal year, and an estimate of overall percentage reduction in all major outlay categories for the beginning fiscal year. The taxpayer empowerment form requires the eligible individual to allocate a percentage of budget authority for each major outlay category for the upcoming fiscal year, with a statement that any difference from 100% reflects the individual's desire to adjust total spending. The taxpayer empowerment form allows individuals to adjust total spending by allocating budget authority for major outlay categories, with limitations on percentage changes. Major outlay categories are defined for this purpose. The term 'major outlay categories' refers to specific areas of government spending, including National Defense, International Affairs, General Science, Energy, Agriculture, Education, Health, Veterans Benefits, Social Security, and more. The Secretary is required to report on these categories by October 15 each year. The Secretary must compile and report the budgeting decisions of eligible individuals by October 15 each year.
