    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) is the main federal aid source for elementary and secondary education, with Title I-A providing aid for disadvantaged students. ESEA was enacted in 1965 to improve educational quality, and was reauthorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in 2015. ESSA authorized appropriations for ESEA programs through FY2020, with $25.9 billion allocated. ESSA also revised educational accountability requirements for ESEA fund recipients. Under the ESEA, as amended by the ESSA, states receiving Title I-A funds must focus on educational accountability. This includes monitoring and improving student achievement outcomes and closing achievement gaps. States must have content standards, academic achievement standards, and aligned assessments in RLA, mathematics, and science. An accountability system with performance goals, weighted indicators, and differentiation is required to identify schools needing support for student achievement. States receiving Title I-A funds must develop a detailed academic accountability system in their state plan, which must be approved by the U.S. Department of Education. The plan must be developed in consultation with various education stakeholders and peer-reviewed before being approved by the Secretary of Education. It must be periodically reviewed and revised as needed to reflect changes in the state's strategies. The SEA must review and revise its state plan to reflect changes in strategies or programs under Title I-A. State plans can be submitted individually or as a consolidated state plan. All SEAs have submitted consolidated state plans, which have been approved by the Secretary for all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The report discusses Title I-A requirements for academic standards, assessments, and state accountability systems. Special rules apply to schools funded by the Bureau of Indian Education, and there is an examination of SEA and LEA report card and reporting. The report discusses Title I-A requirements for academic standards, assessments, and state accountability systems, including special rules for schools funded by the Bureau of Indian Education. Each state receiving Title I-A funds must have state standards in specific subject areas and provide assurance of adopting challenging academic content standards aligned in RLA, mathematics, and science. The achievement standards for public schools must include at least three levels of achievement and align with entrance requirements for higher education. States can adopt alternate achievement standards for students with significant cognitive disabilities, which must be defined relative to cognitive functioning and adaptive behavior. Alternate achievement standards for students with significant cognitive disabilities must align with state academic content standards, promote access to the general education curriculum, and ensure the highest possible standards achievable. These standards must be included in the student's individualized education program (IEP) as per the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and should support the student's path towards postsecondary education or employment. Additionally, states must adopt English language proficiency (ELP) standards covering speaking, listening, reading, and writing for English learners (ELs) at different proficiency levels, aligned with academic content standards. High-quality academic assessments in mathematics, RLA, and science must be implemented. The state must implement high-quality academic assessments in mathematics, RLA, science, and other chosen subjects. These assessments must align with state academic content standards, provide timely information on student achievement, and be used for reliable and valid purposes. The assessments should objectively measure academic knowledge and skills without assessing personal beliefs or attitudes. The state must administer high-quality academic assessments in mathematics, RLA, science, and other chosen subjects. Assessments should align with state standards, measure academic achievement objectively, and may include various measures such as portfolios or projects. Mathematics and RLA assessments are required in grades 3 through 8 and once in high school, while science assessments must be given in three grade spans. In total, a state must administer 17 assessments to comply with Title I-A requirements. The state must administer 17 assessments to comply with Title I-A requirements, with no student required to take more than 3 assessments in mathematics, RLA, and science. Assessments must allow for the participation of all students, including those with disabilities and ELs. States may exempt students with significant cognitive disabilities, provide RLA assessments in another language for ELs, and extend assessment time on a case-by-case basis. An LEA can extend the time for assessing a student in a language other than English by up to two years if needed. States must use assessment results for accountability and reporting, with assessments disaggregated by various subgroups for accountability purposes. Assessment results must be disaggregated by various subgroups including economically disadvantaged students, students with disabilities, English proficiency status, gender, migrant status, homeless status, foster care status, and military parent status. Individual student reports should provide detailed achievement analysis to address specific academic needs. States must include all English Learners (ELs) in their statewide assessment systems and disaggregate results for these students based on their responses to specific assessment items. ELs may participate in assessments in a language other than English under certain circumstances. Each state plan must identify languages spoken \"to a significant extent\" in the student population and indicate languages for which state assessments are needed but not available. The state must make efforts to develop assessments for these languages. ELs participate in English language proficiency assessments and statewide assessment systems based on their language proficiency and years of schooling in the United States. The state must develop assessments for languages spoken \"to a significant extent\" in the student population. The state may request assistance to identify appropriate assessments, but the Secretary cannot mandate a specific assessment. Each state plan must show that LEAs will administer annual English proficiency assessments aligned with ELP standards for all ELs in K-12. ELP scores from previous years cannot be carried over to the following year. The ESEA allows for ELs to be exempt from certain assessments in their first year of enrollment, but they still have to participate in math and ELP assessments. The ESSA provides a second option where states can assess and report the performance of recently arrived ELs on RLA and math assessments for each year of enrollment. In the first year of enrollment, ELs may be exempt from some assessments, but must participate in math and ELP assessments. In the second year, student growth on RLA and math assessments must be included. From the third year onwards, performance on RLA and math assessments must be included in the state's accountability system. Formerly identified ELs' scores can be included in the EL subgroup for four years after becoming proficient in English. All students with disabilities must be included in statewide assessments. States must include all students with disabilities in the statewide assessment system and disaggregate results for these students. Most students with disabilities take the general academic assessment, but those with significant cognitive disabilities can take an alternate assessment. The term \"most significant cognitive disabilities\" is not federally defined, so states must define it based on cognitive functioning and adaptive behavior. The IEP team determines eligibility for the alternate assessment. The IEP team determines when a student with disabilities will participate in an alternate assessment based on alternate achievement standards. Parents must be informed about this decision and how it may impact their child's high school diploma. States must ensure that alternate assessments align with ESEA requirements and are administered appropriately. The 1% cap on the number of students assessed with alternate assessments in each subject can be waived by the state with approval from the Secretary. This cap does not apply at the LEA level. The 1% cap on the number of students assessed with alternate assessments can be waived by the state with approval from the Secretary. An LEA may administer alternate assessments to more than 1% of students if justified. Waiver requests must be submitted at least 90 days prior to testing, include subgroup data, and demonstrate monitoring of LEAs. The state must monitor LEAs assessing more than 1% of students with disabilities using alternate assessments, address disproportionality issues, and provide a plan for improvement. Additional support for LEAs and monitoring of assessment practices are required. If requesting a waiver extension, the state must meet all requirements and show substantial progress. The state must demonstrate substantial progress towards achieving each component of the prior year's plan and timeline for using alternate assessments consistent with IDEA. The state plan must incorporate universal design in alternate assessments and ensure educators are trained to administer them. The ESEA allows for flexibility in assessment systems, including administering advanced mathematics assessments in middle school. The state has the flexibility to administer advanced mathematics assessments in middle school and locally selected assessments in high school. Students can be exempt from regular 8th-grade math assessments if they take more advanced end-of-course assessments. In high school, students must take a more advanced math assessment to measure proficiency for Title I-A accountability. In high school, students must take a locally selected high school assessment approved by the state to measure mathematics proficiency for Title I-A accountability purposes. This assessment can include the SAT, ACT, Advanced Placement exams, ACCUPLACER, or ASVAB. If a state already uses one of these assessments for accountability, the LEA does not need to request its use. The state must approve the use of SAT or ACT as a high school assessment if it is not already the statewide assessment. The SEA establishes criteria for approving locally selected assessments, which must meet technical standards and be peer-reviewed before being used by LEAs. The SEA sets criteria for approving locally selected high school assessments, which must align with state standards, provide valid data on academic achievement, and differentiate between schools within the state. The LEA may choose to submit a locally selected high school assessment to the SEA for approval, notifying parents of the difference from the state assessment. States can use computer adaptive assessments that meet state requirements, allowing measurement of academic ability above and below grade level. ESEA specifies additional requirements for compliance with general assessment standards. The provision allows states to use computer adaptive assessments to measure students' academic proficiency with respect to state standards. This includes assessing growth towards standards and proficiency above or below grade level. States can also use these assessments for students with significant cognitive disabilities, as long as they meet legislative requirements for alternate assessments. The ESEA allows states to use computer adaptive assessments to measure academic achievement and English language proficiency. It includes a demonstration authority for innovative assessment systems that could replace Title I-A assessments. States can apply for this authority to develop competency-based, instructionally embedded, interim, cumulative year-end, or performance-based assessments. The ESEA allows states to use computer adaptive assessments to measure academic achievement and English language proficiency. A maximum of seven SEAs, including not more than four states participating in consortia, may receive the authority to develop innovative assessment systems. Separate funding is not provided under the demonstration authority, but states can use State Assessment Grant program funding. States and consortia may apply for an initial three-year demonstration period to implement innovative assessment systems in a subset of LEAs, with the possibility of a two-year extension for statewide implementation if successful. The ESEA allows states to implement innovative assessment systems for academic achievement and English language proficiency. States can apply for a three-year demonstration period, with a possible two-year extension for statewide use if successful. The innovative assessments must meet general Title I-A state assessment requirements and may include competency-based, instructionally embedded, interim, cumulative year-end, and performance-based assessments. Reporting results may align with state achievement standards. There are provisions for parent rights, assessment time limits, and participation in NAEP. Parents can opt-out of assessments if allowed by state or local law. States can set limits on assessment time as a percentage of annual instructional hours. States must participate in NAEP to receive Title I-A funds. To receive Title I-A funds, states must participate in biennial state NAEP assessments in reading and math for grades 4 and 8. NAEP is known as the \"Nation's Report Card\" and provides a nationally representative assessment of student knowledge. Participation is voluntary at the individual level, with results reported at national, state, and LEA levels. Schools and students are selected for assessments to create representative samples. Results are not reported at the school or individual student levels. States must submit a plan to ED to receive Title I-A funds. Each state must submit a plan to the Department of Education under Title I-A, outlining its accountability system based on academic standards and assessments in reading and math. The system must meet various requirements, including disaggregating data for specific student subgroups such as economically disadvantaged students, major racial/ethnic groups, children with disabilities, and English learners. States set their own minimum group size for accountability determinations. Each state must determine the minimum number of students needed to implement data disaggregation requirements, ensuring statistical soundness and protecting personally identifiable information. The state must involve stakeholders in the process and use the same minimum group size for all students and subgroups. Long-term goals for academic achievement and graduation rates must be established for all students and subgroups. The state must establish long-term goals for academic achievement and graduation rates for all students and subgroups. These goals must consider closing statewide achievement gaps and include measures for English learners' progress in achieving English proficiency. Indicators based on these goals must be used to measure student performance annually, including student proficiency in RLA and Mathematics assessments, and possibly student growth in high schools. The state must establish long-term goals for academic achievement and graduation rates for all students and subgroups, including measures for English learners' progress in achieving English proficiency. Public schools are required to measure student growth, graduation rates, English language proficiency, and school quality or student success indicators. Each state must annually assess at least 95% of all public school students in math and RLA. The state must ensure at least 95% participation in math and RLA assessments for all students and subgroups. States have the flexibility to determine how failing to meet the participation rate will impact school performance evaluations. A state must ensure 95% participation in math and RLA assessments for all students and subgroups. Failing to meet the participation rate may affect a school's rating in the state's accountability system. The proficiency rate is calculated based on 95% of all students or the number of participating students, whichever is higher. This means a school's proficiency rate on assessments cannot exceed 84.2%. The SEA must establish an annual system for differentiating public schools based on key indicators, giving more weight to certain indicators than others. Schools with consistently underperforming student subgroups will be identified for comprehensive support and improvement. This includes the lowest-performing 5% of Title I-A funded schools and all failing public high schools. The Every Student Succeeds Act identifies schools for comprehensive support and improvement based on key indicators, including the lowest-performing 5% of Title I-A funded schools, all failing public high schools, schools requiring additional targeted support and improvement, and other statewide categories at the state's discretion. High schools can be identified for comprehensive support and improvement regardless of Title I-A funding. States have the authority to determine additional schools for this designation. Non-Title I-A schools identified for CSI can receive school improvement funds under Section 1003, but this does not change their Title I-A status. SEAs must notify LEAs if any schools are identified for CSI, and LEAs must work with stakeholders to develop a support and improvement plan that meets specific requirements. The ESEA defines evidence-based as activities or interventions that show a significant effect on student outcomes based on well-designed studies. There are three levels of evidence: strong evidence from a study, moderate evidence from a quasi-experimental study, and rationale based on research findings. The ESEA defines evidence-based as activities or interventions that show a significant effect on student outcomes based on well-designed studies, including strong evidence from a study, moderate evidence from a quasi-experimental study, and promising evidence from a correlational study with statistical controls. School improvement funds may only be used for evidence-based interventions with a statistically significant effect. Differentiated improvement activities may be permitted for high schools identified for CSI. The ESEA defines evidence-based interventions for schools serving at-risk students. LEAs may permit transfer options for students in schools identified for CSI, prioritizing low-achieving children from low-income families. Students opting to transfer must be allowed to remain until completion of the highest grade available. The ESEA allows for transfer options for students in schools identified for CSI, prioritizing low-achieving children from low-income families. Students opting to transfer must be allowed to remain until completion of the highest grade available. An LEA may use up to 5% of its Title I-A allocation for transportation costs related to public school choice. States must identify schools for targeted support and improvement (TSI) where a subgroup of students consistently underperforms, with the state having discretion in defining this term. SEAs notify LEAs of schools identified for TSI, which then work with stakeholders to address underperformance. The school must work with stakeholders to develop a TSI plan to improve student outcomes based on indicators for each subgroup identified by the SEA. The plan must include evidence-based interventions, be approved by the LEA, monitored upon implementation, and lead to additional action if unsuccessful. If a subgroup performs poorly, the school must be identified for CSI. CSI as one of the lowest performing 5% of schools in the state must be identified for additional targeted support and improvement (ATSI) activities, including addressing resource inequities. If a Title I-A school identified for ATSI does not improve within a state-determined timeframe, it will be identified for CSI. States were required to notify LEAs if any of their schools met ATSI requirements for the 2017-2018 school year, with an extension given for compliance by the 2018-2019 school year in some cases. For the 2018-2019 school year, schools for ATSI were identified following their initial identification for TSI. Each school is evaluated individually to determine if it meets ATSI criteria and could be identified for CSI if it fails to improve. There is no limit on the number of schools that may be identified for both TSI and ATSI. Every school identified for TSI could also be identified for ATSI, depending on the state's definition of consistently underperforming. If a school fails to improve within a set number of years, more rigorous state-determined action must be taken. SEAs must review resource allocation to support school improvement in each LEA periodically. SEAs must periodically review resource allocation to support school improvement in LEAs with a significant number of schools identified for CSI or implementing TSI. They are also required to provide technical assistance to these LEAs. SEAs have the option to initiate additional improvement in LEAs with a significant number of schools consistently identified for CSI or implementing TSI plans. Alternative evidence-based state-determined strategies may be established for LEAs to assist schools identified for CSI. The statutory language does not specify the use of these strategies. The ESEA requires SEAs to reserve Title I-A funds for school improvement, with a minimum of 7% or the amount reserved in FY2016. States must allocate at least 95% of these funds to LEAs for schools implementing CSI through formula or competitive grants. LEAs cannot receive less Title I-A funding than the prior year due to this provision in FY2018 and beyond. SEAs must allocate at least 95% of Title I-A funds to LEAs for schools implementing CSI or TSI activities. Priority is given to LEAs serving high numbers of schools with improvement plans, demonstrating strong need and commitment to improving student outcomes. SEAs can reserve up to 3% of funds for direct student services. States can reserve up to 3% of Title I-A funds for direct student services, a provision not present before ESSA. 99% of these funds must be distributed to geographically diverse LEAs through a competitive grant process, prioritizing those serving schools identified for CSI or implementing TSI plans. Funds can be used for various purposes, including academic courses, credit recovery, postsecondary instruction, and public school choice. Title I-A funds support low-income students with examination costs and public school choice. States must ensure teachers meet certification requirements and prevent disproportionate rates of ineffective teachers for low-income and minority children. The BIE oversees 183 schools, with 130 tribally controlled and 53 operated by the BIE. The BIE oversees 183 schools, with 130 tribally controlled and 53 operated by the BIE. Special rules apply to BIE schools regarding standards, assessment, and accountability until meeting Section 8204 requirements. Accredited BIE schools must use state assessments or approved alternatives. The BIE schools must adopt appropriate assessments and academic indicators that meet Section 1111 requirements. Accredited BIE schools must use assessments and indicators developed by tribal accrediting agencies or divisions, with oversight by the Secretary of the Interior. ESEA Section 8204 allocates funds for the Department of the Interior to participate in developing standards, assessments, and accountability systems for BIE-funded schools. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, will use a negotiated rulemaking process to define these standards. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, is required to develop regulations for standards, assessments, and accountability systems for BIE-funded schools. Tribal governing bodies or school boards can waive these requirements if deemed inappropriate, submitting alternative proposals for approval within 60 days. The Secretaries will approve unless they do not meet ESEA Section 1111 requirements, considering the unique circumstances of the schools and students served. The Secretaries of the Interior and Education provide technical assistance to tribal governing bodies or school boards to develop alternative standards, assessments, and accountability systems. Section 1111 outlines requirements for annual public report cards at the state, LEA, and school levels, as well as data reporting to the Secretary and Congress. States and LEAs must prepare and disseminate annual report cards with various information, including privacy requirements. States receiving Title I-A funding must also distribute an annual state report. Title I-A funding requires states to prepare and distribute an annual state report card in a concise and understandable format. The report card must include information on the state's accountability system, teacher qualifications, and other required elements. Additionally, the report card must be made available on the state's website along with all LEA report cards and the annual report submitted to the Secretary. The state report card must include a clear description of the state's accountability system under Title I-A, including subgroup student numbers, long-term goals, and measures of progress. It should also detail how public schools are differentiated, including indicator weights, differentiation methodology, and identifying consistently underperforming schools for specific student subgroups. The state report card must include information about the methodology used to identify schools for Comprehensive Support and Improvement (CSI) or Targeted Support and Improvement (TSI). It should also provide details on exit criteria for CSI status and the number of years for schools to fail before being identified for CSI. Data on student performance must be included, disaggregated by various demographic groups such as race/ethnicity, economic status, disabilities, English proficiency, gender, migrant status, homeless status, and foster care status. The state report card must include information on the impact of English proficiency, gender, migrant status, homeless status, and foster care status on student achievement in mathematics, RLA, and science assessments. It should also report on high school graduation rates for different student groups, including those who are homeless or in foster care. Additionally, the report card must provide details on other academic indicators and methodologies for identifying schools for support and improvement. The state report card must include data on graduation rates, English language proficiency for EL students, performance indicators for all student groups, progress towards state goals, and assessment data for various student subgroups. The state report card must include data on graduation rates, English language proficiency for EL students, performance indicators for all student groups, progress towards state goals, assessment data for various student subgroups, and measures of school quality, climate, and safety including suspension rates, expulsions, chronic absenteeism, incidences of violence, and preschool program enrollment percentages. The CRDC collects data on the number and percentage of students in accelerated coursework for postsecondary credit in high school. SEAs and LEAs must include this data annually on report cards, with the option to report more recent data separately. The data provided are reported separately from the ED-provided data. Reporting requirements are limited to specific data elements under Section 203(c)(1) of the DEOA. State report cards must provide data on teacher qualifications, including inexperienced teachers, emergency credentials, and teachers not certified in their subject. The state report card must provide data on LEA- and school-level per-pupil expenditures of federal, state, and local funds, including actual personnel expenditures and nonpersonnel expenditures, disaggregated by funding source. Data reported must be specific to each LEA and public school, not based on average staff salary data. SEAs may want to develop uniform definitions for terms like high-poverty schools and teachers not certified in their subject. Per-pupil expenditure data for LEAs and public schools may be reported by SEAs, with the option to develop their own procedures or follow statewide guidelines. Reporting may be delayed until the 2018-2019 school year, but information on steps taken must be provided on report cards for the 2017-2018 school year. SEAs and LEAs are expected to make per-pupil expenditure data public by the end of the school year when other report card data are released. The state report card must also include additional information on student assessments. The report card must include data on student assessments, such as the number and percentage of students with significant cognitive disabilities taking alternate assessments by grade and subject. It should also show results on the state's National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) for reading and math in grades 4 and 8 compared to the national average. Additionally, data on cohort rates for all students and specific groups like economically disadvantaged students, racial/ethnic groups, children with disabilities, and English learners who graduate from high school and enroll in postsecondary education programs should be included. The state report card must include data on student assessments, NAEP results for reading and math, cohort rates for various student groups, and information on postsecondary education programs. SEAs must present this information in an easily accessible manner allowing for cross-tabulation by different demographic groups. The state report card must include data on student assessments, NAEP results for reading and math, cohort rates for various student groups, and information on postsecondary education programs. SEAs may choose to cross-tabulate data on student achievement in various subjects and graduation rates, ensuring no personally identifiable information is revealed. An LEA receiving Title I-A funds must prepare and disseminate an annual report card that is concise, understandable, and publicly accessible. The report card must include information on the LEA overall and each public school it serves, following FERPA guidelines. The SEA ensures data collection and reporting requirements are met, including disaggregation of data, but NAEP scores are not required on the LEA report card. The LEA report card does not need to include NAEP scores, as they are only available for a subset of LEAs in the US. Requirements for state report cards are modified for LEA and school report cards, allowing for comparisons at different levels. LEAs can add extra information to provide the public with updates on schools. Each SEA receiving Title I-A funds must report annually to the Secretary. The SEA must report annually to the Secretary on student achievement in mathematics, RLA, and science assessments, disaggregated for student subgroups. The report must also include information on ELs' English proficiency, public schools identified for CSI and TSI, and teacher qualifications. The Secretary must submit an annual report to congressional committees with national and state-level data on teacher qualifications, including those teaching with emergency credentials or out of their certified subject area. The report must protect individuals' privacy and only include statistically reliable information. The report cards and reports do not need to disaggregate data if it reveals identifiable information or yields unreliable data. The FAQs address educational accountability requirements under ESEA, focusing on state standards requirements. States are not obligated to submit academic standards for review. The Secretary does not have the authority to mandate or control State academic standards. Concerns about accountability systems and student preparation led to the development of Common Core State Standards Initiative for English language arts and mathematics in grades K-12. The purpose is to create shared rigorous standards for states. The Common Core State Standards Initiative aims to establish shared rigorous standards for states to voluntarily adopt, defining the knowledge and skills students need for success in college and workforce training. 45 states, the District of Columbia, four outlying areas, and the Department of Defense Education Activity have adopted these standards. Adoption has always been optional, but federal initiatives like the Race to the Top State Grant competition provided incentives for states to adopt college- and career-ready standards, with the Common Core State Standards being the most widely accepted. The Secretary does not have the authority to mandate states to use specific standards for Title I-A compliance. States have the sole decision to adopt the Common Core State Standards. FAQs have arisen regarding assessment requirements for students with disabilities and assessment flexibilities. The ESEA prohibits the Secretary from specifying assessments, as long as state-selected assessments meet statutory requirements. States have the option to use assessments aligned with Common Core State Standards, such as PARCC or Smarter Balanced, or the SAT or ACT for high school assessments. The chosen assessment must align with state standards, provide valid data, and meet assessment system requirements. The SAT and ACT can be used for high school assessments if they align with state standards and meet assessment system requirements. The SAT has aligned itself with Common Core Academic Standards, while the ACT has significant overlap with college- and career-readiness standards. The SAT and ACT can be used for high school assessments if they align with state standards and meet assessment system requirements. An Education Week survey found that 25 states require students to take the SAT or ACT, and 12 use them for federal reporting and statewide accountability systems. States may not be adopting this flexibility quickly due to challenges such as figuring out how to pay for it and designing a process for districts to apply for it. Some states have applied for waivers of the locally selected high school assessments requirements to allow flexibility in assessments. This flexibility may lead to challenges in comparing results across assessments and tracking progress over time. Some states have requested waivers to administer the ACT instead of the high school assessment, but the waiver was not approved due to a late request and lack of comparability. In the 2017-2018 school year, 28 states sought waivers to exceed the 1% cap for alternate assessments, with 23 states receiving them. 19 states were granted a one-year extension for the 2018-2019 school year, and 3 states received new waivers. The National Center on Educational Outcomes tracks student participation in alternate assessments. The ESEA, amended by the ESSA, no longer allows modified achievement standards (AA-MAS) for students with disabilities. States have transitioned away from AA-MAS since around 2014, requiring students to participate in general or alternate assessments based on alternate achievement standards (AA-AAS). Data from 2015-2016 show most states had alternate assessment participation rates between less than 1% and 2.5%, with a 2% rate exceeding statutory limits. States have transitioned away from AA-MAS to either general state assessments or AA-AAS for students with significant cognitive disabilities. The shift may have led to an overidentification of students eligible for AA-AAS, with some states requesting waivers to the 1% cap. States may need to redefine significant cognitive disability and develop strategies for transitioning students from AA-MAS to general assessments. The Secretary has granted innovative assessment authority to four states as of September 2019. Four states - Georgia, Louisiana, New Hampshire, and North Carolina - have been granted innovative assessment authority. Georgia is piloting technology-based assessments for targeted instruction, Louisiana is revamping the LEAP format, New Hampshire is enhancing the PACE system, and North Carolina is using a customized end-of-year assessment. Excessive opt-outs may impact assessment validity and accountability. Excessive opt-outs in student assessments may affect the validity and reliability of measuring student achievement, potentially leading to states failing to meet the 95% participation requirement for accountability purposes. Consequences for not meeting this threshold are determined by the state, and FAQs address implementation of ESEA accountability requirements. The ESEA accountability requirements cover topics such as student growth measures, school identification for improvement, and waivers. States have discretion but must include student proficiency on assessments. High schools can use student growth measures in addition to proficiency, while elementary and secondary schools must use either growth measures or another statewide indicator for performance differentiation. States have the option to use these measures. The state has the option to use student growth measures as indicators for school performance differentiation. The SEA is responsible for developing the state accountability system and selecting the indicators. If student growth measures are not incorporated into the system, they are not considered an accountability indicator. However, an LEA could choose to include student growth measures in their data. An LEA can include student growth measures in their data for analysis or public use, but only for limited purposes. SEAs must include specific indicators in the state accountability system, with some flexibility for additional indicators. The accountability system determines schools for CSI or TSI. LEAs can add extra indicators but not replace SEA-selected ones. Section 8401 allows the Secretary to waive ESEA requirements. Section 8401 of the ESEA allows the Secretary to waive statutory and regulatory provisions for SEAs, Indian tribes, and LEAs receiving funds. Requests for waivers can be made by SEAs or LEAs, with SEAs having the authority to submit LEA waiver requests if deemed appropriate. This flexibility enables SEAs to request waivers related to their accountability systems, such as using measures of student growth instead of proficiency in the system. An LEA can request a waiver to operate under a modified accountability system, but approval from the SEA is required before submission to the Secretary. The identification of the lowest-performing schools for CSI is based on a state-determined methodology. There are no regulations clarifying this process. Based on ED's approval of state plans, a state can choose to use all data or selected elements from the system of differentiation to identify CSI schools. Some state plans include subgroup performance, like the District of Columbia, while others, like North Carolina, only consider total scores for all students. The methodology for identifying schools for TSI begins with an SEA's identification of schools with at least one subgroup that is consistently underperforming. SEAs have the flexibility to define this group broadly or narrowly, resulting in a large group of schools being identified for TSI. ATS I schools are a subset of TSI schools, as they are identified for TSI after the first school year in which schools are identified for ATSI. ATS I schools are a subset of TSI schools. SEAs can define consistently underperforming subgroups for TSI designation, potentially aligning with ATS I criteria. This could result in the same schools being identified for both TSI and ATS I. States can choose a stricter definition for underperforming subgroups, leading to fewer schools identified for ATS I. The Bureau of Indian Education proposed a rule for developing standards, assessments, and accountability systems in BIE-funded schools, following a negotiated rulemaking process as required by the ESEA. Comments on the rule were due on August 9, 2019. The Bureau of Indian Education proposed a rule for standards, assessments, and accountability in BIE-funded schools. Comments were due on August 9, 2019, with a final rule pending as of February 14, 2020. Two FAQs on state and LEA report cards are included. Report cards for 2017-2018 must comply with ESSA, excluding per-pupil expenditures data. SEAs and LEAs can delay reporting this data until 2018-2019. They must explain the delay and make the data public by the end of the school year. SEAs and LEAs are not required to disclose why a school was identified for CSI. In report card guidance, SEAs and LEAs are not obligated to explain why a school was identified for CSI, TSI, or ATSI. They may choose to provide this information, such as specifying which subgroup led to the school's identification for TSI."
