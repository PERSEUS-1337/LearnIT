The Congress acknowledges California's rapid population growth and environmental complexity, emphasizing the need for informed environmental policies and the establishment of a California Urban Environmental Research and Education Center to promote sustainable economic development. Due to the closure of military facilities in California, a Center can aid in converting defense resources for non-defense purposes. The establishment of a Center is necessary to convert defense resources for non-defense purposes in California. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will establish the California Urban Environmental Research and Training Center in cooperation with California State University, Hayward and other universities in the California State University system. Matching funds are required for the cooperative agreement. The California State University, Hayward must provide matching funds or in-kind resources equal to 20% of the funds received from the Center to receive the cooperative agreement. The Center and the university will seek additional funds from various sources to support research and education projects. Any university in the California State University system or in California can join the Center under reasonable guidelines. The Center and the university will establish a Governing Board for a two-year period with members appointed by various California State University presidents. The Governing Board of the Center, appointed by California State University presidents, will establish criteria for membership, contribution requirements, and guidelines for fair representation. The Governing Board of the Center, appointed by California State University presidents, will establish criteria for membership, contribution requirements, and guidelines for fair representation. The Center's Executive Director, appointed for a five-year term, will oversee the awarding of scholarships, fellowships, and grants, and perform other duties as deemed necessary by the Governing Board. The Governing Board appoints each Executive Director and approves their annual budget. The Center may have a principal office in San Francisco and a second office in Southern California within two years of establishment. SEC. 3. FUNCTIONS. The Center's functions include developing environmental research programs for government and private sector use, fostering public-private partnerships, bringing researchers together to address California's environmental issues, and supporting various activities. The Center supports research activities at universities for data collection on California's environment, analysis of policy implications, and educational programs for policymakers in various sectors. The Center supports research activities at universities for data collection on California's environment, analysis of policy implications, and educational programs for policymakers in various sectors.

It also facilitates an exchange of ideas through electronic technology and national conferences on ecology and sustainable economic development for business and labor leaders. Additionally, it provides access to its expertise for policy makers at the federal, state, and local levels by sharing up-to-date information on research findings and policy development for sustainable economic development. This includes developing educational programs and degree programs to impart knowledge and skills required for environmentally sustainable economic development. The curr_chunk focuses on programs aimed at preparing individuals, particularly minority students, for careers in environmental professions. This includes developing certification programs in environmental sciences, an enriched curriculum for underrepresented minority students, and administration of these programs. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a national repository of information on environmental and economic development issues, collaboration with university research centers for an Environmental Outreach Program, and working with Federally-funded research centers. To collaborate with Federally-funded research centers like Lawrence-Livermore National Research Laboratory to transfer environmental technology to the private sector, assist small businesses in meeting environmental regulations, and work with public and private sectors on repurposing military installations for environmental planning and clean-up. The Center aims to extend its activities throughout the State by collaborating with other universities. It will focus on environmentally sound conversion and economic use of military installations. Additionally, scholarships may be awarded to individuals studying environmental fields, with preference given to those affected by the closure of military facilities in California. The Center may award graduate assistantships, fellowships, and research grants to support study and research related to sustainable economic development. The Center is required to submit an annual report to the Administrator detailing its activities and budget needs. It can receive funds and property donations to further its activities, which will be accounted for in the annual report. The Act defines the terms \"Administrator\" as the head of the EPA and \"Center\" as the California Urban Environmental Research and Education Center. It authorizes $2,500,000 for fiscal year 1995 and additional funds for 1996-1999. The Center must match funds received with contributions from other sources."
