    "content": "The \"Repetitive Flood Loss Reduction Act of 1999\" amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to include a new section focused on reducing repetitive flood losses. The terms 'United States' and 'State' now include the District of Columbia. The Director will implement a program to reduce repetitive flood losses by purchasing structures and providing grants for eligible mitigation activities. These activities must be proposed by the State, community, or local flood management agency to reduce flood risk and multiple flood claim structures. The goal is to protect against flood losses and minimize damage. The Director will implement a program to reduce repetitive flood losses by purchasing structures and providing grants for eligible mitigation activities that are cost-effective, technically feasible, and consistent with established criteria. Grants will be limited by available funds and can only be used for eligible mitigation activities proposed by flood management agencies to reduce flood risk and protect against losses. The section allows for eligible mitigation activities like elevation, relocation, demolition, or floodproofing of structures in flood-prone areas. It also includes minor physical mitigation efforts to reduce flooding severity and damage, excluding major flood control projects unless approved by the Director. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State, community, or local flood management agency must submit an application that includes a description of the mitigation activities, structures to be protected, and the total amount of flood insurance payments made for the structures. The Director must approve or reject grant applications within 30 days. Grants cannot exceed 75% of total mitigation costs, and additional information may be required. The Director must approve or reject grant applications within 30 days, with grants not exceeding 75% of total mitigation costs. Mitigation activities require at least 25% funding from non-Federal sources. The Director can offer to purchase repetitive substantial flood loss structures at a price not exceeding 125% of fair market value. The Director may purchase repetitive substantial flood loss structures if the owner accepts an offer, with coordination from the State or local flood management agency. Owners who refuse the offer may face increased premiums. The Director may establish a chargeable premium rate for structures after an offer is made, which will be 150 percent of the rate at the time of the offer. The deductible for insurance under this title will also increase by $5,000 for repetitive substantial flood loss structures upon renewal or modification of coverage. The Director may notify the owner of a repetitive substantial flood loss structure that the offer is still open. If the owner does not accept the offer and the structure sustains substantial damage in a subsequent flood event, the premium rate will be 150 percent of the original rate, with additional adjustments and increases. The Director, in consultation with regional flood plain administrators, develops a list of repetitive substantial flood loss structures. All collected amounts from deductible and premium increases are deposited into the Repetitive Flood Loss Reduction Fund. After acquiring a structure, the Director offers to transfer it to the local flood management agency. The Director offers to transfer repetitive substantial flood loss structures to the local flood management agency or the State if the agency refuses. The transfer is made without compensation and under terms set by the Director to protect the interests of the United States. Oversight is conducted to ensure compliance with approved mitigation activities for grants under this section. The Director may recapture grant funds if mitigation activities are not carried out as specified, depositing them into the Repetitive Flood Loss Reduction Fund. This fund, created within the Treasury, is available for the Director to use for mitigation efforts. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this purpose. Authorized appropriations of $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 to the Director for acquisitions and grants under this section. Definitions for \"community\" and \"repetitive substantial flood loss structure\" are provided. The curr_chunk discusses a title for structures that have experienced flood damage three or more times, with repair costs exceeding 125% of the structure's value."
