    "content": "Since 1995, thirty-one states have enacted laws banning \"partial-birth\" abortion, which remains contentious. Congress passed bans in the 104th and 105th Congresses, with the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act finally enacted in 2003. The U.S. Supreme Court also addressed the issue in Stenberg v. Carhart in 2000. In Stenberg v. Carhart, the Supreme Court addressed the issue of \"partial-birth\" abortion laws, with Congress passing bans in the 104th and 105th Congresses. The Court later upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 in Gonzales v. Carhart, stating it does not unconstitutionally restrict a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy. The Court has affirmed a woman's constitutional right to choose whether to have an abortion, allowing states to regulate abortion after fetal viability with exceptions. In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, the Court expanded a state's authority to regulate abortion by permitting regulation at the pre-viability stage so long as it does not place an \"undue burden\" on a woman's ability to have an abortion. The term \"partial-birth abortion\" refers to a procedure where the fetus is removed intact from a woman's body, known as \"intact dilation and evacuation\" or \"dilation and extraction\" (\"D & X\"). The D & X abortion procedure involves the induced dilation of the cervix, removal of the fetal body through the cervix, collapsing of the skull, and extraction of the fetus. It is one of several abortion methods, with suction curettage being common in the first trimester and induction used in early or second trimester pregnancies. The D & X abortion procedure, also known as intact dilation and extraction, is commonly performed in the second trimester of pregnancy. It involves dilating the cervix, dismembering the fetus inside the uterus, and removing fetal parts either with forceps or suction. Pro-life advocates have criticized D & X, likening it to infanticide. The D & E and D & X procedures were compared in relation to an Ohio act banning partial-birth abortions. The main difference is that D & E results in a dismembered fetus while D & X results in a relatively intact fetus. Both procedures involve compressing the fetal head, with D & E involving dismemberment before skull compression, and D & X involving intact removal of the fetus except for the head before skull compression. The procedural similarities between D & E and D & X procedures have raised concerns about potential restrictions on both methods of abortion. Challenges to partial-birth abortion statutes focus on claims of vagueness and undue burden on women seeking abortions. The Supreme Court deems laws void for vagueness if prohibitions are unclear, leading to potential arbitrary enforcement and discrimination. The Sixth Circuit considered whether a ban on partial-birth abortions imposes an undue burden on a woman's ability to have an abortion. In Voinovich, the court found that an Ohio statute attempting to ban the D & X procedure was unconstitutional under Casey. The court determined that the language of the statute targeted the D & X procedure but also encompassed the D & E procedure, the most common method of second-trimester abortions. The court found that a Nebraska statute banning partial-birth abortions created an undue burden on women seeking abortions in the second trimester. The statute allowed the procedure only if necessary to save the mother's life due to a physical disorder, illness, or injury. The term \"partial birth abortion\" was defined as delivering a living unborn child vaginally before killing it. The Nebraska statute banned partial-birth abortions, defining it as delivering a living unborn child vaginally before killing it. Violation of the statute carried a prison term of up to twenty years and a fine of up to $25,000, with automatic revocation of the doctor's medical license. Dr. Carhart argued that the term \"substantial portion\" was unclear and could include common D & E procedures in the ban. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit interpreted the Nebraska statute banning partial-birth abortions to include both the D & X and D & E procedures due to the lack of a clear definition for \"substantial portion.\" The state argued that the statute only applied to the deliberate and intentional performance of a partial birth abortion. The Eighth Circuit interpreted the Nebraska statute banning partial-birth abortions to include the D & X and D & E procedures. The Supreme Court affirmed this decision, citing the lack of a health exception and an undue burden on the right to choose abortion. The Supreme Court affirmed the Eighth Circuit's decision on the Nebraska statute banning partial-birth abortions, stating that a health exception must be included due to the significant health risks involved in prohibiting the D & X procedure. The Supreme Court upheld the Nebraska statute banning partial-birth abortions, stating that the statute covered both D & X and D & E procedures. Justice O'Connor's concurrence raised concerns among supporters of a woman's right to choose. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1999, S. 1692, and H.R. 3660 were introduced and passed by the Senate and House, respectively, with support for a statute prohibiting partial-birth abortions with exceptions for the mother's health. Justice O'Connor identified states with appropriate statutes differentiating between procedures. S. 1692 and H.R. 3660 proposed criminal penalties for physicians performing partial-birth abortions, defined as delivering a living fetus partially outside the mother's body to kill it. The bills also allowed for a private right of action for certain family members. President Clinton vetoed a partial-birth abortion bill during the 105th Congress due to the lack of exceptions for cases where the procedure was necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. H.R. 4965, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2002, was introduced by Representative Steve Chabot on June 19, 2002. H.R. 4965, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2002, introduced by Representative Steve Chabot, passed the House on July 24, 2002. The bill aimed to prohibit physicians from performing a partial-birth abortion except to save the life of a mother endangered by physical conditions related to the pregnancy. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2002 aimed to prohibit physicians from performing a partial-birth abortion, with penalties for violations. Supporters argued that such abortions were never necessary for a woman's health. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 was signed into law on November 5, 2003. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 was passed by the Senate with a vote of 64-34, resembling the 2002 act in language and form. It prohibits physicians from performing a partial-birth abortion except to save the life of a mother endangered by physical conditions related to the pregnancy. Violators face fines, imprisonment, or both. Unlike previous rulings, this act does not include a health exception, as highlighted by Senator Rick Santorum. Senator Santorum argued against the need for a health exception in the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, citing risks associated with the procedure. Federal courts initially blocked enforcement, but the Supreme Court later upheld the Act in Gonzales v. Carhart, stating it did not impose an undue burden on a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy. The federal statute on partial-birth abortion is not considered unconstitutionally vague as it clearly defines prohibited conduct for doctors. It includes specific \"anatomical landmarks\" to determine when the act's prohibitions apply, and a knowledge requirement further clarifies the law. The Supreme Court upheld the Act in Gonzales v. Carhart, stating it does not unduly burden a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy. The Court concluded that a doctor performing the D & E procedure would not face criminal liability if a fetus is delivered beyond the prohibited points by mistake. The federal statute does not impose an undue burden on a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy, as it does not encompass the D & E procedure. The Court clarified that the federal statute does not apply to the D&E procedure, as it involves the removal of fetal parts rather than delivering a living fetus. This distinction ensures that the statute is not overbroad and does not hinder a woman's ability to terminate her pregnancy. The absence of a health exception was also deemed not to impose an undue burden. In Planned Parenthood of Northern New England v. the Court upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 without a health exception, citing medical uncertainty as a basis for not imposing an undue burden. The Court acknowledged potential instances where the prohibited procedure may be necessary. In an as-applied challenge, exceptions to the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 should be considered, as Justice Ginsburg criticized the Court's decision to uphold the statute without a health exception, citing safety advantages for women with certain medical conditions. Justice Ginsburg criticized the Court's decision to uphold the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 without a health exception, citing the necessity of such exceptions for women's safety in certain medical conditions. She expressed perplexity at the refusal to invalidate the statute on facial grounds, noting the Court's previous decision in Stenberg where a similar statute lacking a health exception was deemed unconstitutional. Ginsburg argued that the decision seemed to undermine women's rights and was an attempt to erode established precedents. Justice Ginsburg criticized the Court's decision to uphold the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 without a health exception, arguing that the statute expressed hostility towards the rights secured by Roe and Casey. She emphasized that burdening constitutional rights with measures driven by hostility is undue."
