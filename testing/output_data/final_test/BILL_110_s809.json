    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Small Public Housing Authorities Paperwork Reduction Act\" and pertains to public housing agency plans for certain qualified public housing agencies. The \"Small Public Housing Authorities Paperwork Reduction Act\" amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to exempt certain qualified public housing agencies from filing requirements. The \"Small Public Housing Authorities Paperwork Reduction Act\" exempts qualified public housing agencies from submitting an annual public housing agency plan, but they must still make a civil rights certification annually. The term 'qualified public housing agency' is defined as a public housing agency that administers 500 or fewer public housing units or any number of vouchers under section 8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 and is not designated as a troubled agency. Qualified public housing agencies with 500 or fewer units must establish resident advisory boards and consult with them during annual public hearings, despite being exempt from submitting an annual public housing plan. Public housing agencies must hold public hearings regarding any changes to their goals, objectives, and policies. Waiver authority applies to qualified public housing agencies, with specific substitutions for certain functions. Qualified public housing agencies are required to conduct annual public hearings to discuss changes to their goals, objectives, and policies, and invite public comments on these changes. The agency must provide information and notice at least 45 days before the hearing. The housing agency must make all relevant information available for public inspection at their office and publish a notice about the public hearing to discuss changes in goals, objectives, and policies."
