Congress makes findings regarding the abduction of 276 female students by Boko Haram from a school in Nigeria, the closure of schools due to attacks, and the threat of selling the kidnapped girls into slavery. Boko Haram has targeted schools, mosques, churches, villages, and government facilities in northern Nigeria to create an Islamic state. The group has killed over 4,000 people since 2011 and poses a threat to US interests in the region. There is a possibility that the abducted girls may have been taken to neighboring countries. The United States deployed military personnel to Chad to locate kidnapped schoolgirls and support counter-terrorism efforts in the Sahel region. Cameroon, Niger, and Chad also deployed troops to secure borders against Boko Haram. The US designated Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2013. In May 2014, Boko Haram was added to the UN sanctions list for terrorist organizations. The US Senate and House passed resolutions condemning Boko Haram for abducting female students in Nigeria. The United States aims to resolve the conflict in northeast Nigeria and Boko Haram-affected areas by eliminating the threat posed by Boko Haram, rescuing abducted individuals, and supporting reconstruction and reconciliation efforts. A regional strategy for defeating Boko Haram is required. The President must develop a regional strategy within 90 days to support efforts against Boko Haram, protect civilians, and enforce the rule of law.

The United States demonstrates commitment to transparent and accountable reconstruction in Boko Haram-affected areas of Nigeria by increasing oversight activities, committing substantial funds, and coordinating with other donor nations to strengthen accountability mechanisms for recovery efforts. The sense of Congress is that bilateral assistance to Nigeria should be withheld if the Government is not committed to transparent and accountable reconstruction in Boko Haram-affected areas. SEC. 7. REPORT. The Secretary of State must submit a report to Congress within 1 year of the strategy submission, detailing progress on implementation and evaluating assistance provided under the Act.
