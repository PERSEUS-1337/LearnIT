    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lifelong Improvements in Food and Exercise (LIFE) Act\". The Congress finds that a high percentage of adults in the United States are overweight or obese, with a significant increase in obesity rates over the years. Additionally, a large number of children and adolescents are also overweight. The percentage of children and adolescents overweight has more than doubled since 1980, with rates increasing from 5% to 17.1%. Over 50% of US adults lack physical activity, leading to increased calorie consumption. Two-thirds of young people in grades 9-12 do not meet recommended activity levels, and high school physical education participation has decreased. Rising obesity rates are linked to various health conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. Obesity is linked to various health conditions such as gallbladder disease, osteoporosis, sleep apnea, respiratory problems, and certain cancers. Factors contributing to obesity include larger portion sizes, increased consumption of sugary drinks, sedentary lifestyles, and fear of crime hindering outdoor exercise. Chronic diseases account for 70% of all deaths in the US annually, but they are preventable through adopting a healthy lifestyle with nutritious foods and physical activity. Regular physical activity can prevent or control chronic diseases, which are among the most common and costly health problems. The Surgeon General's Call to Action highlighted the cost of obesity in the US in 2000, exceeding $117 billion. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a section on reducing obesity prevalence through lifelong improvements in food and exercise. This initiative aims to address the high cost and health impact of obesity in the US. The Secretary will conduct a national program to reduce obesity cases in the US by supporting activities for overweight individuals. This includes training health professionals to recognize and address obesity, educate patients on related health conditions, and promote proper nutrition and physical activity. The program aims to reduce obesity by supporting activities for overweight individuals, including education on nutrition and physical activities. It includes public awareness campaigns, intervention strategies for worksites and community settings, and an authorization of $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2009."
