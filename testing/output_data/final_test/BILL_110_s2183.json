The Secretary may award grants to eligible entities for constructing or modernizing facilities providing mental health services. Eligible entities include states receiving specific grants or Indian tribes/organizations. Applications for grants must be submitted to the Secretary as per specified requirements. The Secretary may award grants to eligible entities for constructing or modernizing facilities providing mental health services.

The eligible entity's application for a grant must include a copy of the State plan, a listing of projects to be funded, and explanations of how each project helps the State achieve its goals under the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant and Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant. Assurances must be provided that the facilities will be used for at least 10 years. The application for a grant must include details of the construction or modernization project, such as site description, plans, and specifications, along with assurance of at least 10 years of use for community-based mental health or substance abuse services. The facility must also provide the name and executive director of the entity offering services. The grant application must include project details, financial resources assurance, cost estimates, and completion time.

The curr_chunk outlines the permissible uses of funds for mental and behavioral health services, including construction, acquisition, and leasing of facilities and equipment, as well as integrated delivery of services for individuals with co-occurring conditions. The curr_chunk discusses the transfer of obligation for facility use and the requirement for non-Federal contributions in exchange for receiving a grant under this section. It also mentions reporting requirements by states during a 10-year period. During the 10-year period, states receiving a grant must report on project progress and facility use. Indian tribes and organizations must also submit reports as required by the Secretary. The Secretary will establish reporting requirements for Indian tribes and tribal organizations receiving grants under this section. They must provide progress reports on projects and ensure facilities are used for their intended purpose for a 10-year period. Failure to meet obligations will result in consequences from the Secretary. The Secretary may take steps to ensure compliance with grant requirements, including returning unused funds and extending the facility's designated use period. Prior to fund return, the entity must be given notice and a hearing. Collaboration agreements may be established, and appropriations are authorized for this purpose. Authorization of Appropriations: $20,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2008, with additional funding for fiscal years 2009 through 2012."
