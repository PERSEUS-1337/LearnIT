    "content": "The \"Clean Smokestacks Act of 2001\" is also known as the Clean Air Act. It aims to reduce emissions from power plants. The Clean Smokestacks Act of 2001 sets emission reduction objectives for power plants by reducing sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon dioxide, and mercury emissions by specific percentages from certain baseline levels. The Administrator is required to establish regulations within two years of the enactment of the Act. The Administrator must promulgate regulations to achieve emission reduction objectives for power plants, ensuring equitable allocation of required reductions and considering market-oriented mechanisms, excluding mercury. The regulations for emission reduction objectives for power plants must include emissions trading, prevent adverse effects on health and the environment, ensure emission reductions in both regions of the US, prevent re-release of captured mercury, and provide incentives for renewable energy. Interagency coordination is required to minimize costs. The Administrator must coordinate with other government agencies to increase energy efficiency, use renewable energy, and implement cost-saving policies to achieve emission reduction objectives. Additional reductions in power plant emissions may be required based on the Administrator's determination. The Administrator may require additional reductions in power plant emissions if necessary to protect public health or welfare. Powerplants must comply with new source performance standards and other applicable requirements within a specified timeframe to modernize outdated facilities. The requirements of this section apply to powerplants with a capacity of 15 megawatts or more using combustion to generate electricity for sale, in addition to other Act requirements."
