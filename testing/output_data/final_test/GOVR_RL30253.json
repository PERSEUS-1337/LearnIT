    "content": "Constitutional challenges alleging sex discrimination are based on the equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment or the Fifth Amendment. To maintain such a challenge, discriminatory government action must be proven, whether by the states under the Fourteenth Amendment or the federal government under the Fifth Amendment. The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits state discriminatory conduct, while the Fifth Amendment forbids federal discriminatory actions. The Fourteenth Amendment allows for classification of individuals as long as it does not involve invidious discrimination. The Court uses three levels of review: strict scrutiny for suspect classifications or fundamental interests, intermediate scrutiny, and rational basis review. Strict scrutiny requires the government to show a compelling interest for the classification to be valid. The Court uses three levels of review for classifications: strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and rational basis review. Intermediate scrutiny requires a classification to be substantially related to an important government objective. Rational basis review is the least rigorous, requiring a classification to be rationally related to a legitimate government interest. The Court adopted intermediate scrutiny for sex classifications in 1976. In Craig v. Boren, the Court declared unconstitutional an Oklahoma statute regarding the sale of beer based on age and gender. The Court in Craig v. Boren declared unconstitutional an Oklahoma statute that prohibited the sale of beer to males under 21 and females under 18, with exceptions for females aged 18-21. The Court found that the gender classification in the statute was not substantially related to the goal of public health and safety, despite statistical evidence presented by the state. This case established an intermediate level of review for sex classifications, focusing on stereotypes and generalizations. The Court in Craig v. Boren invalidated a statute based on sex discrimination under the Fourteenth Amendment, rejecting stereotypes and generalizations about the sexes. In J.E.B. v. Alabama, the Court also criticized the use of stereotypes, specifically in the exclusion of male jurors in a paternity and child support action. The Court in J.E.B. v. Alabama criticized the use of gender stereotypes in jury selection, highlighting the discriminatory nature of peremptory challenges based on gender. The Court emphasized the importance of avoiding stereotypes and ensuring fairness in legal proceedings. In U.S. v. Virginia, the Court applied a more rigorous form of scrutiny to declare the exclusion of women from the Virginia Military Institute unconstitutional, requiring an \"exceedingly persuasive justification\" for such gender-based discrimination. The Court required an \"exceedingly persuasive justification\" for VMI's exclusion of women. Virginia's arguments for the exclusion were rejected as the Court found that VMI was not established for educational diversity and historical reluctance towards women's higher education was evident. Virginia's interest in diversity seemed to be a response to litigation. The Court expressed concern over the exclusion of women from VMI due to generalizations about their ability, cautioning against reliance on overbroad generalizations to perpetuate discrimination. Despite acknowledging the promotion of important goals by the adversative method, the Court found the exclusion of women not substantially related to achieving those goals. VMI's violation of the Fourteenth Amendment led to the establishment of the Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership (VWIL) as a remedy. The Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership (VWIL) was established as a remedy following the court's decision on VMI's exclusion of women. VWIL did not use the adversative method like VMI and was deemed inadequate due to lack of resources. VMI later became coeducational. The Court's recent equal protection rulings on sex discrimination involved immigration issues, such as in Miller v. Albright challenging \u00a7309 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The petitioner's application for citizenship was denied as her father did not establish their relationship before her eighteenth birthday. Justices Stevens and Rehnquist agreed to dismiss the complaint, citing \u00a7309's distinction between children of U.S. citizen mothers and fathers. The Supreme Court Justices debated the constitutionality of \u00a7309, which distinguishes between children of U.S. citizen mothers and fathers. Justices O'Connor and Kennedy argued for rational basis review, while Justices Scalia and Thomas believed the Court lacked the power to confer citizenship. Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Souter dissented. Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Souter dissented in opinions regarding the constitutionality of \u00a7309, which addresses gender stereotypes in establishing parentage. Justice Stevens argued that the statute aims to ensure a blood relationship between father and child, noting the different opportunities mothers and fathers have in establishing parentage. He emphasized that the distinction encourages a healthy relationship between citizen fathers and foreign-born children. In Nguyen v. INS, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer argued against \u00a7309's gender-specific requirements, suggesting a focus on caretaker vs. non-caretaker parents instead of mothers and fathers. They contended that the statute's goals could be achieved without reference to gender. In Nguyen v. INS, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer argued against \u00a7309's gender-specific requirements, suggesting a focus on caretaker vs. non-caretaker parents instead of mothers and fathers. They contended that the statute's goals could be achieved without reference to gender. The Court concluded that \u00a7309's differing requirements for acquiring citizenship based on the sex of the citizen parent were justified by important government objectives related to establishing biological parenthood. The Court found that \u00a7309 ensures an opportunity for a meaningful relationship between the child and citizen parent before conferring citizenship. This requirement is justified by important government interests in promoting parent-child relationships during the child's formative years. The Court upheld \u00a7309 as it recognizes the difference in circumstances between parents at the time of a child's birth, establishing the mother's knowledge of the child in a way not guaranteed to the unwed father. This is not based on stereotypes but on the importance of promoting parent-child relationships during the child's formative years. The Court may subject sex classifications to a more exacting form of judicial review, requiring an \"exceedingly persuasive justification.\" It is unclear if future cases will be subject to traditional intermediate scrutiny or heightened scrutiny. Title VII prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment. Title VII prohibits discrimination in employment based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. It covers various practices such as hiring, promotion, termination, and benefits. The statute also includes protection against pregnancy discrimination and retaliation for filing a claim. Title VII allows exceptions for sex discrimination if it meets a bona fide occupational qualification. Major Supreme Court cases on sex discrimination under Title VII focus on pregnancy discrimination, gender stereotypes, sexual harassment, and other issues. The report discusses two types of discrimination recognized under Title VII: disparate treatment, focusing on intent to discriminate, and disparate impact, focusing on adverse effects of employer practices. Disparate impact analysis allows for claims even without evidence of intent to discriminate. The plaintiff must demonstrate that a specific employment practice has had a different effect on a particular group of employees. Both disparate treatment and disparate impact analyses involve evidentiary burden shifting. The burden shifts to the employer to justify its actions, but the plaintiff must establish that the employer's reasons were a pretext for discrimination. The Court has frequently addressed Title VII and sex discrimination in the context of sexual harassment. The Court has addressed Title VII and sex discrimination, including pregnancy discrimination. In General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, the Court ruled that excluding pregnant employees from benefits did not constitute sex discrimination. Congress later amended Title VII with the PDA to clarify that discrimination based on pregnancy is included in the prohibition of sex discrimination. Women affected by pregnancy must be treated the same for all employment-related purposes. In UAW v. Johnson Controls, the Court found that the company's policy excluding fertile women from certain jobs was discriminatory as it did not apply the same restrictions to fertile men. The policy was deemed discriminatory under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), which requires equal treatment of pregnant women in employment-related matters. The Court rejected Johnson Controls' BFOQ defense based on sex for protecting fetal safety, stating that discrimination on the basis of sex for safety concerns is only allowed in narrow circumstances. In AT&T v. Hulteen, a pregnancy discrimination case, the Supreme Court addressed questions regarding maternity leave entitlement before the PDA. The Supreme Court ruled in AT&T v. Hulteen that the employer did not have to retroactively credit maternity leave for retirement benefits, as their seniority system did not violate Title VII. The Court found that AT&T's pre-PDA seniority system was lawful and not discriminatory. The Supreme Court held in Young v. United Parcel Service that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act's second clause requires employers to accommodate pregnant workers similarly to other disabled employees. UPS argued against this interpretation. The Supreme Court ruled in Young v. United Parcel Service that pregnant workers cannot be granted a \"most-favored nation status\" for accommodations, rejecting both UPS's argument and the plaintiff's interpretation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. The Court stated that employers can establish policies that may negatively affect protected employees, subject to certain conditions, and refused to defer to EEOC guidance supporting the plaintiff's position. The Supreme Court in Young v. United Parcel Service rejected both UPS's and the plaintiff's interpretations of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. The Court disagreed with UPS's interpretation, stating it would render part of the Act \"superfluous,\" and instead relied on a middle ground approach. The Court established a burden of proof framework for pregnant workers alleging discrimination, requiring them to show they are in a protected class, sought accommodation, and were denied by the employer. The Supreme Court in Young v. United Parcel Service established a burden of proof framework for pregnant workers alleging discrimination. The employee must show they are in a protected class, sought accommodation, and were denied by the employer. The employer must provide a legitimate reason for denying the accommodation, and the employee can rebut by showing pretext. Additionally, the employee can reach a jury on the issue of pretext by demonstrating that the employer's policies impose a significant burden on pregnant workers, leading to an inference of intentional discrimination. The Supreme Court in Young v. United Parcel Service established a burden of proof framework for pregnant workers alleging discrimination. A pregnant employee can establish a \"significant burden\" exists if accommodations are provided to non-pregnant workers but denied to pregnant workers, leading to an inference of intentional discrimination. The Court vacated the lower court's judgment and remanded the case to determine if the employer's policies show intentional discrimination. The Supreme Court ruling in Young v. United Parcel Service established a burden of proof framework for pregnant workers alleging discrimination based on accommodations. The Court's decision preserves the ability of pregnant workers to sue under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act when employers refuse to accommodate pregnancy-related disabilities. Additionally, the Court has ruled that employment decisions based on gender stereotypes may constitute unlawful sex discrimination, as seen in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins where a woman was denied partnership due to concerns reflecting gender stereotypes. The Supreme Court ruled in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins that employment decisions based on gender stereotypes may violate Title VII. The Court found that sex stereotyping is a form of discrimination and may result in unlawful employment actions. The decision was a victory for employees facing discrimination based on gender stereotypes, but also favored employers by requiring a lower standard of proof in mixed-motive cases. The Supreme Court ruling in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins allowed employers to defend against discrimination lawsuits by proving they would have made the same decision even without discrimination as a factor. Congress later partially overturned the decision with Title VII amendments, stating that discrimination as a motivating factor for any employment practice is unlawful. The Title VII amendments allow courts to grant declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys' fees, in cases of discrimination. The Supreme Court ruling in Desert Palace v. Costa made it easier for employees to win in mixed-motive cases by allowing circumstantial evidence of discrimination. Two forms of sexual harassment under Title VII are recognized: quid pro quo sexual harassment and hostile work environment harassment. The second form of sexual harassment under Title VII is \"hostile environment\" sexual harassment, which involves conduct that interferes unreasonably with work performance or creates a hostile working environment. In Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., the Court defined what constitutes a \"hostile\" workplace, where a female manager alleged gender-based insults and unwanted sexual innuendos created a hostile environment. The Court clarified that an employee does not need to suffer injury to assert a claim. The Court determined that an employee can assert a hostile environment claim under Title VII without needing to suffer injury. Four factors should be considered to determine a hostile environment: frequency, severity, physical threat or humiliation, and interference with work performance. In 1998, the Court expanded Title VII's prohibition against discrimination \"because of ... sex\" to include same-sex harassment. In 1998, the Court expanded Title VII's prohibition against discrimination \"because of ... sex\" to include same-sex harassment, involving a plaintiff and defendant of the same sex. The case of Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc. involved a male employee who alleged physical assault and threats of rape by three male co-workers, two of whom were supervisors. The Court emphasized the need for careful consideration of the social context in same-sex harassment cases, distinguishing between behavior in different settings like a locker room versus an office. The Court examined hostile environment sexual harassment in cases involving vicarious liability. In Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, the Court found employers vicariously liable for discrimination caused by supervisors, with an affirmative defense based on reasonableness of conduct. The petitioner alleged lewd remarks, gender-biased speech, and offensive touching by supervisors in a workplace environment. The Court recognized that employers could be vicariously liable for a supervisor's misuse of authority in discrimination cases. An affirmative defense was established for employers who could prove they took reasonable steps to prevent and address sexually harassing behavior. The Court established an affirmative defense for employers to prevent and address sexually harassing behavior. In a specific case, the Court found that a city did not exercise reasonable care to prevent supervisors' harassing conduct, despite having a policy against sexual harassment. The city failed to disseminate the policy to employees and did not monitor supervisors' conduct. In Burlington Industries v. Ellerth, the Court held that employers can be held liable for harassment by a supervisor even without tangible job consequences. The petitioner alleged offensive remarks and threats by a manager, but did not report the misconduct before resigning. The Court categorized the harassment claim as a hostile environment claim due to unfulfilled threats by the manager at Burlington. Burlington was given the opportunity to assert an affirmative defense to liability, and the Court addressed the availability of punitive damages for Title VII violations in Kolstad v. American Dental Association. In 2004, the Supreme Court considered employer defenses against claims of supervisor harassment. Employers can assert an affirmative defense unless the harassment results in a tangible employment action. This defense aims to prevent punitive damages under Title VII and encourage employers to prevent workplace discrimination. In Police v. Suders, the plaintiff claimed constructive discharge due to severe supervisory harassment. The Court accepted constructive discharge as a tangible employment action but set conditions for employer's affirmative defense to avoid strict liability under Title VII. This was crucial in determining employers' vicarious liability in cases of \"supervisory\" sexual harassment creating a hostile work environment. In cases of hostile work environment created by a supervisor, the employer may raise an affirmative defense if there is no \"tangible employment action.\" The defense requires the employer to show they had a reasonable remedial process in place and that the employee failed to take advantage of it. The Supreme Court defined a \"tangible employment action\" as any significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, or reassignment with different responsibilities. The Supreme Court ruled that Title VII holds employers liable for constructive discharge claims caused by a supervisor, but the Ellerth/Faragher defense is not available if a supervisor's actions lead to the discharge. However, the defense can be used if there is no \"tangible employment action\" involved. This decision in Suders enhances employee protection under Title VII. Suders decision enhances Title VII protection for employees who quit due to intense sexual harassment by a supervisor. Employers can defend against constructive discharge claims by showing reasonable procedures for reporting and correcting harassment. If the plaintiff quits in response to an adverse action like demotion or pay cut, the employer is strictly liable for damages. Defenses are available even with tangible employment actions. The employer may defend against harassment claims by arguing it was not severe enough or not related to tangible employment actions. They can also escape liability if the action was taken for legitimate reasons by others. Demonstrating that the harassment did not meet the standard for constructive discharge is another defense. Suders decision makes it harder to avoid jury trials in harassment cases involving constructive discharge claims. The Court's decision in Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White expanded protections under Title VII's anti-retaliation provision, stating that any employer action adverse to a reasonable employee qualifies for retaliation. This broader standard makes it easier to sue employers for retaliating against workers who complain about discrimination. The Court's interpretation allows employees to sue employers for retaliation if actions might deter complaints about discrimination, even without resulting in adverse employment actions like termination or wage loss. In Crawford v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, a plaintiff was terminated after participating in a sexual harassment investigation against her supervisor, despite not filing a complaint with the EEOC. The Court's ruling in Thompson v. North American Stainless expanded Title VII's retaliation provision to include protection for employees who speak out about discrimination during internal investigations, preventing employers from silencing them. This decision also addressed third-party retaliation cases, allowing individuals who have not personally engaged in protected activity to seek legal recourse. The Court's ruling in Thompson v. North American Stainless expanded Title VII's retaliation provision to protect employees who speak out about discrimination, even if they have not personally engaged in protected activity. The en banc Sixth Circuit initially ruled against the employee, but the Supreme Court reversed the decision, stating that firing Thompson violated Title VII. The Court emphasized that actions that might dissuade a reasonable worker from complaining of discrimination are prohibited under Title VII's anti-retaliation provision. The Court's ruling in Thompson v. North American Stainless expanded Title VII's retaliation provision to protect employees who speak out about discrimination. In Wal-Mart v. Dukes, the Supreme Court considered approving class action status for female employees alleging sex discrimination. The Court declined to establish fixed rules for third-party relationships protected under Title VII. In Wal-Mart v. Dukes, the Supreme Court reversed the class action certification ruling due to the plaintiffs' failure to establish commonality in discrimination policies. The Supreme Court reversed the class action certification ruling in Wal-Mart v. Dukes, stating that plaintiffs did not prove a common discriminatory policy. The Court emphasized the need for significant proof of specific employment practices leading to discrimination, rejecting statistical and anecdotal evidence. While this decision makes it harder for employees to receive class certification, litigation against Wal-Mart can still proceed on an individual or smaller class basis. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded educational programs. Recent court decisions have addressed issues like damages, liability parties, retaliation claims, and statutory remedies under Title IX. Plaintiffs can still pursue claims individually or as part of a smaller class. In an early Title IX case, the Supreme Court established that student victims of sex discrimination have a right to judicial relief. The case of Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools clarified the availability of monetary damages under Title IX, where a female student sued her school district for sexual harassment and abuse by a teacher. Despite the harassment being known, the school failed to act, leading to discouragement of pressing charges. The Court in Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools established that student victims of sex discrimination can seek monetary damages under Title IX for sexual harassment by a teacher. The ruling clarified that damages are available if intentional violation of Title IX can be proven. Subsequently, in Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, the Supreme Court determined that a school district is not liable for a teacher's sexual harassment of a student if there was no actual notice of the harassment and no deliberate indifference shown. The petitioner, a female high school student, was involved in a sexual relationship with a teacher. The school district did not have actual notice of the relationship until it was discovered by a police officer. Despite the school district's quick termination of the teacher, the petitioner argued for liability based on vicarious liability or constructive notice. The Court required actual notice of harassment for liability under Title IX. The Court discussed the absence of an express cause of action under Title IX, which does not provide for damages or a private right of action. Instead, theories of vicarious liability and constructive notice have been judicially implied for private actions. The Court limited the availability of damages under Title IX to refine its holding in Franklin. The Court in Gebser limited the availability of damages under Title IX by requiring actual notice of sexual harassment for a remedy to be pursued. Financial assistance will not be denied until the appropriate person is informed and fails to end the discrimination voluntarily. Damages are only available if there is deliberate indifference to the discrimination. In Gebser, the school district's response to a teacher-student relationship led to termination, showing no deliberate indifference. Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education addressed liability for student-on-student harassment, where the Court found a Title IX claim valid due to school officials' inaction despite reports of harassment. The Court refused to impose vicarious liability on the school district for student-on-student harassment under Title IX. Liability may occur if school authorities show \"deliberate indifference\" to severe harassment that deprives victims of educational opportunities. This highlights differences between Title IX and Title VII in sex discrimination law. The Court's decision in Davis emphasized the difficulty in proving student harassment compared to sexual harassment in employment. Justice O'Connor stressed that schools are different from workplaces, and school administrators' disciplinary decisions should not be second-guessed unless clearly unreasonable. The ruling also stated that damages are not available for simple teasing among students based on gender differences, leaving the task of distinguishing between innocent teasing and actionable harassment to school administrators. In National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Smith, the Court ruled that the NCAA was not subject to Title IX as it did not directly receive federal assistance. The respondent, a female graduate student, claimed discrimination based on sex for being denied permission to play intercollegiate volleyball at two federally assisted institutions due to NCAA rules. The Court found that the NCAA's actions did not violate Title IX. The NCAA was found not to be subject to Title IX as it did not directly receive federal assistance, but rather dues payments from member institutions. The Court did not address the discrimination allegations due to this ruling. In a separate case, Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education, Title IX was expanded to include protection against retaliation. The Court ruled that Title IX covers retaliation claims and protects individuals who report sex discrimination, even if they are not direct victims. In Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Committee, the Court considered if Title IX is the only remedy for sex discrimination in education, rejecting a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983. The Court reversed a decision rejecting a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 for violations of Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause, stating that Title IX is not the exclusive remedy for gender discrimination in schools. Plaintiffs can now file claims under both statutes for sex discrimination in education."
