    "content": "U.S. insurers and Congress are facing new policy issues related to the growth in the international insurance market. The McCarran-Ferguson Act gives states regulatory primacy, but the business of insurance is becoming more international. This has led to the creation of various entities and measures to facilitate trade and regulation of insurance services. Financial services have also been addressed in U.S. trade agreements. The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) was created over 20 years ago to promote cooperation among insurance supervisors. The 2007-2009 financial crisis led to the creation of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The Dodd-Frank Act altered the U.S. insurance regulatory system, with the Federal Reserve overseeing insurers on international issues. Following Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve oversaw insurers designated as systemically important financial institutions by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The Federal Insurance Office (FIO) represents the US in international insurance matters and can negotiate international agreements. The FIO also joined the IAIS. The Federal Insurance Office (FIO) plays a key role in international insurance matters and has become a member of the IAIS. This has led to frictions between federal entities and states, resulting in congressional hearings and proposed legislation. The report discusses trade in insurance services, international entities and agreements, U.S.-EU covered agreement, international insurance standards, and legislation in the 115th Congress. In 2017, the U.S. had a surplus of $255 billion in services trade. In 2017, the U.S. had a surplus of $255 billion in services trade, with a substantial trade surplus in financial services. The U.S. imported $51 billion in insurance services and exported $18 billion, with a deficit that has been consistent for many years. Global performance by insurance brokers is concentrated in Europe, North America, and North Asia, with the North American and European markets being highly competitive. U.S. insurance services exports are mainly with Asia Pacific, with Japan accounting for 14% of total U.S. insurance exports. In 2017, U.S. insurance exports were mainly with Asia Pacific, with Japan accounting for 14% of total exports. Bermuda and the United Kingdom each accounted for 15% of U.S. international insurance exports. The property casualty market declined from 2013 to 2018 due to natural disasters, but is expected to grow in emerging markets. Services, including financial and insurance services, are traded internationally in accordance with trade agreements negotiated by the USTR. The United States played a key role in negotiating the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) in 1994, establishing rules for trade in services among WTO countries. Core GATS principles include most-favored nation, transparency, and national treatment. Market access commitments were made on a positive list basis, with the U.S. submitting its schedule for insurance services to allow foreign competition. The GATS Financial Services Annex applies to insurance, banking, and financial services in the U.S., excluding services provided by governmental authority. The U.S. Schedule of Specific Commitments lists limitations on foreign companies' access based on state laws. The GATS and U.S. FTAs protect prudential financial regulation, allowing measures for prudential reasons even if they don't comply with the agreement. U.S. FTAs include WTO-plus commitments on financial services, excluding government-provided public services. FTAs, including the USMCA, go beyond WTO obligations with increased transparency, allowing foreign providers in financial services, and access to payment systems. The USMCA, signed by Trump, Canada, and Mexico, updates NAFTA with differences and reflects the Trump Administration's trade approach. The USMCA, signed by Trump, Canada, and Mexico, updates NAFTA with differences and reflects the Trump Administration's trade approach. It includes extensive and enforceable commitments in the financial services chapter, clarifying insurance services coverage, and introducing provisions for expedited availability and transparency requirements to facilitate U.S. firms' business in those markets. The USMCA updates NAFTA with enforceable commitments in the financial services chapter, including provisions for expedited availability and transparency requirements to facilitate U.S. firms' business in those markets. The USMCA applies national treatment and market access obligations to cross-border supply of insurance services, with stronger provisions on cross-border data flows compared to TPP. The agreement also includes changes in the investor-state dispute settlement system, with a narrower scope than in TPP or NAFTA. The USMCA updates NAFTA with enforceable commitments in the financial services chapter, including provisions for expedited availability and transparency requirements. Changes in the investor-state dispute settlement system may limit effectiveness for the insurance sector, raising concerns among insurance companies. USMCA establishes a Committee on Financial Services and provides for consultations between parties. Covered agreements are a new form of international agreement for recognition of prudential measures negotiated by FIO and USTR. FIO lacks regulatory authority over the insurance industry, which is primarily regulated by individual states. The Federal Insurance Office (FIO) lacks regulatory authority over the insurance industry, which is primarily regulated by individual states. However, FIO can preempt state laws if they conflict with international agreements and result in less favorable treatment for foreign insurers. This preemption is limited by savings provisions. The covered agreement statute allows for preemption of certain state insurance measures, including rates, coverage requirements, antitrust laws, and insurer solvency. Specific procedures must be followed, including notice to states and congressional committees, public comment, and judicial review. This preemption narrows the scope of covered agreements compared to legal precedent. The covered agreement statute allows for preemption of certain state insurance measures, including rates, coverage requirements, antitrust laws, and insurer solvency. International agreements reached by federal financial regulators may preempt state laws and regulations. The FIO and the USTR consult with Congress on covered agreement negotiations, but specific authorization or approval is not required. Congress has direct constitutional authority over foreign commerce. Congress has constitutional authority over foreign commerce, including regulating trade with foreign nations and approving trade agreements. Trade agreements like NAFTA and WTO agreements are approved by majority vote of each house, not by a two-thirds Senate vote. Covered agreements defined by Dodd-Frank require congressional notification and a 90-day layover for potential congressional action. The Dodd-Frank Act requires congressional notification and consultation for covered agreements, but congressional action is not necessary for them to take effect. International agreements by federal financial regulators, like the Basel Capital accords, do not have specific congressional notification requirements but must go through the rulemaking process. Trade agreements, including bilateral, regional, and free trade agreements, are conducted under Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which sets trade negotiating objectives and consultation requirements for Congress. The FIO or Treasury Secretary and USTR must notify and consult with Congress during negotiations on a covered agreement. A 90-day layover period is required, but congressional approval is not needed. Under TPA, the President must meet notification and consultation requirements before and during negotiations. After negotiations, the President must notify Congress 90 days before signing the agreement. Implementing legislation triggers a 90-legislative-day period for congressional consideration. Additional reporting requirements include disclosing texts and the U.S. International Trade Commission's economic assessment. The FIO and USTR must notify and consult with Congress during negotiations on covered agreements. If procedures are not met to Congress's satisfaction, expedited treatment can be removed. The USTR leads U.S. trade negotiations, with states having a consultative role. States are not formally consulted in trade negotiations but the USTR's IAPE outreach provides information to state officials on trade issues. The USTR cannot commit on behalf of U.S. states in trade negotiations, leading to frustration for partners seeking state-level market access. State laws and insurance regulations are exempt from trade negotiations, but in covered agreements, FIO and USTR may preempt some state laws. International trade agreements are binding agreements that preempt some state laws and regulations. Dispute settlement proceedings can be initiated if a party believes another party has violated the agreement. Compliance with dispute resolution rulings is mandatory, or parties may face withdrawal of benefits. U.S. FTAs include market access commitments and rules governing financial services measures. Covered agreements need to clarify the dispute resolution process as Dodd-Frank does not specify it. FTAs establish a Financial Services Committee for oversight and communication. U.S. FTAs currently do not include regulatory cooperation commitments for the financial services sector, but this may change in future trade agreements. The U.S. and EU are in the process of determining the scope of potential trade negotiations, with a focus on reducing barriers and increasing trade in services. It is unclear if financial services regulatory regimes would be included in these new negotiations. The EU and US are considering potential trade negotiations to reduce barriers and increase trade in services. Regulatory cooperation issues were sought to be included in the T-TIP trade agreement, with the establishment of the Joint U.S.-EU Financial Regulatory Forum for discussions on financial regulatory reforms and cooperation efforts. U.S. financial regulators initially opposed the inclusion of regulatory cooperation in the agreement. On September 22, 2017, the US and EU signed the first bilateral insurance covered agreement, which was submitted to Congress for review. Concerns about limited market access for US insurance firms in the EU led to negotiations initiated by the Obama Administration in November 2015. In 2015, the Obama Administration notified Congress of plans to negotiate a covered agreement with the EU. Goals included achieving recognition of the U.S. regulatory system by the EU and obtaining uniform treatment of EU-based reinsurers in the U.S. The negotiations also aimed to facilitate the exchange of confidential information. The agreement negotiations aimed to facilitate the exchange of confidential information among supervisors across borders. The bilateral agreement allows U.S. and EU insurers to rely on their home country regulators for worldwide prudential insurance group supervision, eliminates collateral and local presence requirements for reinsurers meeting certain conditions, and encourages information sharing between insurance supervisors. The agreement does not explicitly call for equivalency recognition of the U.S. insurance regulatory system by the EU, but provisions on group supervision aim to achieve the same goal. The agreement on group supervision aims to reduce regulatory burden on U.S. insurers in the EU. It goes beyond previous state-level proposals and allows for federal preemption if states do not comply. U.S. industry groups like AIA, Reinsurance Association of America, and ACLI welcomed the agreement, citing removal of barriers for doing business in Europe and affirming commitments to non-discriminatory treatment and open insurance markets. State regulators and lawmakers, represented by NAIC and NCOIL, expressed concerns about limited state involvement and potential federal preemption in the agreement on group supervision. NCOIL criticized the intrusion of federal and international authorities into state-based insurance regulation. Insurers, like NAMIC, questioned the agreement's utility, citing ambiguity that could lead to confusion and endless negotiations with Europe. The agreement includes a review after an initial implementation period. The covered agreement addresses EU concerns about U.S. state regulatory requirements for reinsurance by non-U.S. reinsurers. Formerly, non-U.S. reinsurers resisted the 100% collateral deposit requirement, citing unfair treatment compared to U.S. reinsurers. The NAIC and states initially refused to reduce collateral requirements but have since changed their stance. In recent years, the NAIC Task Force approved recommendations to reduce required collateral for reinsurers based on financial strength and recognition of domiciliary regulators. The NAIC adopted this proposal as a model law in 2011, but states must enact these changes for them to take effect. By 2019, all states are expected to adopt the reinsurance models as part of NAIC accreditation standards. As of February 2017, 35 states have adopted the model law, with over 30 reinsurers approved for reduced collateral requirements. The NAIC Task Force approved recommendations to reduce collateral requirements for reinsurers based on financial strength and recognition of domiciliary regulators. Seven jurisdictions have been approved for reduced collateral requirements as of January 2017. Non-U.S. reinsurers seek a single standard across the U.S. to eliminate, not just reduce, collateral requirements. The EU's desire for a covered agreement with the U.S. aims to facilitate trade in reinsurance and help supervisors exchange information. The covered agreement between the EU and the U.S. aims to assist U.S. insurers with regulatory burdens related to new EU market requirements under Solvency II. This project aims to harmonize laws within the EU and make equivalency determinations for foreign jurisdictions, which could impact U.S. insurers operating in EU markets. The EU granted provisional equivalence to the United States and five other countries under Solvency II. This designation only applies to capital requirements for EU insurers with U.S. operations. U.S. insurers had difficulties operating in EU countries before the covered agreement was signed. The U.S.-EU covered agreement applies only to the two jurisdictions, providing regulatory certainty for firms operating in both markets. A similar agreement was negotiated with the UK in light of Brexit, aiming to ensure market continuity for U.S. and UK insurers. Reinsurers from countries like Bermuda or Japan may still face collateral requirements in the U.S. despite competition from EU reinsurers exempt from such regulations. The new agreement between the US and UK mirrors the US-EU covered agreement. The UK is a significant market for US firms, accounting for over half of US insurance exports in 2017. Two policy approaches are being considered to address concerns about an uneven playing field between European and non-European reinsurers. Negotiating additional covered agreements with non-European jurisdictions, like the UK, is one option. State laws enacted in response to the US-EU covered agreement may also remove reinsurance collateral requirements for some non-EU jurisdictions. The NAIC is updating a model law on reinsurance collateral to address these issues. The updated model law on reinsurance collateral applies to \"qualified jurisdictions\" such as Japan, Bermuda, and Switzerland. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors play a significant role in international insurance issues in the United States. The FSB, established in 2009 by G-20 nations, assesses vulnerabilities in the global financial system and coordinates with financial authorities of member nations. U.S. FSB members include the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) are key players in international insurance issues. The FSB operates by moral suasion and peer pressure to set internationally agreed policies, while the IAIS focuses on promoting effective supervision of the insurance industry. U.S. members of the IAIS include individual states, the NAIC, the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Insurance Office. The U.S. members of the IAIS include individual states, the NAIC, the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Insurance Office. The FIO director has held committee positions within IAIS, and the NAIC coordinates state participation in IAIS committees. NAIC members have voting rights in IAIS general meetings. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) designates globally systemically important financial institutions, including banks, insurers, and nonbank entities like asset managers and hedge funds. These designated institutions must meet higher regulatory and capital standards to ensure stability during a crisis. The FSB's designations aim to prevent negative impacts on the global financial system. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) designates globally systemically important financial institutions, including banks, insurers, and nonbank entities like asset managers and hedge funds, to ensure stability during a crisis. In 2016, the FSB designated nine G-SIIs, including three U.S. insurers. The FSB requested the IAIS to develop capital standards for G-SIIs and Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs). In 2017, the FSB decided not to publish a new G-SII list, and the IAIS is considering a new approach to systemic risk based on specific activities. Additionally, the IAIS is developing a Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (ComFrame). The ComFrame process for supervising Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs) includes capital standards and is currently in the draft stage for overall framework and specific insurance capital standards. International actions like FSB designations of G-SIIs or IAIS adoption of capital standards do not immediately impact the U.S. regulatory system and require adoption by U.S. regulators or enactment into law. Adoption of agreed-to standards by members of international bodies is expected. The adoption of international standards by international bodies, such as the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision, may face challenges in the United States due to the mix of federal and state authorities over insurance. The U.S. representation at the IAIS includes the NAIC, which represents U.S. state regulators but lacks regulatory authority. The U.S. representation at the IAIS includes the NAIC, which represents state regulators but lacks regulatory authority. The U.S. insurance market is regulated collectively by 56 states and territories, with oversight at the federal level by the Federal Reserve and the FIO. International standards may be agreed upon without the entity having authority to implement them, leading to potential challenges in implementation. The International Monetary Fund conducts a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) every five years, comparing U.S. insurance regulations to core principles adopted by the IAIS. While U.S. regulators generally accept these principles, state regulators reject some aspects. Pressure for regulatory reforms may come from internationally active market participants to minimize costs of adapting to different regulatory environments. Pressure for regulatory reforms may come from internationally active market participants to minimize costs of adapting to different regulatory environments. Companies may push for jurisdictions to adopt similar rules to simplify business operations, even if slightly less favorable. Concerns arise about potential international insurance standards being \"bank-like\" and inappropriate for insurers, particularly regarding the treatment of financial groups. State regulators historically focused on individual legal entities, ensuring subsidiaries have enough capital. Post-financial crisis, oversight increased at the group level, but capital movement between subsidiaries remains a concern. NAIC emphasizes the importance of capital flow not compromising any insurer's financial strength within a group. The group-wide approach allows capital movement among subsidiaries to potentially improve financial stability by preventing insolvency in the short run and providing protection for policyholders. However, there is concern that this could jeopardize future policy claims if there is insufficient capital in the long run. S. 2155, introduced by Senator Michael Crapo, covers various financial services provisions and was marked up by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in December 2017. S. 2155, a bill covering financial services provisions, was passed into law as P.L. 115-174 in May 2018. Section 211 of the law emphasizes transparency in international insurance forums and establishes an Insurance Policy Advisory Committee at the Federal Reserve. Annual reports and testimonies on international insurance discussions are required through 2022. The enacted law, S. 2155, requires transparency in international insurance forums and establishes an Insurance Policy Advisory Committee at the Federal Reserve. The President expressed concerns about congressional directions conflicting with his authority over international negotiations. Representative Sean Duffy and seven cosponsors were involved in the legislation. Representative Sean Duffy introduced H.R. 4537 on December 4, 2017, with seven cosponsors. The bill was marked up and reported by the House Committee on Financial Services, and passed by the House on July 10, 2018. S. 488, originally introduced by Senator Pat Toomey, was amended in the House with provisions focusing on securities regulation. Title XIV of S. 488 and H.R. 4537 focus on international insurance standards and covered agreements. U.S. federal representatives must consult with state insurance regulators and Congress before negotiations and submit a report. Negotiators must provide congressional access to texts and closely coordinate with State insurance commissioners for future covered agreements. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that enacting H.R. 4537 would depend on the frequency of international insurance agreements and consultations with state insurance commissioners. S. 1360, introduced by Senator Dean Heller, aims to create an \"Insurance Policy\". S. 1360 would establish an \"Insurance Policy Advisory Committee on International Capital Standards and Other Insurance Issues\" at the Federal Reserve, requiring annual reports and testimony on discussions at the IAIS through 2020. The Federal Reserve and FIO must conduct a study and report on the impact of international capital standards, with public comment and review by GAO. Final international capital standards must be published for comment and cannot conflict with state or Federal Reserve standards for insurers. H.R. 3762, introduced by Representative Sean Duffy with cosponsor Representative Denny Heck on September 13, 2017, was discussed in a hearing by the House Financial Services' Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance on October 24, 2017. However, there has been no further committee action on this bill. A similar bill, H.R. 4537, was introduced by the same sponsor and ordered reported by the House Committee on Financial Services on December 13, 2017. Another bill, H.R. 3861, introduced by the same representatives on September 28, 2017, aims to amend Dodd-Frank Act provisions related to the Federal Insurance Office, focusing on limiting its scope and size. The bill, H.R. 3762, aims to amend provisions related to the Federal Insurance Office, limiting its scope and size. It would place the FIO within the Office of International Affairs, narrow its function to representing the Treasury on international issues, and require consensus with states on international matters. The bill would remove FIO's authority to collect and analyze information from insurers, including subpoena power, and limit FIO to five employees. The Secretary of the Treasury would have the authority to preempt state laws pursuant to covered agreements."
