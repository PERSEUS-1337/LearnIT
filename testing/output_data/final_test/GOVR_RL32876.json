Past differences over New Zealand's nuclear policy have been overcome, and the relationship is now defined by bilateral cooperation in various areas. Key details discussed include shared interests in the Pacific, security concerns like Afghanistan, trade, and U.S. engagement in the region. New Zealand Prime Minister John Key and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton both expressed satisfaction with the improved relationship. The Wellington Declaration signed in November 2010 restored the U.S.-New Zealand relationship, setting aside past policy differences dating back to the mid-1980s. The Declaration symbolizes the strategic partnership between the two countries, enabling them to work together on shared challenges in the Asia-Pacific region. The only remaining significant policy difference is New Zealand's ban on nuclear ship visits to its ports. The fourth U.S.-New Zealand Partnership Forum took place in Christchurch, New Zealand in February 2011. The Forum, a non-partisan, non-governmental gathering, brings together key leaders from both countries for discussions on various issues. The 2011 meeting focused on topics such as the TPP, food safety, sustainability, climate change, economic growth, security cooperation, and Antarctica. On February 22, 2011, Christchurch, New Zealand, experienced a devastating earthquake, killing 163 people and leaving 200 missing. The quake, measuring 6.3 on the Richter scale, caused significant damage to the city center and infrastructure. U.S. Ambassador David Huebner assisted in coordinating aid in response to New Zealand's request for assistance.

U.S. aid included a Disaster Assistance Response Team and a team from the Los Angeles County Fire Department. President Obama expressed condolences to Prime Minister Key for the earthquake's impact on New Zealand. The two countries share common values due to their historical roots as British settler societies. New Zealand, also known as Aotearoa, was first settled by the Polynesian-Maori people in the tenth century. Captain James Cook mapped the islands in the late 1700s. The Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 defined relations between Maori and European communities, leading to conflicts over land. New Zealand is mostly urban with a high literacy rate and a land area similar to Colorado. Its main exports are agricultural products. New Zealand's demographic makeup is increasingly Pacific, with a significant Maori and Pacific Islander population. Maori represent 14.9% of the population, while Pacific Islanders make up 7.2%. Together, these largely Polynesian groups account for 22.1% of the population. New Zealanders of European and Asian origin make up 76.8% and 9.7% of the population, respectively.

The country gained full political independence from Britain in 1947 under the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act after achieving Dominion Status in 1907. New Zealand operates as a unicameral, mixed-member-proportional parliamentary democracy, with MMP introduced in 1996. The parliament has over 120 seats, with 70 electorate member seats and 50 selected from party lists. Each voter casts both an electorate vote and a party vote under MMP rules. The Mixed Member Proportional system in New Zealand allows smaller parties to play a significant role in forming coalition governments.

Former Prime Minister Helen Clark aimed to make New Zealand a carbon-neutral nation, emphasizing the importance of sustainability and renewable energy. She highlighted the strain traditional development patterns put on the planet and the need for action to mitigate climate change. New Zealand has committed to sourcing 90% of its energy from renewable sources by 2025, with hydroelectric and wind power already accounting for 60-70% of electricity output. New Zealand aims to have 90% of its energy from renewable sources by 2025 to establish itself as a \"green producer.\" Studies show that New Zealand's free-range, grass-fed meat and dairy products have lower carbon emissions compared to products from Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations in the US and Europe. This efficiency is maintained even when considering transportation costs to the UK. New Zealand is reviewing its approach to climate change, specifically the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) under the Climate Change Response Act of 2002. The government is seeking recommendations on how the ETS should evolve beyond 2012, with uncertainty over international efforts influencing the process. New Zealand ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2002 and aims for a global agreement on climate change mitigation actions by all countries. New Zealand, a trade-dependent nation, advocates for free trade and has key exports such as dairy products, meat, timber, fish, fruit, and wool.

It emphasizes the importance of collective action with allies, views Australia as a key security partner, and highlights the evolving security structures in the region. The paper also addresses the likelihood of conflict within fragile states and asserts New Zealand's leadership role in the South Pacific. The White Paper emphasizes the importance of strong international linkages for New Zealand, particularly with Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. It predicts the United States will remain the pre-eminent military power for the next 25 years, but its edge will diminish as other countries like China grow economically. The paper supports a continuing U.S. security presence in the Asia-Pacific and notes their role in regional stability. New Zealand's significant contributions to international security include military forces in Afghanistan and joint surveillance with the U.S. Coast Guard to combat illegal fishing.

Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell views the report as a roadmap for enhancing the bilateral relationship. The report examined five pillars of the U.S.-New Zealand relationship: security and political cooperation, trade and investment ties, science and technology collaboration, people-to-people connections, and alignment on transnational issues. Recommendations include concluding a high-quality TPP trade agreement, initiating a bilateral strategic dialogue, expanding military engagement, and increasing cooperation on nuclear non-proliferation.
