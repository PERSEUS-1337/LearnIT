    "title": "SB 521",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the high long-term unemployment rates in California, with over 600,000 individuals unemployed in 2014. California also had the highest \"U6\" unemployment rate in the country at 15.8 percent. The federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Employment and Training Program provides funding for employment training and support for CalFresh recipients to reduce their dependence on assistance. A new section is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code for this purpose. Section 11327.10 of the Welfare and Institutions Code states that CalWORKs recipients sanctioned for noncompliance with their welfare-to-work plan should not receive a CalFresh penalty until the county determines their exemption status and provides instructions on compliance with work requirements. If a CalFresh recipient complies with requirements during the notice of adverse action period and registers for work with the Employment Development Department, the proposed penalty will be canceled. CalFresh recipients receiving CalWORKs cash aid or postemployment services are ineligible for the CalFresh E&T program, but the receipt of CalWORKs cash aid by another household member does not affect the CalFresh recipient's eligibility. The department seeks a federal waiver to allow county agencies to serve CalFresh E&T program recipients for up to five months. The state includes the program in the Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act state plan to improve coordination with workforce training programs. The department aims to enhance employment opportunities and wages for CalFresh recipients by promoting access to education and vocational training at California Community Colleges. Guidance will be provided to county agencies on partnering with community colleges for CalFresh E&T programs, including requirements for state share match. Requirements for a state share match specific to community college CalFresh E&T programs include approved education courses under the Agricultural Act of 2014. These courses must be part of a career and technical education program or limited to remedial, adult education, literacy, or ESL. Additional outcomes must be reported for CalFresh E&T programs with a community college component. The process for verifying student eligibility for the CalFresh E&T program at a community college involves voluntary participation only. CalFresh recipients receiving CalWORKs cash aid or postemployment services are ineligible for the program, but household members receiving CalWORKs cash aid do not impact eligibility. Counties are not required to offer specific components in their CalFresh E&T plan, and federal funds can be used for program financing. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by this act."
