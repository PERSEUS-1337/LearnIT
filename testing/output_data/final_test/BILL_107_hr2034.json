    "content": "The Act titled \"School and Day-Care Lead-Based Paint Reduction Act of 2001\" establishes a program of grants for addressing lead-based paint hazards at public elementary schools and licensed child day-care facilities. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may make grants for evaluating and reducing lead-based paint hazards at public elementary schools and licensed child day-care facilities. The Secretary consults with other relevant agencies and approves grants based on proposed activities and selection criteria. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development approves grants based on criteria such as reducing lead poisoning risk, severity of lead-based paint hazards, fiscal capacity of facilities, applicant's ability to provide non-Federal contributions, and ability to carry out proposed activities. Other factors may also be considered. The Secretary may authorize grants for risk assessments, lead inspections, interim control, and abatement of lead-based paint hazards at eligible facilities undergoing renovations. Certified contractors must carry out these activities to ensure effective use of grants. Toxic Substances Control Act requires abatements by certified contractors. Maintenance personnel can still perform duties at eligible facilities. Workers' blood-lead levels must be monitored during lead hazard reduction activities. Temporary relocation assistance is provided during hazard reduction measures. Education on lead poisoning and paint hazards is given to school officials, teachers, and students. After lead-based paint hazard reduction activities, testing is done on soil, interior dust, and children's blood-lead levels to ensure safety. This includes school officials, teachers, students, parents, supervisors, staff, and maintenance personnel at eligible facilities. The grant recipient must provide matching funds of at least 50% of the grant amount for lead hazard reduction activities, including renovation of facilities and other activities determined by the Secretary to promote the program's purpose. The grant recipient must provide matching funds of at least 50% for lead hazard reduction activities. Provisions allow the Secretary to waive or reduce requirements for facilities serving low-income children, with a minimum percentage of 10% applicable. Non-Federal contributions for lead hazard reduction activities must be at least 10 percent and can be in cash or in kind. Federal Government contributions cannot be included. Grant recipients must submit a report detailing grant expenditures and risk assessments conducted at eligible schools. The grant recipients must provide a report on lead-based paint hazard reduction activities at eligible schools and child day-care facilities, including the number of hazards reduced through interim controls and abatement. Additionally, recipients must agree not to use the grant to replace other funding sources designated for the same purpose. The Secretary will count non-Federal contributions provided by the applicant, limit administrative expenses to 10% of the grant, and require financial records for proper accounting. Grant applications must meet specific requirements set by the Secretary to be considered for funding. The Secretary will coordinate grant deadlines with academic calendars for eligible schools. Definitions for terms related to lead-based paint are provided. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to lead-based paint, including terms like \"elementary school,\" \"eligible child day-care facilities,\" \"eligible facilities,\" \"eligible schools,\" \"local educational agency,\" and \"low income family.\" These definitions are important for understanding the context of the grant program. The curr_chunk defines the official poverty line and the term \"Secretary\" in relation to housing and urban development. It also authorizes appropriations for carrying out the section."
