    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Point Reyes National Seashore Farmland Protection Act of 1997\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2. The Point Reyes National Seashore Farmland Protection Act of 1997 aims to protect the pastoral land adjacent to the park, create a public/private partnership to preserve historic agricultural lands, safeguard the Federal investment in the Seashore, and maintain agriculture in Marin and Sonoma Counties. The Point Reyes National Seashore Farmland Protection Act of 1997 aims to protect agricultural land in Marin and Sonoma Counties through conservation easements. The Point Reyes National Seashore Farmland Protection Act of 1997 includes the addition of farmland protection area to Point Reyes National Seashore and the acquisition of development rights. The Point Reyes National Seashore Farmland Protection Act of 1997 amends the Act to include a Farmland Protection Area and maintain agricultural land in private ownership through conservation easements. It also adds authority for farmland acquisition and management. The Act allows the Secretary to acquire lands within the Farmland Protection Area through donation, purchase, or exchange, prioritizing development rights and conservation easements. Lands acquired through exchange can be located outside of California. The Secretary can acquire lands for conservation purposes through various means, including conservation easements, acquiring lands from nonprofit organizations, and donation or exchange. There are restrictions on acquiring conservation easements on land within the Farmland Protection Area from nonprofit organizations that acquired the land before January 1, 1997. Cooperative agreements will be made with public agencies or nonprofit organizations experienced in managing conservation easements on agricultural land in the region. The Farmland Protection Area boundaries, as depicted on a map, do not authorize federal regulation of privately owned lands within it, unless acquired by the United States. Lands under easements held by various trusts will remain under state jurisdiction. The Secretary may permit or lease acquired lands with necessary conditions. The Secretary may impose conditions to ensure agricultural use of acquired lands under the Farmland Protection Act. Revenues from permits or leases can be used for agricultural preservation goals. Lands owned by California can only be acquired through donation or exchange. Section 5 does not apply to lands acquired under this provision. \"In addition to previous appropriations, $30,000,000 is authorized for acquiring lands under section 3(d) of the Point Reyes National Seashore Farmland Protection Act of 1997. The Federal share of acquisition costs is half, with non-Federal contributions accepted in various forms.\" The area shown on the map under conservation easements by various agencies or the State of California will be considered a matching contribution from non-Federal sources equal to the fair market value of the lands."
