The Congress acknowledges a shortage of over 200,000 registered nurses nationwide, projected to grow to 1 million by 2020. The primary factor is the lack of qualified nursing faculty, hindering nursing schools from meeting workforce demand. Despite strong interest in nursing, many qualified applications are rejected due to program capacity constraints. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing estimates that over 40,000 applicants were turned away from nursing schools in 2007 due to a lack of faculty. Additionally, a significant number of nursing faculty members in the US are nearing retirement, exacerbating the shortage of qualified educators in the field. The average age of nurse faculty members in the US is 55, with retirement at 62. The nurse faculty vacancy rate is 8.8%, with market forces creating disincentives for potential educators due to lower salaries compared to nurse practitioners. The Health Resources and Services Administration survey data shows a low number of registered nurses with bachelor's and associate's degrees pursuing a master's degree in nursing to become educators. Current Federal incentive programs are insufficient, and a more comprehensive program is needed to support interested and qualified nurses financially. A comprehensive program is needed to support interested and qualified nurses financially to pursue and maintain a career in nursing education. The Nurse Faculty Loan Repayment Program is a new section added to the Public Health Service Act to support nurses pursuing a career in nursing education. The Nurse Faculty Loan Repayment Program allows eligible individuals to repay education loans in exchange for serving as full-time nursing faculty for at least four years within a six-year period. The Nurse Faculty Loan Repayment Program allows individuals to repay education loans by serving as full-time nursing faculty. Agreements are made with terms set by the Secretary, including payments on loans after six years, with limits on payments for master's and doctorate degrees. The Nurse Faculty Loan Repayment Program allows individuals with a doctorate in nursing to receive payments up to $20,000 per year and a total of $80,000. Failure to meet agreement terms results in liability to repay the total amount plus interest. Compliance may lead to waiver or suspension of liability. The Nurse Faculty Loan Repayment Program allows eligible individuals to receive payments up to $20,000 per year and a total of $80,000. Liability for non-compliance can be waived in cases of extreme hardship or unconscionable enforcement. Amounts recovered must be paid to the United States within 3 years and are available for loan repayments by the Secretary. The term 'eligible individual' refers to a US citizen, national, or lawful permanent resident with an unencumbered nursing license, who has completed or is enrolled in a master's or doctorate nursing program at an accredited school. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2009 through 2013 to carry out this Act."
