    "content": "The Science and Technology Scholarship Program is outlined in Section 1. The Administrator is authorized to establish a Science and Technology Scholarship Program to recruit and prepare students for careers in the National Weather Service and marine, atmospheric, and satellite research. Scholarships will be awarded based on academic merit, with consideration for financial need and promoting diversity in STEM fields. The Administrator will enter into service agreements with selected individuals to work for the Administration in exchange for a scholarship. To be eligible for the scholarship program, individuals must be enrolled as full-time students at a higher education institution. To qualify for the scholarship program, individuals must be students at a higher education institution in an eligible academic program, be a US citizen or permanent resident, and not a federal employee. Applicants must submit an application with required information. The Administrator will provide a list of eligible academic programs and fields of study. The Administrator may offer scholarships for up to 4 academic years to individuals pursuing a degree in a program on the list provided. The scholarship amount is determined by the Administrator and cannot exceed the cost of attendance. The scholarship provided under this section can be used for tuition, fees, and other authorized expenses as determined by the Administrator. The Administrator may also make direct payments to institutions for these expenses. The obligated service period for scholarship recipients is 24 months for each academic year. The obligated service period for scholarship recipients is 24 months for each academic year. The service must begin within 60 days of obtaining the educational degree, with the option for deferral under certain circumstances. Penalties exist for breaching the scholarship agreement. Penalties for breaching the scholarship agreement include repayment of all scholarship funds within 1 year of default, for recipients who fail to maintain academic standing or voluntarily terminate academic training before graduation. The repayment period for a scholarship recipient may be extended by the Administrator if necessary. Failure to fulfill the service obligation or deferment terms will result in breach of the agreement, leading to liability for the total amount of scholarships received. The scholarship program allows for the total amount of scholarships received to be calculated, including interest as if they were loans. Any obligations incurred under the program can be waived upon the death of the individual or in cases of extreme hardship as determined by the Administrator. The scholarship program allows for the suspension of service or payment obligations in cases of impossibility, extreme hardship, or if enforcement would not be in the Government's best interests. Definitions for Administration, Administrator, and cost of attendance are provided in the Act. The Education Act of 1965 defines \"institution of higher education\" and \"scholarship program\" as per the Higher Education Act of 1965."
