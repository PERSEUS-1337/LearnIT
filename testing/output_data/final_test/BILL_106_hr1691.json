    "content": "The \"Religious Liberty Protection Act of 1999\" is cited as the short title. It aims to protect religious exercise. The \"Religious Liberty Protection Act of 1999\" prohibits government from substantially burdening a person's religious exercise, except in cases where it serves a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means. The Religious Liberty Protection Act of 1999 prohibits government from burdening religious exercise unless for a compelling governmental interest. The United States cannot deny financial assistance for violations, but the Attorney General retains authority under other laws. SEC. 3. ENFORCEMENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. If a claimant provides evidence of a violation of the Free Exercise Clause or related Act, the government must prove any element of the claim. The claimant must prove if the government practice burdens their exercise of religion. Land use regulations cannot impose a substantial burden where individualized assessments are made. The government must not burden a person's religious exercise unless it serves a compelling interest and is the least restrictive means. Land use regulations must treat religious institutions equally and not discriminate based on religion. The Free Exercise Clause prohibits government zoning authorities from unreasonably excluding or limiting religious assemblies or institutions. Adjudication of Free Exercise Clause violations in a non-Federal forum is only recognized in Federal court if the claimant had a fair adjudication. State laws that protect religious exercise are not preempted by this clause. SEC. 4. JUDICIAL RELIEF. (a) A person can use this Act as a claim or defense in court against the government and seek relief. Standing to do so will follow general rules of standing under the Constitution. \n(b) Attorneys' fees under the Revised Statutes are amended to include the Religious Liberty Protection Act of 1998. \n(c) Prisoners involved in litigation under this Act will be subject to the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995. \n(d) The United States has the authority to enforce compliance with this Act through injunctive or declaratory relief. SEC. 5. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. Nothing in this Act shall authorize any government to burden religious belief or regulate religious exercise. It also does not affect a religious organization's right to receive funding or impose conditions on funding. Governmental discretion allows for alleviating burdens on religious exercise by changing policies, exempting burdened religious exercise, providing exemptions, or using other means to eliminate substantial burdens. This Act does not authorize governments to regulate activities or policies of non-government entities as a condition of receiving funding, except as provided within the Act. It also does not restrict existing authorities to regulate or affect such entities. The Act emphasizes the broad protection of religious exercise and states that proof of a burden on religious exercise affecting commerce does not imply Congress's intent regarding other laws. If any part of the Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest remains unaffected. SEC. 6 of the Act clarifies that government funding, benefits, or exemptions granted in accordance with the Establishment Clause of the first amendment do not violate the Act. SEC. 7 involves amendments to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 is amended to redefine \"covered entity\" and clarify that it includes any exercise of religion, regardless of being compelled by a system of religious belief. This includes using real property for religious purposes and any conduct protected under the first amendment. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 is amended to remove references to the State under the first amendment to the Constitution. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS.
