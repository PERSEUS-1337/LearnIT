    "content": "Funding for farm bill programs is provided through mandatory spending authorized in the farm bill and discretionary spending through subsequent appropriations. Mandatory programs often dominate farm bill policy and the debate over the budget. The Congressional Budget Office baseline projects future federal spending on mandatory programs under current law, serving as a benchmark for proposed changes. Changes that increase spending relative to the baseline have a positive score, while those that decrease spending have a negative score. The baseline for farm bill programs determines future funding, impacting the scoring of proposed changes. Programs without a continuing baseline lack assured future funding, leading to budget challenges when writing new farm bills. The Congressional Budget Office develops the budget baseline under the supervision of the House and Senate Budget Committees. Some farm bill programs may not continue in the budget baseline beyond the end of a farm bill due to various reasons such as spending thresholds or expiration dates. This decision is made in consultation with the Agriculture Committees to control costs or prevent ongoing funding. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects future government spending and evaluates proposed bills, but has not published a list of expiring farm bill programs without a continuing baseline. A total of 39 programs across 10 titles of the farm bill do not have a baseline beyond FY2018, with estimated mandatory spending totaling $2.824 billion. Programs without a baseline beyond FY2018 in the farm bill account for a small percentage of total projected spending, but their impact varies by title. For example, 100% of mandatory spending in the rural development title comes from these programs. The 2014 farm bill has less exposure to programs without baseline compared to the 2008 farm bill. 29 out of 37 programs without baseline in the 2014 farm bill received $6.2 billion in mandatory funding. Figure 1 and Table 2 list the 39 individual programs in the 2014 farm bill without a budget baseline beyond FY2018. Table 2 organizes programs without baseline in the 2014 farm bill by section number and title."
