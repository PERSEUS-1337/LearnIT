The \"Justice for Child Victims Act of 2016\" allows for restitution in cases of child pornography trafficking convictions. Restitution under this act directs the defendant to pay the victim an amount determined by the court. The court determines the victim's losses from child pornography trafficking. Victim's recovery cannot exceed proven losses. Restitution ends when victim receives full amount of losses. The court may terminate the liability of defendants ordered to pay restitution for losses to a victim. The victim may be asked to provide information on restitution received in other cases for the same losses. Additionally, definitions in the relevant section of the law are amended. The court may terminate defendants' liability for paying restitution to a victim. Definitions in the law are amended to include terms related to trafficking in child pornography and child pornography production. The term 'child pornography production' refers to prohibited conduct under specific sections of the law. The term 'full amount of the victim's losses' includes all costs incurred by the victim as a result of the offense, such as medical services. The amendment allows victims of trafficking in child pornography to receive fixed compensation for various losses incurred, such as medical services, therapy, transportation, housing, lost income, attorneys' fees, and other relevant expenses. The court can order fixed compensation for victims of trafficking in child pornography from the Child Pornography Victims' Fund, with the amount being $35,000 for the first year and adjusted for inflation in subsequent years. The court can order fixed compensation for victims of trafficking in child pornography from the Child Pornography Victims' Fund, based on the Consumer Price Index for the preceding calendar year compared to two years prior. Victims can only receive fixed compensation once, but this does not affect their ability to seek restitution from defendants for other offenses. Victims of trafficking in child pornography can seek restitution under this section, with deductions for fixed compensation received. Accepting restitution above a certain amount makes the victim ineligible for fixed compensation. Attorney's fees are regulated. Attorneys are limited to charging 25 percent of any payment made under this section for fees and costs. Violating this rule can result in fines or imprisonment. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the United States Code. SEC. 3. ASSESSMENTS IN CHILD PORNOGRAPHY CASES. Sec. 2259A of Chapter 110 of title 18, United States Code, mandates assessments in trafficking in child pornography cases. The court shall assess specific amounts on individuals convicted of different child pornography offenses, with annual adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index. The court determines assessments based on factors in sections 3553(a) and 3572. Subchapter C of chapter 227 and subchapter B of chapter 229 apply to assessments, with money received from a defendant disbursed accordingly. The defendant's money is disbursed to fulfill specific obligations in a set sequence, including special assessments, restitution to victims of child pornography offenses, and other fines and payments. A separate account called the 'Child Pornography Victim's Fund' is established in the Treasury's general fund to receive deposits. The 'Child Pornography Victim's Fund' receives assessments, gifts, and donations, with funds available for expenditure without time limit. Payments from the Fund are prioritized based on order date, ensuring compensation under section 2259(d) is fulfilled. The Attorney General administers the Child Pornography Victim's Fund, with payments prioritized by order date. Funds can be disbursed 6 months after enactment. Individuals sentenced after the legislation for offenses committed before enactment are subject to the previous statutory scheme. Sec. 2259A and Sec. 2259B address assessments in trafficking child pornography cases and the establishment of a fund. SEC. 4 discusses the allocation of amounts in the Crime Victims Fund. Section 1402(d)(3)(A) of Public Law 98-473 is amended to allocate remaining funds in the Crime Victims Fund for services benefiting crime victims in the Federal criminal justice system. In fiscal year 2017, $5,000,000 shall be transferred to the Child Pornography Victims Fund established under section 2259B of title 18, United States Code. SEC. 5. CLERICAL AMENDMENTS. Expansion of Civil Remedies for Unpaid Fines and Clarification of Interstate or Foreign Commerce Provision Regarding Child Pornography Activities. Expansion of Civil Remedies for Unpaid Fines and Clarification of Interstate or Foreign Commerce Provision Regarding Child Pornography Activities. Amendments are made to the definition of \"Sexually Explicit Conduct\" in title 18, United States Code, including specifying the use of interstate or foreign commerce in relation to child pornography. Amendment to Section 3559(e)(2)(A) of title 18, United States Code, clarifies the offense of coercion and enticement of a minor by removing the phrase \"into prostitution\" and adding a comma after \"genitals\". The Attorney General must report to Congress within 18 months of this Act's enactment on the Department of Justice's progress in obtaining restitution for victims of specified offenses under title 18, United States Code."
