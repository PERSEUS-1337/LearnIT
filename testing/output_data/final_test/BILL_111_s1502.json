The \"Carbon Storage Stewardship Trust Fund Act of 2009\" aims to promote carbon capture and storage, ensure liability assurance for storage facilities, establish a Federal trust fund, set limits on liability for damages, certify closure of facilities, and transfer long-term stewardship to the Federal Government. The \"Carbon Storage Stewardship Trust Fund Act of 2009\" aims to ensure liability assurance for carbon dioxide storage facilities, provide compensation for damages, and protect the environment through long-term stewardship of storage units. The \"Carbon Storage Stewardship Trust Fund Act of 2009\" aims to ensure liability assurance for carbon dioxide storage facilities, provide compensation for damages, and protect the environment through long-term stewardship of storage units. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"active project period\" referring to phases of a carbon dioxide storage facility, \"Administrator\" as the head of the EPA, and \"carbon dioxide storage facility\" as a site for storing carbon dioxide permanently. Certificate of closure is a determination certifying completion of injection operations, well closure, and monitoring to ensure carbon dioxide storage does not harm human health or the environment. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"damage\" in relation to the injection of carbon dioxide into geological storage units, including harm to persons, property, or natural resources. It encompasses personal injury, property damage, natural resource damage, trespass, revenue losses, and loss of profits. The curr_chunk defines terms related to carbon dioxide injection and storage, including enhanced hydrocarbon recovery, Fund, geological storage unit, liability assurance, and long-term stewardship. The curr_chunk defines \"long-term stewardship\" as activities after closure of a carbon dioxide storage facility, \"Program\" as the Carbon Storage Stewardship and Trust Fund Program, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Energy. The curr_chunk states the long-term stewardship responsibility. The Secretary is responsible for long-term stewardship of a carbon dioxide storage facility upon issuance of a closure certificate. A State can request to take over management responsibilities for a facility within its borders, subject to approval by the Secretary. The Secretary, in coordination with the Administrator, shall establish standards for monitoring, measurement, verification, and site remediation activities to protect health, safety, and the environment during long-term stewardship of a carbon dioxide storage facility by a State or the Federal Government. The Secretary may coordinate responsibility for site monitoring, measurement, verification, and remediation with the Administrator if long-term stewardship is vested with the Secretary. The Carbon Storage Stewardship and Trust Fund Program is established. The Carbon Storage Stewardship and Trust Fund Program in the Department of Energy requires operators of carbon dioxide storage facilities to maintain liability assurance and pay a risk-based fee for each ton of carbon dioxide injected into storage units. The Secretary will establish the minimum and maximum balance for the Fund and the fee required based on the estimated quantity of carbon dioxide injected annually into storage units by commercial facilities. The Secretary may establish fees for carbon dioxide storage facilities based on factors like risk of incidents, potential damages, and impact on viability. The fee system could incentivize selecting lower-risk storage units. The Secretary may establish fees for carbon dioxide storage facilities based on factors like risk, potential damages, and impact on viability. This includes incentivizing the selection and operation of the best carbon dioxide storage facilities, as well as determining appropriate fees for carbon dioxide injected into oil and gas fields for enhanced hydrocarbon recovery. The Secretary reviews the Fund balance annually to ensure there are enough funds for required payments and decides on fee adjustments based on factors like carbon dioxide injection quantity and claims against the Fund. The Carbon Storage Trust Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States, consisting of deposited amounts from fees collected. The Fund is available for the Secretary to make payments without further appropriation or fiscal year limitation. The Carbon Storage Trust Fund in the Treasury of the United States is available for the Secretary to pay civil claims, long-term stewardship, and administrative costs related to a carbon dioxide storage facility after a certificate of closure has been issued. Amounts in the Fund are limited for these purposes. The Carbon Storage Trust Fund in the Treasury of the United States can only be used for specific purposes outlined in subparagraph (A). Claims for damages under subparagraph (A)(i) are subject to a limit set by the Secretary based on actuarial modeling and net present value analysis. If damages exceed the limit, Congressional action may be required. The Carbon Storage Trust Fund can only be used for specific purposes outlined in subparagraph (A). If actual damages exceed the established amount, Congress may provide for payments in excess, following guidelines set by law. No Fund amounts can be used for claims due to gross negligence or intentional misconduct by a carbon dioxide storage facility operator. The Carbon Storage Trust Fund can only be used for specific purposes outlined in subparagraph (A). Claims of damage relating to carbon dioxide in a storage facility subject to closure certificate shall be filed in the United States Court of Federal Claims and adjudicated according to its procedures. If insufficient funds are available in the Fund, the Secretary may provide initial funding for potential claims. The Secretary may request an interest-bearing advance from the Treasury to fund the Program, with repayment terms specified by the Secretary of the Treasury. SEC. 6. LIMITATION ON CIVIL CLAIMS. A civil claim cannot be brought against the operator, owner of the carbon dioxide storage facility, generator of the carbon dioxide, or owner/operator of the pipeline upon issuance of a certificate of closure, except in cases of gross negligence or intentional misconduct."
