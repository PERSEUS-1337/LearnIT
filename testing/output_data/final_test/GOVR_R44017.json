    "content": "The Trump Administration identified Iran as a national security challenge in a State Department report titled \"Outlaw Regime: A Chronicle of Iran's Destructive Activities.\" The U.S. intelligence community warned of Iran's regional ambitions and military capabilities threatening U.S. interests due to perceived hostility from the U.S., Saudi Arabia, and Israel. Annual Defense Department reports on Iran's military power align with these assessments. Iran's foreign and defense policies are influenced by overlapping motivations, including perceived threats from the United States and its allies. Supreme Leader Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamene'i believes the U.S. aims to overthrow Iran's regime through various means. Iran's leaders view the U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf region as a potential threat. Iran's foreign policy is influenced by the 1979 Islamic revolution, which established a clerical regime with a Supreme Leader. Initially, Iran tried to export its revolution to nearby Muslim states but later abandoned this goal due to regional resistance. The Arab Spring uprisings in 2011 reignited conflicts in the region. Iran's leaders see opportunities in conflicts arising from the Arab Spring uprisings to revive their goal of challenging US influence in the Middle East. They claim that the region's political and economic structures favor the US and its allies, while oppressing Palestinians and Shia Muslims. Iran asserts that Western intervention and the creation of Israel have distorted the region's politics and economics. The Islamic revolution in 1979 made Iran independent of US influence, shaping its foreign policy. Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979 made Iran independent of U.S. influence, shaping its foreign policy to ensure non-interference in domestic affairs. Iran's ideology is pan-Islamic and nonsectarian, supporting Sunni and secular groups for Palestinian rights. Iran's national interests sometimes conflict with its ideology, but its leaders claim a right to be recognized as a major power in the region. Iran's foreign policy actions are similar to those of the Shah of Iran and prior Iranian dynasties. Iran refrains from backing Islamist movements in Central Asian Sunni-inhabited countries and sometimes prioritizes geopolitical interests over aiding other Shia groups. For example, Iran supports Christian-inhabited Armenia over Shia-inhabited Azerbaijan to prevent cross-border Azeri nationalism among its large Azeri minority. Iran's foreign policy reflects differing approaches among key players. Supreme Leader Khamene'i leads hardline factions supporting regional interventions, while more moderate leaders like President Rouhani advocate for not having \"permanent enemies.\" Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and other moderate factions in Iran advocate for a pragmatic foreign policy, emphasizing the benefits of the JCPOA in easing international sanctions and positioning Iran as a trade hub. Despite criticism from hardliners, Zarif remains in his position. The moderate factions, supported by Iran's youth and intellectuals, aim for integration with the West. Public opinion's influence on Iranian foreign policy decisions remains unclear. In 2018, protesters in Iran opposed the use of financial resources for regional interventions instead of improving living standards. Despite international sanctions from 2011-2016 weakening the economy, the government compromised on its nuclear program. Iran's regime maintains regional policies regardless of domestic public opinion, using support for terrorist groups and armed factions as foreign policy instruments. Iran has established Shia militia groups like Lebanese Hezbollah and Iraqi factions, aiding them to gain political legitimacy. The State Department report on international terrorism for 2017 identified Iran as the primary state sponsor of terrorism, providing arms and support to various allied governments and movements. Iran has been supporting groups like Lebanese Hezbollah, Hamas, Houthi rebels in Yemen, Shia militias in Iraq, and other underground violent groups. Iran has been on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism since January 1984. Iran supports armed factions like the Houthi movement in Yemen, the Taliban, and Shia opposition factions in Bahrain. They oppose Sunni terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, actively combating the latter in Syria and Iraq. The Qods Force of the IRGC, led by General Qasem Soleimani, carries out operations in support of Iran's allies. Iran's IRGC and IRGC-QF leaders publicly acknowledge operations supporting regional allies, often framing it as humanitarian aid or protection for Shia sites. Iran supplies weaponry like anti-tank systems, rockets, mortars, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles to its allies. Recent arrests in Europe include Iranian diplomats and operatives, including IRGC-QF agents, involved in terrorist plots against dissidents. Germany, Albania, Belgium, and France have made arrests related to Iranian operatives. In mid-2018, Iranian operatives were arrested in Germany, Belgium, and France for a suspected plot to bomb a rally in Paris. Iran conducts \"high speed intercepts\" of U.S. ships in the Persian Gulf and has diverted international shipping. In 2018, Iran conducted missile strikes on regional opponents, including firing missiles at a Kurdish opposition group in Iraq and Islamic State positions in Syria. Iran has provided funding to political candidates in neighboring Iraq and Afghanistan, made direct payments to leaders of neighboring states, and established training programs for young Muslims. Since 2012, Iran has focused on cyberespionage and conducted cyberattacks against the United States and its allies in the Persian Gulf, targeting oil and gas companies. Iran has conducted cyberattacks against oil and gas companies in the Persian Gulf. Iran utilizes traditional diplomatic tools, with an active Foreign Ministry and embassies in countries it has diplomatic relations with. Iranian presidents travel outside Iran regularly, while Khamene'i rarely travels abroad. Iran held the presidency of the Non-Aligned Movement from 2012 to 2015, hosting the annual summit in 2012. Iran is a party to major nonproliferation conventions. Iran has adhered to commitments under the NPT and CWC, but the international community claims it did not fulfill all obligations. Nuclear negotiations led to the 2015 JCPOA. Iran aims to join the WTO, SAARC, and SCO, with some SCO members supporting its full membership post-JCPOA. Iran participates in multilateral talks on Syria conflict resolution. Iran has participated in multilateral negotiations to resolve the civil conflict in Syria, with a main goal of ensuring Asad's continuation in power. The international community is concerned about Iran's nuclear program, fearing it could lead to the production of a nuclear weapon. This has been a major issue since 2002, with U.S. officials confirming Iran's nuclear activities. Israeli leaders see an Iranian nuclear weapon as a threat to their country's existence, while some Iranian leaders believe it could protect Iran from external threats. In 2002, U.S. officials confirmed Iran's uranium enrichment facility at Natanz and heavy water production plant at Arak. Iran escalated the threat in 2010 by enriching uranium to 20% purity, close to weapons-grade level. The International Atomic Energy Agency found Iran researched a detonation mechanism until 2009. The U.S. insists Iran must not have nuclear-capable missiles. Iranian leaders cite a fatwa against nuclear weapons as proof of their program's civilian intent. Iranian leaders assert that Iran's nuclear program is for civilian uses, including medicine and electricity generation. Iran argues that uranium enrichment is its \"right\" as a party to the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. U.S. officials find Iran's use of nuclear energy acceptable, but IAEA findings cast doubt on Iran's peaceful intentions. There were no claims of Iran diverting nuclear material for weapons. In 2015, then-Vice President Biden warned Iran could have enough material for a nuclear weapon in months. The JCPOA increased Iran's breakout time. The JCPOA increased Iran's breakout time to at least 12 months by limiting centrifuges and uranium stockpiles. These restrictions start to expire in October 2025. The JCPOA was the result of international efforts to negotiate limits on Iran's nuclear program. In 2003, the EU-3 persuaded Iran to suspend uranium enrichment activities in exchange for peaceful nuclear technology and enhanced inspections. Iran's heavy water plant at Arak could produce plutonium for nuclear weapons, but under the JCPOA, Iran deactivated the reactor core and limited its heavy water stockpile. The JCPOA allows for civilian nuclear plants like the one in Bushehr, which Russia supplies with fuel and reprocesses spent material. Iran signed the Additional Protocol to the NPT in 2003 but did not ratify it. The EU-3 and Iran reached the \"Paris Agreement\" in 2004, where Iran suspended uranium enrichment for trade talks. The agreement broke down in 2005, leading to Iran starting uranium conversion in 2005. The IAEA referred the case to the Security Council in 2006, setting a deadline for Iran to cease enrichment. The Security Council set an April 29, 2006, deadline for Iran to cease enrichment. The \"P5+1\" group was formed, including the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain, and Germany. Sanctions were threatened if Iran did not agree to guaranteed nuclear fuel for its civilian reactor. The P5+1 met in February 2009 to incorporate the Obama Administration's commitment to direct engagement with Iran. In July 2009, the United States and its allies demanded constructive actions from Iran. In July 2009, the United States and allies demanded Iran to offer proposals by late September 2009 or face sanctions. A tentative agreement in October 2009 for Iran to reprocess uranium for medical use was not finalized due to Iran's Supreme Leader finding concessions excessive. In April 2010, Brazil and Turkey negotiated with Iran to revive the agreement, leading to the signing of the \"Tehran Declaration\" in May 2010 for Iran to send low enriched uranium to Turkey in exchange for medically useful uranium. Resolution 1929, adopted on June 9, 2010, authorized U.N. member states to sanction key Iranian economic sectors and presented a modified offer of incentives to Iran. Subsequent negotiations in 2010 and 2011 floundered over Iran's demand for immediate lifting of international sanctions. Additional rounds of talks in 2012 and 2013 also faced challenges. In 2012 and 2013, negotiations with Iran did not reach agreement on P5+1 proposals regarding enrichment levels and facilities. The election of Rouhani in June 2013 improved prospects for a nuclear settlement. An interim nuclear agreement, the Joint Plan of Action (JPA), was announced on November 24, 2013, providing sanctions relief in exchange for Iran's actions. The P5+1-Iran negotiations led to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2015, endorsed by UN Security Council Resolution 2231. Iran completed requirements for sanctions relief by January 2016, despite criticism from the Trump Administration. The Trump Administration criticized the JCPOA for not addressing key U.S. concerns about Iran's \"malign activities\" and ballistic missile program. In October 2017, certification of Iranian compliance was withheld, enabling Congress to reimpose sanctions. The President threatened to withdraw from the JCPOA unless nuclear restrictions were extended, strict sanctions imposed on Iran's ballistic missiles, and measures taken to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. The Trump Administration criticized the JCPOA for not addressing key U.S. concerns about Iran's \"malign activities\" and ballistic missile program. In May 2018, President Trump withdrew the United States from the JCPOA and announced the reimposition of all U.S. sanctions by November 2018. In August 2018, a report was provided to Congress on countering Iran's threats. In May 2019, the Trump Administration revoked some waivers for technical assistance to Iran. Iran announced exceeding limits on its nuclear program and threatened further violations if economic demands were not met within 60 days. Iran has active missile and WMD programs, and signed the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1993. The 2018 CWC review conference stated that the United States has concerns about Iran's undeclared chemical weapons program, including failure to declare production facilities, riot control agents, and transfer of weapons to Libya. Iran's activities under the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention are also questionable. Iran is believed to be unlikely to use or transfer chemical or biological weapons. Iran has the largest ballistic missile force in the Middle East, with over ten systems in its inventory or in development, posing a threat to its neighbors. Iran can strike targets up to 2,000 kilometers away and is working on a space launch vehicle that could lead to an intercontinental ballistic missile capability. Iran's missile programs, led by the IRGC Aerospace Force, include the Al Ghadir Missile Command, sanctioned under Executive Order 13382. Reports suggest extensive missile cooperation between Iran and North Korea, with potential technology exchanges. Iran is focused on acquiring, developing, and exporting short-range ballistic and cruise missiles for its forces and regional allies. Iran's forces can use and transfer military capabilities to protect allies and project power. The U.S. intelligence community has noted Iran's development of various military assets, including armed UAVs, ballistic missiles, naval mines, explosive boats, submarines, torpedoes, and cruise missiles. Resolution 2231 calls on Iran not to develop ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons for up to eight years from the JCPOA Adoption Day. The JCPOA itself does not impose specific restrictions on ballistic missiles. Iran has continued developing and testing missiles, despite Resolution 2231. Iran tested a 1,200-mile-range ballistic missile in October and November 2015, and conducted further tests in March and May 2016. A test of a 2,500-mile-range missile in July 2016 reportedly failed. Iran tested a version of the Shahab missile in January 2017. In 2017, Iran tested a missile that exploded after traveling 600 miles. Iran also launched a satellite into space using a Simorgh rocket. Secretary of State Pompeo stated that Iran test fired a medium-range ballistic missile capable of carrying multiple warheads. Iran continues to periodically test short-range ballistic missiles, which has been criticized by both the Obama and Trump administrations. Iran has conducted missile launches that violate Resolution due to their nuclear warhead capability. The U.N. Security Council has not imposed additional sanctions on Iran for these tests. The Trump Administration has demanded a ban on Iran's development of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles as a condition of any revised JCPOA. Quarterly reports on Iranian missile launches and sanctions efforts are required by Section 1226 of the FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act. Iran claims its missile launches are conventional. Iran asserts that conventionally armed missiles are crucial for its defense strategy and rejects new restrictions on its missile program. The US and Israel collaborate on missile defense, including sales of Patriot and THAAD systems to Gulf states. The US aims to counter a potential long-range Iranian missile threat by deploying defense systems in Eastern regions. The United States has helped Israel develop missile defense systems like Arrow, Iron Dome, and David's Sling to intercept ballistic missiles from Iran and rockets from Iranian allies. The FY2013 national defense authorization act urged more efforts to defend against Iran's missile programs. Iran is capable of defending against aggression from neighbors but lacks the ability to project military power outside the region. Iran's forces in Iran are assessed as incapable of defeating the United States in a military confrontation, but they could potentially inflict significant damage on the U.S. military. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps controls the Basij volunteer militia and has a national defense role. The IRGC and the regular military report to a joint headquarters. In June 2016, Supreme Leader Khamene'i appointed IRGC Major General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri as the new Chief of Staff of the Joint Headquarters, showcasing IRGC's dominance in Iran's military. In April 2019, IRGC Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami replaced IRGC Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari as the IRGC Commander-in-Chief, indicating continuity in IRGC operations and political orientation. The IRGC Navy and regular Navy have distinct responsibilities, with IRIN overseeing the Gulf of Oman and IRGCN managing the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz. The IRGC Navy operates Iran's small boats, including patrol boats supplied by China. General Alireza Tangsiri leads the IRGC Navy. The Artesh, led by Brigadier General Amir Hatami, remains part of Iran's defense establishment. The regular air force operates traditional combat aircraft, while the IRGC Aerospace Force manages Iran's missile force. The IRIN controls larger ships and submarines, including Kilo-class submarines from Russia and midget subs from North Korea. Iran is developing lethal systems like advanced naval mines and has a small number of warships on its Caspian Sea coast. Since 2014, Iran has sent warships into the Atlantic Ocean to showcase its growing naval capability. The IRGC Navy focuses on asymmetric warfare, using small boats to swarm U.S. naval assets in the Strait of Hormuz and launch anti-ship cruise missiles. Iran has added naval bases along its coast to enhance its ability to threaten shipping in the strait. Iran's development of asymmetric warfare capabilities includes arming regional allies and proxies to control territory for military equipment emplacement. This allows Iran to expand influence and project power with deniability. Potential retaliatory actions could involve terrorist attacks or directing Iran-supported forces in Afghanistan or Iraq against the U.S. Iran's support for regional terrorist groups led to its addition to the U.S. terrorism list in 1984. Iran has limited military relationships outside the region, focusing on arms purchases. It has obtained weaponry from Russia, China, North Korea, Belarus, and Ukraine. Iran and Russia have collaborated to support the Asad regime in Syria. In 2016, Iran briefly allowed Russia to use its airbase at Hamadan. Iran allowed Russia to use its airbase at Hamadan for strikes in Syria, marking the first time Iran granted a foreign military use of its facilities. Iran has signed military cooperation agreements with several countries including Syria, Afghanistan, Sudan, Oman, Venezuela, Belarus, Russia, China, and South Africa. The IRIN navy is expanding relationships through port visits and joint exercises with various countries. Iran has expanded its military relationships through joint exercises and port visits with various countries, including Indonesia, South Africa, Oman, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Russia, China, Djibouti, and Italy. UN Resolution 2231 requires Security Council approval for any transfer of weapons or military technology to Iran, lasting until October 17, 2020. The UN Resolution 2231 restricts the transfer of weapons and military technology to Iran until October 17, 2020. Defense Minister Hossein Dehgan visited Moscow in February 2016 to discuss possible purchases of $8 billion worth of new conventional arms, which would require Security Council approval. The UN Resolution 2231 requires Security Council approval for Iranian arms transfers until October 17, 2020. Iran's defense budget is around 4% of GDP, reaching 6% in 2018. The national budget is approximately $300 billion, with a defense budget of $25 billion in 2018-2019, up from $23 billion in 2017. President Trump cited these figures in his 2018 announcement of the US withdrawal from the JCPOA. Trump stated in May 2018 that Iran's defense budget had increased by 40% since the JCPOA was implemented. The budget funds the IRGC and regular military. The GCC defense spending is expected to reach $100 billion in 2019. The Trump Administration aims to counter Iran's activities through economic sanctions. Iran has spent over $16 billion since 2012 supporting Assad and proxies. The Trump Administration aims to counter Iran's activities through economic sanctions. Iran has spent over $16 billion since 2012 supporting Assad and proxies, including Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthi militia. Secretary of State Pompeo outlined 12 demands for Iran to change its behavior in exchange for normalized relations, including ending support for terrorist groups and withdrawing forces from Syria. The Trump Administration aims to counter Iran's activities through economic sanctions and coalition building. This includes ending support for terrorist groups, ceasing threatening behavior against neighbors, and threatening military action in response to Iranian direct action. The Trump Administration aims to counter Iran's activities through economic sanctions and coalition building. Secretary of State Pompeo threatened action against Iran for activities by proxies. The US deployed military assets to the Persian Gulf in response to escalating tensions with Iran. The focus of Iranian security policy is the Near East, where Iran uses all instruments of national power. Iran employs all instruments of its national power to expand its influence in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. The dollar value of material support provided by the IRGC-QF to Iran's allies and proxies is difficult to determine. Official U.S. government sources provide broad figures without clear breakdowns. Iran has a 1,100-mile coastline. Iran's focus on dominating the Gulf has been a key aspect of its foreign policy. The Gulf Cooperation Council alliance was formed in response to perceived threats from revolutionary Iran and the Iran-Iraq War. The U.S. military presence in the Gulf now primarily focuses on containing Iran and combating regional terrorist groups. Iran sought to ease tensions with GCC countries in 2017, but long-standing issues hindered the initiative. The rift within the GCC, led by Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Bahrain, allowed Iran to weaken the alliance. This rift occurred after President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, where he expressed strong support for its policies. President Donald Trump visited Saudi Arabia and expressed strong support for its policies. Iranian and Saudi leaders accuse each other of seeking regional hegemony, leading to escalations in various conflicts. Saudi Arabia blamed Iran for supplying ballistic missiles to Houthi rebels in Yemen. In 2017, Saudi leaders tried to undermine Lebanese Hezbollah by pressuring Prime Minister Sa'd Hariri. Saudi Arabia has been pressuring Lebanon Prime Minister Sa'd Hariri to expose Hezbollah's political influence. Iran blamed Saudi Arabia and the Islamic State for an attack in Ahwaz, retaliating by launching missiles against Islamic State positions in Syria. Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic relations with Iran in 2016 after attacks on its embassy in Tehran. In response to past Iran-inspired actions, Saudi Arabia executed 15 Saudi Shias for \"spying\" for Iran and supports a hard line U.S. policy towards Iran. Saudi leaders praised the Trump Administration's exit from the JCPOA and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman Al Saudi threatened to acquire a nuclear weapon if Iran does. Saudi officials cite past incidents like Iran's encouragement of violent demonstrations at Hajj pilgrimages in Mecca as reasons for distrusting Iran. The UAE, aligned with Saudi Arabia, accuses Iran of supporting the Houthis in Yemen and arming them with missiles. Despite political differences, UAE maintains extensive trade ties with Iran, with many Iranian residents and businesses in Dubai. The UAE has a territorial dispute with Iran over islands in the Persian Gulf. The UAE has tried to refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice, but Iran wants to resolve it bilaterally. The GCC supports the UAE's position. Qatar has maintained a neutral stance between anti-Iran sentiment and engagement with Iran. Qatar's policies are often at odds with Iran, including supporting factions in Syria opposed to Bashar Al Asad and participating in the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen. Despite occasional engagement with Iran for prisoner releases, Qatar denies being aligned with Iran and withdrew its Ambassador after the Nimr execution, only to restore relations in 2017 due to Iran's support during the intra-GCC rift. Iran has increased food exports to Qatar as an alternative to supplies from Saudi Arabia. Qatar increased food exports to Qatar as an alternative to supplies from Saudi Arabia. Qatari officials are wary of Iran encroaching on the natural gas field they share. Bahrain accuses Iran of agitating its Shia community and supporting violent factions. Bahrain has withdrawn its Ambassador from Iran multiple times due to Iranian criticism of its treatment of Shia population and alleged Iranian plots. In 2016, Bahrain cut ties with Iran along with Saudi Arabia. Bahrain has thwarted Iran-backed efforts by Shia dissidents and supports the Trump Administration's withdrawal from JCPOA. Bahraini officials claim Iran provides weapons to violent factions in Bahrain, with evidence of Iran supplying equipment for making explosives. No explosively forced projectiles have been used in Bahrain so far. In Bahrain, security forces have arrested individuals plotting to assassinate government officials with alleged military training from IRGC-QF. Six Bahraini Shias were sentenced to death for this plot. Additionally, 29 Bahrainis were convicted for espionage and links to Iran. The Al Ashtar Brigades, a Bahrain militant group, was named as Specially Designated Global Terrorists by the State Department for alleged funding and support from Iran. In July 2018, the State Department designated the Al Ashtar Brigades as a Foreign Terrorist Organization due to Iran's support for Bahraini militant Shia groups. Tensions have arisen over Iranian challenges to Bahrain's independence referendum. Kuwait stands out in the GCC for integrating Shias into its political and economic systems. Kuwait stands out in the GCC for integrating Shias into its political and economic systems. About 25% of Kuwaitis are Shia Muslims, but they have not been restive. Kuwait cooperates with U.S.-led efforts to contain Iranian power and is participating in Saudi-led military action against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Kuwait has also tried to mediate a settlement of the Yemen conflict and broker GCC-Iran rapprochement. Kuwait exchanges leadership-level visits with Iran, with various high-level visits between the two countries. Omani officials believe engagement with Iran is more effective than threats. Oman has consistent engagement with Iran's leadership. President Rouhani and Sultan Qaboos have exchanged visits. Iran and Oman accelerated joint development after the JCPOA. After the JCPOA was finalized, Iran and Oman accelerated their joint development of the Omani port of Al Duqm, which is emerging as a significant trading and transportation outlet. Oman has not supported any factions fighting the Asad regime in Syria and has not joined the Saudi-led Arab intervention in Yemen, enabling Oman to undertake the role of mediator in both conflicts. Omani officials have successfully blocked Iran from smuggling weaponry to the Houthis via Oman in the past two years. The Gulf countries are crucial in containing Iranian power and ensuring the free flow of oil through the narrow Persian Gulf. Iran's potential threat to the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf is a concern for U.S. and GCC officials. Iran has used various assets and tactics, including stopping commercial ships in the strait to resolve disputes. Iran has challenged U.S. forces in the Gulf, demonstrating defiance against U.S. power. There have been unsafe interactions between U.S. Navy and IRGC-Navy, with high-speed intercepts and rocket firings by Iranian vessels. U.S. ships have fired warning shots in response. Since August 2017, Iran has reduced naval challenges against U.S. forces in the Gulf, possibly due to concerns about potential military response from the Trump Administration. President Trump has warned Iran against threatening the United States, and in May 2019, the U.S. deployed additional military assets in response to reported Iranian attack planning. The U.S. deployed additional bombers in response to reported Iranian attack planning in the Gulf region. National Security Adviser John Bolton warned of a strong response to any attacks on U.S. interests or allies. The Obama Administration aimed to strengthen the U.S.-GCC partnership through a strategic dialogue, but no formal security pledge was made. The JCPOA raised concerns among GCC countries. The JCPOA raised concerns among GCC countries about the United States reducing its commitment to Gulf security. President Obama reassured GCC leaders in summit meetings by announcing a U.S.-GCC strategic partnership, including commitments to arms transfers, increased cooperation on security issues, joint military exercises, and a coordinated ballistic missile defense capability. GCC states expressed support for the JCPOA but also backed the Trump Administration's view of Iran as a regional threat. The GCC states have supported the Trump Administration's stance on Iran as a regional threat, leading to relaxation of arms sales restrictions. There are divisions within the GCC on the JCPOA exit, with Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Bahrain in favor, while Qatar, Kuwait, and Oman expressed understanding. The intra-GCC rift is hindering efforts to form a united strategy against Iran. The Trump Administration is working on building a new coalition, including GCC states, Egypt, Jordan, and possibly Morocco, to counter Iran. The Trump Administration is working on building a new coalition, including GCC states, Egypt, Jordan, and possibly Morocco, to counter Iran. The establishment of a Middle East Strategic Alliance (MESA) has been delayed due to the intra-GCC dispute and the Saudi killing of journalist Jamal Kashoggi. Egypt's decision not to participate in MESA in April 2019 was a setback for the concept. The GCC states are crucial for U.S. efforts to counter Iran militarily, with about 35,000 U.S. forces stationed at GCC military facilities. The GCC states host about 35,000 U.S. forces at military facilities under defense agreements, allowing for pre-positioning of military equipment, training, arms sales, and consultations in case of major threats. Additionally, the U.S. utilizes Section 2282 of U.S.C. Title 10 to enhance GCC counterterrorism capabilities through special operations forces training. The United States has improved GCC air and naval capabilities through arms sales, including combat aircraft, precision-guided munitions, combat ships, radar systems, and communications gear. However, some U.S. arms sales to the GCC states have been slowed or halted due to various factors. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia have signed MoUs for U.S. military personnel to train the military and National Guard. The United States has military personnel training Saudi Arabia's military, National Guard, and Ministry of Interior forces. Saudi Arabia has 225,000 active duty personnel, including 200 U.S.-made M1A2 \"Abrams\" tanks and F-15 fighter jets. In late 2018, Saudi Arabia announced a $14 billion purchase of the THAAD missile defense system. Kuwait hosts over 13,000 U.S. Army personnel, including ground combat troops, and has been a key location for Operation Inherent Resolve against the Islamic State. The United States has military personnel stationed in Kuwait, including at Camp Arifjan and Camp Buehring, where they pre-position ground armor and conduct training. Kuwait has a small military force that relies on U.S. arms, such as Abrams tanks and F/A-18 combat aircraft. The Trump Administration has agreed to sell Kuwait 32 additional F/A-18s. In Qatar, over 11,000 U.S. military personnel are stationed at the forward headquarters of U.S. Central Command, overseeing combat aircraft missions in the region. Qatar has a small armed force with 12,000 military personnel. They historically relied on French military equipment but purchased 72 F-15s from the US in a $21 billion deal. An agreement was signed in 2019 to expand Al Udeid air base to accommodate up to 13,000 US personnel. The US has a Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) with the UAE since 1994, with about 5,000 US forces stationed there. The UAE armed forces have about 63,000 active duty personnel, with an air force equipped with U.S.-made F-16s and a desire to purchase the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Trump Administration has agreed to brief the UAE on the aircraft. The UAE has also taken delivery of the THAAD anti-missile system. The United States has a Defense Cooperation Agreement with Bahrain since 1991, with over 6,000 U.S. personnel, mostly Navy, stationed there. Bahrain has a large Naval Support Activity facility with over 6,000 U.S. personnel, mainly Navy. The U.S. has provided older model tanks and a frigate ship to Bahrain as grant \"excess defense articles.\" The country has also purchased F-16s with U.S. Foreign Military Financing credit. The Obama Administration conditioned the sale of additional F-16s on human rights progress, but the Trump Administration dropped that condition in 2017. Arms sales to Bahrain's internal security forces are banned by the Trump Administration. The United States has a facilities access agreement with Oman since 1980, allowing U.S. forces to be deployed at Omani air bases. Oman has a 25,000-person force using British-made military equipment. The GCC states are wealthy and receive minimal U.S. assistance, with Bahrain and Oman receiving a few million dollars. Iran supports Shia-led governments in Iraq and Syria against insurgencies. Challenges in Syria and Iraq have been countered by Iranian, U.S., and Russian interventions. Iran is perceived to be strongly positioned in both countries. Iran's strong position in Iraq is maintained through relationships with Shia militias and IRGC-QF assistance. Iran provided military support to Iraq and Kurdistan against the Islamic State in 2014. Iran's influence in Iraq includes supporting Shia militias with weapons, appointing IRGC-QF members as ambassadors, and supplying natural gas for electricity. The replacement of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki with Haider al-Abadi was influenced by U.S. pressure to be more inclusive of Sunni leaders. Iran-backed militias make up two-thirds of the estimated 110,000-120,000 Shia militiamen in Iraq. Iran's influence in Iraq includes supporting Shia militias with weapons and supplying natural gas for electricity. In 2018, Secretary of Defense Mattis warned of Iran funding Iraqi candidates to increase its influence. In 2018, pro-American figures were named president and prime minister, but Iran seeks a pro-Iranian interior minister. President Rouhani visited Iraq in 2019, signing agreements for new economic linkages. Ayatollah Sistani urged Iran to respect Iraq's sovereignty during Rouhani's visit. Iran-backed militias in Iraq, led by influential commanders with close ties to Iran, are pressuring the government to align more closely with Iran and reduce reliance on the United States. Some commanders advocate for a U.S. withdrawal now that the Islamic State has been mostly defeated in Iraq. These militias resist formal incorporation into the government's forces. Iran-backed militias in Iraq, led by influential commanders with close ties to Iran, are pressuring the government to align more closely with Iran. Reports suggest Iran transferred ballistic missiles to Shia militia allies in Iraq, raising concerns about Iraqi sovereignty. Despite good relations with Iraqi Kurdish leaders, Iran opposes Kurdish independence and supports Iraq's territorial integrity. Iran fired ballistic missiles at a Kurdish opposition group in northern Iraq, casting doubt on Iran's influence in the region. The number of Iranian personnel advising militias in Iraq is unknown, but likely fewer than during the Islamic State challenge in 2014. Iran's assistance to Iraq in 2014 was estimated at $1 billion. Iran's assistance to Iraq in 2014 increased to about $1 billion, with some Iran-backed militias originating from the Mahdi Army formed by Shia cleric Moqtada Al Sadr in 2004. One offshoot, Kata'ib Hezbollah, was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization with an estimated 20,000 fighters. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, its commander, was also identified as a threat to Iraqi stability. Qais al-Khazali, a former leader of the Mahdi Army, broke away to form Asa'ib Ahl Al Haq (AAH) after his capture by U.S. forces. He later took refuge in Iran and returned in 2011 to lead AAH as a political movement. Qais al-Khazali formed Asa'ib Ahl Al Haq (AAH) in 2011, turning it into a political movement with about 15,000 fighters. He is now an elected member of Iraq's national assembly. The Badr Organization, the armed wing of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI), did not oppose the 2003-2011 U.S. intervention in Iraq. Its leader, Hadi al-Amiri, advocates for government reliance on Shia militias. Amiri's faction \"Conquest\" won seats in the 2018 Iraqi election, giving him significant influence. Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, an Iran-backed Shia militia, formed in 2013 to support the Asad regime in Syria. The Nujaba militia was designated as a terrorist entity in March 2019. The Mukhtar Army claimed responsibility for attacking Iranian dissidents in Camp Liberty in late October 2015. U.S. policy aims to limit Iranian influence in Iraq by engaging with nonsectarian Iraqi leaders. The U.S. supported Abadi's reelection to counter Iran's influence, and current Iraqi leaders Salih and Mahdi favor continued U.S. involvement. U.S. officials initially refused to support Iraqi Shia militias in the fight against ISIS, but later supported PMFs not backed by Iran. In October 2017, Secretary of State Tillerson called on Iran-backed militias to disarm. The Trump Administration has worked with the Iraqi government to integrate Iran-backed militias into official security forces or demobilize them. Despite U.S. forces in Iraq focusing on combating Islamic State remnants, Iran-backed Shia militias pose a potential threat. The Administration blamed Iran for rocket attacks near U.S. diplomatic facilities and threatened military action if U.S. interests were attacked. The Trump Administration has integrated Iran-backed militias into official security forces in Iraq. U.S. forces are focused on combating Islamic State remnants, but Iran-backed Shia militias remain a potential threat. The U.S. blamed Iran for rocket attacks near diplomatic facilities and threatened military action if U.S. interests were attacked. Additional U.S. force deployments to the Persian Gulf were prompted by indications of Iranian planning for attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq. Secretary of State Pompeo made an unscheduled visit to Iraq to assure leaders of U.S. support. The U.S. has pressed Iraq to comply with reimposed sanctions on Iran. The United States has imposed sanctions on Iran and ceased dollar transactions with Iran's Central Bank. Waivers have been provided to Iraq to continue buying Iranian natural gas for its power plants. Legislation in the 116th Congress requires sanctions on Iran-backed militias in Iraq. Iranian leaders view Syrian President Bashar al Asad as a key figure. Iran supports Syrian President Bashar al Asad due to strategic reasons, including protecting Hezbollah, maintaining a close Arab ally, preventing a hostile Sunni government, and blocking Sunni extremist groups. Iran signed military cooperation agreements with Syria in 2018, indicating continued support for Asad's regime. In 2018, Iran and Syria signed updated military cooperation agreements, suggesting Iranian intent to remain militarily in Syria indefinitely. Iran-backed militias advanced east to potentially form a secure supply corridor from Iran to Lebanon. Iran fired ballistic missiles from western Iran on suspected Islamic State positions near Hanjin, Syria, claiming retaliation for an attack on Iran's military parade in Ahwaz. Iran-backed forces approached U.S. training locations in southeast Syria combatting the Islamic State, prompting U.S.-led fire to halt their advances. Iran's extensive involvement in Syria, including backing forces in government offensives and constructing bases, has raised concerns for Israel. Iran's presence in Syria, along with Hezbollah, poses a threat to Israel's security. Iran has openly acknowledged its involvement and losses in Syria, with high-ranking IRGC commanders' deaths widely publicized. Iran's extensive involvement in Syria, including backing forces in government offensives and constructing bases, has raised concerns for Israel. Iran's presence in Syria, along with Hezbollah, poses a threat to Israel's security. Iran has openly acknowledged its involvement and losses in Syria, with high-ranking IRGC commanders' deaths widely publicized as heroic sacrifices for the Iranian revolution. Iran participated in multilateral diplomacy for a political solution in Syria before Russia's intervention. Iran attended meetings and did not dissent from joint statements on Syria, invited to the \"Vienna process\" after the US dropped objections post the Iran nuclear agreement. Russia's intervention in Syria allowed Iran to potentially achieve its maximum goals in the region. Iran's extensive involvement in Syria, including backing forces in government offensives and constructing bases, has raised concerns for Israel. Iranian support to Asad against the rebellion is extensive, including the provision of substantial funds, weapons, and IRGC-QF advisors to the Syrian regime. Iran expanded its intervention in Syria after 2012, deploying nearly 2,000 military personnel by late 2015. Iran's extensive involvement in Syria includes deploying nearly 2,000 military personnel by late 2015, including IRGC-QF, IRGC ground force, and regular army special forces. Lebanese Hezbollah fighters and Shia militia recruits, numbering up to 80,000, were also deployed to assist Syrian government forces. Iran's support for the Syrian government includes managing up to 10,000 Shia fighters, some as young as 12 years old. Estimates of Iran's aid to Syria vary, with the UN estimating it at $6 billion per year in 2015. Financial support includes economic aid, subsidized oil transfers, and military aid. The \"Outlaw Regime\" report indicates that Iran has provided at least $4.6 billion in credit to the Assad regime since 2012. U.S. officials emphasize the importance of reducing Iran's presence in Syria to protect Israel and counter Iran's regional influence. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Adviser John Bolton have both highlighted the need to diminish Iranian influence in Syria. In a speech on September 10, 2018, Secretary of State Pompeo reiterated the call for Iran to withdraw all forces from Syria. President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria raised concerns about losing leverage against Iran. However, some experts argue that the current U.S. presence in Syria does not significantly pressure Iran. The Administration has supported Israeli strikes on Iranian positions in Syria to prevent Iran from establishing a military infrastructure. Ultimately, President Trump decided to leave at least 400 U.S. forces in Syria. President Trump decided to leave at least 400 U.S. forces in Syria indefinitely. Executive Order 13572 blocks U.S.-based property and prevents U.S. visas for persons responsible for human rights abuses in Syria. IRGC-QF commanders have been sanctioned under the order. H.R. 4012 in the 115th Congress calls for a National Intelligence Estimate on Iranian support to proxy forces in Syria and Lebanon. Iran uses allies to pressure Israel strategically, viewing Israel as illegitimate and oppressive. Supreme Leader Khamene'i has called Israel a \"cancerous tumor\" that should be removed. Iran's Leader Khamene'i has referred to Israel as a \"cancerous tumor\" that should be eliminated from the region, predicting that Israel will not exist in 25 years. This rhetoric contributes to Israeli concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions posing an existential threat. Iran accuses Israel of being a strategic threat and criticizes the international community for not sanctioning Israel despite its possession of nuclear weapons and non-membership in the NPT. Iran supports groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, which are seen as obstacles to establishing a WMD-free zone in the Middle East. Iran materially supports nonstate actors like Hamas and Hezbollah, providing funding, weapons, and training to various U.S.-designated FTOs. This support is seen as an attempt to pressure Israel and disrupt its security. There is disagreement between Israel and the Obama Administration over the JCPOA, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling it a \"historic mistake.\" Netanyahu criticized the JCPOA as a \"historic mistake\" and urged Trump to renegotiate or terminate it. The Trump Administration exited the JCPOA in May 2018. Israel retains the option of a military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007 but ceded authority to the Palestinian Authority in 2014 and 2017. Hamas has used Iran-supplied weaponry in conflicts with Israel. Hamas has used Iran-supplied rockets in conflicts with Israel since 2008, with smaller scale attacks in 2018. The Iran-Hamas relationship was established in the 1990s to disrupt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. However, a rift occurred in 2012 due to differing views on the Syria conflict. Iran reduced support to Hamas in the 2014 conflict with Israel, but has since sought to rebuild the relationship by providing missile technology. Iran has provided significant support to Hamas, including missile technology for rockets and rebuilding tunnels destroyed in conflicts with Israel. The annual support from Iran to Hamas is estimated to be as high as $300 million, with a baseline amount in the tens of millions. Additionally, Iran supports other Palestinian terrorist groups like PIJ and PFLP-GC, providing up to $100 million annually. Hezbollah, Iran's significant nonstate ally, supports Iranian interests through various means, including terrorism and combat in the region. Iran's close relationship with Hezbollah began in 1982 when Lebanese Shia clerics organized into what later became Hezbollah in 1985. Iranian leaders have used Hezbollah to pressure Israel, leading to Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000. Hezbollah, with Iranian support, has become a major force in Lebanon's politics and a potential global terrorism threat. In the 2006 war with Israel, Hezbollah fired Iranian-supplied rockets and damaged an Israeli warship. The State Department Coordinator for Counterterrorism has stated that Hezbollah's ambitions and global reach rival those of Al Qaeda and ISIS. Iran has assisted Hezbollah in various terrorist attacks. Hezbollah, supported by Iran, wields significant influence in Lebanese politics. Despite criticism for supporting Asad and engaging in conflicts with other Muslims, Hezbollah's position remains strong. Prime Minister Hariri's attempted resignation to weaken Hezbollah's power was unsuccessful. Hezbollah's allies gained seats in the 2018 elections, maintaining its own 13 seats. Iranian support for Hezbollah varies. Iran provides high levels of aid to Hezbollah, including training thousands of fighters in camps in Iran. Hezbollah has become more self-sufficient and assists IRGC-QF operations in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. The IRGC-QF facilitates Hezbollah's involvement in Syria to support the Asad regime, which aligns with Iran and Hezbollah's interests. Hezbollah receives significant financial support from Iran, with estimates of up to $700 million per year. This aid is used for weapons transfers, with Hezbollah reportedly stockpiling over 130,000 weapons since the conflict in Syria. Hezbollah has stockpiled over 130,000 rockets and missiles, mostly supplied by Iran, capable of reaching central Israel. Iran transfers weaponry to Hezbollah through Syria and possibly Beirut. The Trump Administration has tried to disrupt the Iran-Hezbollah relationship with limited success. The United States has supported Israeli air strikes in Syria to disrupt Iranian weapons supplies to Hezbollah. Efforts to build up the Lebanese army as a counterweight to Hezbollah have not achieved stated objectives. Sanctions have been imposed on Iranian entities supplying Hezbollah, but with limited effect due to their limited operation in the international financial system. The 115th Congress enacted legislation expanding sanctions on foreign banks conducting business with Hezbollah. Sanctions on Hezbollah and Iran may have led to increased donations in early 2019, but there has been no noticeable change in Hezbollah's behavior. Iranian leaders saw an opportunity to gain leverage against Saudi Arabia in Yemen after Zaidi Shia Houthi rebels made territorial gains in 2014. The Saudi-led Arab coalition, with U.S. support, has helped the ousted Yemeni government regain some territory since 2015, but has also caused severe humanitarian consequences without resolving the conflict with the Houthis. Iran's support for the Houthis through sophisticated weapons shipments, including anti-ship cruise missiles, has raised concerns among U.S. commanders. The U.N. has reported Iran's arms shipments to the Houthis, leading to U.S. strikes on Houthi-controlled radar installations. Iran's perceived use of the Houthis as a proxy to project power on the Arabian Peninsula is evident in their deployment of warships to the Yemen seacoast in support of the Houthis. The U.S. has expressed concern over Iran's support for the Houthis, including supplying missiles. General Joseph Votel highlighted the strategic importance of the Bab el-Mandeb Strait due to the migration of capabilities supported by Iran. Iran is accused of providing missiles and other weapons to the Houthis, who have fired them on Riyadh. Reports from the U.N. and U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. support these allegations. Two missiles fired on Saudi Arabia by the Houthis were found to be consistent with Iranian design. Iran is accused of supplying missiles to the Houthis, with evidence showing Iranian-designed missiles fired at Saudi Arabia. The State Department displayed captured Iranian-supplied weapons, while Russia blocked a resolution directly implicating Iran for violating the U.N. ban on arms shipments to Yemen. Iran denies providing missiles to the Houthis, claiming they are from pre-existing government stockpiles. Observers believe Iran's support for the Houthis has been limited. Iran has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Houthis since 2012. A 20-person IRGC-QF unit called \"Unit 190\" is responsible for funneling Iranian weaponry to the Houthis, as well as arranging for the travel of IRGC-QF and Hezbollah advisers to Yemen. There are reports that Iran may have sent militia forces from Syria to fight alongside the Houthis. U.S. officials argue for providing logistical support to the Saudi-led Arab coalition in Yemen due to Iran's support for the Houthis. In his speeches, Secretary Pompeo emphasized the need for Iran to end its military support for the Houthis in Yemen. He also warned against Iran's desire to establish a Hezbollah-like presence in the Arabian Peninsula. Despite concerns from Congress about civilian casualties, bills have been passed to reduce or end U.S. support for the Arab coalition in Yemen. The United States has increased assistance to Oman to prevent smuggling of Iranian weapons to the Houthis in Yemen. Iran has been transferring weapons deliveries to small boats in the northern Persian Gulf to evade naval scrutiny. U.S. forces have not engaged in bombing the Houthis but continue to operate against AQAP in Yemen. Iran and Turkey have economic relations but sometimes tense political relations. Turkey is a NATO member, while Iran seeks to limit Turkey's cooperation with NATO near its borders due to sectarian differences. Turkey advocated for Asad's ouster in Syria, while Iran supports Asad. After a failed Turkish coup and concerns over Syrian Kurdish forces, Turkey-Iran differences narrowed. Erdogan now accepts Asad's potential remaining in power. Iran and Turkey cooperate to halt cross border attacks by Kurdish groups in northern Iraq. High-level Iranian military visit to Turkey took place in August 2017. Turkey supports JCPOA and sanctions relief has expanded Iran-Turkey trade. Iran supplies oil and gas to Turkey. President Erdogan has indicated Turkey's stance on Iran. President Erdogan of Turkey has stated that Turkey will not cooperate with the reimposition of sanctions on Iran. The relationship between Iran and Turkey improved after Erdogan's party came to power. Egypt and Morocco are potential members of the planned \"Middle East Strategic Alliance\" to counter Iran. Iran's relations with Egypt have been strained for decades. Iran's relations with Egypt have been strained for decades, with Egypt viewing Hamas as an Islamist threat and seeking to cut off Iranian weapons supplies. Despite some common ground on Syria, including not seeking Asad's ouster, Egypt has not joined the U.S.-backed MESA alliance. Morocco severed diplomatic ties with Iran in May 2018 due to alleged Iranian support for Lebanese Hezbollah. Morocco severed ties with Iran in May 2018 over alleged Iranian support for Lebanese Hezbollah and the Polisario Front seeking independence for Western Sahara. Morocco's foreign minister accused Hezbollah of providing missiles to the Polisario, but no public evidence supports this claim. Morocco has close ties with Saudi Arabia, which supported the decision to cut ties with Iran. Joining the MESA coalition could push Morocco to take a hardline stance against Iran, potentially making unsubstantiated accusations. Iran's regional policies do not focus on influencing politics in Morocco, as there is little evidence of significant Iranian involvement in the country. Iranian leaders rarely mention Morocco in their Middle East policy outlines. There are few pro-Iranian factions in Morocco for the IRGC-QF to collaborate with. Iran's relations with countries in the Caucasus, Central Asia, and South Asia vary, with most engaging in normal trade and diplomacy. Central Asian states, once part of the Soviet Union, are governed by authoritarian leaders. Afghanistan remains politically weak, allowing Iran to exert influence. Iran has territorial disputes with Azerbaijan over the Caspian Sea boundaries. Azeri nationalism could potentially incite separatism among Iran's Azeri Turkic population. Iran has favored Armenia over Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Relations are expanding among Iran, Armenia, and Georgia. Relations are expanding among Iran, Armenia, and Georgia now that Iran is not under international economic sanctions. President Rouhani visited Armenia to discuss a transit and transport corridor between the Persian Gulf and the Black Sea. Azerbaijan has strategic cooperation with the United States against Iran and Russia, including deployments of troops to Afghanistan and counterterrorism cooperation. The United States has supported non-Iranian and non-Russian export routes, but also accepted Azerbaijan's collaboration with Iran on regional energy projects. U.S. sanctions laws exempt long-standing joint natural gas projects involving Iranian firms, such as the Shah Deniz natural gas field and pipeline in the Caspian Sea. Iranian firms, including NICO, have a 10% share in the Shah Deniz natural gas field and pipeline project in the Caspian Sea. Azerbaijan's policy towards Iran has shifted post-sanctions, leading to discussions on the North-South Transport Corridor with Russia and Iran. Iranian investors with ties to governing institutions have been involved in projects in Azerbaijan. Relations between Iran and Central Asian countries are generally positive. Iran has positive relations with Central Asian states, despite their secular leadership and Sunni majority. The countries share a language and culture with Turkey, except for Tajikistan which shares a language with Iran. They collaborate to prevent Sunni jihadist terrorist actions, such as the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. Economic relations between Iran and the Central Asian states are expanding, possibly to align with China's Belt and Road Initiative. In 2014, a new railway was inaugurated through Iran and Kazakhstan. Iran has positive relations with Central Asian states and collaborates to prevent Sunni jihadist terrorist actions. Economic relations between Iran and the Central Asian states are expanding, with a new railway inaugurated in 2014. Iran hoped to position itself as central to energy and transportation routes linking East Asia with Europe, but the reimposition of U.S. sanctions in 2018 may hinder this ambition. Iran, along with India and Pakistan, has observer status in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, but was barred from full membership in 2010. Iran was barred from full membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in 2010 due to UN sanctions. Despite the JCPOA removing this obstacle, opposition from some member countries has prevented Iran from gaining full membership. Iran's President Rouhani attended a 2018 SCO meeting in China to discuss the US exit from the JCPOA. Iran and Turkmenistan share a border and have close ties, including natural gas projects with China as a major customer. China is Turkmenistan's largest natural gas customer. Turkmenistan and the United States support a gas pipeline project through Afghanistan to Pakistan and India (TAPI pipeline). The project is expected to be completed in 2019 and is backed by U.S. officials as part of the New Silk Road Initiative for regional integration. Iran and Tajikistan have cultural ties. Iran and Tajikistan share cultural ties and a common Persian language. President Imamali Rakhmonov believes the two countries face common threats such as terrorism, extremism, and drug trafficking. Tajikistan is concerned about Sunni Islamist extremist groups allied with Al Qaeda or the Islamic State. Islamist movements, including the United Tajik Opposition, posed a serious threat in the early 1990s. The Tajik Opposition posed a serious threat in the early 1990s, and tensions with government-Islamist opposition continued. The Tajikistan government detained members of Jundallah, a Pakistan-based Islamic extremist group. Kazakhstan, a significant power with ample natural resources, hosted nuclear negotiations with Iran in 2013 and expressed hope for economic integration with Iran in 2014. Kazakhstan facilitated the shipment of Iran's low-enriched uranium to Russia in December 2015, meeting a JCPOA requirement. Iran received 60 metric tons of natural uranium from Kazakhstan as compensation. With sanctions lifted, Iran seeks further cooperation with Kazakhstan on energy and infrastructure projects. Kazakhstan has significant oil and gas reserves, including major offshore fields in the Caspian Sea. Iran and Kazakhstan resumed Caspian oil swap arrangements after finalizing the JCPOA in July 2015. Territorial questions regarding the Caspian Sea were partially settled in 2018. Uzbekistan and Iran have moved closer due to shared concerns about Sunni Islamist extremist movements. The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) extremist group was accused of orchestrating bomb blasts in Tashkent in February 1999. The IMU was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) by the State Department in September 2000. Iran-Uzbekistan relations have not significantly changed since the death of Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov in August 2016. Uzbekistan and Iran do not have joint energy-related ventures despite Uzbekistan's substantial natural gas resources. Mirziyoyev aims to enhance regional and international cooperation, potentially benefiting Uzbekistan-Iran relations. South Asian countries face threats from Sunni extremist groups and share common interests with Iran. In Afghanistan, Iran pursues economic development, engages with the central government, supports pro-Iranian groups, and sometimes arms Taliban fighters to regain influence in the region. Iran aims to restore influence in eastern, central, and northern Afghanistan by supporting the Afghan government and engaging with pro-Iranian groups. They cooperate with Afghanistan in countering Islamic State affiliates and narcotics trafficking, while also providing cash payments to the government. Iran has been providing cash payments to the Afghan government, with reports of support to select Taliban and other militants, including training in tactics and weapons. Iran has sought leverage against U.S. forces in Afghanistan and in peace settlements. In the past, Iran allowed the Taliban to open an office in eastern Iran and invited Taliban figures to an \"Islamic Unity\" meeting. Iran invited Taliban figures to an \"Islamic Unity\" conference in Tehran, showing concern about the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan. Iran reportedly tried to derail the U.S.-Afghanistan Bilateral Security Agreement, prohibiting military action from Afghanistan. Secretary Pompeo demanded Iran end support for Taliban and terrorists in the region, despite past conflicts with the Taliban regime. Iran's relations with Pakistan have been uneven, with support during the Iran-Iraq War but a rift emerging in the 1990s due to conflicting support for different factions in Afghanistan. Pakistan's nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan sold nuclear technology to Iran, but tensions arose over Pakistan's support for the Taliban. Iran is concerned about Pakistan harboring ambitions to support the Taliban movement. Iran is concerned about Pakistan potentially supporting the Taliban to regain power in Afghanistan. Two Sunni Muslim militant groups, Jundullah and Jaysh al-Adl, operate from western Pakistan, targeting Iranian regime. The relationship between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia is a significant factor, with Pakistan joining Saudi Arabia's \"antiterrorism coalition\" in 2015. The two nations are focusing on a joint gas pipeline project to address Pakistan's energy shortages and provide Iran with a new customer for its natural gas reserves. Iran completed a gas pipeline project with Pakistan, with China financing the project on Pakistan's side. The project could face U.S. sanctions under the Iran Sanctions Act. India and Iran share historical and strategic ties, with both supporting minority factions in Afghanistan. India has historically supported minority factions in Afghanistan and cooperated with U.S. sanctions on Iran. India has pursued projects in Iran, including the development of the Chabahar port for direct access to Afghanistan and Central Asia. Despite U.S. opposition, India, Iran, and Afghanistan inaugurated the $1 billion expansion of Chabahar in December 2017. In 2017, Iran inaugurated the $1 billion expansion of Chabahar, exempted from U.S. sanctions due to its importance for Afghanistan's development. During Rouhani's visit to India in February 2018, he and Prime Minister Modi signed agreements for future energy cooperation. The military relationship between India and Iran has diminished in recent years, with past concerns about military ties. Iran values its relationship with Russia, a key supporter of the Asad regime and a supplier of arms. Russia values its relationship with Iran, providing a $5 billion line of credit for joint projects. They agreed on strategic energy deals worth $30 billion and oppose the U.S. exit from the JCPOA. Russia and Iran's military cooperation in Syria has been crucial for the Asad regime's success in reclaiming rebel-held territory since 2015. However, their interests in Syria differ, with Iran prioritizing the protection of Hezbollah post-Asad regime, while Russia focuses on preserving the Asad regime and its presence in the Middle East. In 2016, Iran allowed Russia to conduct bombing runs from a base in western Iran, but ended the arrangement after it was publicized due to constitutional restrictions on foreign use of military facilities. Russia remains Iran's main supplier of conventional weaponry. Russia has been Iran's main supplier of conventional weaponry and missile-related technology. In 2016, Iran discussed purchasing combat aircraft, tanks, helicopters, and defense equipment from Russia. U.S. officials have stated they would not support such sales without Security Council approval. Russia previously canceled a contract to sell Iran the S-300 air defense system but lifted the ban after the 2015 nuclear accord. In 2016, Iran and Russia signed a defense cooperation agreement, with Russia providing fuel for Iran's nuclear power reactor at Bushehr. Russia also helped Iran meet JCPOA requirements by shipping out low-enriched uranium. The U.S. ending of sanctions waivers could complicate this assistance. Iran is urging European countries to maintain economic benefits from the JCPOA after the U.S. pullout in 2018. The EU is facing challenges due to substantial engagement in the U.S. economy. The EU is critical of Iran for alleged plots to assassinate dissidents in Europe, leading to sanctions on Iran's Intelligence ministry. Terrorism has historically disrupted Iran-Europe relations, with the US having no dialogue with Iran in the 1990s. The EU maintained a policy of \"critical dialogue\" with Iran but suspended it in 1997 due to high-level Iranian involvement in terrorism. East Asia, including China, is a significant buyer of Iran's oil and has not extensively intervened in the Middle East. China, a P5+1 party to the JCPOA, is Iran's largest oil customer and tended to argue for less stringent sanctions on Iran at the U.N. Security Council. China's compliance with U.S. sanctions was crucial in reducing Iran's oil revenue from 2012-2016. Despite opposing the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA, China continued to buy significant amounts of Iran oil. China sees Iran as a potential ally against Sunni extremists and supports the Asad regime over Islamist rebel groups. President Xi Jinping visited Iran in 2016, focusing on energy and transportation cooperation. Iran and China are working together to expand trade to $600 billion over the next decade as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). This includes Iran's growing economic and diplomatic ties with Central Asian states to benefit from Chinese investments in the region. China has previously provided Iran with advanced weapons and technology, and some Chinese entities have been sanctioned by the United States for this. Iran and China are working to expand trade to $600 billion over the next decade as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative. Some China-based entities have been sanctioned by the United States for allegedly aiding Iran's weapons programs. Japan and South Korea are focused on expanding commercial relations with Iran after sanctions were eased. Both countries are close allies of the United States and wary of Iran's military and technology relations with North Korea. South Korea's then-President visited Tehran in 2016, signing agreements in various fields and agreeing to reestablish direct flights. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had planned to visit Iran in late August 2016 but postponed the visit. During the U.N. General Assembly meetings in New York in September 2017, Abe accepted an invitation from President Rouhani to visit Iran, although no date was announced. The visit, the first by a Japanese leader to the Islamic Republic, is now unlikely due to the U.S. exiting the JCPOA. Japanese and South Korean firms are hesitant to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran, leading them to leave the Iranian market as U.S. secondary sanctions are reimposed. Iran and North Korea, both subjected to international sanctions, have been aligned as \"rogue states.\" North Korea and Iran have military and WMD-related cooperation, including ballistic missile technology development. Iran reportedly funded the transfer of missile and nuclear technology from North Korea to Syria. North Korea supplied Iran with small submarines. There are suspicions of ongoing cooperation on missile and possibly nuclear issues. North Korea's economy is too small to significantly help Iran. Some believe China reexports oil purchased from Iran to North Korea. After international sanctions on Iran's crude oil exports were removed, additional quantities of Iranian oil likely began reaching North Korea via China. However, the expansion of retransfers is limited by U.N. sanctions on oil supply to North Korea. Concerns have been raised about Iran's relations with Latin American leaders who share Iran's distrust of the U.S. Some officials believe Iran has positioned operatives in Latin America for potential terrorist attacks. Iran and Hezbollah's activities in Latin America include money laundering and drug trafficking. Iran and Hezbollah's activities in Latin America involve money laundering, drug trafficking, and counterfeit goods. During Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's presidency, he visited the region to bypass U.S. sanctions and criticize U.S. policies, but few economic agreements were implemented. President Rouhani has shown limited interest in expanding ties with Latin America, as it is not crucial to Iran's economy. He visited Cuba, Chile, Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Venezuela in 2016, following Foreign Minister Zarif's visits to the same countries in August 2016. Iran's officials visited Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to expand economic relations in Latin America. The Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act was enacted in the 112th Congress to counter Iran's influence in the region. A report in June 2013 stated that Iranian influence in Latin America is decreasing due to U.S. efforts. Observers are concerned about Iran's relationships with Venezuela, Argentina, and Cuba. Iran's relations with Cuba have been analyzed by experts in the past, but the U.S. opening to Cuba that began in late 2014 have eased concerns about Cuba-Iran relations. U.S. counterterrorism officials have stated that the tri-border area of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay is a \"nexus\" of arms, narcotics, and human trafficking, counterfeiting, and other potential funding sources for terrorist organizations, including Hezbollah. Iran had particularly close relations with Venezuela during Ahmadinejad's presidency, but neither Rouhani nor Chavez's successor, Nicolas Maduro, have expressed the same level of enthusiasm for the relationship. Iran has expressed support for Maduro in 2019. Iran has expressed support for Maduro in 2019 amidst political challenges from the opposition. U.S. officials accused Iran and Hezbollah of aiding Maduro in retaining support within the Venezuelan military. Iranian leaders publicly backed Maduro as the legitimate leader and resumed a direct air route from Tehran to Venezuela in April 2019. The extent of Iranian or Hezbollah involvement in Venezuela remains unclear. The U.S. did not see a threat from the Iran-Venezuela relationship during Chavez and Ahmadinejad's presidencies. President Obama mentioned in 2012 that the ties did not pose a serious national security threat. Few economic agreements between the two countries were implemented. In the United States, economic agreements announced were not fully implemented. President Maduro restarted a direct air link in 2015 to promote tourism. PDVSA supplied Iran with gasoline since 2009, leading to sanctions under the Iran Sanctions Act. Iran and Hezbollah carried out terrorist attacks in Argentina in 1992 and 1994, affecting Iran-Argentina relations. The 1992 and 1994 terrorist attacks in Argentina were carried out by Hezbollah operatives with assistance from Iranian diplomats. There is no recent indication of planned attacks in Argentina or Latin America, but in 2015, Uruguay reported an Iranian diplomat testing security measures at Israel's embassy. Argentina's Jewish community opposed a 2013 agreement with Iran to form a \"truth commission\" instead of prosecuting those involved in the attacks. In May 2013, Argentine prosecutor Alberto Nisman alleged Iran's long-standing presence in Latin America for intelligence activities. Nisman's suspicious death in January 2015 raised concerns of a conspiracy involving Argentina's president and Iran. President Kirchner was succeeded by Mauricio Macri in December 2015, who did not pursue closer ties with Iran. Sub-Saharan Africa has not been a priority for Iranian foreign policy due to the region's limited influence on Iran's main rivals. Former President Ahmadinejad aimed to strengthen ties with African countries with strained relations with Western powers, but many African nations were hesitant to risk their relationships with the US or face backlash from Sunni populations. During the Saudi-Iran dispute in January 2016, several African countries that Iran had courted as allies severed ties, including Djibouti, Comoros, Somalia, and Sudan. Senegal, once a focus of Ahmadinejad's Africa outreach, also distanced itself from Iran. Iran has shown interest in cultivating African countries as trading partners, especially with the Trump Administration's decision to exit the JCPOA and reimpose sanctions. Tehran also sees Africa as a potential market for its arms, while the UAE seeks allies in the Horn of Africa to counter Iranian influence. West Africa's Lebanese diaspora communities could be targets for Iranian influence and Hezbollah activities. Rouhani has not prioritized relations with African countries. Iran sees Africa as a market for arms exports and diplomatic support, with Al Mustafa University promoting Iran's message in various African countries. The IRGC-QF operates in Africa to secure arms-supply routes and counter U.S. interests, with some countries disrupting IRGC-QF-backed activities. In Kenya, two Iranian men were found guilty of planning bombings against Israeli targets in 2013. Iran's relations with Sudan have diminished since 2014 as Sudan aligns with Iran's rivals, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Sudan, like Iran, is still considered a state sponsor of terrorism by the United States, but there has been praise for Sudan's counterterrorism efforts. Sudan provided Iran with a channel to supply weapons. Iran's relationship with Sudan allowed Iran to supply weapons to Hamas and other pro-Iranian groups in Gaza. This partnership began in the 1990s when Islamist leaders in Sudan welcomed international Islamist movements. Iran provided weapons for Sudan's internal conflicts and reportedly armed and trained Sudanese forces. Israel accused Iran of shipping weapons through Sudan to Gaza and took military action against sites in Sudan linked to Iran's support of Hamas. Since 2014, Sudan has shifted its alliances away from Iran towards Saudi Arabia and the UAE. This shift was evident when Sudan closed Iranian cultural centers, joined the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, and severed ties with Iran in 2016. In January 2016, Sudan cut ties with Iran following Saudi Arabia's execution of Nimr. Key questions revolve around U.S. actions impacting Iran's behavior and the potential for conflict. Despite various U.S. strategies, Iran's regional influence remains strong. The Trump Administration believed that the JCPOA sanctions relief empowered Iran's malign activities, leading to the decision to withdraw from the agreement and reimpose sanctions. However, Iran's regional influence is more tied to regional conflicts than financial resources. Deploying more U.S. military forces may deter some Iranian actions, but historically, such buildups have not forced Iran to change its behavior. Iranian actions have not been altered by U.S. buildups. Administration efforts against Iran include sanctions, advice, training, and deployment of forces to intercept weapons shipments. Increased U.S. pressure, especially military action, could deepen involvement in regional conflicts. Iran is likely to supply allies with more accurate weaponry. Iran's allies and proxies in Syria and Iraq may establish a secure land corridor to Lebanon, potentially leading to conflict with Israel. The lifting of the U.N. arms sales ban in October 2020 will allow Iran to modernize its armed forces and potentially move ground forces across waterways. Iran could also increase support to opposition factions in Bahrain and emerge as a major regional energy and trading hub. Iran's participation in China's BRI initiative could expand its political influence. Regional powers may increase military cooperation with Iran, strengthening its capabilities. Iran might accept regional settlements to maintain some sanctions relief and avoid confrontation. This could involve cooperating on Syria, curbing support for Hezbollah and Hamas, but not reducing political backing for Hezbollah. Iran's foreign policy could shift due to domestic factors like protests, potentially leading to a reduction in interventions, defense budget cuts, or limits on missile development. If unrest escalates further and the regime falls, Iran's foreign policy may undergo significant changes. If unrest escalates dramatically and the regime loses power, Iran's foreign policy could shift significantly, potentially becoming more favorable to U.S. interests. The departure of the Supreme Leader could also lead to a sharp change in Iran's foreign policy, depending on the views of his successor."
