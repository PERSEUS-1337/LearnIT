    "content": "The FCC's early regulation of cable television was based on the Communications Act, which unified federal regulation of wire and radio communications. Title II gave the FCC authority over telephone service providers, while Title III covered radio transmission providers and broadcast television. As commercial television evolved in the late 1940s and 1950s, municipalities began experimenting with cable systems due to poor broadcast reception. In the 1950s, municipalities started experimenting with cable systems to improve poor broadcast reception. The FCC initially did not regulate these systems, known as \"Community Antenna Television,\" but later asserted jurisdiction in a 1966 order due to cable television's close relationship to its regulatory scheme. The Supreme Court affirmed the FCC's authority to regulate cable television in a 1968 decision, enabling the FCC to regulate operational aspects of cable television while state and local authorities continued to regulate cable operators through franchises. The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 (Cable Act) was the first federal statutory scheme to regulate cable television, recognizing the local nature of cable regulation and allowing franchising authorities to impose fees and conditions on cable operators for using public rights-of-way. Federal courts supported this local regulation to ensure optimal use of the cable medium in the public interest. The Cable Act of 1984 aimed to regulate cable television by ensuring local responsiveness, promoting diversity of information sources, and minimizing unnecessary regulation. It added Title VI to the Communications Act, preserving franchising authorities' power to award franchises and requiring cable operators to secure franchises before providing services. Title VI of the Cable Act allows franchising authorities to regulate services, facilities, and equipment provided by cable operators, including requiring channel capacity for PEG use or I-Nets. Franchising authorities can charge fees capped at 5% of the operator's gross annual revenue, defined as franchise fees, excluding taxes or fees of general applicability. Congress amended Title VI of the Cable Act in 1992 and 1996 to increase competition in the cable market by prohibiting exclusive franchises, allowing potential cable operators to sue franchising authorities for refusing to award a franchise, and enabling telecommunication providers to enter the cable television marketplace. The Cable Act amendments in 1992 and 1996 allowed telecommunications providers regulated under Title II to offer video programming services, repealed a ban on offering video programming, and added provisions for open video systems. Franchising authorities were barred from conditioning franchise grants on cable operators providing telecommunications services. Many phone companies upgraded networks to enter the cable market, with FCC orders issued to interpret franchising provisions. In 2007, the FCC adopted the First Order to address burdensome demands on new entrants in the cable market. The order aimed to reduce entry barriers by clarifying when Title VI prohibits franchising authorities from imposing certain franchise conditions. Practices constituting an \"unreasonable refusal\" to award a franchise were highlighted, such as delays in decision-making and specific requirements. The First Order addressed burdensome demands on new entrants in the cable market by clarifying when Title VI prohibits franchising authorities from imposing certain franchise conditions. It highlighted practices constituting an \"unreasonable refusal\" to award a franchise, such as delays in decision-making and specific requirements. The Order also addressed issues related to franchise applications, \"build out\" requirements, PEG and I-Net Requirements, and level-playing-field requirements for new cable operators. The Sixth Circuit upheld the FCC's authority to issue the Order in Alliance for Community Media v. FCC. The FCC's First Order clarified Title VI rules for new entrants in the cable market, later extended to incumbent providers in the Second Order. The Reconsideration Order affirmed these rulings and allowed noncash payments by franchising authorities to count towards the 5% franchise fee limit. In 2017, the Sixth Circuit vacated the FCC's determinations in the Second Order and Reconsideration Order. The FCC adopted the Third Order on August 1, 2019, clarifying the basis for counting in-kind payments towards the 5% franchise fee cap and preempting state and local regulations inconsistent with Title VI. The Third Order extended the Commission's rules to state-level franchising authorities, stating there is no statutory basis for distinguishing between state and local franchising actions. The FCC's post-2007 orders have focused on key issues within Title VI's framework, including unreasonable refusal to award franchises, 5% franchise fee cap, and regulation of mixed-use networks. Title VI prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably refusing to grant a franchise to a cable operator. The FCC's interpretations of these provisions have been discussed in detail. The FCC's post-2007 orders have focused on key issues within Title VI's framework, including unreasonable refusal to award franchises. The Sixth Circuit upheld the FCC's interpretation of the standard, allowing franchising authorities to impose certain conditions on cable operators. This includes requiring PEG channel capacity, facilities, or financial support, and I-Net services or facilities. However, franchising authorities are limited by Section 621(a)(1) from granting exclusive franchises or unreasonably refusing to award additional competitive opportunities. The FCC clarified practices that constitute an unreasonable refusal of a new franchise under Section 621(a)(1) of Title VI. Examples include delaying decisions on franchise applications, imposing burdensome requirements, and demanding similar terms as incumbent operators. The FCC set decision deadlines to prevent delays in franchise applications, with time limits of 90 days for entities with rights-of-way access and six months for those without. If these deadlines pass, applications are deemed granted. The FCC also stated that requiring new franchise applicants to build out their cable systems may be an unreasonable refusal of a franchise, depending on existing facilities or market penetration. The FCC clarified that certain build-out requirements are per se unreasonable refusals under Section 621. PEG and I-Net terms and conditions that are \"completely duplicative\" are deemed unreasonable unless serving a public safety purpose. The FCC also found PEG requirements exceeding those of incumbent cable operators as unreasonable. Level-playing-field requirements in local laws or franchise agreements were determined to be an unreasonable refusal of a franchise. The FCC concluded that new cable entrants face different challenges from incumbent operators, leading to unreasonable mandates that impede competition. Franchising authorities challenged this interpretation in court, but the Sixth Circuit upheld the FCC's decision. The court found ambiguity in the phrase \"unreasonably refuse\" and supported the FCC's interpretation. The court upheld the FCC's interpretation of the phrase \"unreasonably refuse\" in the First Order, stating it was reasonable and not foreclosed by Title VI. This means that franchising authorities must abide by the rules set out in the First Order, including what constitutes an unreasonable refusal by a cable operator. If a franchising authority denies a franchise request for an unreasonable reason, the cable operator can sue for relief. If no decision is made within the allotted time, the franchise is deemed granted. Title VI limits franchise fees to 5% of the cable operator's revenue. The FCC has clarified the exceptions to the 5% cap on franchise fees for cable operators, including PEG capital costs and incidental costs exemptions. Non-monetary contributions are subject to the 5% cap unless they fall under express exceptions. Litigation over the definition of \"franchise fee\" is ongoing. Section 622 limits franchise fees to 5% of the cable operator's gross annual revenues derived from providing cable service. The FCC has clarified exceptions to the 5% cap on franchise fees for cable operators, including PEG capital costs and incidental costs exemptions. Section 622 limits franchise fees to 5% of the cable operator's gross annual revenues derived from providing cable service. The FCC has provided guidance on expenses subject to the 5% cap for cable operators, including in-kind contributions, PEG capital costs, and incidental costs exemptions. The agency clarified that in-kind contributions unrelated to cable service are subject to the 5% cap, and this also applies to cable-related in-kind contributions. The Sixth Circuit vacated the FCC's conclusion on cable-related in-kind contributions counting towards the 5% cap. The court found the FCC's interpretation of \"franchise fee\" to be arbitrary and capricious, leading to the issuance of the Third Order detailing the reasons for including such contributions. The FCC issued the Third Order, explaining its decision to include cable-related in-kind contributions in the 5% cap for franchise fees. The Commission argued that the broad definition of \"franchise fee\" encompasses in-kind contributions, with no limitations or exemptions for such expenses. The FCC's Third Order clarified that cable-related, in-kind contributions are not exempt from the 5% cap on franchise fees, despite arguments to the contrary. The Commission acknowledged that certain types of in-kind contributions may be excluded, such as obligations to build out cable systems or meet specific customer requirements. The FCC's Third Order clarified that cable-related, in-kind contributions are not exempt from the 5% cap on franchise fees. The Commission noted that requirements to build out cable systems or meet specific customer service obligations are not considered franchise fees. The PEG capital costs exemption covers certain cable-related expenses, while specific in-kind expenses like providing free or discounted cable service to public buildings are subject to the 5% cap. The FCC's Third Order clarified that cable-related, in-kind contributions are not exempt from the 5% cap on franchise fees. The FCC reasoned that fair market value should be used to measure cable-related in-kind services for the 5% cap. Despite challenges in court, the FCC maintains its position that in-kind contributions are not categorically exempt from the cap. The FCC's interpretation of the PEG capital costs exemption has evolved, broadening to include equipment costs in addition to construction costs. Capital costs, such as equipment like a van or camera, are now considered exempt, while operating costs are not. The FCC's interpretation of the PEG capital costs exemption has evolved to include equipment costs, while operating costs are not exempt from the franchise fee calculation. The scope of the exemption remains uncertain as the FCC deferred consideration on whether the costs of providing PEG channel capacity fall under the exclusion. The Third Order is being challenged in court, and its interpretation could potentially be vacated. The FCC's interpretation of the PEG capital costs exemption has evolved to include equipment costs, while operating costs are not exempt from the franchise fee calculation. The scope of the exemption remains uncertain as the FCC deferred consideration on whether the costs of providing PEG channel capacity fall under the exclusion. The FCC has articulated its position on in-kind contributions and the PEG capital costs exemption, but the interpretation of the \"incidental costs\" exemption in the First Order remains unclear. The exemption is narrowly defined to include specific expenses listed in Section 622(g)(2)(D), excluding unlisted costs like attorney fees and consultant fees. The FCC's interpretation of the \"incidental costs\" exemption in the First Order allows for certain additional expenses beyond those listed in the statute, such as application or processing fees. The Sixth Circuit upheld the FCC's interpretation, stating that the phrase \"incidental to\" is open to multiple interpretations. The FCC's interpretation of the \"incidental costs\" exemption in the First Order allows for additional expenses beyond those listed in the statute. The phrase \"incidental to\" had multiple interpretations, leading to the conclusion that the FCC's rules on fees are reasonable constructions entitled to deference under Chevron. The interpretation is not currently facing legal challenges, except for minor expenses mentioned in the First Order. Only expenses listed in Section 622(g)(2)(D) are exempt from the 5% cap under the incidental costs exemption. Disagreements between the FCC and franchising authorities persist regarding the regulation of non-cable services provided over a mixed-use network. The FCC's interpretation of Title VI provisions prevents franchising authorities from regulating non-cable services on mixed-use networks. The Sixth Circuit upheld this for new entrants but not for incumbent cable operators. The Third Order clarified that state and local governments cannot regulate non-cable services provided by cable operators, preempting such efforts under Title VI. Legal challenges to the Third Order are ongoing. The ongoing legal challenge to the Third Order unsettles the issue of whether Title VI provisions prohibit franchising authorities from regulating non-cable services on mixed-use networks. Sections 602 and 624 of Title VI exclude certain facilities and limit the authority of franchising authorities to regulate services provided by cable operators. The FCC has clarified that franchising authority jurisdiction applies only to the provision of cable services over cable systems, excluding common carrier facilities. The First Order applied to new entrants, but the Second Order extended these conclusions to incumbent providers. The ongoing legal challenge to the Third Order questions whether Title VI provisions prohibit franchising authorities from regulating non-cable services on mixed-use networks. The FCC extended its conclusions on franchising authority jurisdiction to incumbent providers, but a legal challenge questioned whether Title VI provisions allow regulation of non-cable services on mixed-use networks. The Sixth Circuit vacated the FCC's extension of the mixed-use network rule to incumbent cable providers, stating that Section 602 did not support this interpretation. The FCC extended its conclusions on franchising authority jurisdiction to incumbent providers, but a legal challenge questioned whether Title VI provisions allow regulation of non-cable services on mixed-use networks. The Sixth Circuit vacated the FCC's extension of the mixed-use network rule to incumbent cable providers, stating that Section 602 did not support this interpretation. In response, the FCC's Third Order provided additional support for extending the mixed-use rule to incumbent cable operators, citing Section 602's definition of \"cable system\" as the basis for barring franchising authorities from regulating incumbent cable operators when acting as common carriers. The FCC concluded that franchising authorities cannot regulate non-common carriers providing other services along with cable, such as broadband internet access. The Third Order referenced Section 624(b)(1) to support this, stating that franchising authorities may not establish requirements for video programming or other information services. The term \"information services\" is interpreted to include broadband internet access service, aligning with the FCC's interpretation under Title I of the Communications Act. The FCC's Third Order clarifies that franchising authorities cannot regulate non-common carriers providing services like broadband internet access along with cable. It also preempts state and local laws imposing fees or restrictions on cable operators for non-cable services in connection with public rights-of-way. This decision aims to prevent competitive disadvantages for cable operators. The city imposed a \"license-fee\" on telecommunications services over public rights-of-way, including broadband internet services, not considered a franchise fee under Title VI. Other governments used different legal authority to regulate mixed-use networks after the Oregon Supreme Court's decision. The FCC's Third Order rejects the City of Eugene's interpretation of Title VI. The FCC's Third Order rejects City of Eugene's interpretation of Title VI, stating that it preempts any state or local requirement imposing obligations on cable operators beyond what Title VI allows. This includes regulating terms of access and operation in local rights-of-way. The FCC has authority to preempt state or local laws that are inconsistent with Title VI, allowing the Commission to identify the scope of subject matter expressly preempted. Franchising authorities cannot regulate non-cable services over mixed-use networks by new entrants, and the Third Order's broad preemption of any state and local law regulating cable operators' use of public rights-of-way raises uncertainty about the extent of Title VI preemption. The FCC has the authority to preempt state and local laws inconsistent with Title VI, including regulations on non-cable services by cable operators. Petitions challenging the Third Order allege violations of the Communications Act and the U.S. Constitution, raising complex legal issues. Petitions challenging the Third Order allege violations of the Communications Act and the U.S. Constitution, raising complex legal issues related to statutory interpretation, administrative, and constitutional law. Commenters argue that Title VI contradicts the FCC's broad interpretation of franchise fees, citing provisions like Section 611(b) as evidence. A reviewing court would likely apply the Chevron framework to resolve such statutory arguments, as seen in the Sixth Circuit's decision in Montgomery County. The court may uphold the Third Order's interpretation of the franchise fee provision under the Chevron doctrine. The Sixth Circuit's decision in Montgomery County shows that the FCC's rulings could be vacated if found arbitrary and capricious under the APA, regardless of Chevron deference. The Sixth Circuit held that the FCC acted arbitrarily and capriciously by expanding its franchise fee interpretation without sufficient explanation or statutory basis. It remains to be seen if the court will find the FCC's efforts in addressing these concerns in the Third Order satisfactory. Challengers of the FCC's Third Order may argue that the Commission failed to address evidence contradicting its rules or consider important counterarguments. Petitioners also criticized the FCC for not addressing potential public safety effects of the order's treatment of cable-related contributions. State or local challengers may question the order's preemption assertion, especially after a recent D.C. Circuit decision struck down a similar FCC attempt. Justice Thomas, along with Justice Gorsuch, expressed concerns about the FCC's deregulatory policy preempting state regulatory efforts in a case involving Voice over Internet Protocol service. They questioned the FCC's statutory authority to preempt state and local regulation in areas outside its purview. This could lead to challenges arguing that Title VI's preemption provision does not extend to non-cable services. Challengers to the Third Order may also raise constitutional arguments against preventing state and local governments from regulating non-cable services based on state law. The Third Order prevents state and local governments from regulating non-cable services provided by cable operators, which some argue violates the anti-commandeering doctrine. The Supreme Court clarified this doctrine in Murphy v. NCAA, stating that Congress cannot issue direct orders to state legislatures. This promotes accountability in state regulation. The anti-commandeering doctrine promotes accountability by preventing Congress from shifting regulatory costs to states. It contrasts unlawful commandeering with cooperative federalism regimes where states can choose to implement federal standards. Some argue that the FCC's Third Order violates this doctrine by effectively commanding local governments to grant right-of-way access. The FCC's Third Order is contested by the National League of Cities, arguing that it violates the anti-commandeering doctrine by shifting costs to local governments and blurring responsibility. The issue may hinge on whether Title VI, as interpreted by the FCC, is a permissible cooperative federalism program. The FCC's Third Order is being challenged by the National League of Cities for violating the anti-commandeering doctrine and shifting costs to local governments. There are disagreements over the practical impact of the FCC's rules, with concerns about the potential financial strain on local budgets and the imposition of a 5% cap on in-kind franchise requirements. The FCC's Third Order, which includes a 5% cap on franchise requirements, has sparked debate. Some argue it forces local authorities to choose between PEG access and I-Nets, while others believe it benefits consumers by reducing costs passed on to them. Dissenting commissioners fear it diminishes local authority and public rights-of-way value. Congress may need to address the issues raised by the FCC's Third Order, including the interpretation of Title VI's scope and the definition of \"franchise fee.\" Federalism issues may arise if Congress attempts to prohibit state and local authorities from regulating non-cable services provided by cable operators. The Cable Act allows for \"cooperative federalism\" regimes where states can choose to regulate according to federal standards. This avoids anti-commandeering issues by setting federal standards for ancillary non-cable services. The act also imposes federal standards and restrictions on franchising authority power, including the Build-Out Requirement for cable operators. The Cable Act defines key terms such as Cable Operator, Cable Service, Cable System, Common Carrier, Franchise, and Franchise Fee. Cable Operator is defined as a person or group providing cable service over a cable system. Cable Service is the one-way transmission of video programming to customers. Cable System is a facility providing video programming to multiple subscribers within a community. Common Carrier provides interstate telecommunications service. Franchise is the right to operate a cable system in a given area. Franchise Fee is any tax, fee, or assessment related to cable services. Franchise Fee is a tax or fee imposed on cable operators or subscribers by a franchising authority. Franchising Authority is a governmental body responsible for awarding franchises. I-Net refers to an institutional network for non-residential customers. In-Kind means non-monetary. PEG stands for Public, Educational, or Governmental. Telecommunications is regulated by the Communications Act. Telecommunications is the transmission of user-selected information without alteration. Telecommunications Service is offering this directly to the public for a fee. Title VI encompasses provisions of the Cable Act."
