    "content": "Federal land management decisions impact the U.S. economy, environment, and social welfare by determining the acquisition, development, management, and protection of federal lands. The 116th Congress may address federal land policy issues through oversight, authorizations, or appropriations. The federal government manages approximately 640 million acres of land, with four agencies administering 608 million acres: the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service. The federal government manages approximately 640 million acres of land, with agencies like BLM, FWS, and NPS overseeing most of the lands in the West and Alaska. The Department of Defense administers around 11 million acres in military bases. Energy and mineral resources below ground and offshore are also managed by various agencies, including BLM for onshore subsurface mineral estate and BOEM for offshore areas. Federal land policy and management issues revolve around questions of national vs. local benefits, balancing current uses with future opportunities, and deciding on management and protection programs. Stakeholders have differing views on maintaining or divesting federal land, with some issues involving both federal and nonfederal land. Policy positions on federal land issues may not align with party lines but instead with rural-urban, eastern-western, and coastal-interior interests. Several House and Senate committees have jurisdiction over federal land issues, such as national forests management. These issues are often addressed during annual appropriations for FLMAs' programs. This report introduces complex federal land management issues, aiming to provide a broad overview. Federal land management issues are broad and cover various categories such as Federal Estate Ownership, Funding, Climate Policy, Energy Resources, Forest and Range Management, Recreation, Species, and Wildfire Management. The report provides recent data on federal land ownership history, from the original 13 states ceding land to the central government to the creation of national parks and forest reserves in the late 1800s. The \"reservation era\" in the late 1800s established federal agencies to manage natural resources on federal lands. Controversy surrounds the extent of federal land ownership, with debates on whether to dispose of some lands or acquire more for conservation and recreation purposes. Discussions also focus on expanding or curtailing certain land designations like national monuments and wilderness areas. Debates about federal land ownership, including efforts to divest federal lands, often revolve around constitutional principles such as the Property Clause and the Supremacy Clause. Some states are seeking to assume title to federal lands within their borders, echoing past efforts like the \"Sagebrush Rebellion\" in the 1980s. This is driven by concerns about the amount and management of federal land within the state. Additionally, there are challenges in ensuring border security while protecting federal lands managed by multiple agencies with different missions. The Property Clause and Supremacy Clause grant Congress authority over federal lands, allowing for transfer of ownership to states or other entities. Congress's power over federal lands is described as \"without limitations\" by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management manage federal lands under a multiple-use mission, including activities like livestock grazing, energy development, recreation, timber production, and wildlife habitat. Differences in management decisions sometimes lead to lack of consensus. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service manages 89 million acres as part of the National Wildlife Refuge System with a mission to conserve plants, animals, and habitats. Other uses on these lands are permitted if compatible with the conservation mission. The National Park Service also plays a role in managing federal lands for various purposes. The National Park Service (NPS) manages 80 million acres in the National Park System with a mission to preserve resources and provide for public enjoyment. The Bureau of Ocean Management (BOEM) oversees energy resources in areas of the outer continental shelf to balance energy independence, environmental protection, and economic development. The Bureau of Ocean Management (BOEM) manages offshore conventional and renewable energy resources, including scheduling lease sales, administering existing leases, and issuing easements for renewable energy technologies. Congress has granted the Federal Land Management Agencies various responsibilities related to federal land designations, national park system management, and national forest system management. The Federal Land Management Agencies (FLMAs) have varying authorities for land acquisition and disposal. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has broad authority under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), while the National Park Service (NPS) requires congressional action for land acquisitions. The Forest Service (FS) can acquire lands within or contiguous to national forests and has limited disposal authorities. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) can acquire lands but lacks general authority to dispose of them. The Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 grants FWS authority to acquire land for the National Wildlife Refuge System using funds from sources like hunting and conservation stamps. Congress debates federal land ownership and management, including acquisition and disposal policy. Funding for federal land and FLMAs presents issues for Congress. Congress debates funding questions related to the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), including levels, sources, and uses of funding. There are also discussions on compensating states for federal lands, maintenance of agency assets, and addressing backlog of maintenance projects. The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 established the Land and Water Conservation Fund in the U.S. Treasury to support outdoor recreation facilities and promote the health of U.S. citizens. The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 created the LWCF in the U.S. Treasury to fund outdoor recreation purposes. It has been the main source of funding for land acquisition by FLMAs and has also supported state grant programs and federal programs related to lands and resources. $900 million in specified revenues are annually deposited in the fund, mostly from oil and gas leasing in the OCS. Congress determines discretionary appropriations yearly, with fluctuating levels since the program's inception. Additionally, the state grant program receives permanent appropriations. There is debate on how LWCF funds should be allocated. Current congressional issues surrounding the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) include debates on fund allocation, amount for land acquisition, state grant program, and other purposes. Additional debates focus on providing permanent appropriations, directing revenues to the LWCF, limiting fund use for specific purposes, and requiring funds for facility maintenance. The state grant program is also a point of contention, with discussions on funding apportionment, competitiveness of grants, and impact of mandatory funding increases. Some states argue for compensation for services related to federal lands, such as fire protection and police cooperation. State and local governments receive payments through various programs due to the presence of federally owned land. The federal government compensates state and local governments for services related to federally owned land through various payment programs, including Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) based on federal acreage and population. PILT is the most widely applicable onshore program administered by the Department of the Interior. Additionally, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has a separate payment program for certain refuge lands called the Refuge Revenue Sharing program. The federal government also shares revenue from mineral and energy development with states, with Alaska receiving 90% of revenues from federal onshore development. The Secure Rural Schools program compensated counties in Oregon for declining timber harvests, but expired after FY2018. Alaska receives 90% of revenues from federal onshore leases, while coastal states share revenue from offshore mineral and energy development at varying rates. Some states advocate for a larger share of revenue due to project impacts, while others argue for funds to go to the Treasury or federal programs. The CRS reports discuss various issues related to federal lands, including PILT, Secure Rural Schools Act, compensation to local governments, Oregon and California Railroad Lands, mineral royalties, and compensating state and local governments for tax-exempt federal lands. The FLMAs are responsible for maintenance of infrastructure. Congress is concerned about deferred maintenance and repairs on federal lands. The agencies emphasize the negative impact of deferring maintenance on federal lands, leading to increased deterioration, higher repair costs, and decreased value and safety. The NPS backlog has grown to $11.2 billion in FY2017, with a significant portion allocated to roads, bridges, and trails. Other agencies like FWS, BLM, and FS also face maintenance backlogs, totaling billions of dollars in deferred maintenance. The four federal land management agencies have a combined FY2017 backlog of $18.5 billion attributed to funding shortfalls for capital improvement projects. There is debate over funding levels, using funds from other programs, balancing maintenance with acquiring new assets, and prioritizing infrastructure maintenance. Scientific evidence shows that the United States' climate has been changing in recent decades, posing complex issues for federal land management in terms of mitigation, adaptation, and resiliency. Climate change introduces uncertainty about previously stable conditions, affecting federal lands with concerns such as invasive species, sea-level rise, wildlife habitat changes, and increased vulnerability to extreme weather events. This uncertainty also impacts tourism and recreation. The effects of climate change on tourism and recreation include an earlier and longer fire season, warmer winter temperatures allowing for extended tourism seasons but also leading to insect infestations, habitat shifts impacting sensitive species, and changes in iconic federal lands like Glacier National Park. The role of Federal Land Management Agencies in responding to climate change is debated, with concerns about resource diversion from other agency activities. The impact of energy production on federal lands is a topic of debate, with greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels on federal lands accounting for a significant portion of national emissions. Carbon sequestration on federal lands offsets some of these emissions, raising questions among observers. In 2014, questions arose about promoting different energy sources on federal lands due to their impact on climate change. Some stakeholders advocate for prioritizing renewable energy production, while others argue for a robust traditional energy program to ensure energy security and competitiveness. Legislative issues for Congress may include managing federal lands in line with long-term climate policy goals. The curr_chunk discusses the management of federal lands in relation to long-term climate policy goals and the collaboration among Federal Land Management Agencies (FLMAs) regarding climate change activities. It also mentions the availability of federal lands for energy and mineral exploration, with some areas specifically withdrawn from development. Energy production on federal lands contributes to total U.S. energy production. Energy production on federal lands plays a significant role in the overall U.S. energy production. In 2017, about 24% of crude oil and 13% of natural gas production in the U.S. came from federal lands. Additionally, federal lands account for approximately 40% of annual U.S. coal production. These lands also offer opportunities for renewable energy projects, with geothermal capacity representing 40% of the total U.S. capacity. There is potential for 3,300 MW of wind and 6,300 MW of solar energy on federal lands. The 116th Congress may continue to debate access to federal lands for energy and mineral development. The discussion includes balancing energy and mineral development on federal lands with environmental protection and other land uses. Some advocate for opening more lands for energy development, while others want to maintain or increase restrictions. Congress is also focusing on permitting processes, development timelines, royalty collections, and management of split estates. Onshore oil and gas production on federal lands accounted for 5% and 9% of total U.S. production in 2017. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 governs oil, gas, and coal development on federal lands, with the Secretary of the Interior leasing subsurface rights. Leases include annual rental fees and royalties based on resource value. Congress has debated raising the onshore royalty rate, currently at 12.5% since 1920. The oil and gas industry argues for access to currently unavailable areas for future domestic supply. The debate over oil and gas development on federal lands includes issues such as access to restricted areas, conservation, permitting processes, and the controversial Arctic National Wildlife Refuge program established in 2017. The debate over coal production on federal lands includes balancing production with other resource values, potential effects on climate change, assessing the value of coal resources, fair market value, government royalties, inconsistencies in evaluating federal coal leases, and violations of MLA provisions. The Obama Administration issued a new rule for coal valuation. The Trump Administration repealed a rule on coal valuation, returning to previous rules. Executive Order 13783 lifted moratoria on federal coal leasing. Both BLM and FS manage land for renewable energy projects like geothermal, wind, solar, and biomass energy production. Geothermal energy is produced from heat stored under the earth's surface, with leasing on federal lands managed by BLM under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970. Congressional interest in renewable energy resources on federal lands focuses on expanding wind and solar projects versus maintaining current authorization processes. Development of solar and wind energy sources on BLM and FS lands is primarily governed by right-of-way authorities under Title V of FLPMA. Potential wildlife impacts from wind turbines and water supply requirements from solar energy infrastructure are controversial. Managing the leasing process and balancing such projects against other land uses are key issues for Congress. Woody biomass removal from federal lands for energy production is a topic of interest due to its widespread availability. Proponents argue that removing biomass density provides landscape benefits, while opponents raise concerns about increased land disturbances on federal lands. The General Mining Law of 1872 grants free access to individuals and corporations to prospect for minerals on federal lands, allowing them to stake a claim upon discovery. This law guides the development of metallic, nonmetallic, and other minerals found in the subsurface. The General Mining Law of 1872 allows individuals and corporations to prospect for minerals on federal lands and stake a claim upon discovery. Congress has imposed a moratorium on mining claim patents since FY1995, but the right to stake claims and extract minerals remains. The mining industry supports the claim-patent system, while critics argue that it undervalues publicly owned resources due to minimal fees. Offshore energy resources in approximately 1.7 billion acres of US territory are managed by the federal government under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 governs offshore resources, balancing energy demands with environmental protection. Debate surrounds access to ocean areas for drilling, considering economic needs, energy security, oil-spill risks, and climate change. Some support drilling bans in certain regions, while others believe in safe offshore development to diversify the nation's energy portfolio. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management oversees 2,600 active oil and gas leases on nearly 14 million acres. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management administers oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf, with plans for lease sales in different regions. The final leasing program for 2017-2022 included 10 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and 1 in Alaska. A draft proposed program for 2019-2024 under the Trump Administration suggests 12 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico, 19 in Alaska, 9 in the Atlantic, and 7 in the Pacific regions. The draft proposal for the 2019-2024 leasing program under the Trump Administration includes areas prohibited from oil and gas development, with the President having the authority to withdraw unleased lands on the Outer Continental Shelf. Congress has also established leasing moratoria, such as the GOMESA moratorium in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The 116th Congress may address offshore oil and gas exploration issues, including access to ocean areas and impacts on domestic energy markets. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) manages leases for renewable ocean energy resources like offshore wind. BOEM has issued 13 offshore wind energy leases in various states. Congress may consider facilitating offshore wind and renewable energy development. To support the development of offshore wind and other renewables, Congress may consider measures such as research, project loan guarantees, and extending federal tax credits. Policy questions for Congress include the appropriate level of timber harvesting on federal forest lands and balancing timber harvesting with other statutory uses and values. The Forest Service (FS) manages 145 million acres of forests in the National Forest System (NFS), harvesting 2.8 billion board feet of timber in FY2018. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages 38 million acres of forest, primarily public domain forests under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield. The O&C Railroad Lands in western Oregon are managed under a different statutory direction. Congress may debate timber harvesting levels and techniques for resource management objectives. In FY2018, approximately 177.8 million board feet of timber and other forest products were harvested from BLM lands in western Oregon, valued at $41.3 million. The NPS and FWS have limited authorities to cut, sell, or dispose of timber from their lands, only doing so in specific cases like controlling for insect and disease outbreaks. Discussions have focused on the ecological condition of federal forests, with concerns about overgrown forests susceptible to insect and disease outbreaks due to past forest management decisions. Critics and advocates debate forest management strategies to reduce wildfire risk, with advocates pushing for activities like prescribed burning and forest thinning. The 115th Congress enacted provisions to expedite forest management projects on federal land and encourage forest restoration projects. Management of federal rangelands, particularly by BLM and FS, presents policy matters for Congress regarding livestock grazing fees. Currently, BLM and FS charge a 2019 grazing fee of $1.35 per animal unit month (AUM) based on a formula established in 1978 and continued through an executive order in 1986. Conservation groups advocate for increased grazing fees on federal lands to cover program costs or approximate market value, while livestock producers prefer lower fees to support ranching and rural economies. Permits and leases issued by BLM and FS for grazing generally last 10 years and may be renewed, with discussions in Congress about extending the length to 20 years for operational predictability. Longer permit terms face opposition due to concerns about analyzing the impact of grazing on rangelands' health and productivity. The debate over grazing on rangelands continues, with some proposing restrictions or elimination of grazing to protect the land. However, supporters argue that ranching can benefit rangelands environmentally, economically, and for lifestyle reasons. Invasive weeds are also a concern. Congressional interest remains in managing wild horses and burros on federal lands under the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971. Most of these animals are on BLM lands. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service manage wild horses and burros on federal lands, with populations exceeding appropriate management levels. BLM estimates a maximum AML of 26,690 animals on the range and cares for an additional 50,864 off-range. The Forest Service has 9,300 wild horses and burros on its lands. Both agencies are authorized to remove excess animals and use various methods for management, including adoption, fertility control, and ecosanctuaries. Congressional questions revolve around the sufficiency of these programs and authorities. The debate surrounding the management of wild horses and burros includes discussions on whether to humanely destroy excess animals or continue prohibiting slaughter, the high costs of off-range animal care, and options like expanding herd areas or changing AML determination methods. Additionally, the challenge of balancing recreational uses on federal lands and waters has raised questions about collecting fees for recreational activities. The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA) established a recreation fee program for federal lands, with authorization ending on September 30, 2020. The 116th Congress faces decisions on whether to let the program lapse, extend, make permanent, or amend it. Current oversight issues include fee changes, revenue use, and fee collection pace. Supporters argue that the program sets fair fees and funds improvements desired by visitors. Some visitors support new or increased fees for recreation on federal lands, while others oppose fees in general. There are debates over which agencies should implement fees, how the fee structure should be simplified, and how fees should be used to reduce maintenance backlogs. Another contentious issue is the use of off-highway vehicles (OHVs) on federal lands, with supporters citing increased access to natural areas and economic benefits, while critics raise concerns about disturbance to nonmotorized recreation and damage to wildlife habitats. Issues for Congress regarding OHV access and management on federal lands include concerns about potential damage to wildlife habitats and ecosystems. Access to opportunities for hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting on federal lands is also a topic of interest, with debates on whether restrictions are necessary and how to balance these activities with other land uses. Some question the opening of more FLMA lands for hunting and fishing, citing concerns about game management, public safety, and resource management. Congress also grapples with how to balance hunting and fishing with other recreational uses and the statutory purposes of the lands. The text discusses the management of hunting and fishing activities on federal lands, including regulations on firearms and ammunition. Various designations, such as national recreation areas and monuments, can be established by Congress and the President. Additionally, nonfederal lands may receive designations like national heritage areas for conservation and promotion purposes. The federal government designates various areas, including national heritage areas, marine national monuments, and federal land systems like the National Wilderness Preservation System. Controversies arise over the types, locations, and management of these designations, as well as debates on altering, expanding, or reducing them. The Antiquities Act of 1906 allows the President to establish national monuments on federal lands with historic or scientific interest. Presidents have used this authority to create, modify, or abolish monuments. Congress has also made changes to these designations. Since the Antiquities Act of 1906, Presidents have established, modified, or abolished national monuments on federal lands. The process has sometimes been contentious, with the Trump Administration reviewing and making changes to proclaimed monuments. Congress is considering bills to restrict the President's authority in proclaiming monuments, such as blocking declarations in certain states or requiring approval from Congress or state officials before establishing a new monument. Since the Antiquities Act of 1906, Presidents have established, modified, or abolished national monuments on federal lands. Some support the Act in its current form, citing court rulings upholding monument designations and public backing for the recreational, preservation, and economic benefits they bring. Others argue for restrictions on the President's authority, such as requiring approval from Congress or state officials before establishing a new monument. The Wilderness Act of 1964 created the National Wilderness Preservation System, with Congress designating wilderness areas. There are 802 wilderness areas totaling over 111 million acres in 44 states, managed by FLMAs. Wilderness designations prohibit commercial activities, motorized access, and human infrastructure to preserve undeveloped conditions. Advocates seek to protect these areas, while opponents argue it limits economic development in rural areas. Designation of new wilderness areas can be controversial, with questions over management and restrictions on activities that may reduce wilderness potential. BLM wilderness study areas (WSAs) are studied for potential wilderness designation, with restrictions on many uses to protect wilderness characteristics. Congress has designated some WSAs as wilderness and released BLM from certain legislative requirements. The Forest Service manages inventoried roadless areas, with restrictions on activities like road construction and timber harvesting. The Clinton policy to prohibit many activities on roadless areas remains intact after legal challenges. In 2018, the Forest Service began developing a new roadless rule specific to national forests in Alaska. The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System was established by Congress in 1968 to preserve designated free-flowing rivers for present and future generations. Rivers are classified as wild, scenic, or recreational based on various factors, and can be added to the system by an act of Congress or state nomination with approval from the Secretary of the Interior. The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, established in 1968, preserves free-flowing rivers classified as wild, scenic, or recreational. Over 200 river units in 40 states and Puerto Rico are administered by FLMAs or state, local, or tribal governments. Controversies arise over land designation, private property rights, and federal projects within river corridors. The National Trails System Act of 1968 authorized a national system of trails for outdoor recreation opportunities. The National Trails System Act of 1968 established a system of trails on federal and nonfederal lands to provide outdoor recreation opportunities and promote access to outdoor areas and historic resources. The system includes 11 national scenic trails, 19 national historic trails, almost 1,300 national recreation trails, and 7 connecting-and-side trails covering roughly 55,000 miles. National trails are administered by NPS, FS, and BLM in cooperation with state and local authorities, with most recreation uses permitted but motorized vehicles prohibited on many trails. Ongoing issues for Congress include designating additional trails and balancing trail designation with other considerations. Some Members are interested in new types of trails for the system, such as \"national discovery trails,\" which would connect various regions. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act authorizes NOAA to designate areas for protection based on ecological, historical, cultural, or educational qualities. The NOAA Office of National Marine Sanctuaries oversees 13 national marine sanctuaries designated for protecting cultural artifacts, species, and ecosystems. Management plans are required for each sanctuary to manage incompatible activities. Mallows Bay, Potomac River, MD, and Lake Michigan, WI are potential new sanctuary areas. Five marine national monuments have been designated by the President. The President has designated five large marine national monuments under the Antiquities Act, with the most recent being the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument in 2016. Activities within the monuments are regulated, with exceptions for recreational fishing and subsistence use. These monuments are managed cooperatively by the Department of the Interior and Department of Commerce. Marine national monuments are designated through presidential proclamation or congressional legislation, while national marine sanctuaries are designated through administrative action. The NMS designation process involves nomination, public scoping, comment, and review before approval by the Secretary of Commerce. Stakeholders from extractive industries and environmentalists have concerns about resource protection and use in national marine sanctuaries. Debate continues over the purpose of NMSA in preserving marine areas. The Trump Administration has reviewed and recommended changes to marine national monuments. Each FLMA is responsible for managing plant and animal resources based on applicable statutes and directives. Collaboration with state authorities is essential for species management. The National Wildlife Refuge System focuses on conserving plants and animals while allowing compatible uses. The federal land management agencies collaborate with state authorities for species management, sharing responsibilities for wildlife resources. Congress often directs federal agencies to work with states on wildlife censuses and hunting licenses on federal land. Federal land management agencies collaborate with states for wildlife management and hunting licenses on federal lands. BLM and FS open their lands to hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting, while FWS reports on refuges open for hunting and fishing, providing access to 86 million acres for hunting. The protection of endangered and threatened species on federal lands is managed under the 1973 Endangered Species Act (ESA). Federal land management agencies, such as the FLMAs, consider listed species in their land management plans and activities to balance natural resource use and species protection. They consult with FWS to ensure conservation efforts are in line with the ESA. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) governs the protection of endangered and threatened species on federal lands. Federal land management agencies consult with FWS to balance natural resource use and species protection. Congress has debated altering ESA implementation, including redefining the listing process and addressing conflicts over species conservation in various habitats. Examples of species generating conflict include sage grouse, grey wolves, and polar bears. The Endangered Species Act governs the protection of endangered and threatened species on federal lands. Proposals include granting states more authority over species listing, changing listing status, and creating special conditions. Invasive species are a major factor in species decline, causing harm to the environment, economy, and human health. They have the potential to affect habitats and people across the United States and U.S. territories. Invasive species pose a significant threat to habitats and people in the United States and U.S. territories. Examples include gypsy moths in eastern national forests, white-nose syndrome affecting bat populations, and Burmese pythons preying on native species in south Florida. Prevention of introduction and spread is key, while managing already introduced species can be complex and costly, requiring collaboration among stakeholders. Multiple federal agencies, including the FLMAs, share the responsibility of addressing invasive species by planning and carrying out control activities. These activities aim to manage invasive populations, prevent their spread, and restore impacted areas. Agencies must consider ecological and economic aspects, coordinate with state, local, and tribal representatives, and adhere to legislation addressing invasive species. Wildfire management includes preparedness, suppression, fuel reduction, and site rehabilitation. In 2015, 10.1 million acres burned due to wildfires, followed by 10.0 million acres in 2017 and 8.8 million acres in 2018. The federal government manages wildfires on federal land, with the Forest Service receiving the majority of funding. Funding for wildfire management has averaged $3.8 billion annually over the last 10 years. Funding for wildfire management has averaged $3.8 billion annually over the last 10 years, with costs varying annually. Congressional activity peaks during the fire season, focusing on oversight of fire management activities and consideration of programs for reducing fuel loads. The 115th Congress enacted a new adjustment for wildfire suppression funds starting in FY2020. Congressional interest in federal roles and responsibilities for wildfire protection, response, and damages, including air tanker readiness, liability issues, and new technologies like unmanned aircraft. The expanding wildland-urban interface (WUI) poses a significant risk, with approximately 10% of land in the lower 48 states classified as WUI. The text chunk discusses various reports by Katie Hoover on federal assistance, wildfire suppression spending, and wildfire management funding in the 115th Congress."
