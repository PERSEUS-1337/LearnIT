The Board determines any excess or shortfall in payments compared to an annuity value of $300,000,000 per year. The Board adjusts banks' payment obligations to ensure equivalence to the value of an annuity, extending or shortening the term as needed. If payments extend beyond maturity dates, banks must continue to pay 10 percent. Each bank must pay 10 percent of its net earnings to the Treasury until the total payments equal the value of an annuity. In the final year, if the earnings exceed the remaining obligation, the Finance Board makes adjustments. The Finance Board will adjust the percentage banks pay to the Treasury to cover remaining obligations. Amendments become effective on January 1, 2000."
