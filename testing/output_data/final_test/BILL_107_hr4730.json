    "content": "SECTION 1. PEDIATRIC LABELING OF DRUGS AND BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS: Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by adding a section on pediatric labeling of drugs and biological products. A person submitting an application for a new drug or biological product must include assessments containing data on safety and effectiveness. The application for a new drug or biological product must include data on safety and effectiveness for pediatric subpopulations to support dosing and administration. If the disease course and drug effects are similar in adults and pediatric patients, the Secretary requires similar data. The Secretary may conclude that pediatric effectiveness can be extrapolated from studies in adults, with the option to defer some assessments until after approval if the drug is ready for adult use before pediatric studies are complete. The Secretary may require pediatric studies to be delayed until additional safety or effectiveness data are collected, with the applicant submitting a certified description of the planned studies. For marketed drugs and biological products, the Secretary may issue an order after providing notice and an opportunity for written response and a meeting. The Secretary may require pediatric studies to be delayed until additional safety or effectiveness data are collected, with the applicant submitting a certified description of the planned studies. If the drug or biological product is used for a substantial number of pediatric patients or represents a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing therapies for pediatric patients, the holder of the license must submit assessments by a specified date to address potential risks to pediatric patients. If assessments for a drug or biological product are delayed beyond a specified date, it will be deemed misbranded and subject to certain actions. Delays cannot be used to withdraw approval or revoke a license. A full waiver of assessment submission requirements can be granted upon request. The submission of assessments for drugs or biological products may be waived if necessary studies are impossible, there is evidence of ineffectiveness or safety concerns in all pediatric age groups, or if the product does not offer significant therapeutic benefits over existing therapies for pediatric patients. A partial waiver can be requested by the applicant. The Secretary may grant a partial waiver for submitting assessments for a specific pediatric subpopulation if certain grounds apply or if attempts to produce a necessary pediatric formulation have failed. If a waiver is granted due to ineffectiveness or safety concerns in pediatric populations, this information must be included in the drug labeling. The Secretary will meet with the sponsor during the investigational new drug process to discuss plans for pediatric studies. Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act include requirements for pediatric assessments. Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act now include requirements for pediatric studies when submitting a license application. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act now includes requirements for manufacturers to assess the safety and effectiveness of new drugs and biological products in pediatric patients. This does not affect the existing authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to require pediatric assessments for drugs and biological products. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires manufacturers to assess the safety and effectiveness of new drugs in pediatric patients. Health and Human Services must comply with this Act for specific populations other than pediatrics."
