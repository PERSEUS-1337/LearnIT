    "content": "President Bush announced a Medicare-endorsed prescription drug discount card program on July 12, 2001, to help Medicare beneficiaries reduce out-of-pocket drug costs. The program was seen as an interim measure before broader Medicare reform, including a prescription drug benefit for seniors. Critics argued that the plan would not bring additional benefits for seniors and that retail pharmacies would bear the burden of prescription drug cost reductions. Pharmacies challenged the authority of the Administration to implement the Medicare prescription drug discount card program in 2001. Despite legal opposition, CMS proceeded with the program and solicited applications from interested parties. The Medicare discount card initiative faced legal challenges, with a federal judge ruling against it in January 2003. CMS withdrew the application solicitation, considering options like an appeal. Legislation was introduced in Congress to authorize prescription drug discount cards for Medicare beneficiaries. Many private companies already offer such cards for seniors. The Medicare discount card program for seniors would allow private companies to develop endorsed discount card plans with comparative information on formularies and prices. Beneficiaries could have only one Medicare-endorsed card plan. The report will discuss prescription drug coverage gaps, private sector discount card programs, the President's proposed program, and implementation issues. In 1998, 10 million elderly Medicare beneficiaries lacked prescription drug coverage, while 28 million had some coverage. Despite being high users of prescription drugs, seniors face challenges in affording their medications. Medicare beneficiaries still pay out of pocket for a portion of their drug expenses. In 1998, Medicare beneficiaries with coverage paid 33% of their total drug expenses out of pocket. Average out-of-pocket drug expenditures for covered beneficiaries was $325, while those without coverage paid $546. Uncovered beneficiaries in poor health had average out-of-pocket expenditures of $820. Covered beneficiaries paid a larger percentage of their total drug costs out of pocket in 1998 than in 1997, with a nearly 18% increase in out-of-pocket expenditures. Prescription drug discount cards are available through private companies and organizations like AARP, offering savings through buying clubs. Several companies, including Internet mail order services and pharmacy benefit managers, offer discount card services for prescription drugs and medical services. These plans require an annual membership fee and provide discounts at retail pharmacies. In response to President Bush's proposal, pharmaceutical companies started their own senior discount card plans in 2002. In early 2002, card sponsors set up discount card plans for prescription drugs at retail pharmacies. Pharmacies agree to lower reimbursement rates for card holders, resulting in higher business volume but potentially lower revenues. Card programs control costs by developing formularies listing drugs for higher benefits at reduced costs. Private discount card programs provide higher benefits to members at a reduced cost by offering formularies that list cost-effective drugs. These programs use restricted formularies, meaning discounts are only available for drugs on the list. Formularies are developed with the help of a pharmacy and therapeutics committee, ensuring coverage of therapeutically equivalent drugs. The Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) committee evaluates the safety, efficacy, substitutability, and cost of drugs in a therapeutic category. Members of the committee include physicians, pharmacists, medical directors, and health plan staff. Formularies help contain prescription drug costs through manufacturer rebates and pharmacy discounts. Manufacturer rebates and pharmacy discounts play a significant role in lowering prescription drug costs for health plan sponsors. These rebates vary across the industry, with no reliable data on their size. Retail pharmacies offer discounts to access card plan members, while mail order pharmacies provide cost-effective options for sponsors. Some sponsors incentivize members to use mail order services by offering lower prices compared to retail pharmacies. Some card sponsors perform drug utilization review (DUR) to evaluate proper dosage, appropriate prescriptions, drug interactions, and fraud. Pharmaceutical companies started offering discount card plans for low-income seniors in 2002. Several companies have introduced senior discount card plans for low-income seniors, including GSK and Novartis. The GSK Orange Card offers a 25% discount on outpatient prescription products for Medicare beneficiaries with incomes below 300% of the federal poverty level. The card has been in effect since January 2002 and does not require an enrollment fee. Pharmacies participating in the program allow cardholders to receive savings at the point of sale. Novartis Care Card is available for low-income Medicare beneficiaries with no prescription drug coverage, offering a 25% discount on select Novartis outpatient prescription products. The card is free for U.S. citizens with incomes below 300% of the Federal Poverty Level. Pfizer Share Card is for low-income Medicare beneficiaries with no other drug coverage, charging a $15 fee for each 30-day supply of Pfizer drugs with no prescription limits. Eli Lilly Lilly Answers program includes two co-promoted drugs and was effective as of March 1, 2002. The Eli Lilly Lilly Answers program offers a card for Medicare-eligible seniors and the disabled with low incomes, allowing them to buy a 30-day supply of any Lilly prescription drug for $12. Card holders could save up to $850 per drug per year. The Together Rx Card from various pharmaceutical companies is available for Medicare beneficiaries with incomes up to $28,000 for individuals and $38,000 for couples, offering savings on over 150 widely prescribed medicines. The Pharmacy Care Alliance Pharmacy Care One Card provides savings options for card holders. The Pharmacy Care Alliance created the One Card program to provide low-income seniors access to multiple drug manufacturer discount and subsidy programs through one card at their chosen pharmacy. Critics argue that pharmaceutical companies are using these cards to divert attention from rising prescription drug costs and promote their own products. The Pharmacy Care Alliance's One Card program aims to help low-income seniors access drug manufacturer discounts. Retail pharmacies criticize drug manufacturers' discount card programs, claiming that discounts only come from pharmacy price reductions. The final regulation for the Medicare-endorsed prescription drug initiative was announced in 2002, but its implementation is uncertain due to a court ruling on the Administration's authority. The Administration's decision to appeal a court case will determine the implementation of the Medicare-endorsed drug card initiative. Representative Mark Foley introduced a bill to authorize HHS for the program. The initiative is voluntary and modeled after existing plans, aiming to provide immediate prescription drug benefits to Medicare beneficiaries. The proposal aims to provide Medicare beneficiaries with immediate prescription drug benefits at discounted prices through a drug card initiative endorsed by Medicare. The program would offer discounts on certain prescription drugs and require card sponsors to provide comparative information on prices, formularies, pharmacy networks, enrollment fees, and other drug services. The Medicare drug card initiative would require card sponsors to follow CMS guidelines and limit beneficiaries to one endorsed card program at a time. Multiple enrollments could weaken negotiating leverage, leading to lower discounts. Beneficiaries could enroll in non-endorsed discount card plans as well. CMS plans to endorse 15 card sponsors, but it is unclear if existing cards will be used or new programs created. President Bush's drug discount card initiative under Medicare would involve limited government involvement, with CMS managing the program. The government's role includes providing information to beneficiaries and facilitating access to private companies offering endorsed discount cards. CMS oversight involves certifying card providers based on specific criteria. Funding for the program is expected to come from card providers, with minimal federal administrative costs covered by the CMS budget. Upon implementation, detailed information on each endorsed discount card will be provided. The final rule for the Medicare-Endorsed Prescription Drug Card Assistance Initiative was published in the Federal Register on September 4, 2002. It outlined the detailed information provided by CMS on endorsed discount cards to Medicare beneficiaries, including promotion to various groups. Card sponsors applying for endorsement would need to meet specific requirements. The final federal proposal for the Medicare-Endorsed Prescription Drug Card Assistance Initiative includes coordination with state programs, allowing states to partner with private drug card program sponsors. Entities seeking Medicare endorsement must meet specific requirements outlined in the regulations. Applicants can sponsor up to two card programs and must submit applications to CMS. The Medicare-Endorsed Prescription Drug Card Assistance Initiative allows sponsors to have up to two card programs with operational responsibilities in multiple programs. Endorsements last 12-24 months in year one and 12-15 months in year two. CMS can terminate endorsement at any time, and sponsors can opt out. If a program is terminated, sponsors must give 90-day notice to beneficiaries. Applicants must meet specific criteria for experience, program structure, consortium management, and customer service to be endorsed by Medicare. Applicants for the Medicare-Endorsed Prescription Drug Card Assistance Initiative must demonstrate three years of relevant experience, manage at least one million covered lives, have a nationwide or regional pharmacy network, be financially solvent, and have a record of integrity and business ethics. Applicants for the Medicare-Endorsed Prescription Drug Card Assistance Initiative must demonstrate integrity, manage a consortium with other sponsors, comply with laws, offer customer service with a $25 enrollment fee, enroll only Medicare beneficiaries, provide outreach materials, and maintain a toll-free customer call center. Applicants must offer discounts on prescription drugs, obtain rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers, maintain drug formularies for at least 60 days, and notify of any changes 30 days in advance. Medicare-endorsed card sponsors must ensure beneficiaries receive the lowest price between the discount card program and pharmacy cash prices. They need a pharmacy network accessible to at least 90% of beneficiaries within five miles in urban areas and ten miles in rural areas. Sponsors must establish a consortium for enrollment and eligibility functions to prevent duplicate card issuance. The consortium is responsible for handling enrollment and eligibility functions for Medicare-endorsed card programs to prevent duplicate card issuance. It will ensure beneficiaries have access to comparative price information on discounted drugs and comply with data security and privacy laws. CMS may assist in the start-up of the consortium and perform some functions for a transitional period. Medicare beneficiaries can enroll in a Medicare-endorsed prescription drug card program at any time. They can only be enrolled in one program at a time but can switch to a different program in January or July after requesting a change. If a program is terminated, beneficiaries can immediately enroll in a different endorsed card program. CMS received 26 comments on proposed regulations, with support from PhRMA and AARP but requested changes before the final rule was issued. The Small Business Administration and pharmacy groups criticized the proposed rule for a Medicare-endorsed prescription drug card program, stating it could reduce pharmacy profits. CMS made changes to the final regulation based on public comments, including enhanced information on drug prices and program features available through a consortium website and by telephone. The Medicare-endorsed card program features include secure manufacturer rebates, reduced experience requirements, increased opportunities for organizations, two program designs for beneficiaries, stable drug formularies and prices, and new privacy requirements for sponsors. New privacy requirements for Medicare card sponsors would align with HIPAA standards, including changes in the recent update. Retail pharmacies in the program would join a network organized by the sponsor voluntarily, accepting negotiated reimbursement rates that may lower profit margins. Pharmacies join networks for access to a large member base. Pharmacies join card networks to gain access to a large member base, increasing customer base and sales volume. The potential savings come from market leverage and educational aspects of the program, allowing consumers to comparison shop for the lowest cost. Seniors could receive a 10% to 15% discount on prescription drug purchases through the Medicare-endorsed card program. The Medicare-endorsed card program is projected to save beneficiaries $1.2 to $1.6 billion on drug purchases in the first year. Questions remain about the actual discounts available and specific information on discount amounts and formularies is not yet known. Retail discounts may only be determined after the program's first year of operation. The lack of widely available data on retail drug prices is a constraining factor in conducting analysis. A 2002 study by the U.S. General Accounting Office found that discounts on brand name drugs offered by drug discount card programs ranged from 6% to 32% off average retail prices. Internet pharmacy prices varied, sometimes being up to 19% higher than discount card prices. The General Accounting Office found that Internet pharmacy prices were consistently lower than retail pharmacy prices, with some drugs being up to 19% higher than discount card prices. Prices varied considerably in different geographic regions, with critics disputing potential discounts of up to 25%. Recent announcements suggest discounts may range from 10% to 15%, leading some to believe the program may not produce significant savings for seniors. Based on GAO data, Congress argues that existing Medicare discount card programs offer minimal savings, with no more than 10% off retail prices. They believe the proposed Bush program would not provide greater discounts for seniors. Six Members of Congress wrote to HHS stating that a Medicare discount card program is unlikely to offer significant savings on brand name drugs for seniors, as current programs already offer little savings. They suggest that unless the proposed program mandates significant discounts from drug manufacturers passed on to seniors, it would not provide additional benefits. President Bush emphasized that the Medicare discount card program would not replace a new prescription drug benefit under Medicare. The program was meant to provide immediate cost relief for seniors while other options were considered. CMS believed that Medicare-endorsed cards would be better than current discount cards by offering exclusive enrollment, formulary, pharmacy network, and informational features to obtain larger rebates from manufacturers for consumers. The Medicare-endorsed card initiative aims to pass manufacturer rebates to consumers, potentially providing larger discounts than current card programs. The program could leverage market power to negotiate discounts on commonly prescribed senior drugs. However, details on discounts and rebates for Medicare beneficiaries are not publicly available. The Administration believes that the comparative price information feature of the Medicare-endorsed card proposal would benefit seniors by providing access to comparative price, formulary, and pharmacy network information on various card programs. Discount program participants could switch between programs every 6 months, potentially incurring one-time enrollment fees of up to $25. The informational feature would offer a single source of information on drug prices, formularies, and pharmacy networks of all Medicare-endorsed discount card programs. The Medicare-endorsed card proposal aims to provide seniors with access to comparative price, formulary, and pharmacy network information on various card programs. Published information would be crucial for seniors without internet access. The success of the program depends on the details of individual card programs and how well companies manage the consortium. Drug price publication could pressure pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmacies to match lower prices, potentially leading to additional savings for seniors. Retail pharmacies are concerned about reduced profit margins if pressured to lower prices without changes in what they pay. The final rule on pharmaceutical rebates may lead to reduced profit margins for pharmacies, as they argue the rule does not specify the amount of discount they should receive. Drug utilization review (DUR) under proposed Medicare plans aims to enhance patient safety and lower prescription drug costs by preventing duplicative drug use within the same therapeutic category. The Medicare drug card initiative aims to enhance patient safety and lower prescription drug costs by preventing harmful drug interactions. It requires card sponsors to offer broad access to retail pharmacies, not just mail-order services. Pharmacy associations argue that mail-order programs may offer lower prices but lack the personal help seniors need from community pharmacists. The Medicare drug card initiative aims to shift prescription drug purchases to mail-order services, potentially impacting retail pharmacies. CMS requires network pharmacies to ensure beneficiaries still buy from retail pharmacies. Card sponsors must provide educational services like pharmacy counseling and drug interaction monitoring. This feature aims to help seniors choose a quality discount card program and lower drug costs. The Medicare drug card initiative aims to help seniors lower drug costs by choosing the most appropriate card program. The quality of service provided by card sponsors is crucial. Features of the program are geared towards Medicare beneficiaries, with a focus on customer service, marketing materials, and included drugs. Coordination among companies and CMS could improve service and information for seniors. A consortium of card sponsors may lead to better marketing materials and drug price information. However, the details of proposed card programs are unknown, making it difficult to assess potential improvements. The National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS) and the NCPA filed a lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to block the Administration's prescription discount card initiative. The court issued an injunction on September 6, 2001, stating that the pharmacy groups had a substantial likelihood of success. Judge Friedman issued an injunction in favor of the pharmacy groups, stating they had a substantial likelihood of success due to the Administration lacking legal authority and not following proper rulemaking process. The Administration requested a stay to use formal rulemaking for a new Medicare discount card proposal. Judge Friedman granted a stay for HHS to submit their proposed policy for notice and comment, allowing the plaintiffs to return to court after publication. CMS proceeded with the rulemaking process in late 2001 for a Medicare-Endorsed Prescription Drug Card and Drug Discount Card Assistance Initiative. The Department of Justice filed a motion in September 2002 to require pharmacy groups to decide whether to proceed with a case against CMS and HHS to halt the program. Pharmacies rejected the federal government's schedule in response. Pharmacies rejected the federal government's schedule for filing motions in response to the Medicare discount card initiative. Judge Friedman ruled that the NACD had standing to show economic harm. HHS Secretary Thompson's argument was rejected, and CMS Administrator Tom Scully announced plans to evaluate options and work with Congress for a prescription drug benefit. The court's decision hastened the likelihood of an appeal. The pharmacy associations criticized President Bush's Medicare discount card program on economic grounds, arguing that it puts cost reductions for seniors on retail pharmacies. They claim that the program does not reduce medication prices for pharmacies and will disproportionately reduce pharmacy profits compared to card sponsors and drug manufacturers. The final regulation of the Medicare drug card initiative requires card sponsors to have contractual arrangements with drug manufacturers for rebates or discounts. Pharmacies are concerned that the revised Medicare discount card initiative may harm their profits as it does not specify how much of the savings should be passed on to seniors. Pharmacies argue that their net profit is only 2% after accounting for operating expenses, and the proposal could limit seniors' choice of pharmacy. Pharmacies are concerned that the Medicare discount card initiative may lead to underutilization of generic drugs and promote the use of brand name drugs. The National Community Pharmacists Association and the National Association of Chain Drug Stores filed a declaration in support of a lawsuit against the federal government, stating that pharmacies could lose almost $2 billion. The University of Minnesota's PRIME Institute predicts that pharmacies could lose $2 billion in revenue and 2,500 to 10,000 community pharmacies may close within three years due to the discount card program. The program may lead to increased use of mail order pharmacies, reducing profit margins for retail pharmacies. Despite potential profit margin decreases, some analysts believe overall net profits may increase with higher prescription drug sales. The drugstore industry saw an increase in total sales in 2000, with prescription drug sales to third-party plans driving the growth. Despite falling gross profit margins, rising prescription volumes led to a 6% net profit increase in 2000. Larger chains like CVS and Walgreens experienced an average net income increase of 19.5%. Gross margins are expected to improve in the coming years. The S&P report indicates that drugstore chains are expected to improve their agreements with third-party payers and decline marginally profitable plans. The potential economic impact of the Administration's discount card proposal for seniors on retail pharmacies is uncertain due to lack of details. The Administration has mentioned that card sponsors will bear the administrative costs, but specifics on sponsors and programs are scarce. The Administration's Medicare discount card program proposal for seniors could impact pharmacies, but details are uncertain. Congress has previously considered coverage for drug costs, with no consensus on structure. Representative Mark Foley introduced a bill to authorize the Secretary of HHS to endorse prescription drug discount cards for Medicare beneficiaries. The bill would give legal authority for the Administration to implement the initiative. The role of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) in U.S. healthcare delivery is significant, managing drug benefits for 70% of Americans, including 65% of seniors. PBMs are central in the debate over the Administration's drug discount card plan, raising concerns for retail pharmacies beyond just the Medicare discount card proposal. Congressional critics argue that discount cards are not a solution to high prescription drug costs for uninsured or partially insured seniors. Some Members of Congress identify high drug prices as a serious issue, especially for uninsured or partially insured seniors. The complexity of drug pricing procedures makes it challenging to devise policies that ensure affordable prescription drugs for seniors compared to third-party purchasers. Concerns remain about whether seniors will benefit from the President's discount program proposal. Discount drug programs may offer additional savings for seniors on prescription medications, but many covered drugs may still be costly for low- and middle-income seniors without adequate insurance. Anecdotal evidence suggests that comparing prices online can sometimes result in matching or beating discount card prices. The challenge for policymakers is to ensure necessary medications for seniors while maintaining incentives for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, PBMs, and pharmacists. While a Medicare-endorsed discount card program could provide some savings, the overall impact is unclear. President Bush's revised proposal could offer seniors some savings on medications through discount card programs, depending on the final details. The size of discounts and formularies offered would impact the overall effect on the senior population. Seniors could benefit from more information on drug prices and plans to comparison shop and save money. Critics of the Bush plan believe that the net overall effects are unclear due to the lack of details on individual card programs. Critics of the Bush Medicare-endorsed discount card plan argue that it may not provide significant benefits for seniors and could lead to seniors switching from local pharmacies to mail order pharmacies. Pharmacists are concerned about the cost burden and potential impact on their businesses depending on agreements with card sponsors. Seniors are worried about ensuring that discounts are passed on to them effectively. The impact on pharmacies from the Medicare-endorsed discount card plan depends on seniors' response to the program. While some seniors will continue to use local pharmacies for quick prescription fills, others may switch to mail-order options for deeper discounts, especially for chronic conditions."
