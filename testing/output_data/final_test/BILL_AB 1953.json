    "title": "AB 1953",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature amends Section 8332 of the Government Code to exclude the Reporting of Improper Governmental Activities Act and civilian complaints against peace officers from certain provisions. Additionally, Section 148.6 of the Penal Code is amended to make filing false misconduct allegations against peace officers a misdemeanor offense. Complainants must sign an advisory before making such allegations. You have the right to file a complaint against a police officer for improper conduct. California law mandates agencies to investigate civilian complaints and provide a written description of the procedure. Complaints must be retained for at least five years. Filing a false complaint is illegal and can result in misdemeanor charges. The advisory for filing civil claims against a peace officer is available in multiple languages. Filing a false claim or lien with the intent to harass the officer is a misdemeanor. Legislative intent is to establish policies for body-worn camera data storage based on best practices. When establishing policies for body-worn camera data storage, designate a person responsible for downloading data and establish a timeline for downloading to ensure timely entry, maintenance, and categorization of the data. Establish specific measures to prevent data tampering, categorize and tag body-worn camera video, and state the length of time data should be stored. Non-evidentiary data should be retained for a minimum of 60 days, while evidentiary data should be kept for a minimum of two years. The recording from a body-worn camera should be retained if it involves the use of force, detention or arrest, or is relevant to a complaint against law enforcement. If the recording contains evidence for a criminal prosecution, it should be kept for an extended period as required by law. Agencies should work with legal counsel to establish retention schedules that comply with relevant laws and preserve evidentiary chains of custody. Records of access and deletion of data from body-worn cameras should be retained permanently. Body-worn camera data can be stored on an in-house server or online cloud database managed by a third-party vendor. Factors to consider when using a third-party vendor for data storage include selecting an experienced vendor, establishing contracts to protect data, using a system with an audit trail and data backup, and consulting with legal counsel to ensure compliance with chain-of-custody requirements. The use of body-worn cameras by law enforcement agencies requires that all recorded data is owned by the agency, not for personal use or public sharing. Evidentiary data must be retained according to state laws for investigative purposes. The section defines \"nonevidentiary data\" as data not useful for investigations, and clarifies that public access to recorded data is not limited by this section. The Penal Code is amended to collect data on the juvenile justice system for statistical purposes, compliance with reporting requirements, measuring juvenile delinquency, and identifying trends. The annual report must include statistics on various aspects of the system. The Penal Code is amended to collect data on offenses, characteristics of criminals, administrative actions by law enforcement, and civilian complaints received. The Penal Code is amended to collect data on civilian complaints alleging criminal conduct, racial or identity profiling, and their dispositions such as \"Sustained.\" The Penal Code is amended to collect data on civilian complaints and their dispositions, including \"Exonerated,\" \"Not sustained,\" and \"Unfounded.\" Reports will be made public and disaggregated for each law enforcement agency. The department is responsible for interpreting and presenting statistics to guide legislative policies and law enforcement actions. The report must include comparable statistics to national criminal data. The Racial and Identity Profiling Board (RIPA) analyzes annual statistics on complaints reported by peace officers, which are included in its annual report. The Department of Justice's annual report must include statewide information required by Section 13012.5 of the Penal Code. The annual number of fitness hearings in juvenile courts under Section 707 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, outcomes including orders to remand to adult criminal court, and information on age, gender, ethnicity, and offense of minors. Also, the annual number of minors whose cases are filed directly in adult criminal court under Sections 602.5 and 707, with corresponding demographic and offense details. The outcomes of cases involving minors prosecuted in adult criminal courts, including acquittals, convictions, dismissals, and sentencing details, cross-referenced with age, gender, ethnicity, and offense. The department's annual report under Section 13010 will include this information starting from July 1, 2003. Section 41603 of the Vehicle Code is amended. Section 41603 of the Vehicle Code is amended to prohibit the use of the number of arrests or citations as the sole criterion for promotion, demotion, or dismissal of peace officers or parking enforcement employees. Performance evaluations must consider various criteria such as attendance, punctuality, complaints, commendations, demeanor, training, and judgment."
