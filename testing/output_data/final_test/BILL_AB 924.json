    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Article 1 adds Section 18701 to Chapter 3 of Part 10.2 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. It allows individuals to designate contributions to the State Children\u2019s Trust Fund on their tax returns. Contributions must be in full dollar amounts and once designated, they are irrevocable. If the contributions exceed the tax liability, the excess amount goes to the Trust Fund. The Franchise Tax Board will allocate contributions among designated accounts on a pro rata basis if the total amount designated exceeds the available funds. The tax return form will include a space for the \"State Children\u2019s Trust Fund for the Prevention of Child Abuse\" designation, with instructions stating contributions can be one dollar or more to support child abuse prevention programs and education efforts. The Franchise Tax Board will notify the Controller of excess taxpayer payments and refund designations for the State Children\u2019s Trust Fund. The Controller will transfer designated amounts from the Personal Income Tax Fund to the Trust Fund. All money transferred to the State Children\u2019s Trust Fund under this article will be allocated for reimbursement of costs incurred by the Franchise Tax Board and the Controller, and up to 10% will go to the State Department of Social Services for child abuse prevention education and promotion. The State Department of Social Services receives funds for child abuse prevention and intervention programs operated by private nonprofit organizations or public institutions of higher education with expertise in child welfare. The Legislature intends for this funding to be additional and not a replacement for other sources available to the State Children\u2019s Trust Fund. The State Children\u2019s Trust Fund will be in effect until January 1 of the fifth taxable year after its first appearance on tax returns, and will be repealed on December 1 of that year. The Franchise Tax Board will determine the minimum contribution amount needed for the fund to appear on tax returns each year. The Franchise Tax Board will estimate contributions to determine if they meet the minimum amount required for the State Children\u2019s Trust Fund to appear on tax returns. If the estimated contributions fall short, the article will be inoperative for taxable years starting on or after January 1 of that year and will be repealed on December 1 of the same year. The minimum contribution amount for the State Children\u2019s Trust Fund on tax returns is $250,000 for the second calendar year and will be adjusted annually based on inflation factors. The inflation factor adjustment for the calendar year is based on the California Consumer Price Index. Contributions designated prior to the repeal of this article will continue to be transferred accordingly. Section 18969 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended. Section 18969 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to create the State Children\u2019s Trust Fund, funded by county contributions, state collections, grants, gifts, and legislative appropriations for child abuse prevention projects. The State Registrar can retain up to 10% of fees collected for collection costs. The State Children\u2019s Trust Fund, funded by various sources, is allocated to the State Department of Social Services for child abuse prevention programs. Supplanting of other funds is prohibited. The State Department of Social Services may establish positions for child abuse prevention programs funded by the State Children\u2019s Trust Fund, using no more than 5% of the funds for administrative costs. Trust Fund money cannot replace state General Fund money for any purpose. The State Children\u2019s Trust Fund aims to develop public-private partnerships, fund public awareness campaigns on child abuse, and support research projects for long-term solutions. The State Children\u2019s Trust Fund plans to promote charitable tax deductions through activities like convening a philanthropic roundtable and developing literature for dissemination by the State Bar of California."
