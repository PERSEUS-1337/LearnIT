    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature appropriates annual proceeds of the fund to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in California. 35 percent of the proceeds are allocated for transit, affordable housing, and sustainable communities programs. Five percent of the fund proceeds are allocated to the Low Carbon Transit Operations Program, while twenty percent goes to the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program. The Controller distributes funds according to program requirements and specific distribution formulas. At least 10 percent of the proceeds for affordable housing must be spent as per program provisions. Beginning in the 2015\u201316 fiscal year, 25 percent of the fund proceeds are continuously appropriated to the High-Speed Rail Authority for project costs and repayment of loans. In the 2016\u201317 fiscal year, another 25 percent goes to the Department of Water Resources for compliance with water code requirements. The Department of Water Resources is tasked with identifying and expanding statewide water storage capacity by 25% by 2025 and 50% by 2050. They must present a strategy and implementation plan to the Legislature and make it publicly available. The Department of Water Resources must update the water storage capacity strategy every two years until 2050. They are required to increase the state's water storage capacity by 25% by 2025 and 50% by 2050 through various projects. The Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office will report to the Legislature every five years on the Department of Water Resources\u2019 progress in fulfilling water storage requirements, including achieving a 25% increase by 2025 and 50% by 2050. The report will assess projects such as surface water storage, groundwater storage, conjunctive use, and reservoir reoperation. In formulating state policy for water quality control in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, the state board must consider groundwater sustainability plans and their impact on surface water beneficial uses."
