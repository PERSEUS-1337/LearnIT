    "content": "The Supreme Court's 2015 docket includes white collar crimes involving three Hobbs Act cases and one on computer fraud. The Hobbs Act prohibits robbery and extortion that obstructs interstate commerce. Cases include robbery of drug dealers, a kickback conspiracy between traffic cops and body shop owners, and a drug manufacturer showering gifts on a state governor. The Court clarified that the Government does not need to prove drugs crossed state lines for a conviction under the Hobbs Act. The Supreme Court clarified that under the Hobbs Act, it is enough for a defendant to knowingly steal drugs or drug proceeds to satisfy the commerce element, as the market for illegal drugs falls under U.S. jurisdiction. The Court's decision in a 7-1 ruling focused on cases where defendants target drug dealers for theft, rather than other types of businesses or victims. The case involved Taylor, a member of a gang attempting to rob drug dealers of cash and drugs. Taylor was convicted under the Hobbs Act for robbing drug dealers, netting $40, cell phones, a marijuana cigarette, and jewelry. He tried to argue that the robbery only involved in-state marijuana, but the court ruled that drug dealing affects interstate commerce. Taylor appealed, questioning the government's fulfillment of the commerce element. Lower federal appellate courts interpreted the \"in any way or degree\" language of the Commerce Clause to give Congress full power, requiring only a minimal impact on interstate commerce for prosecution. The Supreme Court's Raich decision supported this view, stating that Congress can regulate intrastate activities if they affect the interstate market. The Fourth Circuit upheld Taylor's conviction for robbing drug dealers, ruling that the robberies would impact interstate commerce. The Supreme Court rejected the Second and Seventh Circuits' interpretations regarding the impact of drug trafficking on interstate commerce. The Court stated that proof of individualized impact is not necessary for federal drug law prosecutions, but is required for Hobbs Act prosecutions. The Court's decision in the Taylor case was based on grafting its holding in Raich onto the commerce element of the Hobbs Act, recognizing Congress' power to regulate purely local activities that are part of an economic class. The Supreme Court in Taylor case recognized Congress' power to regulate local activities that impact interstate commerce, including drug trafficking. Justice Thomas dissented, arguing for limits on congressional authority under the Commerce Clause. The Hobbs Act requires proof that a robbery affected interstate commerce. Ocasio, a Baltimore police officer, was convicted of extortion and conspiracy under the Act for receiving kickbacks. The Act punishes anyone obstructing commerce through extortion. Ocasio argued against his conviction. Ocasio argued that the Hobbs Act does not outlaw obtaining property from a co-conspirator, citing alternative theories and a Sixth Circuit case for support. The Fourth Circuit, however, was not convinced. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected Ocasio's arguments regarding the \"property of another\" and \"consent\" in relation to the Hobbs Act. The Supreme Court affirmed the Fourth Circuit's decision, stating that not every extortion scheme involves a conspiracy to commit extortion. Justice Alito wrote the opinion for the Court. Justice Alito's opinion for the Court affirmed that a person can be convicted of conspiring to commit a crime they cannot personally commit. In the case of Ocasio, the body shop owners conspired to commit extortion by agreeing to help Ocasio and other officers commit the crime. This ruling does not eliminate the distinction between extortion and bribery. The Court affirmed that arranging a meeting or hosting an event does not qualify as an \"official act\" for federal bribery unless it involves \"the formal.\" Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and his wife were convicted on corruption charges related to his activities as governor, including wire fraud, conspiracy, and Hobbs Act offenses. The Supreme Court reviewed the definition of \"official act\" in relation to the convictions, which stemmed from gifts received from a constituent who sought approval for an antismoking substance. Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell sought state university medical research to test and report favorably on an antismoking substance he hoped to have approved by the FDA. He used his position to promote the product, including pitching it to officials responsible for employee health plans. The wire fraud statute he was convicted under prohibits using wire communications to defraud others. The Supreme Court has defined the scheme to defraud element to include honest services bribery, which involves exchanging something of value for a public official's commission or omission of an official act. This is similar to the extortion prong of a Hobbs Act violation, which outlaws obstructing interstate commerce by extortion under color of law. An official act for bribery purposes is defined as any act that involves accepting something of value for the commission or omission of an official act. The prosecution argued that the governor had committed at least five qualifying official acts for bribery purposes, including arranging meetings, hosting events, and contacting government officials to promote certain products. The Governor's Office encouraged Virginia state research universities to study anatabine, promoted Star Scientific's products, and recommended meetings with company executives to discuss lowering healthcare costs. The Supreme Court found the jury instructions deficient in convicting the governor for bribery without requiring proof of influencing governmental power. The jury in Governor McDonnell's case was not properly instructed on what constitutes an \"official act,\" leading to potential misunderstandings and errors in their decision-making process. The lack of specific guidance may have resulted in the jury mistakenly believing that routine meetings or events could be considered official acts without further clarification. This lack of clarity could have influenced the jury's perception of Governor McDonnell's actions as official acts, even when they were merely arranging meetings or hosting events. The Court's decision on what constitutes an \"official act\" in Governor McDonnell's case aligns with its reluctance to involve federal authorities in state and local political affairs without clear congressional directive. The decision focuses on whether setting up a meeting or hosting an event qualifies as an official act, rejecting a broad interpretation of the term. The U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Sun-Diamond Growers of Cal. addressed challenges to sufficiency of evidence in criminal cases and the statute-of-limitations defense. In Musacchio v. United States, the Court upheld a computer fraud conviction, ruling that a statute of limitation challenge cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. The Court in Musacchio v. United States rejected a statute of limitation challenge raised for the first time on appeal and upheld a computer fraud conviction. The defendant hacked into his former employer's computer network and was indicted for unauthorized access. Despite jury instructions suggesting additional elements, the defendant was convicted. He argued insufficient evidence for one element, but the Court disagreed. The Supreme Court in Musacchio v. United States addressed a statute of limitations challenge raised for the first time on appeal in a computer fraud case. The defendant's argument that the five-year statute of limitations should have barred his prosecution was rejected. The Court emphasized that a statute of limitations defense must be claimed before conviction and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. The Supreme Court in Musacchio v. United States rejected the defendant's statute of limitations challenge in a computer fraud case. The Court emphasized that such a defense must be raised before conviction and cannot be brought up for the first time on appeal. The Fifth Circuit's decision was based on the rule-of-the-case doctrine, which prevents revisiting legal issues already addressed in a case. The Fifth Circuit erroneously applied the rule-of-the-case doctrine in a lower court ruling within the same case. The Court did not address whether the outcome would have been different with extraneous elements in the indictment or if the trial court's instructions were in error. The case involved sex offender registration obligations for an overseas resident and the construction of recidivist mandatory minimum sentencing provisions. The Court confirmed that the provision applies to prior state convictions for sexual abuse and aggravated sexual abuse. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld a mandatory minimum sentencing enhancement in a child pornography case based on statutory construction. The provision applies to prior state convictions for sexual abuse and aggravated sexual abuse. Lockhart pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges after a prior conviction for sexual abuse. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld a mandatory minimum sentencing enhancement in a child pornography case based on statutory construction. Lockhart pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges after a prior conviction for sexual abuse. The Court concluded that the mandatory minimum applied to Lockhart, whose crime involved sexual abuse of an adult. Justice Sotomayor, writing for the Court, examined the text of the statute under the \"last antecedent\" rule of statutory construction. The Justice analyzed the statutory construction regarding mandatory minimum sentencing in a child pornography case. She highlighted the symmetry between state and federal triggering offenses, questioning why the mandatory minimum would apply to individuals convicted of sexual abuse involving an adult in federal court but not in state court. The federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) requires offenders to notify in cases of sexual abuse or aggravated sexual abuse involving an adult, but not in state court convictions. Justice Kagan's dissent questions the mandatory minimum sentencing in child pornography cases, suggesting Congress may reconsider. The Supreme Court ruled that the federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) does not require offenders residing overseas to notify their jurisdiction of address changes. This decision resolved a conflict among lower federal appellate courts regarding registration requirements for sex offenders relocating abroad. The Supreme Court ruled that federal sex offenders residing overseas are not required to notify their jurisdiction of address changes under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA). Failure to comply with registration requirements is a federal crime for both federal and state sex offenders. In the case before the Court, Nichols, convicted of a federal sex offense, relocated to the Philippines without informing Kansas authorities, leading to his deportation back to the United States. The Supreme Court ruled that federal sex offenders residing overseas are not required to notify their jurisdiction of address changes under SORNA. Nichols, convicted of a federal sex offense, was deported back to the United States for failing to update his Kansas registration information. He pleaded guilty and appealed, arguing that SORNA's residency requirement does not apply when moving to a non-SORNA jurisdiction. The Tenth Circuit rejected his argument, but the Supreme Court reversed, stating that SORNA requires offenders to register in jurisdictions where they reside, work, or study. The Supreme Court ruled that federal sex offenders residing overseas are not required to notify their jurisdiction of address changes under SORNA. Justice Alito explained that SORNA only applies to jurisdictions where the offender resides, works, or studies, using the present tense. Once Nichols moved to Manila, he no longer resided in Kansas, so he was not required to update his registration there. Congress later passed the International Megan's Law to address this issue. The Supreme Court ruled that federal sex offenders residing overseas are not required to notify their jurisdiction of address changes under SORNA. The Court also addressed stun gun bans and Second Amendment rights, highlighting issues under the Armed Career Criminal Act and firearm possession disqualification triggered by domestic violence misdemeanors. In Caetano v. Massachusetts, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a Massachusetts law banning stun guns, stating that stun guns are protected by the Second Amendment right to bear arms. The Massachusetts court had previously ruled that stun guns were not covered by the Second Amendment because they were considered dangerous, unusual, and not in common use at the time of the Bill of Rights. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned a Massachusetts law banning stun guns, stating that they are protected by the Second Amendment. The court found that stun guns, although unusual and not in common use during the time of the Bill of Rights, are covered by the Second Amendment right to bear arms. The court also noted that stun guns can be used for self-defense, contradicting the Massachusetts court's ruling. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned a Massachusetts law banning stun guns, stating that they are protected by the Second Amendment. A misdemeanor conviction for recklessly assaulting a domestic relation disqualifies an individual from possessing a gun under federal law. Individuals convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence may not possess a firearm. The Supreme Court ruled that individuals convicted of recklessly assaulting a domestic relation are disqualified from possessing a firearm under federal law, even if the offense was committed without intent. In the case of Voisine, his previous state domestic abuse conviction for beating his girlfriend led to charges of unlawful possession of a firearm. The Court upheld this disqualification, stating that the use of physical force in such cases does not require intent. The Supreme Court ruled that individuals convicted of recklessly assaulting a domestic relation are disqualified from possessing a firearm under federal law, even if the offense was committed without intent. Justice Kagan emphasized that the word \"use\" in the law encompasses both reckless and knowing conduct, and ignoring reckless abuse convictions would undermine Congress's aim of preventing domestic abusers from owning guns. The federal ban on firearms possession applies to those with prior misdemeanor convictions for the reckless use of physical force against a domestic relation. The Supreme Court's ruling disqualifies individuals convicted of recklessly assaulting a domestic relation from possessing a firearm under federal law, regardless of intent. Justice Thomas dissented, citing Second Amendment rights and a narrow interpretation of \"use of physical force.\" The decision in Johnson v. United States, declaring the Armed Career Criminal Act's residual clause vague, applies retroactively to federal prisoners seeking habeas corpus review. The ACCA mandates a 15-year sentence for certain firearms offenses with three prior violent felony convictions. The Supreme Court declared the Armed Career Criminal Act's residual clause unconstitutionally vague in Johnson v. United States, making it retroactively applicable. Welch, convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm, challenged his sentencing under the ACCA based on three state robbery convictions, arguing that one of the prior convictions did not qualify as an ACCA predicate conviction. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed Welch's sentence under the residual clause of the ACCA. Welch later sought collateral review after the Supreme Court deemed the residual clause unconstitutionally vague in Johnson. The Court determined Johnson should be applied retroactively and remanded the case to the Eleventh Circuit to assess if Welch's state robbery conviction qualified under the elements clause. Justice Kennedy, speaking for the majority of the Court, discussed the retroactivity of decisions like Johnson, which introduce new constitutional interpretations. The Teague doctrine aims to promote finality by encouraging prisoners to raise constitutional challenges on direct appeal rather than on collateral review. This doctrine generally prohibits federal collateral review for new rules, with exceptions for substantive and procedural rules. The procedural exception applies to \"watershed\" rules in criminal procedure that impact the fundamental fairness of proceedings, such as Gideon v. Wainwright. The substantive exception applies to rules that change the range of conduct. The substantive exception to the Teague doctrine applies when a new rule alters the range of conduct or the class of persons punished by the law. Johnson is an example of this exception, as it changed the reach of the Armed Career Criminal Act by striking down the residual clause as void for vagueness. Justice Kennedy explained that before Johnson, the Act applied to individuals with three violent felony convictions, but after Johnson, the same conduct no longer subjected them to the Act. Justice Thomas dissented, arguing that the case was not yet ripe for Supreme Court review. The Supreme Court reviewed the application of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) and determined that a past conviction must have elements that are the same as or narrower than those of the generic offense to qualify as an ACCA predicate conviction. The ACCA does not make an exception when a defendant is convicted under a statute with multiple alternative means of satisfying its elements. The Supreme Court clarified that for defendants to be guilty of certain firearms offenses under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), their prior convictions must match the elements of the generic offense. Mathis, convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm, questioned if his Iowa burglary convictions qualified as ACCA predicates, as the Iowa burglary statute aligned with the generic crime of burglary. The Supreme Court ruled that for a state burglary conviction to qualify as an ACCA burglary conviction, the elements of the crime must match or be narrower than those of the generic offense. Mathis argued that his Iowa burglary convictions did not meet this criteria due to the broad definition of \"building or structure\" in Iowa's criminal code. The Court agreed with Mathis, stating that if a crime covers more conduct than the generic offense, it cannot be considered an ACCA burglary conviction. The Iowa Supreme Court ruled that Iowa's burglary law is broader than the generic offense, as it includes unlawful entry into a vehicle to commit a crime. This means Mathis's convictions under that law cannot lead to an ACCA sentence. Justice Kennedy disagreed with the opinion but acknowledged it was based on precedents that Congress could change through amendment. Justice Thomas and Justice Kennedy disagreed on the interpretation of Iowa's burglary law in relation to the ACCA. Justice Thomas suggested that congressional inaction may require the Court to revisit its precedents, while Justice Kennedy acknowledged the possibility of Congress amending the ACCA. Justices Breyer and Ginsburg dissented, arguing for a closer examination of the charging documents in Mathis's case. Justice Alito went further, advocating for a review of the entire record of prior proceedings. The trio of Fourth Amendment cases raised questions on statutory construction and the application of precedents. The trio of Fourth Amendment cases raised questions on the exclusionary rule, warrant requirements for sobriety tests, and official immunity in excessive force allegations. The Supreme Court ruled on the attenuation exception to the exclusionary rule in Utah v. Strieff, addressing evidence suppression in criminal proceedings related to policing practices. The exclusionary rule requires suppressing evidence seized after an illegal stop led to the discovery of a warrant. The rule aims to deter police misconduct by excluding evidence obtained through illegal searches or seizures. The potential deterrence must outweigh the costs, such as releasing a criminal into the public. The attenuation doctrine allows courts to admit evidence obtained after an illegal search or seizure if the connection between police misconduct and the discovery of evidence is sufficiently attenuated. Factors considered include the temporal proximity, intervening event, and purpose of police misconduct. In the case of Strieff, the Court reviewed evidence obtained from a search incident to a lawful arrest on an outstanding warrant, discovered from a warrant check. The police department in Salt Lake City, Utah received an anonymous tip about ongoing drug activity at a house. Officer Doug Fackrell surveilled the house and observed short-term traffic consistent with drug activity. When Edward Strieff left the house, he was questioned, and a warrant check revealed an outstanding arrest warrant. A search incident to arrest uncovered methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia. Strieff was prosecuted for a drug crime after being stopped by Officer Fackrell without reasonable suspicion. The dispute centered on whether the discovery of an outstanding warrant attenuated the illegal stop from the discovery of drugs and paraphernalia. The Utah Supreme Court reversed the trial court's decision, stating that only the defendant's voluntary conduct can attenuate evidence from illegal searches. Utah and Strieff focused on the flagrancy portion of the three-part doctrine on appeal to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court case involving Utah and Strieff focused on the flagrancy portion of the attenuation analysis. Utah argued that an arrest warrant issued by a neutral judge should erase the taint of an illegal stop if not \"flagrant,\" while Strieff contended that police activity is flagrant when done without reasonable suspicion. The Court considered adding a subjective component to the flagrancy analysis during oral arguments. The Supreme Court held in a 5-3 decision that the discovery of the warrant was sufficiently attenuated from the illegal stop, making the evidence admissible. Justice Thomas concluded that the officer's actions were at most negligent, not flagrant. Justice Kagan suggested that knowing someone stopped might have an arrest warrant could deter illegal stops, while Justice Alito highlighted the costs of suppressing evidence from a lawful search. The Court found that the illegal stop by Fackrell was negligent, not flagrant, and not part of systemic police misconduct. Dissenting opinions expressed concerns about widespread warrant checks and the majority's ruling potentially incentivizing officers to violate the Constitution. The Supreme Court ruled that in the absence of a warrant, a breath test (but not a blood test) may be administered as a search incident to a lawful arrest for drunk driving. This decision came from the consolidation of three cases in Birchfield v. North Dakota, Bernard v. Minnesota, and Beylund v. Levi, addressing the Fourth Amendment question of warrantless sobriety tests after a drunk driving arrest. In Birchfield v. North Dakota, Bernard v. Minnesota, and Beylund v. Levi, individuals were arrested for drunk driving. Birchfield refused a blood test, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, and appealed on Fourth Amendment grounds. Bernard was arrested for public drunkenness after his truck got stuck, refused a sobriety test, and was arrested. The Minnesota Supreme Court upheld the decision not to dismiss charges against Bernard for refusing a breathalyzer test. Beylund was arrested for erratic driving, agreed to a blood test after learning of the penalties, and challenged the suspension of his license. The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, allowing exceptions for warrants based on probable cause. The Supreme Court has exceptions to the warrant requirement, including exigent circumstances, search incident to arrest, and consent to search. Justice Alito discussed the exigent circumstance exception and incident to arrest exception in a recent opinion. In a recent opinion, Justice Alito explained that breath tests are less intrusive than blood tests and can be administered as a search incident to a lawful arrest for drunk driving. Blood tests, on the other hand, are significantly more intrusive and require a warrant. Justice Alito reversed Birchfield's conviction for refusing an unlawful blood test but upheld Bernard's conviction for refusing a lawful breath test. Beylund's case was sent back to state court to determine if his consent to a blood test was voluntary. The Supreme Court justices had differing opinions on warrantless breath tests in Birchfield and Beylund cases. Justice Thomas believed alcohol tests always fall under exigent circumstances. The Court ruled in favor of qualified immunity for officials in excessive force cases like Mullenix's car chase incident. The Supreme Court confirmed that police officers are entitled to qualified immunity for use of force, except when they should have known their conduct was unlawful. The case involved a Texas state trooper who fired at a car during a high-speed chase, resulting in the driver's death. Trooper Mullenix fired at a car during a high-speed chase, resulting in the driver's death. The driver's family sued, alleging excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Mullenix sought qualified immunity, but the district court refused, leading to an appeal. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the district court's decision to deny Trooper Mullenix qualified immunity in a case involving a high-speed chase and a fatal shooting. The court emphasized that qualified immunity protects government officials from civil damages unless they violate clearly established constitutional or statutory rights. The panel found that Mullenix's actions did not meet the criteria for qualified immunity, as the fleeing suspect did not pose a sufficient threat to warrant the use of deadly force. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied Trooper Mullenix qualified immunity in a case involving a high-speed chase and a fatal shooting. The court ruled that the use of deadly force was not justified as the fleeing suspect did not pose an immediate, serious threat. The Supreme Court agreed with Mullenix in an 8-1 decision, stating that the Fourth Amendment right was not clearly established in this case. The Supreme Court ruled in an 8-1 decision that Trooper Mullenix was entitled to qualified immunity in a case involving a high-speed chase and a fatal shooting. Justice Scalia believed the law was not clearly established as the car-chase cases cited involved deadly force to make an arrest. Justice Sotomayor dissented, stating that Mullenix violated the suspect's rights by not waiting to see if tire spikes would disable the car, and expressed concerns about a \"shoot first, think later\" approach to policing. The Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits successive prosecution by federal government and Puerto Rico for the same offense. Sanchez Valle sold a firearm, indicted by both Puerto Rican and federal grand juries. He pleaded guilty to federal charges and moved to dismiss Puerto Rican charges on double jeopardy grounds. Puerto Rican Court of Appeals reversed trial court's decision, but Supreme Court of Puerto Rico upheld it. The issue stems from Puerto Rico's self-government status and U.S. citizenship for its residents. The relationship between Puerto Rico and the federal government is a subject of dispute, with arguments over whether changes in political status require consent from both parties. In Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle, the issue of double jeopardy arose when defendants faced prosecution under both federal and Puerto Rican laws for the same offense. The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment allows for separate state and federal prosecutions for the same offense, but territories like Puerto Rico are not considered separate sovereigns under this clause. This was the issue in Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle, where defendants faced prosecution under both federal and Puerto Rican laws for the same offense. The Supreme Court precedent states that Puerto Rico cannot prosecute a person convicted in federal court for the same crime due to the double jeopardy clause. There was a conflict with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit's opinion treating Puerto Rico as a state for double jeopardy purposes. Puerto Rico argued that its relationship with the U.S. changed in 1950, leading to the petition for a writ of certiorari. In 1950, Congress passed P.L. 81-600, allowing Puerto Rico to form its own government with a constitution subject to congressional approval. Puerto Rico argued that this approval established its sovereignty similar to territories achieving statehood. The defendants disagreed, stating that the relationship with the U.S. remained unchanged, with Congress retaining authority over Puerto Rico's constitution. The Court, led by Justice Kagan, ruled that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits successive prosecutions by the federal government and Puerto Rico for the same crime, emphasizing that the prosecuting entities must derive their authority from distinct sources of power. Justice Kagan emphasized that the prosecuting entities of the federal government and Puerto Rico must derive their authority from distinct sources of power, as confirmed by Public Law 600 and Puerto Rico's adoption of a constitution. Congress conferred the authority to create the Puerto Rico Constitution, making it the original source of power for Puerto Rico's prosecutors. The Supreme Court affirmed that Puerto Rico cannot prosecute after a federal prosecution for the same offense, as their authority comes from Congress. Justices Ginsburg and Thomas agreed, but expressed concerns about the dual sovereign doctrine. Justice Thomas also disagreed with the Court's opinion on Indian law-Double Jeopardy precedents. The Supreme Court ruled that pretrial restraint of legitimate assets needed for counsel of choice violates the Sixth Amendment. Justices Breyer and Sotomayor dissented, arguing that Puerto Rico's criminal law is not the same source as federal law. The Supreme Court ruled that pretrial restraint of assets needed for counsel violates the Sixth Amendment. Justice Thomas concurred based on the Sixth Amendment's text. Sila Luis was indicted for health care fraud, with the government initiating a civil forfeiture proceeding for tainted assets. Luis argued for substitute assets to pay her defense attorney. The Eleventh Circuit held that the freeze order violated Sila Luis's Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights as she needed substitute assets to pay her defense attorney. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to decide the constitutional issue, focusing on the confiscation of tainted and untainted property under the Controlled Substances Act. The Caplin & Drysdale decision clarified that individuals have no Sixth Amendment right to use another person's money to pay for legal services. The Monsanto decision stated that a judicial finding of probable cause is sufficient for a pre-trial restraining order on assets. The Kaley decision determined that a grand jury's probable cause finding is enough for a restraining order without a judicial hearing. Justice Breyer agreed with Luis that her frozen untainted assets for her defense should not be restrained, citing her Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice. He argued that her rights outweighed the government's interest in forfeiture and restitution, marking a departure from previous cases. The government's position could undermine a defendant's right to choose their counsel. Justice Thomas agreed that the Sixth Amendment protects untainted assets but did not support the plurality's analysis. Justices Kennedy and Alito criticized the ruling for benefiting criminals who quickly spend stolen funds. Justice Kagan dissented based on precedent. The Sixth Amendment's Speedy Trial Clause does not apply after a guilty plea or conviction. The Sixth Amendment's Speedy Trial Clause does not apply after a guilty plea or conviction. It is a fundamental right specifically affirmed in the Constitution and enforced by the Speedy Trial Act of 1984. Montana has a similar constitutional right but lacks a statutory provision for it. Brandon Betterman was charged with bail jumping after failing to appear for his sentencing hearing for a domestic assault conviction in Montana. He waited 14 months for his sentencing on the bail jumping charge, during which he argued that the delay violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. Brandon Betterman argued that the delay in his sentencing violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. The Montana Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's decision, with Betterman contending that the Sixth Amendment's Speedy Trial Clause should apply until sentencing concludes. Montana disputes this, stating that the right only applies to the accused, not the convicted. The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) supported Betterman's case by arguing that the right to a speedy trial should extend to sentencing to reduce oppressive consequences of extended jail stays. However, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Sixth Amendment's Speedy Trial Clause does not apply post-conviction. The Supreme Court clarified that the Speedy Trial Clause loses force upon conviction, with the sole remedy for a violation being dismissal of charges. This decision aligns with the historical understanding that the right to a speedy trial is focused on the accused, not the convicted. The Supreme Court clarified that the Speedy Trial Clause loses force upon conviction, with the sole remedy for a violation being dismissal of charges. Reliance on valid uncounseled tribal-court misdemeanor convictions to prove 18 U.S.C. Section 117(a)'s predicate offense element does not violate the Sixth Amendment or the Due Process Clause. Indian defendants in tribal courts do not have the constitutional right to an appointed attorney in criminal cases with imprisonment terms. Bryant, a tribal member, challenged the use of his uncounseled tribal court convictions in a federal domestic violence case. The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's decision, citing a previous case as precedent. The court found that using Bryant's uncounseled tribal court convictions to establish an element of the offense in a federal prosecution violated the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The Ant decision previously held that the Sixth Amendment barred such evidence in a federal prosecution. The Supreme Court later clarified that tribal courts are not bound by the Bill of Rights, and there is no right to appointed counsel in tribal courts. The Supreme Court in Nichols upheld uncounseled state misdemeanor convictions as valid for enhancing punishment in federal convictions. The Ninth Circuit found no issue with this, while the Eighth and Tenth Circuits had differing views. They believed that the validity of uncounseled convictions mattered more than the reason behind them. Nichols emphasized the importance of valid convictions, regardless of the lack of counsel. The Supreme Court ruled that the defendant's prior tribal-court convictions, which did not involve a constitutional violation, could still be considered for sentencing enhancement in federal court. Justice Ginsburg emphasized that the Sixth Amendment does not apply in tribal court proceedings, and the defendant had the full advantage of counsel in his federal trial under Section 117. The lack of counsel in tribal court did not undermine the validity of the convictions. Justice Ginsburg disagreed with the argument that the lack of counsel in tribal court would invalidate tribal convictions for later federal criminal proceedings. She stated that statutory rights in tribal court sufficiently ensure the reliability of convictions. Justice Thomas concurred with the decision but questioned the validity of previous precedents. The Supreme Court's ruling in Maryland v. Kulbicki held that the failure to anticipate the discrediting of Comparative Bullet Lead Analysis did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. The Supreme Court overturned the decision of the Maryland Court of Appeals regarding the effectiveness of counsel in the case of Kulbicki, emphasizing the right to effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment. This was based on the failure to uncover a report that questioned the reliability of the Comparative Bullet Lead Analysis used in the case. The Supreme Court overturned the Maryland Court of Appeals' decision on the effectiveness of counsel in Kulbicki's case, emphasizing the Sixth Amendment's right to effective assistance of counsel. The Court found that counsel's performance must be deficient and prejudicial to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, and that hindsight should not be used to judge effectiveness. The focus was on the adequacy of performance at the time of the trial, not on later developments. The Court clarified that counsel did not perform deficiently by focusing on defense elements unrelated to challenging the ballistics analysis. The Court also noted that capital punishment cases were prevalent in its sentencing cases this term. The Supreme Court has jurisdiction to decide on the retroactive application of Miller v. Alabama's prohibition on life without parole for juvenile murderers. The case of Montgomery v. Louisiana granted relief to a 69-year-old inmate sentenced for a crime committed as a juvenile, breaking tradition. The Supreme Court's decision in Montgomery v. Louisiana breaks tradition by retroactively applying Miller v. Alabama's prohibition on life without parole for juvenile murderers. The Court's use of the Teague doctrine is unusual, as it typically limits state prisoner access to federal habeas corpus review. The decision burdens states more than federal prosecutions due to the rarity of federal juvenile and murder cases. The Court had previously ruled that the Eighth Amendment prohibits certain sentences for juvenile offenders. Montgomery, convicted of killing a deputy sheriff at 17 in 1963, received a life sentence without parole. He sought to overturn his sentence due to constitutional issues post-Miller, but Louisiana courts denied his appeal. State prisoners can challenge their convictions or sentences through direct and collateral review processes. Montgomery, convicted of killing a deputy sheriff at 17 in 1963, sought to overturn his sentence post-Miller. State prisoners can challenge convictions or sentences through direct and collateral review processes. In the federal habeas corpus stage, the Teague doctrine limits new rule requests, except for substantive new rules or \"watershed\" decisions. The Supreme Court in Montgomery applied Teague's exception to the second stage of the criminal proceeding, following the Miller decision that voided life imprisonment without parole for juveniles. Montgomery's case was sent back to Louisiana for resentencing or parole eligibility. Justice Thomas disagreed with the Court's jurisdictional assessment, while Justice Scalia objected to \"ripping Teague.\" Justice Scalia, in a dissent with Justices Thomas and Alito, objected to the Court's interpretation of Teague's exception, stating that Congress can change the result. The Court's appellate jurisdiction is governed by statute, and reliance on an incorrect Guidelines range can affect a defendant's substantial rights during plain-error review. The Fifth Circuit cannot require additional evidence when the original sentence falls within both incorrect and correct Guidelines ranges. In United States v. Molina-Martinez, the Supreme Court addressed how to determine if an incorrect guidelines range affected a defendant's substantial rights under plain error review. The district judge calculates the advisory guidelines range using the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and considers aggravating and mitigating factors before imposing a sentence. If the defendant does not object at sentencing, appellate review is limited to plain error. The appellate review of the sentence is limited to plain error under Criminal Procedure 52(b). To establish plain error, the defendant must show that the court made an obvious error affecting their substantial rights. In United States v. Molina-Martinez, the defendant was convicted of being unlawfully present in the U.S. after being previously removed. The district court adopted the probation office's calculation of Molina-Martinez's guidelines range of 77 to 96 months, based on a total offense level of 21 and criminal history category VI. Molina-Martinez appealed, arguing that his criminal history score should have been category V, not VI, which would have resulted in a lower guidelines range of 70 to 87 months. The court acknowledged the error but found that it did not affect his substantial rights. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's judgment as Molina-Martinez failed to show that the error in calculating his guidelines range affected his sentence. He petitioned for a writ of certiorari to determine if an appellate court should presume plain-error review when a district court incorrectly calculates a defendant's guidelines range. Martinez-Molina argued for a rebuttable presumption of plain error in cases where a district court miscalculates a defendant's guidelines range. Different circuit courts have varying approaches, with some presuming plain error and others requiring a remand for resentencing. Martinez-Molina cited Supreme Court precedent to support his argument. In Peugh v. United States, the Supreme Court discussed the impact of miscalculations in sentencing guidelines on judicial decisions. Martinez-Molina argued for a presumption of plain error in such cases, while the government opposed it citing concerns about judicial efficiency. The Justices appeared divided on whether to adopt this presumption. Justices were divided on adopting a presumption of plain error in cases where sentencing guidelines were miscalculated. Justice Breyer suggested shifting the burden of proof to the government in such cases, while Justice Scalia questioned the impact on sentencing policy. The Court, in a unanimous ruling, declined to adopt the requested presumption but held that the error itself could show a reasonable probability of a different outcome. The Court held that sentencing calculation errors based on the Guidelines could show a reasonable probability of a different outcome, without requiring further proof of prejudice from the defendant. The Court rejected the Fifth Circuit's unique approach and emphasized that the error itself could be sufficient for plain-error review. The Court's review of a Guidelines error in a capital punishment case found that the erroneous Guidelines range did not make the sentencing proceedings fundamentally unfair. Justice Scalia's last opinion for the Court in Kansas v. Carr clarified that capital-sentencing courts are not required to instruct the jury on mitigating circumstances. The Supreme Court ruled in Kansas v. Carr that capital-sentencing courts are not obligated to instruct the jury on mitigating circumstances. The case involved the Carr brothers who were convicted of multiple crimes including capital murder, kidnapping, robbery, rape, and murder. In the Kansas v. Carr case, defendants were convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death, but the Kansas Supreme Court vacated their sentences on Eighth Amendment grounds due to inadequate jury instructions on mitigating circumstances. The court found the instructions constitutionally insufficient, leading to a conflict with U.S. Supreme Court precedent. In the Carr decision, Justice Scalia rejected the Kansas court's characterization of jury instructions, stating that jurors were not prevented from considering mitigating factors. The Carrs' severance argument was also dismissed by the Court. In the Carr decision, Justice Scalia disagreed with the Kansas Supreme Court's view on jury instructions and the Carrs' severance argument. Scalia argued that the joint sentencing proceedings were not fundamentally unfair, despite the defendants' mitigating evidence influencing each other's fate. The graphic evidence of the Carr brothers' shared responsibility for heinous acts outweighed any potential individual differences in culpability. The Wichita Massacre was described in detail by a surviving victim during joint sentencing proceedings. Justice Sotomayor dissented, arguing that the Court should not have overturned a state high court ruling based on state law. Justice Scalia disagreed, stating that state courts cannot experiment with the Federal Constitution and avoid review. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower federal appellate court decision in White v. Wheeler, ruling that Kentucky courts had not violated the Sixth Amendment by excluding a juror in a death penalty case. This decision reversed the grant of habeas relief and upheld the death sentence for Wheeler, who was convicted of murdering a Louisville couple in 1997. Wheeler was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of a Louisville couple. A prospective juror initially expressed uncertainty about the death penalty but ultimately stated he could consider all penalty options. The prosecution asked the court to excuse the juror, which was done after further questioning. Kentucky courts affirmed Wheeler's conviction and sentence, denying habeas relief. The U.S. district court denied Wheeler's petition for federal habeas review, but the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision. The Sixth Circuit concluded that the Kentucky courts had misapplied the Supreme Court's \"death qualified jury\" case law, but the Supreme Court disagreed, stating that the statutory standard for habeas review of state convictions is demanding and requires a showing that the state court's ruling was lacking in justification beyond any existing law. The Supreme Court disagreed with the Sixth Circuit's conclusion that the Kentucky courts misapplied the \"death qualified jury\" case law. The statutory standard for habeas review of state convictions is demanding and requires a showing that the state court's ruling lacked justification beyond existing law. The Court emphasized the importance of fairminded disagreement in jury selection challenges, where the state judge's decision is entitled to double deference. The Sixth Circuit was criticized for applying the test incorrectly in a case involving a prospective juror's ability to impartially apply the law. The habeas standard, created by Congress as part of the AEDPA, aims to reduce delays in capital cases. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned a death penalty conviction due to the prosecution's failure to disclose material evidence, violating the defendant's due process rights. The Court's decision in Wearry v. Cain overturned a death penalty conviction due to the prosecution's failure to disclose material evidence favorable to the defendant. Testimony at Wearry's trial implicated him in a murder, but key witnesses had conflicting statements and authorities failed to disclose evidence that would have undermined their credibility. The prosecution failed to disclose key evidence that could have undermined the credibility of witnesses in the trial, including undisclosed evidence of a witness seeking a reduced sentence in exchange for testimony. The authorities also did not provide medical records that could have cast doubt on the events surrounding the murder. The Supreme Court's Brady v. Maryland decision requires the disclosure of material exculpatory evidence, while the Strickland v. Washington decision guarantees defendants the assistance of competent attorneys. The Supreme Court's decisions guarantee defendants the assistance of competent attorneys, bar prosecutors from racially discriminatory jury selection, and preclude execution of the mentally retarded. In the Wearry case, evidence withheld undermined confidence in the conviction, leading the Court to return the case to Louisiana courts due to lack of confidence in the defense attorney's work. The Supreme Court found that evidence withheld in the Wearry case undermined confidence in the conviction, leading to a lack of confidence in the defense attorney's work and a return of the case to Louisiana courts. Justices Alito and Thomas dissented, believing that full disclosure would not have changed the outcome. The Supreme Court ruled that in cases where a capital defendant's future dangerousness is a factor, they are entitled to inform the jury about their parole ineligibility when the only sentencing options are death or life imprisonment without parole. In Lynch, the issue arose over the possibility of parole for a murder conviction in Arizona, where parole has been largely abolished. The Supreme Court ruled that a capital defendant can inform the jury about their parole ineligibility when facing death or life imprisonment without parole. In Lynch's case, he wanted to waive release-eligibility and only have death or life imprisonment without parole as options, but the court refused. Arizona argued that Lynch could potentially be eligible for parole in the future if sentenced to life with the possibility of release after 25 years. The Supreme Court ruled that a capital defendant can inform the jury about their parole ineligibility when facing death or life imprisonment without parole. Lynch requested to waive release-eligibility, but the court refused, stating the only options were death or life imprisonment without parole. The Arizona appellate court's decision was reversed, with Justices Thomas and Alito dissenting. They believed the juries' death penalty verdicts were based on the heinous nature of the crimes, not ignorance of parole absence. The Florida Supreme Court rejected Hurst's appeal, affirming the trial court's decision to sentence him to death despite the jury's non-unanimous recommendation. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the death sentence for Hurst, stating that the Sixth Amendment does not require jury decisions on death sentences. The Court has ruled that judges cannot impose sentences beyond statutory limits without jury findings. This decision invalidated Florida's capital sentencing system. The Supreme Court invalidated Florida's capital sentencing scheme, citing the need for jury determination of aggravating factors in line with the Sixth Amendment. This decision was influenced by the precedent set in Ring v. Arizona. The Supreme Court in Hurst invalidated Florida's capital sentencing scheme, requiring jury, not judge, determination for imposing the death penalty in line with the Sixth Amendment. The advisory nature of Florida's jury recommendation was found to not meet Sixth Amendment requirements. The decision leaves the fate of the death penalty in Florida uncertain, as the legislature may need to revise procedures. The Florida legislature may need to revise procedures following the Hurst decision, which invalidated the state's capital sentencing scheme. The Foster v. Chatman ruling found that prosecutors violated Batson principles by striking black jurors from the trial based on race. This could lead to resentencing hearings if the decision is deemed retroactively applicable. In jury trials, lawyers and judges use voir dire to select jurors. Parties can strike jurors for cause or use peremptory challenges. When a Batson challenge is made, courts follow a three-step inquiry to determine if discrimination occurred based on race. The Supreme Court's ruling in Foster involved a Batson challenge from Timothy Tyrone Foster's 1987 capital murder trial in Georgia, where the prosecution used peremptory strikes against four black potential jurors. Despite the challenge raised by Foster, the trial judge concluded that the prosecution had provided race-neutral reasons for the strikes. The prosecutor provided race-neutral reasons for striking potential jurors in Timothy Tyrone Foster's 1987 capital murder trial in Georgia, including ties to social workers, relationships with substance abusers, untruthful answers, and reluctance to impose the death penalty. Foster was convicted and sentenced to death. Postconviction habeas corpus proceedings revealed the prosecutor's notes highlighted black jurors' names, suggesting racial bias in their dismissal. The prosecutor in Timothy Tyrone Foster's 1987 trial in Georgia provided race-neutral reasons for striking potential jurors, including ties to social workers, relationships with substance abusers, untruthful answers, and reluctance to impose the death penalty. Despite the revelation that black jurors were highlighted in the prosecutor's notes, the courts did not find a Batson violation. The Supreme Court of Georgia declined to issue a \"Certificate of Probable Cause,\" preventing Foster from appealing the ruling. During oral arguments, Justices raised broader questions about how to approach Batson claims when faced with a list of allegedly race-neutral reasons for striking jurors. During oral arguments, Justices discussed the issue of providing legitimate race-neutral reasons for striking potential jurors. Foster's lawyer emphasized the need for careful scrutiny of these reasons to prevent prosecutors from giving multiple reasons in the hope that one will be accepted. Justice Breyer presented a hypothetical scenario to illustrate the importance of evaluating the validity of the reasons given. The Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors were motivated by race when striking black jurors from Foster's trial. The Court found evidence of a concerted effort to exclude black jurors, contradicting the state's claim of being color-blind. The ruling did not address deeper Batson issues raised during oral arguments. The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Foster's case found prosecutors were racially motivated in striking black jurors, showing a concerted effort to exclude them. However, the ruling did not address deeper Batson issues discussed during oral arguments, such as how to handle race-neutral reasons for juror exclusion or applying mixed-motive analysis. In Williams v. Pennsylvania, the Court reviewed a case where a judge with prior involvement as a prosecutor in a death penalty decision did not recuse himself, raising concerns of bias under the Due Process Clause. The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Foster's case found prosecutors racially motivated in striking black jurors. In Williams v. Pennsylvania, the Court reviewed a case where a judge with prior involvement as a prosecutor in a death penalty decision did not recuse himself, raising concerns of bias under the Due Process Clause. The Court upheld the death sentence, sparking debate on recusal standards in cases involving the death penalty and the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Terrance Williams was convicted of murder and sentenced to death 30 years ago. The trial prosecutor withheld evidence that could have been used as mitigating factors against the death penalty. The post-conviction court granted a stay of execution and vacated Williams's death sentence. The state appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, where Chief Justice Ronald Castille declined to recuse himself despite his prior involvement in the case. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Ronald Castille, reinstated the death penalty for Terrance Williams despite his request for recusal. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear questions regarding potential bias in cases where a judge had prior prosecutorial involvement. Williams argued for recusal to prevent bias in the review of his death penalty case. The Supreme Court ruled that judges cannot play dual roles in cases involving criminal contempt hearings, citing examples where judges accused of bias were required to recuse themselves. This was relevant in the case of Chief Justice Ronald Castille, who authorized the pursuit of a death sentence as a prosecutor and later sat on the panel deciding whether to vacate the death penalty for Terrance Williams. Pennsylvania argued that Chief Justice Ronald Castille's prior involvement in Terrance Williams' death penalty case was just a \"single administrative act\" and not enough to require recusal. The Supreme Court had previously left unresolved the question of how due process is affected when a judge fails to recuse and does not cast a decisive vote, as seen in Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. Lavoie. In Lavoie, a judge with a financial interest in the case was part of a majority decision, leading to a violation of due process. In a 5-3 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court regarding Chief Justice Ronald Castille's involvement in Terrance Williams' death penalty case. The Court found that there is an impermissible risk of actual bias under the Due Process Clause when a judge fails to recuse, regardless of whether they cast a decisive vote. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that under the Due Process Clause, there is a risk of bias when a judge previously had personal involvement as a prosecutor in a critical decision in the defendant's case. The Court found that Chief Justice Ronald Castille's failure to recuse himself in Terrance Williams' death penalty case constituted a structural error requiring reversal, even if his vote was not decisive. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a judge's previous personal involvement as a prosecutor in a defendant's case creates a risk of bias. Chief Justice Ronald Castille's failure to recuse himself in Terrance Williams' death penalty case was deemed a structural error, even if his vote was not decisive. The Court's ruling brings constitutional recusal standards closer to federal statutory standards. The Supreme Court resolved a split among circuits regarding federal inmate payments for court filing fees, ruling that monthly assessments under the Prisoner Reform Litigation Act must be stacked rather than satisfied on a one-a-month basis. The decision emphasized simultaneous recoupment of multiple filing fees and the requirement for full payment of filing fees by prisoners bringing civil actions or appeals in forma pauperis. The Supreme Court ruled that federal inmate payments for court filing fees must be stacked monthly under the Prisoner Reform Litigation Act, emphasizing simultaneous recoupment of multiple fees and full payment requirement for civil actions or appeals in forma pauperis. The Supreme Court clarified that federal inmates must pay court filing fees monthly under the Prisoner Reform Litigation Act, rejecting a judicially created exception to the exhaustion requirement in the act. In Ross v. Blake, the Fourth Circuit ruled that inmates can bypass the PLRA's exhaustion requirement if special circumstances led them to believe they had exhausted their remedies. This decision conflicts with rulings from other circuits, prompting the Supreme Court to review the case. During a cell block transfer, a Maryland inmate was punched in the face five times by a state corrections officer. James Madigan punched Blake in the face five times while Lieutenant Michael Ross failed to intervene. The Internal Investigative Unit concluded Madigan used excessive force. Blake filed a civil-rights suit against Madigan and Ross, alleging Eighth Amendment violations. The district court granted summary judgment for Ross due to Blake's failure to exhaust available remedies. The Fourth Circuit overturned the district court's ruling that Blake failed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit against Ross. The court considered \"special circumstances\" that justified Blake's non-compliance with Maryland's administrative procedures, following a methodology established by the Second Circuit. The Fourth Circuit overturned the district court's ruling that Blake failed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit against Ross. The court considered \"special circumstances\" that justified Blake's non-compliance with Maryland's administrative procedures, following a methodology established by the Second Circuit. The court concluded that Blake reasonably interpreted Maryland's grievance procedures and his participation in the IIU investigation provided the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services with ample notice and opportunity to address the issues raised. The Fourth Circuit overturned the district court's ruling that Blake failed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit against Ross. Judge Agee dissented, arguing against any exceptions to the PLRA's exhaustion requirement. The Supreme Court asked parties to address the conflict in circuit rulings on exhaustion exceptions. Ross argued against the Second and Fourth Circuits' exhaustion exception, citing Congress's intent in enacting the PLRA. Ross argued against the exhaustion exception, citing Congress's intent in enacting the PLRA and the Supreme Court's interpretation of the act. He contended that the mandatory exhaustion requirement was designed to fix a flaw in the act's precursor, CRIPA, and allowing the exception would restore discretion removed by Congress. In response to the Supreme Court's certified question, Blake argued that administrative remedies were not \"available\" to him, therefore he did not need to exhaust them. He claimed that the prison dismissed other grievances as procedurally improper during the investigation, making Maryland's ARP unavailable to him. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the Fourth Circuit, stating that the PLRA did not allow for a \"special circumstances\" exception to the exhaustion requirement. The Supreme Court ruled that the PLRA does not permit a \"special circumstances\" exception to the exhaustion requirement, emphasizing the mandatory nature of the exhaustion provision. Congress enacted the PLRA to replace the former weak exhaustion provision with a more stringent requirement. Permitting exceptions would undermine the purpose of the PLRA. The Supreme Court clarified the exception to the exhaustion requirement under the PLRA, stating that administrative remedies are considered unavailable when they are a dead end, opaque, or obstructed by prison administrators. The Supreme Court clarified that administrative remedies are considered unavailable when they are obstructed by prison administrators. The Court remanded the case to evaluate if Blake had an 'available' administrative remedy to exhaust."
