    "content": "The Act titled \"Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999\" is also known as the \"Short Title\". It includes findings in Section 2. The Congress acknowledges that low-power television license holders have provided valuable broadcasting to their communities despite severe license limitations, hindering their access to capital and ability to maintain quality broadcasting. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 has created uncertainty for low-power television stations regarding the permanency of their licenses and their treatment during the transition to digital television. It is important to promote diversity in television programming formats by supporting low-power stations serving foreign language communities to ensure they do not lose access to foreign language programming. SEC. 3. PRESERVATION OF LOW-POWER COMMUNITY TELEVISION BROADCASTING. Within 120 days of the Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999, the FCC must create regulations for a class A television license for qualifying low-power TV stations, with similar terms as full-power stations. The Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999 establishes Class A designation for low-power television stations meeting specific requirements. Licensees must submit a certification of eligibility to the Commission within 60 days of enactment. The Commission will grant certification unless there is a material deficiency, and will act to preserve low-power station contours. The Commission will preserve low-power television licensees' contours pending Class A application resolution. Licensees can apply for Class A designation within 30 days of final regulations adoption. The Commission will award a Class A license to qualifying low-power television station licensees within 30 days of an acceptable application. If unforeseen technical issues arise after certification or licensing, an engineering solution may be required. The Commission may modify parameters to ensure replication of digital television service areas. Qualifying low-power television stations must meet broadcasting criteria outlined in the Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999. The Commission may modify parameters for low-power television stations to ensure digital television service area replication. Qualifying stations must meet broadcasting criteria outlined in the Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999, including producing at least 3 hours of local programming per week within their market area. Compliance with operating rules for full power television stations is also required for Class A license application. The Commission may modify parameters for low-power television stations to ensure digital television service area replication. Qualifying stations must meet broadcasting criteria outlined in the Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999. No low-power television station authorized before 1999 shall be disqualified for a class A license based on common ownership with any medium of mass communication. The Commission is not required to issue additional licenses for advanced television services to the licensees of class A television. The Commission may modify parameters for low-power television stations to ensure digital television service area replication. Low-power television station licensees may elect to convert to advanced television services on their analog channel, but are not required to convert to digital operation until the end of the digital television transition. No preemption of section 337 of this Act. The Commission may not grant a Class A license to low power television stations operating between 698 and 806 megahertz, but shall provide them with the opportunity to qualify for a Class A license. Channels within the core spectrum are off-limits for certain channels under this subsection. The Commission must identify 175 additional channels within 18 months of the Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999. Class A licenses cannot be granted if they cause interference within the Grade B contour. The Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999 prohibits interference within the Grade B contour of television stations or digital television service areas, as well as low power television stations or translators. The Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999 prohibits interference within protected contours of television stations or digital television service areas. Amendments include restrictions on interference within specific frequency bands in certain geographic areas. The Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999 prohibits interference within protected contours of television stations or digital television service areas. A television broadcast station shall not lose its status as a qualified low power station due to a full power television station being licensed in the same community or providing local news and information. SEC. 4. COMPETITIVE BIDDING EXCEPTIONS. Section 309(j)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include provisions for low power television stations if at least one applicant is a Class A licensee. The Commission will assign the license to the Class A licensee if only one qualifies, and if multiple applicants qualify, the Commission will make the assignment accordingly. The Commission will assign a license to an applicant serving an underserved area or population, defined as an area where at least 25% within the station's primary service contour does not receive service from more than two commercial TV stations, or where the station broadcasts in a foreign language spoken by a significant proportion of the population. The Commission will notify affected parties to develop an engineering solution if multiple applicants broadcast to underserved areas or populations, allowing 60 days to resolve mutually exclusive applications. The Commission will establish a bidding credit to encourage localism, diversity of programming, and programming for underserved communities if applicants fail to resolve mutual exclusivity in their engineering solutions."
