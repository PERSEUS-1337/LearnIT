The program includes Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) and Concurrent Retirement and Disability Payments (CRDP). Congress is considering expanding the program to include more populations. The VA disability compensation offsetting military retired pay system was adopted in 1944, requiring retired military personnel to waive a portion of their retired pay equal to their disability compensation. This allowed for simultaneous receipt of both payments, with disability compensation being non-taxable. Advocacy groups sought changes to allow for receipt of both payments without offset. In 2003, Congress created Combat Related Special Compensation (CRSC) to provide cash benefits for disabled retirees with combat-related disabilities. In 2004, Concurrent Retirement and Disability Payments (CRDP) was authorized, allowing for immediate concurrent receipt for those rated 100% disabled by the VA. In 2008, eligibility for concurrent receipt was expanded to include those who are 100% disabled. The CRDP phase-in was fully implemented by 2014, allowing retirees with a disability rated at 50% or greater to receive full retired pay and full VA disability compensation without an offset. Understanding military retirement and VA disability compensation is crucial for discussing concurrent receipt. Active duty servicemembers become entitled to retired pay after 20 years of service, receiving a monthly annuity based on their final base pay or average high three years of base pay. Retired pay accrues at a rate of 2.5% per year of service for those who entered before January 1, 2018, and 2.0% for those after. Reserve component members become eligible for retirement after 20 years of service, with retired pay based on a point system. Retirement eligibility is typically at 20 years for active component members and age 60 for reserve component members, with some exceptions for earlier retirement. Some servicemembers may retire early due to physical disability if rated 30% or higher by DOD. These Chapter 61 retirees can choose between two options for calculating monthly retired pay: Longevity Formula or Disability Formula. Longevity retirement eligibility is typically at 20 years for active component members and age 60 for reserve component members. Monthly Retired Pay is calculated based on years of service and pay base, using either the Longevity Formula or Disability Formula. The maximum retired pay cannot exceed 75% of base pay. Disability retired pay is fully taxed unless it's due to a combat-related injury. TERA retirees are those who retire early due to force management requirements before completing 20 years of service. In 1993, Temporary Early Retirement Authority (TERA) was granted as a tool to encourage voluntary retirements during the early 1990s drawdown. TERA retired pay is calculated similarly to longevity retirement, with a 1% reduction for each year of service below 20. To qualify for VA disability compensation, the VA must determine if the veteran sustained an injury or disease while serving in the Armed Forces. VA disability ratings range from 10% to 100%, with each percentage entitling the veteran to a specific level of compensation. A veteran can request a medical reexamination for VA disability compensation at any time. VA compensation is tax-free and can be sought after leaving the service. Disability ratings range from 10% to 100%, with each percentage corresponding to a specific level of compensation. Military retirees can apply for VA disability compensation and have their disability level reevaluated later. After retirement, veterans can receive VA disability compensation for conditions that may have originated during military service. The DOD and VA disability rating systems differ, with DOD assessing disability based on military duties. Military disability retired pay is usually taxable, while VA disability compensation is tax-free. Retirees can have both DOD and VA disability ratings. The DOD and VA have different disability rating systems for retirees. The DOD rating determines fitness for duty, while the VA rating reflects loss of earning power. Efforts have been made to consolidate the systems with a single medical examination and rating. This led to the creation of the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES). The Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) was established at military medical centers to streamline the disability evaluation process for retirement cases. It has since been expanded to other sites and all new disability retirement cases worldwide are now processed through IDES. The DOD and VA are focusing on improving health care data sharing to better assist service members with complex medical issues. Plans are in place to implement an integrated electronic health system for seamless sharing of health care data between the departments. The FY2003 NDAA, amended by the FY2004 NDAA, authorized Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) for military retirees with at least 20 years of service. Eligibility criteria include disabilities attributable to specific injuries or involvement in armed conflict, hazardous duty, duty simulating war, or through an instrumentality of war. Retirees must apply to their parent service for CRSC, which verifies the disability. Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) is not automatic and requires an application to the parent service for verification of combat-related disability. CRSC payments are equal to VA disability compensation and are considered \"special compensation\" rather than retired pay. Payments are made from the Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund, with 90,740 retirees receiving CRSC as of September 2017. Retirees with a DOD disability rating of 30% or greater may receive retired pay before completing 20 years of service. Chapter 61 and active duty TERA retirees with less than 20 years of service are now eligible for Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) as of January 1, 2008. Eligibility no longer requires a minimum number of years of service or a minimum disability rating, with a 10% VA rating potentially qualifying if combat-related. Retirees must still apply to their parent service for validation. The FY2008 NDAA expanded eligibility for Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) to almost all reserve disability retirees, except those retired under a specific provision. A \"special rule\" for Chapter 61 disability retirees caps CRSC at a level based solely on years of service to prevent double annuities. The special rule for Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) may limit or eliminate payments in certain cases, particularly affecting active duty servicemembers with disability retirement and high VA disability ratings. Reserve members with little active duty may also be impacted. Originally, CRSC required 20 years of service, but the FY2008 NDAA expanded eligibility for reserve disability retirees. The FY2004 NDAA clarified that reserve component personnel with at least 20 years of duty creditable for reserve retirement are eligible for Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC). Reserve retirees must be drawing retired pay to receive the CRSC payment, except for reserve component members injured while not in a duty status. Military retirees with combat-related disabilities or Purple Heart recipients are eligible for Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC). Retirees with service-connected disabilities that are not combat-related may be eligible for Concurrent Retirement and Disability Pay (CRDP). The FY2004 NDAA allowed for concurrent receipt of benefits for retirees with at least a 50% disability, phased in over a 10-year period. 100% disabled retirees were entitled to immediate concurrent receipt in 2005.Offsets for retired pay were gradually restored from $100 to $750 per month based on disability level, with all offsets ending in 2014. In 2014, all offsets for military retirees ended, allowing those with at least a 50% disability to receive their full military retired pay and VA disability compensation. In FY2017, 577,399 retirees received CRDP, and retirees cannot receive both CRSC and CRDP benefits. Some retirees are not eligible for CRDP, including nondisability military retirees with service-connected disabilities rated at 40% or less, and Chapter 61 disability retirees with service-connected disabilities of 100% or less and less than 20 years of service. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 granted temporary authority for early retirements to personnel with more than 15 but less than 20 years of service. TERA was used as a manpower tool during the post-Cold War drawdown. TERA retirees are eligible for CRSC and CRDP even with less than 20 years of service. The Blended Retirement System (BRS) offers a lump sum payment option for military retirees joining on or after January 1, 2018. If eligible for CRDP, retirees can receive a lump sum payment while still getting monthly VA disability payments. If not eligible for CRDP, VA disability payments will be withheld until the lump sum payment is repaid. Veteran advocacy groups are pushing for changes to concurrent receipt programs like CRSC and CRDP, which are paid from the DOD Military Retirement Fund. Costs have been increasing due to more eligible recipients, with one-third of military retirees receiving these benefits as of September 2017. Some groups argue that receiving both VA and DOD payments is double-dipping. DOD payments can lead to double-dipping for veterans also eligible for SSDI. Congress is considering changes to concurrent receipt programs to save money, but this may be unpopular among servicemembers and veterans. Eliminating the CRDP program could save $139 billion between 2018 and 2026. The FY2008 NDAA extended CRSC eligibility to Chapter 61 retirees with combat-related disabilities before completing 20 years of service. Congress could expand CRDP to include Chapter 61 retirees with disabilities rated less than 50% or less than 20 years of service, costing $5.8 billion over 10 years. Currently, CRDP is available to retirees with disabilities rated at 50% or higher. Congress could revise concurrent receipt legislation to include all military retirees. The concurrent receipt legislation may face challenges due to perceived inequities between CRSC recipients with 20 or more years of service and Chapter 61 disability retirees. Congress could consider modifying or eliminating the special rule to address this issue, but some observers argue that this would result in duplicate payments. Eliminating or modifying the special rule for concurrent receipt legislation could lead to double payment for the same disability by DOD and VA, complicating future efforts to streamline compensation as recommended by the Dole/Shalala commission."
