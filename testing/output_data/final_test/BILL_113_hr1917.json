    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-Cuba Normalization Act of 2013\". Congress finds that Cuba is no longer a threat to the United States or the Western Hemisphere after the end of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet Union. The continuation of the trade embargo declared in 1962 is not fulfilling its purpose. The US is engaging with other countries like China and Vietnam to promote democratic and human rights reforms. Normal trade relations with Cuba would help its economy develop based on free market principles. The United States can support democratic change and human rights in Cuba by promoting trade, travel, communications, and cultural exchanges. Expanding bilateral trade relations can further progress in Cuba on human rights and democratic rule. Cuba's membership in international trade organizations warrants unconditional normal trade relations treatment from the US. SEC. 3.

This section references specific provisions of law and takes effect upon enactment.

The United States policy is to demand Gross's immediate release and ensure he receives necessary medical treatment. SEC. 12. EFFECTIVE DATE.
