    "content": "The President signed the FY2006 Department of Defense appropriations bill into law, P.L. 109-148, on December 30, 2005. It included a reallocation of $29 billion in Hurricane Katrina recovery funds and a 1% across-the-board rescission for domestic discretionary programs. HUD received $11.9 billion in supplemental Katrina funds, $11.5 billion for the Community Development Block Grant program, and $390 million for Section 8 vouchers for displaced families. The 1% cut led to a $380 million reduction in HUD's FY2006 budget. The FY2006 TTHUD funding bill, signed into law as P.L.109-115, includes $34 billion for HUD. The final agreement splits the difference between House and Senate-approved levels, rejecting the SACI proposal to eliminate the CDBG program. President Bush submitted a rescission and reallocation package on October 28, 2005, to fund Gulf Coast reconstruction after hurricanes. The proposal aims to reallocate funds from various programs to provide $2.2 billion in additional funding to HUD for disaster recovery efforts, including $1.5 billion for the CDBG program. The Senate approved a $34.8 billion FY2006 budget for HUD. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a $34.8 billion FY2006 budget for HUD, with several amendments adopted. The Senate bill rejected the President's SACI proposal and included increases in funding for various programs. President Bush signed a continuing resolution into law on September 30, 2005, funding agencies until November 18, 2005, or the enactment of regular appropriations bills. Programs were funded at the lower of FY2005 enacted, FY2006 House-passed, or FY2006 Senate-passed levels as of October 1, 2005. The House approved H.R. 3058 on June 30, 2005, with a significant increase in funding for HUD programs. Amendments were made to increase funding for various programs such as Section 8 vouchers, HOPE VI, CDBG, Brownfields, HOPWA, and Lead-based Paint Hazard Reduction. The House and Senate passed budget resolutions for FY2006, with differing versions supporting the CDBG program at HUD. The President's FY2006 budget proposed a $2.8 billion cut for HUD, including the controversial elimination of CDBG and related programs. Most HUD appropriations target housing issues for low-income households and special needs. HUD provides various programs to assist households with low incomes or special housing needs, including rental assistance, housing for the elderly or disabled, and shelter for the homeless. They also offer block grant programs like HOME and CDBG to help communities address housing and community development needs for disadvantaged populations. HUD has been focusing on increasing homeownership rates for lower-income and minority households, with FHA insuring mortgages for lower-income homebuyers and developers of affordable rental buildings. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides programs for low-income households, including rental assistance and housing for special needs. In FY2005, HUD received $31.9 billion in funding, with Congress rejecting the Flexible Voucher Program proposal. In FY2005, Congress rejected the Flexible Voucher Program proposal and continued dollar-based funding for HUD. The approved bill allocated $1.6 billion more for Section 8 than requested, with reductions in other HUD programs. Despite no funding proposed for the HOPE VI program, $144 million was appropriated. The President's FY2006 HUD budget and Congressional response are detailed in Table 2. The Senate versions of H.R. 3058, H.Rept. 109-153, S.Rept. 109-109, Conf. Rept. 109-307, and P.L. 109-148 included adjustments for FY2005 figures due to an across-the-board rescission. FY2006 figures were not adjusted for the rescission. Two accounts with offsetting receipts were excluded from the table. P.L. 109-148 enacted a 1% rescission for all domestic discretionary spending. The Administration proposed no new funding for FY2006 and a rescission for the HOPE VI program. In FY2006, Congress proposed no new funding and rescinded HOPE VI funding from FY2005. $58 million was allocated for Indian community and economic development activities, down from $68 million in FY2005. Additionally, $45 million was allocated for the same activities. Hawaiian Homelands Homeownership received $8.9 million in FY2005, with a proposed $8.8 million in FY2006. The Administration planned to replace these programs with a new one funded by the Commerce Department. The CDBG appropriation included $180.8 million in supplemental funding for FY2005. In FY2005, CDBG supplemental funding included $30.8 million under P.L. 108-447 and $150 million under P.L. 108-324. Amendments added funds to the CDF account for CDBG formula grants and Brownfields. $24.8 million was set aside for the program in the Community Development Fund. The House bill renamed the account to Self-Help and Assisted Homeownership and transferred funding for set-asides previously under the Community Development Fund. The final bill adopts the new account proposed by the House, allocating funds differently. In FY2005, $41.7 million was provided for the program as a component of HOME. The House and Senate bills provide funding for Housing Counseling Assistance within the HOME program. University Partnerships received $29 million in FY2005. Other categories include Section 108, Native Hawaiian housing, and Indian housing loan guarantees. The bill includes rescinding $10 million from prior years' appropriations and one-time rescissions of unobligated balances from various accounts. It also proposes replacing Section 108 loan guarantees with a new program in the Commerce Department for FY2006. The Section 8 program consists of tenant-based rental assistance and project-based rental assistance. Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers are federal subsidies for low-income families to reduce housing costs in the private market. Approximately $4.2 billion in advance funding is provided each year for the program, with funds distributed to Public Housing Authorities. The FY2004 appropriations bills synchronized PHA fiscal year start dates, but the advanced funding structure has continued. The House provides $15,631,400,000 for tenant-based rental assistance, with a $44,000 discrepancy that may be due to rounding. The Senate version of H.R. 3058 includes provisions for renewal funding adjustments. The Senate version of H.R. 3058 includes provisions for renewal funding adjustments of up to $45 million to address agencies impacted by the FY2005 formula or portability vouchers. The most contentious aspect is the renewal of existing vouchers, with Congress authorizing over 2 million vouchers throughout the program's history. The program has authorized over 2 million vouchers throughout its history, with funding expiring annually. Prior to FY2004, PHAs were funded based on voucher usage and costs, but in FY2005, a new formula was implemented to control costs, leading to concerns about inadequate funding for many agencies. The President's FY2006 budget proposed $14.1 billion for voucher subsidies, with additional funding for unforeseen emergencies. Congress provided a central reserve account for PHAs in FY2003 and FY2004. The House Appropriations Committee provided less funding for tenant-based assistance than requested by the President in FY2005. An amendment adding $100 million for renewals was approved during floor proceedings. The bill proposed to distribute funding using the President's formula and allowed the Secretary to set aside $45 million for adjustments. The Senate version of the bill funded renewals at the President's requested level. The Senate bill for H.R. 3058 funded agencies based on recent data, with renewal funding determined by voucher costs and leasing over the past 12 months. It also granted the Secretary authority to adjust PHA budgets with up to $45 million. The final version of the bill adopted the Senate's renewal funding formula, which was $100 million less than the House-passed level. The final version of the bill adopted the Senate's renewal funding formula, which included inflation adjustments for agencies based on 2005 funding levels. The bill also allowed the Secretary to set aside up to $45 million for PHAs experiencing low leasing or increased renewal costs. Administrative fees for PHAs changed in FY2003 to a pro-rata share of the appropriated amount. The bill aimed to contain the cost of administrative fees by distributing funds based on previous year's allocations. The President's FY2006 budget requested $1.3 billion for administrative fees, with the House proposing $1.2 billion. The Senate bill would have funded administrative fees at a different level. The final version of H.R. 3058 provides $1.25 billion for administrative fees, with $10 million available for agencies in need of extra funds. Tenant protection vouchers are also included for families facing displacement. The President requested a significant increase in funding for tenant protection vouchers for families displaced from public housing. The proposed increase was due to the needs of the HOPE VI program and a new rule allowing the conversion of public housing to vouchers. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 3058 expressed doubt about the implementation of the mandatory conversion rule and proposed funding tenant protection vouchers at similar levels as the previous year. The final version of H.R. 3058 provided $180 million for tenant protection vouchers, falling between the House and Senate proposed levels. The President's FY2006 budget requested Congress rescind $2.5 billion in unobligated balances from the tenant-based rental assistance account, causing concern among low-income housing advocates. The Secretary was unsure where funds for the proposed rescission would come from, causing concern about potential impact on active programs. The House bill proposed a $2.49 billion rescission, slightly lower than the President's proposal, with flexibility for the Secretary to use funds from other accounts. The Senate bill proposed a lower rescission level and required the Secretary to prioritize taking funds from specific accounts before other HUD programs. The final version of H.R. 3058 rescinds $2.1 billion in unobligated funds from the Section 8 accounts, allowing the Secretary to use funds from other accounts if necessary. The President intends to introduce a new proposal to reform the tenant-based voucher program to contain or reduce costs, citing that Section 8's program costs are impacting other HUD programs. The State and Local Housing Flexibility Act of 2005 proposed a new Flexible Voucher Program to replace the current voucher program, providing more flexibility to Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) and reducing regulations. Congressional action was not taken on previous reform proposals in FY2004 and FY2005. The Disaster Voucher Program (DVP) was established in October 2005 by FEMA and HUD to provide rental assistance to families affected by hurricanes. $390 million was transferred from FEMA to HUD for this program. The DVP operates under Section 8 voucher program rules with some flexibility granted to the Secretary of HUD. The Section 8 Project-based Rental Assistance program provides funding to renew existing contracts between HUD and private landlords, allowing low-income families to live in private market rental units and pay only 30% of their incomes towards rent. Unlike Section 8 vouchers, this program provides subsidies to specific housing units rather than to families. No new contracts are made under this program, with funding used for contract renewals and administrative costs. The Section 8 Project-based Rental Assistance program was funded through the Housing Certificate Fund until FY2004 when it was split. In FY2006, there was a 5% decrease in renewal funding for project-based rental assistance contracts. The President planned to supplement the funding with recaptured funds and program savings, increasing the program level to $5.6 billion. The House version of H.R. 3058 proposed $17 million more for renewals than the President's request. The final version of H.R. 3058 adopts the House-passed funding level for project-based renewals, but does not include the transfer authority proposed by the House. The bill does not include a request for the GAO report proposed by the Senate, but does direct the Department to study and report back on the living conditions of residents. The President's budget requested a 46% increase in funding for contract administrators, with $185 million in unobligated balances to augment the funding. This would result in a 70% program level increase over FY2005. Contract administrators manage long-term Section 8 contracts between HUD and private owners of subsidized multifamily units. HUD plans to transfer most contracts to contract administrators in the future, with an additional $67 million allocated in the FY2006 budget for this purpose. HUD also intends to use contract administrators to manage rental assistance contracts outside of HUD. The budget includes $30 million for contract administrators to manage rental assistance contracts outside of the Section 8 program, such as those under the Section 202 Housing for the Elderly program. Congress continues to provide funds for public housing programs to maintain over 1.2 million units, with the Operating Fund for ongoing maintenance and the Capital Fund for large capital projects. The Capital Fund provides funding for large capital projects and modernization needs in public housing. HOPE VI is a grant program for demolishing and redeveloping distressed public housing, focusing on mixed-income communities. The President's FY2006 budget proposes no new funding for HOPE VI. Operating funds help cover the difference between low rents and building costs in public housing, with a requested $3.4 billion for FY2006. In FY2006, despite a slight decrease in program level, the requested budget would have been enough to fund agencies at a similar proration level as FY2005. HUD issued a proposed rule to revise the formula for distributing operating subsidies, differing from the version agreed upon by stakeholders. HUD published a final rule in September 2005 that reinstated most provisions of a negotiated rule, delayed implementation until 2007, and allocated more funding for FY2006 than FY2005. The House version of the HUD funding bill included language directing the distribution of operating funds based on a negotiated rulemaking committee's formula and provided $50 million to assist agencies facing losses. The bill allocated $50 million to help agencies transition to asset-based management. The Senate proposed $150 million more for the Operating Fund than the President requested. The final version of H.R. 3058 funded the Operating Fund at a higher level than the President's request or Senate-passed level, but lower than the FY2005 program level. The bill did not specify how funds should be distributed. The bill does not specify how funds should be distributed, with a focus on the postponed implementation of a new rule. The President's budget proposed a decrease in capital funding for PHAs, arguing that it would be sufficient to meet repair needs despite a backlog of modernization needs estimated at $18-$20 billion. HUD states that reductions in the capital fund are necessary to ensure sufficient funding for tenant-based rental assistance. The President proposed cuts to ROSS and Neighborhood Networks funding, which provide supportive services and technology centers for public housing residents. The House-passed bill allocated more capital funding than requested, with increases for capital grants. The Senate-passed version of the HUD bill also included increases for capital grants. The final version of the HUD funding bill provides $2.46 billion for the Capital Fund, which is a decrease from FY2005 but higher than the President's request. It also allocates $38 million for ROSS and $8 million for Neighborhood Networks, splitting the difference between the House and Senate levels. The President's budget requested no new funding for HOPE VI for the third year. The President's budget requested no new funding for HOPE VI for the third year, claiming program funds are spent too slowly and costs are too high. Congress funded HOPE VI in FY2004 and FY2005, but at a lower level than in FY2003. The House Appropriations Committee did not provide new funding for FY2006 but did not rescind FY2005 funding. An amendment transferred $60 million to HOPE VI for FY2006. The Senate proposed $150 million for HOPE VI. The Senate-passed bill proposed $150 million for HOPE VI, a slight increase over the FY2005 level. The enacted version of H.R. 3058 provides $100 million for the HOPE VI program. The conference agreement stated that alternative approaches to the HOPE VI program should be considered. Native American Block Grants replaced several separate programs of assistance. The Native American Block Grants replaced multiple assistance programs in 1996 to provide grants to Indian Tribes and their Housing Entities for housing and community development needs. Funding for the program in FY2005 was $68.4 million, with a recommendation of $69 million for FY2006, but the final appropriation was $60 million. The President's FY2006 budget proposed $583 million for the program. The President's FY2006 budget proposed $583 million for the Native American Block Grant program, with a decrease of $39 million. The House-passed version of H.R. 3058 increased funding for Native American Block Grants above the President's requested level but below the FY2005 enacted level. Formula grants received a 6% increase above the President's request but were 10% below the FY2005 enacted level. The President's request for the Indian Economic Block Grant program to be funded as a set-aside in the Community Development Fund is reduced by $45 million in H.R.3058. The Senate-passed version of the HUD funding bill increased funding for Native American Block Grants above FY2005 levels. The Senate Committee expressed concern about unspent balances and eligibility definitions for FY2004 formula funding. P.L. 109-115 appropriates $630 million for Native American Housing Block Grants, with HUD required to allocate funds based on Census data. Housing for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) provides housing assistance for low-income persons with HIV/AIDS and their families through formula allocation and competitive grants. The Administration proposed a 5% reduction in HOPWA program funding for FY2006, citing the need to prioritize Section 8 voucher program funding. The House Appropriations Committee's bill allocated $285 million for HOPWA, with an additional $10 million added through an amendment. The Senate-passed bill provided about $5 million more than FY2005 levels and $20 million more than the President's request, but $18 million less than the House. The final appropriation for HOPWA in FY2006 was $289 million. The final appropriation for HOPWA in FY2006 was $289 million, an increase of 2.6% over FY2005. It exceeded the Administration's request by $21 million, the Senate's version by $2 million, and was $6 million less than the House proposal. The Rural Housing and Economic Development program received about $25 million in funding for FY2006, despite the Administration's proposal to eliminate funding for it. The Rural Housing and Economic Development program received $25 million in funding for FY2006. The Administration proposed consolidating it into a new program called the \"Strengthening America's Communities Initiative,\" but both the House and Senate continued to fund it as a freestanding program at HUD. The House proposed $10 million, while the Senate Committee proposed $24 million. P.L. 109-115 appropriated $17 million for the program. Additionally, the Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities program awards tax incentives and grant funds to eligible businesses in designated zones. The Bush Administration's budget proposal aimed to eliminate funding for the EZ/EC program and other community development programs, replacing them with the Strengthening America's Communities Initiative. However, H.R. 3058 rejected this proposal and did not include funding for EZ/ECs in FY2006. The CDBG program, a significant federal assistance source for housing and community development, was also at risk of being eliminated in the Administration's FY2006 budget. The Administration's FY2006 budget proposed eliminating funding for the CDBG program and related set-asides, replacing them with the \"Strengthening America's Communities Initiative\" block grant funded at $3.7 billion. This initiative aimed to consolidate 18 programs to reduce fragmentation in federal community and economic development assistance. The Administration's new initiative aims to consolidate 18 programs into a block grant to improve accountability and target assistance to areas with the greatest needs. However, organizations representing states and local governments have voiced reservations about the lack of details and inclusion in discussions. The proposal was characterized as a work in progress when support did not materialize. The Administration's proposal to consolidate 18 programs into a block grant was characterized as a work in progress. The Commerce Department released the SACI advisory committee's report with findings and recommendations to assist in developing a legislative proposal. The report is available for discussion at http://www.compete.org/pdf/SACAC_Report.pdf. The Senate bill for formula grants and set-asides totals $2.6 million less than the total appropriation level for the CDF specified in the bill. The amount specified in each appropriations bill for formula grants is split between grants to entitlement communities and states. $57.8 million is requested for the program within the Native American Housing Block Grant. The House version of H.R. 3058 includes funding for the Indian CDBG program in the Native American Housing Block Grant account, as well as creating a new account for Self-Help Assisted Homeownership with various allocations for different organizations. Additionally, P.L. 108-324 provided funding for emergency disaster assistance to communities affected by disasters designated by the President between August 31, 2003, and October 1, 2004. The House version of H.R. 3058 includes funding for various housing organizations such as the American Indian Housing Council, Housing Assistance Council, and Housing Partnerships Network. Additional funding is provided for capacity building and technical assistance. The conference version of the act also includes funding for organizations like the National American Indian Housing Council, La Raza HOPE Fund, National Housing Development Corp., and Special Olympics. Research and Technology funding requests include allocations for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Community Development Work Study, and Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions. The House version of H.R. 3058 includes funding for various housing organizations and university-based programs. Funding is allocated for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Community Outreach Partnerships. The Research and Technology Account would receive $29 million for assistance to university-based programs previously funded under the CDBG account. Funding for these programs would shift to the Office of Policy Development and Research. Additionally, $8.8 million is requested for activities within the Native Hawaiian Block Grant. $8.8 million is requested for the Native Hawaiian Block Grant program. The House version of H.R. 3058 would fund this program separately at its requested level. $30 million is requested for a separate program line item. $58.9 million is requested for a program within the Department of Labor. A House floor amendment added $67.5 million to the CDF account, with up to $50 million available for Youthbuild. Additionally, $31 million was appropriated to the Community Development Fund for the Hudson River Park Trust. In FY2005, EDIs were funded at $291.6 million post-rescission, equivalent to $294 million pre-rescission. An additional $1 million in EDI funds was not included in the House Appropriations Committee's re-estimate. The Brownfields program received $24 million from a House floor amendment to H.R. 3058. S.Amdt. 2183 allocated $5 million for Habitat for Humanities capacity building activities. The House Appropriations Committee passed a FY2006 HUD funding bill that included $4.15 billion for the Community Development Fund within HUD. The bill also allocated funds for various programs such as Habitat for Humanities, YouthBuild, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions, and Tribal Colleges and Universities. The FY2006 HUD funding bill recommended $4.151 billion for the Community Development Fund, rejecting the Administration's proposed SACI. The funding included $3.860 billion for CDBG formula grants and $290 million for EDI grants. Several CDBG set-asides like YouthBuild and empowerment zones would not be funded, with funds being transferred to other HUD accounts. The House approved H.R. 3058 with $4.324 billion in funding for the Community Development Fund, including allocations for various programs like the Self-Help Homeownership Program and the Housing Assistance Council. Amendments increased funding, with an additional $67.5 million proposed. The House approved additional funding of $67.5 million for the Community Development Fund, with $50 million allocated for the Youthbuild program and $17.5 million for CDBG formula grants. The CDBG formula-based program received $3.9 billion in funding, $230 million below its FY2005 level. Representative Knollenberg expressed intent to restore funding to FY2005 levels. Another $24 million was added for the HUD Brownfields Redevelopment program. The House approved additional funding for the Community Development Fund, including $24 million for the HUD Brownfields Redevelopment program. Representative Gingrey offered an amendment related to the use of CDBG funds for economic development projects in response to the Kelo v New London Supreme Court decision. The House approved additional funding for the Community Development Fund, including $24 million for the HUD Brownfields Redevelopment program. Representative Scott Garrett's amendment in H.R. 3058 would prohibit the use of federal funds to enforce the Kelo decision, approved by a vote of 231-189. The Senate Appropriations Committee also approved its version of H.R. 3058, allocating $4.324 billion for Community Development Fund activities. The Senate approved $554 million for CDBG-related set asides and earmarks in H.R. 3058, with differences in funding allocations compared to the House version. The Senate bill included funding for smaller CDBG-related programs under the CDF account, such as $69 million for the Native American CDBG and $32.4 million for college and university programs. The Senate approved $554 million for CDBG-related set asides and earmarks in H.R. 3058, with differences in funding allocations compared to the House version. The Senate bill included funding for smaller CDBG-related programs under the CDF account, such as $69 million for the Native American CDBG and $32.4 million for college and university programs. Additionally, the Senate version of the bill retained programs under the CDF account, appropriated $40 million for the Neighborhood Initiative Program, and allocated $30 million for capacity building grants under the National Community Development Initiative program. The Senate also included provisions limiting the use of federal funds in economic development projects involving eminent domain. Senator Bond introduced and withdrew an amendment that would have prohibited the use of federal funds in such projects. The Senate approved funding for various CDBG-related programs in H.R. 3058, including allocations for Native American CDBG and college programs. Senator Bond introduced an amendment to limit federal funds in economic development projects involving eminent domain, specifying that funds could only be used for projects with a public purpose. The amendment in H.R. 3058 allows the use of eminent domain for public use projects without losing federal funds. It also mandates a state-by-state study on eminent domain use. The bill allocates $4.220 billion for Community Development Fund activities, with $3.748 billion for the CDBG formula grant program, a 9% decrease from FY2005. $471 million is designated for CDF set-asides, with $310 million for 1126 EDI earmarked projects. The $310 million in EDI earmarks represents a 7% increase in funding for projects over the amount appropriated in FY2005. Funding for various programs previously funded under this account has been shifted to other HUD accounts. Section 726 of the TTHUD Appropriations Act for FY2006 prohibits the use of federal funds for projects involving eminent domain unless they serve a public purpose, excluding economic development benefiting private entities. Eminent domain can be used for projects like brownfield redevelopment and mass transit without losing federal funds. The FY2006 supplemental appropriations included $11.5 billion for disaster-recovery assistance in five states impacted by hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. Louisiana received $6.2 billion, with provisions allowing for administrative costs, waivers of program requirements, and funding for local community development corporations. The HUD income targeting requirement for CDBG activities benefiting low- and moderate-income persons was decreased from 70% to 50% of the state's allocation. The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows states and entitlement communities to leverage their annual CDBG allocation for brownfield redevelopment, economic development, and housing projects. States and entitlement communities can borrow up to five times their annual CDBG allocation, pledging their current and future CDBG allocation as security. The Brownfields Redevelopment program provides funds to assist cities in redeveloping abandoned industrial sites with environmental contamination. The House allocated $24 million for the program in FY2006 under the Community Development Fund. The Brownfields program received $24 million in funding under the Community Development Fund in FY2006. The Administration's budget proposed eliminating the program, but H.R. 3058 rejected this proposal and included funding for the program. The Senate version of the bill allocated $15 million for the Brownfields program. The conference version of the act appropriates $10 million for the Brownfield Redevelopment activities. The HOME Investment Partnerships Program provides block grant funding for affordable housing initiatives, including acquisition, rehabilitation, new construction, and rental assistance. The FY2006 budget requested $1.94 billion for the HOME program, an increase of $41.3 million. The FY2006 budget requested $1.94 billion for the HOME program, with an increase of $41.3 million. The increase was mainly for the American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI), while other HOME program set-asides decreased. Concerns were raised about the program assisting families who may not be suitable for homeownership. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) review suggested that HUD might not be able to obligate more than $40 to $50 million during the fiscal year. Both the House and Senate versions of the FY2006 HUD bill proposed $1.9 billion for the HOME program. In FY2006, funding for the HOME program was less than the President's request but slightly more than in FY2005. The House bill proposed an increase in formula grants over both FY2005 and the President's request, while the Senate bill suggested a slight increase above the House level. The American Dream Downpayment Initiative was funded close to the FY2005 level, significantly less than the President's request. H.R. 3058 ultimately cut funding for the HOME program by $125 million from the initial request and reduced funding for the American Dream Downpayment Initiative by half. Formula grants faced the largest decrease with a 5% cut. The final version of H.R.3058 cut funding for the HOME program by $125 million and reduced funding for the American Dream Downpayment Initiative by half. The Self Help Homeownership Program (SHOP) was funded in a new account called Self Help and Assisted Homeownership, consolidating funding for several programs previously funded as set-asides. The final version of H.R.3058 reduced funding for various housing programs, including the HOME program and the American Dream Downpayment Initiative. The Self Help Homeownership Program (SHOP) was consolidated into a new account called Self Help and Assisted Homeownership, with funding for additional programs. The President's FY2006 budget proposed an additional $1.2 million for the Native American Housing Block Grant account to be awarded to the National American Indian Housing Council for capacity building and technical assistance. Homeless Assistance Grants include competitive grant programs like the Supportive Housing Program, Shelter Plus Care program, and Single Room Occupancy program, as well as the Emergency Shelter Grants program distributed via formula allocation. The President's FY2006 budget proposed $200 million more for homelessness programs than in FY2005. The budget included the Samaritan Initiative for supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals and $25 million for another initiative. Legislation for the Samaritan Initiative was introduced in the 108th Congress but not enacted. The President's FY2006 budget proposed $25 million for a Prisoner Re-entry Initiative, with funds transferred from HUD to the Department of Justice. The House-passed version of H.R. 3058 provided $100 million less for Homeless Assistance Grants than requested. The House bill did not designate funding for the Samaritan Housing Initiative or the Prisoner Re-entry Initiative due to lack of authorizing legislation. The final spending bill for FY2006 appropriated $1.34 billion for Homeless Assistance Grants, $100 million below the President's request. Funding for the Samaritan Housing Initiative and Prisoner Re-entry Initiative was not included in the final version. The bill also emphasized the implementation of HUD's Homeless Management Information System. HUD continues to implement its Homeless Management Information System to count and track the homeless, reporting progress to Congress by March 10, 2006. Housing Programs for the Elderly and Disabled, including Section 202 and Section 811, provide capital grants and rental assistance for new subsidized housing. Funding for Homeless Assistance Grants in FY2006 was $1.34 billion, $100 million below the President's request, with emphasis on the HMIS implementation. The President's FY2006 budget proposed a 50% cut in funding for Section 811, with the full amount allocated for vouchers to persons with disabilities instead of capital grants. The rationale for the reduction or restriction on capital grants was not provided in HUD budget documents. The Secretary of HUD mentioned the need for unpopular cuts in programs like Section 811 to maintain funding for Section 8 and homeless programs. Both the House and Senate versions of H.R. 3058 proposed funding the Section 202 program at a level similar to the President's request. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 3058 proposed funding the Section 202 program at the President's requested level, similar to FY2005 spending. A Senate floor amendment made $10 million available for the Section 202 LEGACY demonstration program. Both versions also proposed funding the Section 811 program at the FY2005 level, allowing funds for capital grants. The Senate bill suggested transferring Section 811 vouchers renewal to the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account. The enacted FY2006 appropriation funds Section 202 at $742 million. The enacted FY2006 appropriation funds Section 202 at $742 million and Section 811 at $239 million, with a reduction in funding for the Section 202 LEGACY demonstration program. The final bill includes funds for capital grants but does not transfer Section 811 vouchers to the Section 8 tenant-based rental account as proposed in the Senate version. Additionally, the Senate version of H.R. 3058 proposed establishing the Affordable Housing and Economic Development Technical Assistance Board to provide technical assistance to local non-profit organizations managing HUD programs. The Affordable Housing and Economic Development Technical Assistance Board (AHEDTAB) would consist of three national organizations and an advisory board made up of various groups involved in HUD programs. The program would be funded by transferring $50 million from existing HUD funds. The Affordable Housing and Economic Development Technical Assistance Board (AHEDTAB) would have been funded by transferring $50 million from various existing HUD programs. The Board was not included in the final version of H.R. 3058. The funds for AHEDTAB would be transferred from other accounts, not directly appropriated. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) administers mortgage insurance programs to protect lenders from borrower defaults. The Federal Housing Administration administers mortgage insurance programs to protect lenders from loan defaults by borrowers. FHA insurance enables borrowers to obtain loans for various purposes such as home purchase, home improvement, apartments, hospitals, and nursing homes. The programs are administered through two program accounts - the Mutual Mortgage Insurance/Cooperative Management Housing Insurance fund account (MMI/CMHI) and the General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance fund account (GI/SRI). The FHA has negative appropriations, indicating a surplus generated by the program from insurance premiums exceeding expenses. This led to HUD requiring $1,724 million less in appropriations in FY2005. Two legislative initiatives proposed by the Administration involve 100% FHA financing for first-time buyers with strong credit records and amending underwriting guidelines for borrowers with blemished credit records to obtain FHA-insured loans with increased insurance premiums to cover higher risks and costs. The President's budget assumed initiatives would create $268 million in negative appropriations in FY2006, with MMI and GI/SRI programs generating $1,956 million in offsetting receipts. The Administration estimated net FHA appropriations of $-1,489 million for FY2006, but the Appropriations Committee disagreed. Their re-estimate assumed zero savings from initiatives and $347 million less in offsetting receipts. Both House and Senate versions of H.R. 3058 assumed lower expenses in the MMI account and lower receipts in the GI/SRI account, resulting in greater savings than the President's estimate. The committees were able to achieve greater savings than the President's budget allowed, but less than in the original budget. They estimated an appropriation of $-913 million, with a need for an additional $811 million to support other HUD programs. OFHEO, responsible for regulating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has faced criticism for being ineffective. The appropriations for OFHEO are offset by fees collected from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Administration plans to transfer resources from OFHEO to a new agency called the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity enforces laws against housing discrimination based on various factors. FHAP provides grants to enforce these laws at the state and local levels, while FHIP funds fair housing initiatives. The President's budget recommended decreases in funding for Fair Housing programs, with FHAP being reduced by 14% and FHIP by 19%. H.R. 3058 adopted the President's funding request, but the full House increased funding slightly over FY2005 levels. The Senate version of H.R. 3058 provided more funding for fair housing activities than the President's request, but less than FY2005 levels. For FY2006, P.L. 109-115 funds Fair Housing programs at $46 million, with $26 million for Fair Housing Assistance and $20 million for Fair Housing Initiatives. An administrative provision prohibits the use of funds for legal activities under the Fair Housing Act. The Office of Lead Hazard Control at HUD administers the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control Grant Program and Healthy Homes Initiative to reduce lead-based paint hazards in homes. The Administration proposed $116 million for the Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control Reduction program in FY2006, a $48 million reduction from FY2005 levels. The FY2006 budget for the Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control Reduction program was reduced by $48 million (29%) from FY2005 levels. This reduction was mainly due to zero funding proposed for the Lead Hazard Demonstration program, with funds redirected to the Section 8 voucher program. The House initially adopted the President's funding request, but a floor amendment during full House debate restored funding to FY2005 levels. The Senate-passed bill proposed funding slightly above FY2005 levels, and ultimately, P.L. 109-115 appropriated $152 million for the program in FY2006."
