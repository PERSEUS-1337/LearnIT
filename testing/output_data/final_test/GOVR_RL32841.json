A strategic approach using various frameworks is discussed in a series of reports. This final report builds on previous analyses and explores new policy options. The broader context of Homeland Security efforts and congressional concerns are reviewed. The homeland security effort is depicted as concentric circles or screens. The homeland security effort involves a series of concentric circles or screens, starting with preventive measures abroad and ending with emergency preparedness at home. This includes discovery and prevention of terrorist actions, interdiction at borders, defense against terrorism within the US, protection of critical infrastructure, and emergency response. Congressional concern with terrorism and border security has been evident since early terrorist attacks. Congressional interest in terrorism and border security began early, prompted by terrorist attacks in the 1990s. This led to inquiries, studies, and targeted measures post-9/11. Efforts continued in the 108th Congress with the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Various commissions were created to understand the terrorist threat, including the Gilmore, Bremer, and Hart-Rudman Commissions. Following the 9/11 attacks, Congress took immediate legislative action focused on airline, visa, and border security, followed by maritime security. This led to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and the USA PATRIOT Act. However, Congress has shown frustration in addressing broader border and transportation security threats, such as integrating terrorist watch-lists and addressing rail and mass transit security. The evolution of congressional concern post-9/11 attacks led to legislative actions focusing on airline, visa, and border security, followed by maritime security. However, broader concerns like integrating terrorist watch-lists and addressing rail and mass transit security have been a challenge. This has prompted the exploration of possible policy frameworks to enhance border and transportation security. The curr_chunk explores a \"layered\" approach to protecting the nation through multiple policy actions on various fronts to increase the probability of intercepting threats. It discusses the complexity of providing border and transportation security due to the scale of the task and potential conflicts with national goals. This includes balancing security needs with facilitating essential travel and trade for economic growth. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of good border management for economic growth, emphasizing the need to facilitate the flow of goods and people while screening out threats. It suggests viewing the border as a flexible concept to enhance border management options. The curr_chunk discusses the geographic dimension of the problem with screening people, goods, and documents moving from the source country to the United States. It identifies paths and points of interception en route to the final destination in the United States. The results are illustrated in Figure 1, showing the journey from the foreign port of exit to the domestic port of entry. The curr_chunk discusses the multiple points of vulnerability in the shipping or travel process, highlighting opportunities for interception to increase the probability of interdiction. It also mentions current programs for interception discussed in another report. The curr_chunk discusses strategies for achieving greater border and transportation security, including pushing the border outwards, hardening the border with technology, making the border more accessible for legitimate trade and travel, strengthening border inspection processes, and engaging other actors in enforcement efforts. The concept of a \"layered\" approach to security involves applying multiple and overlapping measures at key points in the border security environment to enhance interdiction opportunities. This approach is gaining traction in policy discussions, particularly in the context of aviation safety and security. The Hart-Rudman Commission Report in 2001 emphasized the importance of a \"layered defense\" strategy for homeland security, focusing on prevention, protection, and response. The concept of layered protection was applied to border security, with the goal of translating it into concrete programs and policy actions. The 9/11 Commission Report in 2004 also advocated for a layered approach, specifically highlighting the importance of passenger screening and security rules enforced by the FAA. The Hart-Rudman Commission Report in 2001 emphasized a \"layered defense\" strategy for homeland security, with rules for airlines and airports to implement. The concept aimed to have multiple layers of security to prevent failures. The commission endorsed this approach, citing Dr. Stephen Flynn's work on layering security like locking doors and using additional measures like lights and dogs for protection. A \"layered\" approach to security involves multiple measures such as having a dog on the premises, posting signs indicating monitoring by a security company, and forming neighborhood watch groups. These measures, when combined, can significantly reduce the probability of burglary. This comprehensive strategy is cost-effective and effective in enhancing security for homes and communities. Transportation security is a comprehensive strategy that identifies vulnerabilities and turns them into targets for interception, with overlapping redundancies to increase the chances of intercepting terrorist activity. This approach addresses dilemmas in policy design such as diminishing returns, goal conflict, and the opportunistic nature of security threats. The opportunistic nature of terrorism leads to shifting targets and methods to reduce cost and risk. Security policies for transportation involve various actors and considerations for different modes of transportation. Policies for transportation security can focus on different zones or actors in the journey, or use a layered approach covering staff authentication, passenger screening, monitoring conveyances, and access control. Transportation security measures include physical security of conveyances, access control for storage and maintenance areas, screening of cargo and baggage, security at ports of departure, transit, and entry, and maintaining security en route between ports. The text discusses potential policy exploration opportunities in transportation security measures from ports of departure to domestic entry, considering resource constraints and societal goals. One approach to enhance transportation security is to implement a Transportation Workers' Identification Credential (TWIC) program, which includes biometric identification testing for truck drivers and other workers at various locations. The plan is to implement a single standard for secure identification, including iris scans, fingerprints, and hand geometry, for 5 million transportation industry workers at seaports, airports, and other facilities in the United States. Future steps may involve accelerating TWIC implementation for maritime workers and expanding to workers in all transportation sectors. International agreements could allow for secure identification of transportation workers from other countries. Screening may be extended to all staff levels, including office workers in the supply chain, to prevent terrorists from gaining access. To prevent terrorists from accessing transportation systems and crossing borders, improvements in terrorist screening databases are recommended. This includes detecting terrorist indicators on travel documents at various stages of the border and immigration system. Intelligence efforts feeding into the databases should be expanded, and more sophisticated name recognition software should be utilized to reduce false positive identifications. The 9/11 Commission recommended expanding the use of biometric identifiers for secure identity authentication during travel. This would involve better integration of databases and technical improvements for faster and easier use by border and immigration personnel. Improved training for border security staff is also essential. The 9/11 Commission recommended enhancing the use of biometric identifiers for secure identity authentication during travel, including improving databases and technical capabilities for border and immigration personnel. Efforts should be made to establish effective screening methods at various checkpoints and portals to ensure accurate identification and intercept suspects. Research and investment in biometric readers are also crucial to increase accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, exploring screening methods for rail and transit passengers is important to expand coverage beyond air transportation. The 9/11 Commission recommended expanding security measures to other modes of transportation, such as rail and mass transit systems, due to vulnerabilities in cargo and general aviation security. The need for passenger screening in these settings requires further research and experimentation. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 extended screening to cruise ships and larger charter airplanes. Additional training for border inspectors is also necessary. The 9/11 Commission recommended expanding security measures to other modes of transportation, such as rail and mass transit systems, due to vulnerabilities in cargo and general aviation security. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 extended screening to cruise ships and larger charter airplanes. Better training for border inspectors is needed, along with augmented research on terrorist travel methods and document falsification techniques. Analyzing characteristic travel documents and patterns could have allowed authorities to intercept hijackers. Clear signs on travel documents linked most terrorists to terrorism, but were not part of routine inspector training at the time. Explore ways to deny terrorist entry. The 9/11 Commission recommended enhancing security measures for various modes of transportation, including rail and mass transit systems, to address vulnerabilities. They also emphasized the importance of targeting terrorist travel as a powerful weapon against terrorism. The commission suggested setting national standards for state-issued documents and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 addressed this proposal. Additionally, attention was given to denying internal travel to terrorists who have entered the country, legally or illegally. As part of enhancing security measures for transportation, attention should be given to inspecting all conveyances for possible terrorist tampering. Special focus should be on trucks carrying hazardous materials, as they have been used in past attacks. Steven Flynn also highlights weaknesses in the transportation system. Steven Flynn highlights weaknesses in the transportation system, particularly for short-haul truckers carrying hazardous materials. Recommendations include using transponders to track vehicles and implementing automatic shutoff devices for security. Research at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is developing truck-stopping devices for law enforcement use in case of terrorist threats. Ensuring the safety of transportation vehicles is crucial for security measures. The security of transportation vehicles is crucial, especially for rail and transit systems. Protective measures like increased guards, fencing, cameras, and sensors can be implemented. Enhanced access control using intelligent credentials and biometric checks can also be beneficial, providing a record of movement and personnel activity. Enhanced security measures for transportation include screening passengers, cargo, and baggage, as well as focusing on high-risk shipping containers. Suggestions for improvement include advanced targeting of high-risk containers, early screening before loading onto ships, scanning devices for contraband detection, smart-container technology, and possibly using GPS tracking. Enhanced security measures for transportation include screening passengers, cargo, and baggage, as well as focusing on high-risk shipping containers. Suggestions for improvement include advanced targeting of high-risk containers, early screening before loading onto ships, scanning devices for contraband detection, smart-container technology, and possibly using GPS tracking. Proposals also suggest increased attention to air cargo inspection, with recommendations for better oversight of the \"known shipper\" program and more random checks to supplement security measures. Enhanced security measures for transportation include screening passengers, cargo, and baggage, as well as focusing on high-risk shipping containers. Suggestions for improvement include advanced targeting of high-risk containers, early screening before loading onto ships, scanning devices for contraband detection, smart-container technology, and possibly using GPS tracking. Congress required an immediate tripling of cargo inspections for cargo on airline passenger planes in the FY2005 Appropriations Bill approved for the Department of Homeland Security. Expand use of fixed and mobile portal screening devices for explosives and radiation detection, as well as random inspections for other hazardous material. Recommendations also include reviewing rail routes for hazardous cargo and re-routing as necessary. The City Council for the District of Columbia passed a 90-day ban on shipments of hazardous materials through the nation's capital. Enhance maritime domain awareness efforts by utilizing radar, sonar, cameras, and direct observation to track vessels entering or leaving ports. Strengthen security at rail and transit terminals to protect against potential threats posed by large shipping containers and liquid natural gas conveyances. To enhance security at rail and transit terminals, various measures can be implemented such as using non-intrusive inspection technologies like portal screening devices, explosive screening for passengers, sensors for chemical and biological materials, bomb-sniffing dogs, frequent traveler IDs, and random checks of passengers and baggage en route. This is crucial in light of past terrorist attacks on rail systems in Madrid and Tokyo, highlighting the need for increased protection in accessible transportation systems. To strengthen security at multi-modal shipping nexus points, consider implementing measures like security for smaller pallets of goods, in-line baggage screening, inspection at rail sidings, and easier access in congested areas. New port designs could facilitate these security steps seamlessly, despite limited space challenges. To enhance security at ports and terminals, design initiatives should focus on maintaining high security levels throughout the journey. Special efforts are needed to secure passengers and cargo in the transit zone, including the use of multi-modal security devices like \"smart containers\" and transponders. Policy options should address vulnerabilities and opportunities across different modes of transportation. Policy options for enhancing security at ports and terminals include better targeting of passengers and cargo through a mix of sophisticated and random inspections. This involves achieving high confidence in identifying high-risk individuals and goods, utilizing biometric identifiers, the US-VISIT program, terrorist watch lists, border inspector training, and screening at various transportation points. Successful targeting of high-risk containers requires similar measures with additional crucial information. Enhancing security at ports and terminals involves better targeting of passengers and cargo through sophisticated and random inspections. Random changes in inspection targets and procedures can help identify gaps in present algorithms and increase risks for terrorists. An example of using random principles is seen at the land border port between Mexico and the United States at the Douglas, AZ port. The Douglas, AZ port uses sophisticated algorithms for random inspections, including switching inspectors and changing targets. Red Teams and war-gaming are used to explore vulnerabilities and defeat potential attacks, as recommended by the 9/11 Commission. The 9/11 Commission recommended the use of Red Teams and war-gaming to explore vulnerabilities and defeat potential attacks. The military has utilized these techniques for years, with NORAD running an exercise involving a hijacked airliner crashing into the Pentagon. The exercise was terminated due to the Korean War, highlighting the importance of early warning and defense strategies in contingency planning. The Red Team technique was endorsed by the Bush Administration and the 9/11 Commission for homeland security. Research efforts are needed for better detection devices for explosives and radiation across transportation systems. Investments in scanning technologies for containers could improve security across transportation modes. Investments in scanning technologies for containers across transportation modes are crucial for improving security, although widespread deployment is still years away. Efforts to promote better border management are complicated by potential goal conflicts, such as balancing security with economic growth, freedom of movement, and privacy concerns. One approach to balancing security goals without overemphasizing one area is to adopt a \"layered\" strategy, as recommended by the 9/11 Commission and BTS analysts. This approach spreads security actions across multiple areas to increase the chances of preventing or deterring terrorist activities. It also addresses the issue of terrorist opportunism by avoiding over-concentration of resources in one area, which terrorists can easily exploit by targeting softer targets. When considering security actions, policymakers can choose between a layered strategy or a more targeted approach. Key criteria for evaluating actions include prioritizing near-term actions, weighing security benefits against social and economic costs, minimizing intrusiveness, addressing privacy and civil liberties concerns, and considering how actions interact with others in the security process for cumulative security."
