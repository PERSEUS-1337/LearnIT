    "content": "In a 5-to-4 ruling, the Supreme Court in Citizens United v. FEC lifted restrictions on corporate independent expenditures, invalidating provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act and the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. The Court found these prohibitions violated the First Amendment by constituting a \"ban on speech.\" This decision overruled previous rulings and allowed corporations to use their general treasury funds for independent expenditures. The Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United v. FEC lifted restrictions on corporate independent expenditures, allowing corporations to use their general treasury funds for independent expenditures. The Court upheld disclaimer and disclosure requirements in certain sections of BCRA, finding that they do not impose a ceiling on campaign-related activities. The ruling did not affect the validity of Title I of BCRA, which bans the raising of soft, unregulated money by national parties and federal candidates. The Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United v. FEC lifted restrictions on corporate independent expenditures, allowing the use of general treasury funds for independent expenditures by corporations and labor unions. Before the ruling, corporations and unions were prohibited from using general treasury funds for communications advocating for or against federal candidates. Additionally, they were not allowed to finance electioneering communications within a certain timeframe. The Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United v. FEC allowed corporations and labor unions to use general treasury funds for independent expenditures and electioneering communications. This decision overturned restrictions on using general treasury funds for political advocacy, but contributions to candidates and political parties from corporate and union treasuries are still prohibited. Various proposals and legislation have been discussed in response to the Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United v. FEC. This report provides an analysis of constitutional and legal issues raised by several proposals, including increasing disclaimer requirements, disclosure for tax-exempt organizations, shareholder notification, restricting political expenditures by government contractors, taxing corporate independent expenditures, and public financing for congressional campaigns. The report also discusses amending the Constitution but does not describe specific legislation. For more details on legislation and policy options, refer to CRS Report R41054. Some proposals in response to Citizens United v. FEC ruling aim to increase disclaimer requirements for political communications paid for by corporations. This may include statements by the corporation's president or CEO in advertisements, along with an image of the individual. Currently, FECA mandates disclaimer requirements for public political advertising financed by a political committee. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) mandates that public political advertising funded by corporations and labor unions must include disclaimers, especially for communications advocating for or against a candidate. This includes electioneering communications within specific timeframes. The disclaimer must clearly identify the source of the communication and state that it was not authorized by any candidate. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) requires corporations and labor unions to include disclaimers in radio and television advertisements, stating the entity responsible for the content. This includes a spoken statement and a full-screen view of the entity's representative for at least four seconds. This is known as the \"stand by your ad\" requirement. FECA does not mandate disclosure for advertising that does not explicitly advocate for or against a candidate. The Supreme Court upheld the disclaimer requirement in Section 311 of BCRA in McConnell v. FEC and Citizens United v. FEC, stating it serves the important governmental interest of shedding light on campaign financing. Disclaimer and disclosure requirements do not limit campaign-related activities or prevent anyone from speaking. The Court upheld disclaimer requirements in Section 311 of BCRA, stating they provide information to voters and help them evaluate arguments. Enactment of increased disclaimer requirements for corporate-financed political ads would likely survive challenges. However, overly burdensome disclaimer requirements could impede a corporation's free speech rights under Citizens United. Some propose disclosing certain donors to \u00a7 501(c) organizations, which have federal tax-exempt status. Current law requires disclosure of donors to entities making independent expenditures and electioneering communications if donations exceed a threshold amount to further campaign activity. The organization may avoid disclosing donors by setting up a separate account for activities, resulting in only those donors being publicly disclosed. Compelled donor disclosure can be seen as infringing on First Amendment rights, but the Supreme Court has upheld disclosure requirements in certain cases. Disclosure requirements would be unconstitutional if donors are at risk of threats or harassment. Some suggest mandating public disclosure of donors to \u00a7 501(c) organizations to prevent threats or harassment. Proposals include expanding disclaimer requirements for large donors in political ads. Concerns about constitutional limitations on disclosing donors who did not donate for political purposes have been raised. Some argue that the ability of Congress to require disclosure of donors who did not donate specifically for political activity may face constitutional challenges, as the relationship between compelled disclosure and governmental interests may not be strong enough to withstand judicial scrutiny. Some argue that requiring disclosure of donors who support \u00a7 501(c) organizations' activities outside of political campaigns may face constitutional challenges, as campaign activity is not their primary focus. The constitutionality of disclosure and disclaimer proposals remains uncertain, as the Court generally supports such requirements, but other factors may influence their legality. The constitutionality of donor disclosure requirements for \u00a7 501(c) organizations, which are limited in campaign activity but can engage in unlimited lobbying, remains uncertain. Courts may consider the organization's full range of activities and donor protection interests when evaluating disclosure laws. Congressional interest exists in amending federal securities laws to mandate shareholder notification of corporate political spending. Congress has not passed legislation giving shareholders voting authority on corporate expenditures, leaving decisions to corporate executives and boards. Management is typically protected from liability under the business judgment rule if transactions are made in good faith. The business judgment rule typically protects management from liability for decisions made in good faith. While Congress has not passed legislation requiring shareholder approval of corporate political expenditures, the Commerce Clause may give Congress the authority to do so. Courts have upheld broad legislation concerning corporations under the Commerce Clause in the past. The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were upheld as constitutional under the Commerce Clause. The Acts require registration statements for securities sold through interstate commerce to protect against fraud. Congress has the authority to enact regulations to prevent such fraud. Legislation may require shareholder approval for corporate spending on political advertising to prevent fraud in interstate commerce. This could potentially affirm shareholders' right to direct spending by executives and boards of directors, but may also pose a challenge to corporations' free speech rights as established in Citizens United. A proposal mandating shareholder votes on specific political advertising expenditures within a limited timeframe may infringe on corporations' free speech rights per Citizens United. Careful consideration is needed for enforcing such legislation without violating corporate freedom of speech. The Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United emphasized that restrictions on political speech based on corporate status may still be permissible under certain circumstances. Certain federal laws categorize some US corporations as \"foreign\" due to ownership and control, imposing restrictions. Congress could consider similar legislation post Citizens United. The proposed legislation targets US corporations with substantial foreign influence, not incorporated under foreign laws. These corporations are among \"foreign nationals\" prohibited from campaign contributions. The constitutionality of this is unclear. The constitutionality of prohibiting campaign contributions or expenditures by US corporations with foreign ownership or control has not been challenged. Prior to Citizens United, these corporations could not make direct campaign expenditures but could use PACs. Proposed bills aim to include such corporations in the definition of \"foreign national,\" potentially conflicting with existing legal theory. Such proposals challenge the prevailing legal theory of corporations as separate entities from shareholders. Federal statutes classify some U.S. corporations as \"foreign\" due to foreign ownership, justified by federal powers over immigration, commerce, and naturalization. The federal government has the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, naturalization, and national defense. Legislation restricting political speech of foreign-owned corporations can be supported by provisions limiting foreign involvement in the federal government. Courts consider various factors, including the percentage of foreign ownership, when determining if a corporation is \"foreign\" for statutory purposes. Federal laws that distinguish based on alienage and do not impact fundamental rights are generally upheld. In Moving Phones Partnership, L.P. v. Federal Communications Commission, the court upheld regulations limiting foreign ownership in broadcasting to 20% as a means to prevent foreign influence on U.S. elections. Preventing foreign influence on U.S. elections has not been recognized as a legitimate state interest like national security. However, it could be treated as such by a court, as determining who can participate in the political process is essential for sovereignty. Restrictions on non-citizens' involvement in politics exist, and the Constitution reflects concerns about foreign involvement. Restrictions on campaign expenditures by foreign-owned corporations may be upheld due to their lack of First Amendment rights. The U.S. has a strong interest in limiting political influence. The United States has a strong interest in limiting political participation to its citizens, with restrictions on corporate political speech depending on the corporate structure. The Court's decision in Citizens United aims to prevent foreign influence without overly restricting corporate expenditures. Restrictions targeting ownership percentages without control are more questionable than those targeting wholly owned subsidiaries. Certain restrictions on the political speech of foreign-owned or -controlled corporations could potentially be challenged on First Amendment grounds by U.S. citizens. Courts have recognized that some restrictions on the speech of foreigners can abridge First Amendment rights of U.S. citizens. In Mendelsohn v. Meese, a U.S. district court upheld a statute preventing two U.S. citizens from using funds from the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Restrictions on political speech by foreign-owned corporations may face First Amendment challenges from U.S. citizens. The case of Mendelsohn v. Meese involved two U.S. citizens unable to use PLO funds for speaking engagements in the U.S. due to restrictions. The lenient standard of review for content-neutral speech may not apply, as noted in Citizens United. Restrictions on corporations with small foreign ownership percentages could impact the speech of U.S. majority owners and may be challenged for vagueness under the Fifth Amendment. Statutes must clearly define offenses to avoid being deemed \"void for vagueness,\" especially concerning restrictions on speech. Concerns arise regarding determining corporate ownership, particularly with publicly traded corporations, as shifts in ownership and control can create vagueness issues. This is relevant in light of the Citizens United case's implications for corporate speech. Efforts to restrict private entities from using non-federal resources for political advocacy raise First Amendment concerns. While Congress can regulate funds it appropriates, going beyond restrictions on fund use raises constitutional issues. Federal laws already impose restrictions on using federal funds for political purposes. When legislation seeks to suppress independent political advocacy by private entities as a condition to receive federal funds, it must be scrutinized under First Amendment principles. The Supreme Court has ruled that the government cannot deny benefits to individuals for exercising their constitutional rights. The Supreme Court has established that the receipt of a federal benefit cannot be conditioned upon giving up one's constitutional rights, particularly the First Amendment freedom of speech. This principle applies even though a person may not have a \"right\" to the benefit, and the government can deny it for various reasons. The government cannot deny a benefit to a person based on their constitutionally protected interests, such as freedom of speech. This would penalize and inhibit the exercise of those freedoms, which is impermissible interference with constitutional rights. The Supreme Court has recognized the right of independent contractors not to be terminated for exercising their First Amendment rights, even when receiving government contract funds. The Supreme Court has invalidated federal laws restricting advocacy rights under the First Amendment, including a case involving public broadcasting grants. The Court ruled that broadcasters receiving federal funding cannot be prohibited from expressing their own opinions on public interest matters. In Citizens United, the Court rejected arguments to maintain restrictions on corporate campaign expenditures, citing the need for narrow tailoring of speech restrictions. The Supreme Court rejected the notion that corporations could be denied their First Amendment right to engage in political expression in exchange for government benefits. The Court emphasized that the state cannot require the forfeiture of First Amendment rights as a condition for receiving special advantages granted to corporations. The Supreme Court ruled that corporations cannot be required to give up their First Amendment rights in exchange for government benefits. This raises questions about imposing broad restrictions on political speech as a condition for federal grants or contracts. The Court distinguishes between campaign contributions and independent expenditures, with the former being subject to limitations due to corruption concerns. The Supreme Court distinguishes between campaign contributions and independent expenditures, with the latter receiving greater First Amendment protection as they are not coordinated with candidates, reducing concerns of corruption. The Supreme Court concluded that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not lead to corruption or the appearance of corruption. This decision was based on the absence of prearrangement and coordination, which reduces the risk of quid pro quo arrangements with candidates. The Supreme Court's decision on independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, found that they do not lead to corruption or the appearance of corruption due to the absence of prearrangement and coordination with candidates. Congress can impose conditions on the receipt of federal funds, but restrictions on the use of a recipient's own funds for speech within a federally supported program have been allowed by the Court. The Supreme Court allows Congress to impose conditions on the receipt of federal funds, but restrictions on the use of a recipient's own funds for speech within a federally supported program are permitted. Chief Justice Rehnquist distinguished this from unconstitutional conditions cases, where the government prohibits the recipient from engaging in protected conduct outside the scope of the federally funded program. The Supreme Court allows Congress to impose conditions on the receipt of federal funds for government speech. In Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, the Court overturned a restriction on grantees lobbying for changes in welfare legislation within a government-funded legal services program. In Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, the Supreme Court ruled that lobbying within a government-funded legal services program could not be restricted under the \"government speech\" doctrine. Private organizations acting as surrogates for government agencies may also be subject to restrictions on partisan political activities under federal law. The Supreme Court has ruled that private organizations acting as surrogates for government agencies may be subject to restrictions on partisan political activities under federal law, based on the Hatch Act. Arguments could be made for limiting political speech of private participants in government programs to protect fair administration, but this rationale may not be strong for private contractors providing goods or services to the government. The Supreme Court applies \"strict scrutiny\" to laws limiting First Amendment rights, weighing governmental interests against restrictions. Prohibiting political expenditures by government contractors aims to prevent corruption and undue influence on elections. The Supreme Court has found that governmental interests in preventing corruption and undue influences on candidates may justify limitations on First Amendment activities. However, restrictions must be narrowly tailored to meet these objectives. The Court has also ruled that restricting independent expenditures by private entities in political campaigns may not necessarily advance the interest of preventing corruption. The Supreme Court has found that restrictions on independent expenditures by private entities in political campaigns may not necessarily prevent corruption or undue influences on candidates. Legislation limiting private parties or corporations receiving federal contracts from engaging in independent political expenditures may not advance the interest in preventing corruption. The Supreme Court has ruled that coordination with a candidate for an \"independent expenditure\" by a private entity may not lead to corrupt influence or quid pro quo agreements. The Court also rejected the idea of limiting speech to balance competing voices in public policy debates. If the government's purpose is not to prevent corruption, it may aim to protect government funds and programs. The federal government aims to prevent the use of government funds for unauthorized political advocacy activities by private parties. Current provisions already prohibit the use of contract or grant funds for political or lobbying purposes and impose criminal penalties for fund diversion. The government aims to prevent the use of government funds for political advocacy by private parties. Restrictions on privately funded advocacy by grant or contract recipients may be considered over-inclusive and burdensome on First Amendment rights. The government aims to prevent indirect subsidies for political advocacy by private groups using federal funds for non-advocacy activities. The Supreme Court has rejected the argument that grants for one purpose subsidize other activities, including political speech. The government may assert new interests in conditioning political speech of government contractors, targeting specific categories, to prevent influence on the political process. Alleged interests in avoiding corruption or using government-generated wealth for political influence may not be sufficient post Citizens United. The government may have interests in restricting political speech of government contractors to prevent corruption and political influence, but courts have not recognized these as compelling enough to justify across-the-board restrictions. Narrower restrictions targeting specific types of contractors may be more plausible. The appearance of quid pro quo corruption in government contracts earmarked for specific entities may justify limitations on campaign contributions. Contractors performing critical or mission essential functions could be targeted similar to the Hatch Act. Personal service contracts making contractor personnel appear as government employees could also be subject to restrictions. Foreign government or corporate contractors may also be targeted. Some have proposed an excise tax on corporate campaign-related expenditures permitted under Citizens United. Existing taxes apply to tax-exempt organizations, assuming any proposed tax would apply to both for-profit and non-profit corporations. Congress has broad powers to tax under the Constitution. Tax distinctions and classifications are constitutionally permissible as long as they have a rational relation to a legitimate governmental purpose. Courts typically show great deference to Congress's taxing power, but provisions based on the content of speech are subject to strict scrutiny. Such provisions must be necessary to serve a compelling government interest and narrowly drawn to achieve that end. The imposition of a tax on certain corporate expenditures by Congress could raise significant constitutional concerns, especially when related to the exercise of a constitutional right. The lack of case law analyzing the constitutionality of such a tax limits the analysis. Depending on the specifics, an excise tax on corporate political expenditures could be seen as a penalty on protected speech, potentially facing strict scrutiny. The Supreme Court has upheld provisions that provide unfavorable tax treatment to a taxpayer's campaign activities. In Cammarano v. United States, the Court upheld a tax regulation disallowing a business deduction for lobbying expenditures, citing no obligation for the government to subsidize taxpayers' constitutional rights. Taxpayers were denied a deduction for lobbying against a state initiative, arguing it violated the First Amendment. The Court emphasized the chilling effect on speech and equated it to a fine. In Cammarano v. United States, the Court upheld a tax regulation disallowing a business deduction for lobbying expenditures, stating that taxpayers were not being denied a deduction for engaging in constitutionally protected activities but were required to pay for those activities out of their own pockets. The Court emphasized the chilling effect on speech and equated it to a fine. In Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Washington, the Court upheld federal law limiting lobbying by \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations, stating that the First Amendment does not require government subsidy for lobbying activities. An excise tax on corporate campaign expenditures would not, in general, affect the community as everyone should be on equal footing regarding Treasury purchases. An excise tax on corporate campaign expenditures may be seen as a restriction on speech, similar to the prohibition in Citizens United. The specifics of the proposal, such as the tax rate, scope of taxpayers, activities subject to tax, and purpose of the tax, could impact how a court analyzes it. An excise tax on corporate campaign expenditures could be viewed as a speech restriction, akin to the ban in Citizens United. The proposal's details, like tax rate, taxpayer scope, taxable activities, and tax purpose, could influence a court's assessment. Proponents cite existing taxes on tax-exempt groups engaging in political spending to support Congress enacting such a tax. For instance, IRC \u00a7 527(f) and IRC \u00a7 4955 levy taxes on certain organizations for election-related expenditures. Tax laws impose a 10% tax on certain expenditures, with an additional 100% tax if not corrected promptly. Private foundations, as \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations, face stricter regulations due to limited contributions. IRC \u00a7 6033 imposes a proxy tax on tax-exempt organizations for political dues notification failures. IRC \u00a7\u00a7 4911 and 4912 tax \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations exceeding lobbying expenditure limits. The \u00a7 527(f) tax and \u00a7 6033 proxy tax may be seen as similar to a corporate campaign expenditure tax, but there are characteristics that could undermine support for an excise tax on corporate campaign expenditures. These taxes could be upheld under the non-subsidization rationale, serving as a mechanism to prevent federal subsidization of political activities. The taxes imposed on \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations under \u00a7\u00a7 4955, 4945, 4911, and 4912 could be viewed as penalty taxes for engaging in campaign and lobbying speech, suggesting that the subsidization rationale may not fully justify their imposition. These taxes are imposed on activities that these organizations are restricted from engaging in under tax laws. The \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations are restricted from certain activities under tax laws, with taxes serving as enforcement mechanisms. If these limitations are deemed unconstitutional, it could raise questions about the constitutionality of the taxes. The \u00a7 4945 tax penalizes certain expenditures allowed by tax laws, potentially likened to taxing corporate campaign expenditures. However, private foundations face heavy regulation to prevent abuse, making the \u00a7 4945 tax part of a regulatory scheme separate from campaign finance. In the context of tax laws and restrictions on \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations, the discussion shifts to the potential taxation of corporate campaign expenditures. Proposals for public financing of congressional candidate campaigns have been introduced, with emphasis on voluntary participation and spending limits to ensure constitutionality. The comparison between taxes on tax-exempt organizations and corporate campaign expenditures raises questions about the applicability of similar rationale. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court ruled that spending limits violate the First Amendment as they restrict political speech. Citizens United v. FEC reaffirmed this, stating that only voluntary spending limits are constitutional. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of voluntary public financing for presidential elections in Buckley. Congress can engage in public financing and set expenditure limitations for candidates who accept public funds. Public financing encourages public participation in the electoral process without violating First Amendment rights. In Buckley, the Supreme Court upheld voluntary public financing for presidential elections and expenditure limitations for candidates who accept public funds. A proposal for a voluntary public finance program for congressional candidates, with spending limits, would likely be constitutional. In Citizens United v. FEC, the Court invalidated provisions of the FECA and BCRA, finding them unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. FEC overturned provisions of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, which prohibited corporations from using general treasury funds for \"electioneering communications.\" The Court deemed these restrictions as a violation of the First Amendment, suggesting that amending the Constitution could be a way to overturn the ruling and restore previous FECA provisions. This would require allowing legislation to prohibit corporations and labor unions from using their general treasury funds for political communications. In the 111th Congress, proposals have been introduced to amend the Constitution to allow Congress to regulate the raising and spending of money in federal elections, including setting limits on expenditures for or against federal candidates. Approval would require two-thirds of each House and ratification by three-fourths of the states within seven years. Some proposals in the 111th Congress aim to amend the Constitution to allow Congress to regulate money in federal elections, including limiting expenditures by corporations, labor unions, and individuals. This would also potentially give states the power to regulate corporate expenditures in state elections."
