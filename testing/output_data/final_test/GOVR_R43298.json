    "content": "The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014, P.L. 113-121) was signed into law on June 10, 2014. It resolved differences between the House-passed H.R. 3080 and the Senate-passed S. 601, focusing on water resource activities, primarily by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Members expressed frustration with project delays and interest in authorizing new projects while deauthorizing older ones. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014) authorized new construction projects, deauthorized older projects, and addressed concerns about congressional roles. The bill included a fixed set of 34 new projects totaling $25.65 billion and increased appropriations for previously authorized projects. The Administration provided comments during congressional deliberations through letters and testimony. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 authorized new construction projects totaling $25.65 billion and increased appropriations for previously authorized projects. It established expedited House and Senate procedures for bills authorizing construction projects meeting specified criteria. The bill required an \"Annual Report\" to Congress identifying proposed new studies and completed feasibility reports. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 authorized construction projects totaling $13.0 billion, with reforms to expedite Corps studies and environmental compliance. Independent peer review was included as a reform measure. The bill also expanded project delivery and financing opportunities. WRRDA 2014, H.R. 3080, and S. 601 promoted nonfederal involvement in water projects through crediting, increased opportunities for contributions, and pilot programs for nonfederal management. It also established the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) to finance water projects. The Corps and EPA administer water infrastructure projects. WRRDA 2014 increased spending from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund and modified funding prioritization for different types of harbors. Changes were made to inland waterway project delivery and cost-sharing for specific projects. The enactment of P.L. 113-121 authorized a levee safety initiative to reduce flood risks, expanding technical assistance and training for levee safety. It also increased FEMA assistance for state and tribal levee safety programs and allowed the ASA to develop national levee safety guidelines. This legislation may increase availability of Inland Waterways Trust Fund monies for waterway construction projects. The WRRDA 2014 legislation directed the ASA to repair levees to the design level of protection and provided congressional direction for regional river and coastal restoration efforts. It also authorized the construction of projects in the Everglades and Coastal Louisiana. Additionally, the legislation expanded the Corps' authority to undertake activities for prevention. WRRDA 2014 expanded the Corps' authority to address invasive species at projects and created a process to deauthorize projects with federal costs totaling $18 billion. It also included provisions for managing backlogs and addressed issues related to oil spill regulations and water infrastructure. The WRRDA 2014 legislation included water infrastructure provisions of the Clean Water Act, focusing on grants for wastewater treatment projects. It did not address ocean-related provisions from other bills, such as prohibiting actions related to coastal planning or creating a National Endowment for the Oceans. Instead, WRRDA 2014 authorized studies of Corps projects in coastal zones. The ASA authorized studies of Corps projects in coastal zones to enhance ocean and coastal ecosystem resiliency, as well as construction of smaller projects or recommendations for congressional authorization. The report provides a side-by-side analysis of selected provisions of H.R. 3080, S. 601, and the conference report which became WRRDA 2014, focusing on significant provisions for the Corps and policy differences between the bills. Many project-specific or geographically specific provisions are not discussed, with the report divided into sections for comparison. The conference report for WRRDA 2014, like the House and Senate bills, aimed to expedite water project delivery and permit processing. Provisions included establishing deadlines, schedules, and funding limits for feasibility studies, eliminating certain study requirements, expediting environmental compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, and streamlining Corps permitting. Members expressed frustration with the cost and duration of Corps studies, which are typically cost-shared 50% federal and 50% nonfederal. The factors contributing to study completion time are complex and challenging to determine. The time it takes to complete a Corps study is influenced by various factors, such as the complexity and cost of the project. Delays may also occur due to disagreements with federal or state agencies. Limited data is available to determine if delays are systemic or project-specific. Congress's role in authorizing studies and project construction, as well as the timing of appropriations, significantly impact study duration. Timing of appropriations significantly affects project delivery. Delays in the Corps study process can occur due to various factors. At a House hearing, the Corps witness mentioned proposed legislation to expedite planning processes. The Corps' ability to innovate and streamline processes may be hindered by certain requirements, potentially leading to a less flexible and inefficient program. The conference report for WRRDA 2014 set time and funding limits for feasibility studies, aiming to expedite project approval. The conference report for WRRDA 2014 imposed time and funding limits on feasibility studies to speed up project approval. WRDA 2007 introduced reforms such as independent peer review for feasibility studies, with a higher threshold of $200 million for review and extended the requirement until 2019. The WRRDA 2014 project acceleration provisions aim to expedite the Corps' project development by streamlining the NEPA compliance process. NEPA requires federal agencies to consider a project's environmental impacts before making a final decision. The conference report expanded the definition of the \"environmental review process\" to include the NEPA compliance process. The conference report expanded the definition of the \"environmental review process\" to include requirements for water resources projects under Federal law other than NEPA. The Corps' planning process includes the \"Environmental Evaluation and Compliance\" process to ensure compliance with environmental requirements. The NEPA compliance process is essential for ensuring compliance with environmental requirements from various levels of government. The Corps typically prepares an environmental impact statement for projects requiring a feasibility study. Project acceleration provisions in the conference report focus on outside agency involvement in the NEPA process and other environmental laws. Prior to WRRDA 2014, Section 2045 of WRDA 2007 required the Corps to establish a coordinated review process for water resources projects needing a feasibility study and an EIS under NEPA. This process allowed the Corps to set a schedule for federal, state, or local agencies to process required reviews, permits, and approvals for the project. The conference report for WRRDA 2014 includes provisions that apply to project studies requiring an EIS under NEPA, with some changes to Corps practices and outside agencies' procedures. These changes do not substantially affect the Corps' obligation to comply with existing environmental requirements. The Corps must comply with environmental requirements under NEPA or other laws for projects. The integration of project acceleration provisions with the Environmental Evaluation and Compliance process is uncertain. Some provisions may lengthen the planning process, such as the requirement to prepare a coordination plan for outside agency participation in the environmental review process. Deadlines for outside agencies may be extended for \"good cause,\" adding complexity to the process. The provision may not significantly change the Corps' coordination procedures with outside agencies. Unique requirements for NEPA compliance may have limited impact on the Corps' process. Financial penalty provisions allow reprogramming of funding if deadlines for permit decisions are not met. Corps projects often require approvals from state, tribal, or local agencies. The financial penalty provisions for Corps projects under federal environmental laws are mostly issued by state, tribal, or local agencies, not federal agencies. WRRDA 2014 also included a provision related to actions for project repair after a disaster, processed as a categorical exclusion. The regulations allow agencies to categorically exclude projects with no significant environmental impact from preparing an environmental assessment or EIS under NEPA. The Corps identifies activities at completed projects as actions processed as CEs, even in emergencies. Compliance with NEPA may not be required for projects under construction as their impacts would likely be evaluated in an existing NEPA document. The Stafford Act exempts certain disaster-related activities from NEPA, potentially waiving some Corps repairs. Designating a project as a CE does not waive NEPA. It is unclear if this directive could result in limited NEPA review for projects that would have otherwise had no review. The Corps also has regulatory responsibilities for water resources projects and activities affecting navigable waters and wetlands. H.R. 3080 and S. 601 included provisions to streamline the Corps' regulatory program. Both H.R. 3080 and S. 601 aimed to streamline the Corps' regulatory program by eliminating the expiration of the authority allowing the agency to accept funds from nonfederal public entities to expedite permit processing for projects serving a public purpose. H.R. 3080 proposed expanding the eligibility of entities providing funds to include public-utility and natural gas companies, while S. 601 did not expand eligibility but required certain provisions. WRRDA 2014 (\u00a71006) expanded the authority for public-utility and natural gas companies to provide funds to the Corps for permit processing, with a seven-year expiration for these entities. The authority was extended indefinitely, with improvements in transparency and reporting required. Water Resource Authorizations, Appropriations, and Activities, by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed], highlights frustrations with the pace of Corps studies and construction due to congressional authorization and limitations on federal appropriations. Interest in nonfederal entities, including private interests, playing a greater role in project development, construction, and financing has grown. WRRDA 2014, like H.R. 3080 and S. 601, included provisions to encourage and manage nonfederal participation in project delivery, such as permitting, crediting, and reimbursing for nonfederal work, and establishing pilot programs for nonfederal management and financing. The conference report consolidated authorities for nonfederal leadership in water resources under two statutes. WRRDA 2014 provided a mechanism for nonfederal entities to start work on projects with completed feasibility studies. Nonfederal entities could receive credit or reimbursement if Congress authorizes the project. The report also required a 5-year pilot program for nonfederal management of studies and project construction. WRRDA 2014 included the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) for loans. The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) authorized a pilot program for loans and loan guarantees for flood damage reduction projects and water supply projects. The WIFIA concept is modeled after the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program. The conference report adopted the Senate's WIFIA provisions with some additions and modifications. The conference report expanded the types of projects eligible for WIFIA assistance to include flood damage reduction, hurricane and storm damage reduction, environmental restoration, and navigation improvements. It also included language giving state infrastructure financing authorities the first right to finance projects to address concerns about potential impacts on wastewater and drinking water State Revolving Fund programs. Additionally, the authorized funding for the pilot program was reduced from $250 million to $175 million total for each agency. The Congressional authorization is required for most Corps new construction projects, with WRRDA 2014 authorizing 34 projects totaling $25.65 billion. All authorized projects have completed Chief's Reports, but only 25 were formally submitted to Congress at the time of the conference report. Total funding for the pilot program was reduced from $250 million to $175 million for each agency. The ASA submitted 9 projects worth $3.73 billion to Congress, while 8 project cost modifications were authorized in the conference report. The Senate passed S. 601 with 19 construction projects totaling $10.8 billion, and H.R. 3080 would have authorized 23 new construction projects costing $13.0 billion. The House bill H.R. 3080 did not include construction authorization for projects completed after a specific hearing. The bill also included a provision to clarify that it would not expand the authorized purposes of a dam or reservoir. The Administration opposed provisions in bills H.R. 3080 and S. 601 that prioritized current uses of Corps projects over new uses. They supported legislation adding fish and wildlife protection as an authorized purpose for all Corps dams and allowing flexibility to revise project operating guidelines. The ASA was required to assess management practices and priorities of Corps reservoirs in arid regions to evaluate impacts on water supply during drought. The conference report required the ASA to assess impacts on water supply during drought and identify actions to increase project flexibility for mitigating drought impacts. WRRDA 2014 expanded the Corps' programmatic authorities known as Continuing Authorities Programs (CAPs) without specific congressional authorization. The WRRDA 2014 and H.R. 3080 required the Corps to solicit proposals from nonfederal entities for new studies and transmit qualifying studies to Congress. Congressional authorization was needed for the agency to proceed with the study. S. 601 would have established a process for initiating new studies, addressing projects with completed study milestones. The conference report did not authorize projects without completed Chief's Reports, requiring the ASA to submit feasibility reports and project modifications to Congress. The WRRDA 2014 and H.R. 3080 required Congressional authorization for the Corps to proceed with construction projects. Expedited procedures were established for bills authorizing projects meeting specific criteria, including a completed Chief's Report. Nonfederal entities could initiate work on projects with completed feasibility studies prior to Chief's Reports. The WRRDA 2014 and H.R. 3080 required Congressional authorization for construction projects. WRRDA 2014 authorized eight project cost modifications with ASA recommendation letters to Congress. H.R. 3080 and S. 601 proposed processes for project cost modifications, with unclear use of expedited procedures for modifications. The conference report (\u00a77004) is unclear on using project cost modifications traditionally documented in reports of the Director of Civil Works. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) covers costs for operating and maintaining federally authorized harbors, supported by a tax on cargo and cruise ship passengers. Annual HMTF expenditures require congressional appropriations typically as part of an Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act. The conference report sought to increase HMTF spending without affecting funding for other Corps activities. WRRDA 2014 expanded eligible uses of HMTF funds for dredging activities paid by nonfederal sponsors at ports with higher HMT revenue. The report also eliminated the 50% nonfederal cost share for maintaining harbors at depths between 45 and 50 feet, potentially increasing HMTF spending on harbors with high cargo volumes. The conference report addressed increasing HMTF spending on harbors handling large cargo volumes, prioritizing maintenance among ports, and allowing certain ports to use appropriated funds. It also modified provisions regarding federal maintenance of harbors and expanded eligible uses of HMTF funds. The conference report modified provisions to allow \"donor ports\" and \"energy transfer ports\" to use appropriated funds for rebating HMT payments to shippers or for dredging-related activities not a federal responsibility. Seattle and Tacoma, WA, could qualify as \"donor ports,\" while fourteen ports may qualify as \"energy transfer ports.\" A donor port generates more HMT than it receives, while an energy transfer port handles over 40 million tons of cargo with energy products comprising over 25% of the tonnage. The Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) is funded by user fees and pays for 50% of inland navigation infrastructure projects. The fund has a declining balance, limiting waterway construction projects. The Olmsted Locks and Dam project has received the majority of construction funds, with other projects postponed. The Olmsted project required an increase in authorization due to cost overruns. The FY2014 Continuing Appropriations Act increased the Olmsted project's authorization from $775 million to $2.92 billion. WRRDA 2014 altered the IWTF cost-share requirement for the project, reducing the required IWTF share of project costs from 50% to 15%. S. 601 and H.R. 3080 also proposed changes to the IWTF cost-sharing requirements. The Administration initially objected to changes in the cost-sharing formula for the Olmsted project but eventually agreed to them in the enacted legislation. The conference report raised the threshold for cost sharing for major rehabilitation investments on inland waterways from $8 million to $20 million, shifting more responsibility to the General Fund. WRRDA 2014 authorized changes to inland waterways project delivery, consistent with recommendations from the Inland Waterways User Board. The conference report authorized studies on inland waterways project revenues by GAO and ASA. H.R. 3080 and S. 601 had different approaches to flood risk management. The conference report included levee safety provisions similar to S. 601 but was scaled back in scope and authorization levels. WRRDA 2014 established a levee safety initiative with Corps technical assistance, training, and rehabilitation assistance at 65% federal cost share. It also included FEMA assistance for state and tribal levee safety programs. Similar to H.R. 3080 and S. 601, WRRDA 2014 required the Corps to develop national levee safety guidelines. The conference report provided a limited extension of federally cost-shared beach nourishment. The conference report in WRRDA 2014 included a more limited 3-year extension for federally cost-shared beach nourishment projects, as opposed to the 15 years authorized in S. 601. The ASA objected to this provision and recommended reevaluating projects instead of simply extending them. Additionally, the ASA did not support specific sections of S. 601 related to levee repair and rehabilitation. WRRDA 2014 included altered authorizations for levee repair and rehabilitation, allowing for repairs to be completed to the design level of protection or to address major deficiencies. The WRRDA 2014 authorized the Corps to rehabilitate existing hurricane and storm damage levees that provide reduced protection due to various factors. It also directed the ASA to ensure that activities under the Corps inspection program provide adequate information for levee accreditation decisions related to floodplain mapping. The Corps is involved in projects to restore aquatic ecosystems and control invasive species. Congress directs these actions through project-specific and programmatic provisions. WRRDA 2014 authorized new construction projects aimed at restoring aquatic resources. The conference report authorized new restoration projects for the Everglades and Coastal Louisiana, totaling $6.05 billion. WRRDA 2014 directed new studies for ecosystem restoration in specific locations, including Coastal Louisiana, the North Atlantic coast, and Chesapeake Bay. Additional congressional actions would be needed to authorize these projects. WRRDA 2014 authorized feasibility studies for ecosystem restoration projects in Louisiana and the North Atlantic coast. Congressional approval would be needed for new construction in these areas. WRRDA 2014 authorized an ocean and coastal ecosystem resiliency program, additional restoration studies in the Chesapeake Bay, and converted the Corps Chesapeake Bay watershed assistance authority into a program for various projects and activities. WRRDA 2014 authorized $10 million for a resiliency program and increased funding for oyster restoration in the Chesapeake Bay to $60 million. It also set criteria for prioritizing environmental restoration projects, focusing on public safety, national ecosystems, and federally protected species. Restoration efforts are a priority in the Administration's budget development process for the Corps, with provisions in WRRDA 2014 addressing invasive species. The legislation altered existing Corps invasive species authorities to control aquatic plant growths and invasive species, adding prevention to authorized activities. WRRDA 2014 increased appropriations for aquatic plant control and invasive species activities. It directed efforts to combat Asian carp in specific basins and water bodies, authorizing federal aid to state and local governments. Reporting requirements for Asian carp were also expanded. The WRRDA 2014 authorized watercraft inspection stations in the Columbia River Basin to prevent the spread of aquatic nuisance species. The Corps has a backlog of $62 billion in construction projects, with annual appropriations declining. There is no publicly available list of project authorizations, their status, and cost to complete. The deauthorization process for Corps projects has not significantly reduced the backlog. The ASA is directed to annually review projects under 33 U.S.C. 579a(b)(2). The ASA is directed to annually transmit a list of authorized projects with no funding obligations for the last five fiscal years. If funds are not used within a year of publication, projects are deauthorized. WRRDA 2014 required an interim deauthorization list for projects not funded for six years. The WRRDA 2014 requires the ASA to annually transmit a list of authorized projects with no funding obligations for the last five fiscal years. An interim deauthorization list is required for projects not funded for six years, with a final deauthorization list to be developed within 120 days after public comment, representing at least $18 billion in federal cost to complete. Projects on the final list will be automatically deauthorized after 180 days unless Congress passes a joint resolution disapproving the list. The existing annual deauthorization process will be maintained after enactment. The WRRDA 2014 requires the ASA to annually transmit a list of authorized projects with no funding obligations for the last five fiscal years. An interim deauthorization list is required for projects not funded for six years, with a final deauthorization list to be developed within 120 days after public comment, representing at least $18 billion in federal cost to complete. Projects on the final list will be automatically deauthorized after 180 days unless Congress passes a joint resolution disapproving the list. The existing annual deauthorization process will be maintained after enactment. S. 601 included a provision to amend the EPA's Oil Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure regulations, while H.R. 3080 did not. S. 601 would have amended the scope and applicability of the program, exempting certain farms from the regulations. The WRRDA 2014 included amendments to water infrastructure provisions of the Clean Water Act (CWA) from H.R. 1877. These amendments focused on CWA Title VI, authorizing grants for state loan programs for wastewater treatment projects. The effective date of these provisions was set for October 1, 2014. Some provisions, like extending loan repayment to 30 years, were not included in other legislative proposals. The WRRDA 2014 included amendments to water infrastructure provisions of the Clean Water Act (CWA) from H.R. 1877, focusing on CWA Title VI. These amendments expanded SRF-eligible projects, increased assistance to Indian tribes, and imposed \"Buy American\" requirements. However, long-standing issues like authorization of appropriations for capitalization grants and prevailing wage requirements were not addressed. The WRRDA 2014 included provisions authorizing the Corps to study projects in coastal zones for ecosystem resiliency. A provision added during House floor consideration aimed to prohibit programs from furthering implementation of Executive Order 13547 on coastal and marine spatial planning. The House debate focused on recommendations supporting a national ocean policy and coordination framework. The recommendations in the Task Force support a national ocean policy, coordination framework, and implementation strategy for ocean stewardship. The ASA's letter opposes a specific section of H.R. 3080, while S. 601 proposed establishing a National Endowment for the Oceans to support coastal management. This provision was similar to a previous proposal by the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended the establishment of an Ocean Policy Trust Fund funded by outer continental shelf oil and gas activities. Several bills have been introduced since 2004 to create an ocean trust fund or endowment, raising concerns about potential reductions in program appropriations and tax increases."
