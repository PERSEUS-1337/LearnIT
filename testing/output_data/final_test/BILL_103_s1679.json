    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Shoreline Erosion Control Demonstration Act of 1993\". Congress finds it essential to develop innovative technologies to prevent shoreline erosion due to the importance of coastal areas, deterioration of shorelines, harm to water quality and marine life, loss of recreational potential, financial losses to landowners, lack of assistance, and loss of historic structures. The purpose of this section is to establish a program for innovative technologies to combat shoreline erosion and prevent the loss of historic structures or landmarks. The National Shoreline Erosion Control Development and Demonstration Program is established to combat shoreline erosion and protect historic structures. The National Shoreline Erosion Control Development and Demonstration Program, established by the Secretary of the Army, aims to address erosion issues in sheltered waters through cost-effective shore protection measures for a period of 8 years. The National Shoreline Erosion Control Development and Demonstration Program, established by the Secretary of the Army, will run for 8 years. The program includes planning, designing, and constructing shoreline erosion control devices, monitoring prototypes, producing engineering and environmental reports, and transferring technology to private property owners and State/local entities. The National Shoreline Erosion Control Development and Demonstration Program, established by the Secretary of the Army, will emphasize innovative technologies, cost-effective shore protection, natural designs, avoidance of negative impacts to communities, preservation of aesthetic appeal in residential or commercial areas, long-term protection potential, and lessons from evaluations of the original 1974 program. The National Shoreline Erosion Control Development and Demonstration Program will focus on lessons from the original 1974 program, including subgrade consideration, proper filtration, durable components, unit connection, and additional relevant information. Shoreline erosion control projects will be conducted at publicly or privately owned sites on open coast or sheltered waters, with site selection criteria based on various geographical and climatic conditions. The National Shoreline Erosion Control Development and Demonstration Program will focus on projects at specific sites on various coastlines, including the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts, the Great Lakes, and the State of Alaska. Projects will consider factors such as population dependence on beaches, erosion rates, natural resources, and historic structures. Collaboration is essential for the success of these projects. The National Shoreline Erosion Control Development and Demonstration Program will collaborate with the Secretary of Agriculture, Federal, State, and local agencies, private organizations, the Coastal Engineering Research Center, and university research facilities to prevent and control shoreline erosion. Cooperation may involve agreements with other entities to carry out program functions. The Secretary will annually submit a program progress report to Congress on the national shoreline erosion control program, including recommendations for its continuation. Federal funding for projects will be determined according to specific guidelines. The cost and responsibility for operation and maintenance of projects under the program will be borne by non-Federal sponsors upon completion of construction. Cost share requirements may be adjusted for projects in sponsoring communities experiencing financial hardship. Section 1(e) of the Act of August 13, 1946 is amended to include \"sections 3 and 5\"."
