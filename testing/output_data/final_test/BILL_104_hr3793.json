    "content": "The Act is titled the \"50 States Commemorative Coin Program Act\". The Congress finds it appropriate to honor the 50 States of the United States and promote knowledge about their history and geography. The circulating coinage has not been modernized in 25 years. A 25-cent coin program could generate earnings of $110,000,000 over 10 years and indirect earnings of $3,400,000,000 to the Treasury, reducing the need for borrowing to fund the national debt. A commemorative circulating coin program could reduce the need for borrowing to fund the national debt by encouraging the collection of State-themed coins at face value. The redesigned quarter dollars will be issued over a 10-year period to commemorate each of the 50 states. Section 5112 of title 31, United States Code, is amended to include a new subsection for the redesign and issuance of quarter dollar coins commemorating each of the 50 states over a 10-year period starting from January 1, 1997. Each coin will feature a design emblematic of a single state, with five states being commemorated each year. The redesign and issuance of quarter dollar coins commemorating each of the 50 states over a 10-year period starting from January 1, 1997. Each coin will feature a design emblematic of a single state, with five states being commemorated each year. The dollar coins issued during each year shall be emblematic of 5 States which have not previously been commemorated during such period. The Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe the number of quarter dollars issued with each of the 5 designs selected for each year. Each of the 50 designs required for quarter dollars shall be selected by the Secretary after consultation. The Secretary, in consultation with state officials and the Commission of Fine Arts, selects designs for quarter dollar coins commemorating each state. The Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee reviews the designs. All coins minted under this program are considered numismatic items. The Secretary may mint and issue quarter dollars in uncirculated and proof qualities as deemed appropriate. The Secretary may mint and issue quarter dollars with 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper, sourced only from stockpiles established under a specific act. The coins will be sold at a price covering face value, design, and issuance costs. The Secretary of the Treasury may issue quarter dollar coins with designs emblematic of newly admitted states during a 10-year period, in addition to regular quarter dollar coins. SEC. 4.
