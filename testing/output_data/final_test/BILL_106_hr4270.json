The Act \"Advanced Technology Motor Vehicle Fuel Economy Act of 2000\" introduces a credit for hybrid vehicles under section 30B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The credit allows for an amount equal to the sum of credit amounts for each qualified hybrid vehicle placed in service during the taxable year. The credit amount is based on the rechargeable energy storage system's power. The Act \"Advanced Technology Motor Vehicle Fuel Economy Act of 2000\" introduces a credit for hybrid vehicles under section 30B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The credit amount varies based on the applicable percentage, ranging from $500 to $2,000. An additional increase in credit amount is provided for qualified hybrid vehicles with regenerative braking systems. The credit amount for qualified hybrid vehicles ranges from $250 to $1,000 based on the applicable percentage. A qualified hybrid vehicle is defined as an automobile that can draw energy from consumable fuel and a rechargeable energy storage system. The tax credit for qualified hybrid vehicles ranges from $250 to $1,000 based on the applicable percentage. An automobile is considered a qualified hybrid vehicle if it can draw energy from consumable fuel and a rechargeable energy storage system. The credit allowed for any taxable year is subject to certain limitations and does not exceed the excess of the regular tax reduced by other credits over the tentative minimum tax. The tax credit for qualified hybrid vehicles ranges from $250 to $1,000 based on the applicable percentage. The credit allowed for any taxable year is subject to limitations and does not exceed the excess of the regular tax reduced by other credits over the tentative minimum tax. Special rules include basis reduction, recapture, and restrictions on property eligibility for the credit. The tax credit for qualified hybrid vehicles ranges from $250 to $1,000 based on the applicable percentage. No credit is allowed if the taxpayer elects not to apply this section to the vehicle. Regulations will be prescribed by the Secretary and the Environmental Protection Agency for testing and calculation procedures. The section outlines calculation procedures for determining vehicle eligibility for a tax credit. It applies to qualified hybrid vehicles placed in service between December 31, 1999, and January 1, 2009. Conforming amendments are made to section 1016 of the Code. The text discusses the extension of the credit for qualified electric vehicles until December 31, 2008, and the repeal of phaseout limitations. The amendments apply to vehicles placed in service after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, there is a study on energy conservation regarding motor vehicles and transportation in the United States. Subtitle G of title I of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to include a new section on a transportation energy conservation study. The Secretary of Transportation, in collaboration with the Secretary of Energy, is required to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on energy conservation in transportation. This study will analyze voluntary, mandatory, and other approaches used by the private and public sectors for conserving energy in interstate commerce, as well as the provision of services by motor vehicles and other modes of transportation. The study will also evaluate the effectiveness, costs, and impact on mobility of current and potential energy conservation measures. The study on energy conservation in transportation will consider factors like energy supplies, availability of transportation, population size, and impact of technologies. It will also compare energy conservation approaches in other developed countries. The study will include an overview of the US energy supply situation and projected fuel supplies. The study on energy conservation in transportation will assess current and projected fuel supplies, their impact on national security and trade, energy use in various sectors, and the effectiveness of past and current conservation programs and policies in the United States. This includes regulatory requirements, fuel economy mandates, authority over transportation regulation, gas guzzler tax, and alternative fuel vehicles. The study on energy conservation in transportation will cover various aspects such as alternative fuel vehicles, tax credits for electric vehicles, fiscal measures, fuel economy labeling, integration of transportation and land use planning, speed limits, carpooling requirements, incentives for mass transit, and congestion mitigation measures. The assessment includes regulatory measures, fiscal measures, higher fuel taxes, vehicle taxation by engine size, tolls, alternative fuel vehicles, and voluntary commitments in economically developed countries and integrated economic regions. The curr_chunk discusses potential future approaches to motor vehicle and transportation energy conservation efforts in the United States, including voluntary commitments, gas rationing, monitoring, and fuel economy programs. It also mentions voluntary approaches by industry, incentives for market penetration, and cooperative government/industry arrangements. The curr_chunk discusses identifying potential approaches for energy conservation in transportation, including advanced technologies, alternative fuels, congestion mitigation, intelligent transportation systems, and other potential approaches. The study will assess marketability, risks, benefits, practicability, acceptability, and costs of these approaches, as well as any legal or market barriers to their introduction. The curr_chunk discusses the effects of current conservation policies on personal mobility and the US economy, as well as the need for future energy conservation measures for motor vehicles. It also includes conclusions on the effectiveness of transportation policies in fostering energy conservation. The Secretary of Transportation will submit a report to Congress within 18 months of this Act, detailing the study results, recommendations, estimated costs, and benefits of conservation measures for motor vehicles and potential future approaches and policies. The Secretary of Transportation will submit a report to Congress within 18 months of this Act regarding a study on lean burn technology. The Secretary of Transportation, in collaboration with the Secretary of Energy, will conduct a study on lean burn technology within 60 days of the Act's enactment. The study will assess the benefits and barriers of implementing lean burn technology for increased fuel efficiency, including its impact on fuel consumption and cost effectiveness as a transition to advanced fuel economy technologies. The study on lean burn technology will assess emissions control, fuel compatibility, conflicts with emissions limits, and barriers to implementation such as cost, public awareness, and regulations. Recommendations will be made to address these barriers and implement new technologies. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 12 months of the enactment of the Act, detailing the results of the study on lean burn technology, including recommendations on implementing new technologies with minimal disruption to the economy and the cost of increasing fuel efficiency. Extension of credits for flexible fuel vehicles. The purpose of this section is to extend manufacturing incentives for dual fuel vehicles from 2004 to 2008 model years and increase fuel economy. Amendments include extending model years in the United States Code and setting a deadline for the Secretary. The amendments extend manufacturing incentives for dual fuel vehicles to model years 2008 and increase fuel economy. Deadlines for compliance are also updated in the United States Code."
