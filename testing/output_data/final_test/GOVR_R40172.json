President Obama signed bills in December 2010 related to fisheries, including extending trust fund expenditures and authorizing a fisheries cooperative for Pacific cod. The Senate and House passed related bills, with provisions for Coast Guard and NOAA to identify areas for oil spill risk reduction. President Obama signed bills in December 2010 related to fisheries, including extending trust fund expenditures and authorizing a fisheries cooperative for Pacific cod. The bills aimed to reduce the risk of oil spills, improve ocean ecosystems, and combat illegal fishing. Additionally, a provision was added to the Lacey Act to prohibit the importation or interstate shipment of bighead carp. On December 14, 2010, the House passed bills authorizing a fisheries cooperative for Pacific cod. On December 10, 2010, the Senate Committee reported a research program for the recovery of the southern sea otter. On December 8, 2010, the House passed food safety legislation including updates for fish and fisheries products guidance. Increasing use of coastal and marine resources is driving proposals for Congress and the Administration to alter current relationships between environmental protection and sustainable resource management. Recent reports highlight declines in marine resources and shortcomings in resource protection and management approaches in federal and state waters. Concerns also arise from economic activity in coastal areas leading to habitat loss or alteration. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA) and the Marine Mammal Protection Act are key legislation that Congress must balance with economic, political, and social interests to promote sustainable management of marine resources. Coastal states historically managed fisheries, but improved fishing techniques have led to offshore ventures. Funding authorization for these acts has expired, requiring reauthorization to address declines in marine resources and habitat loss from economic activities in coastal areas. Before 1950, the federal government had limited involvement in marine fisheries, focusing on international fishery concerns and treaties. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Latin American nations extended marine jurisdictions, leading to conflicts with distant-water fishing nations. Foreign fishing vessels started entering U.S. offshore waters in the 1950s and 1960s to exploit seafood resources. Foreign vessels entered U.S. offshore waters to exploit seafood resources, leading to concerns of overfishing and depletion of fish stocks. The enactment of the Fishery Conservation and Management Act (FCMA) in response to international negotiations ushered in a new era of fisheries management. The Fishery Conservation and Management Act (FCMA) was signed into law in 1976, bringing federal marine fishery management under the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). The Act established a 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and created eight Regional Fishery Management Councils to allocate fishing rights. Eight Regional Fishery Management Councils were established by the FCMA, with members appointed by the Secretary of Commerce from lists provided by coastal state governors. These councils develop fishery management plans for fisheries requiring federal management, which are then submitted for approval. Approved plans are implemented through regulations. Currently, 40 FMPs have been developed for various fish and shellfish resources, with 9 more in progress. Plans can be created for individual species or larger species assemblages. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 reauthorized the MSFCMA, with the authorization of appropriations expiring in FY2013. State management of marine fisheries occurs within 3 miles of the coast, while federal management extends from 3 to 200 miles offshore. Interstate coordination is facilitated through regional interstate marine fishery commissions. Under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the federal government manages fish resources up to 200 miles offshore. Initially, foreign fishing fleets were allocated a significant portion of the catch from federal waters, but amendments have reduced foreign catch allocations. As a result, domestic offshore catch in federal waters has increased significantly since 1977. The commercial landings of edible fish and shellfish in federal EEZ waters increased significantly from 1977 to 1986-1988, reaching a peak of over 6.3 billion pounds. In 2009, U.S. commercial fishermen landed slightly more than 6.0 billion pounds of seafood, valued at $3.7 billion. Imports supplied 5.2 billion pounds, worth $13.1 billion. U.S. consumers spent $75.5 billion on seafood in 2009, with recreational anglers catching an estimated 391 million fish. In 2009, U.S. commercial fishermen landed over 6.0 billion pounds of seafood, valued at $3.7 billion. NMFS reports on fish stocks annually, with 15% subject to overfishing and 23% overfished. The Fish Stock Sustainability Index (FSSI) increased from 481.5 to 580.5 between 2005 and 2010. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA) was reauthorized in 2006 to address key issues such as ending overfishing by 2011, rebuilding depleted fisheries, considering economic and social impacts in fishery management, improving data collection, protecting deep sea corals, and promoting ecosystem-based management. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA) was reauthorized in 2006 to address key issues such as ending overfishing by 2011, rebuilding depleted fisheries, considering economic and social impacts in fishery management, improving data collection, protecting deep sea corals, and promoting ecosystem-based management. NMFS has implemented various tasks related to promoting new gear technologies, establishing national guidelines for fishing quota programs, modifying fishery management plan procedures, and strengthening the role of science in decision-making. NMFS has also reported to Congress on controlling illegal fishing activities and issued guidance to end overfishing by implementing new requirements for catch limits and accountability measures. P.L. 109-479, 111-281, 111-335, and 111-348 amended the American Fisheries Act and MSFCMA to address various issues such as vessel rebuilding, shark finning prohibition, and extending stock rebuilding deadlines. A fisheries cooperative was authorized for the Bering Sea Aleutian Islands longline catcher processor subsector. A hearing was held on MSFCMA implementation by the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Insular Affairs, Oceans, and Wildlife. The House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Insular Affairs, Oceans, and Wildlife held hearings on catch shares as a fishery management option and from a community perspective.

Management of steelhead trout and salmon is complex due to their migration across state and national boundaries. Threats to salmon populations include hydropower dams, harvests, habitat modification, and hatcheries. Endangered species listings have been made in response to declining populations. A settlement agreement in 2006 aimed to improve river channels and sustain Chinook salmon populations. The United States and Canada negotiated a bilateral agreement in 1985 to address concerns about Pacific salmon management. A new accord was reached in 1999 to adjust cooperative management of these fish. Annex IV of the agreement outlines fishery regimes for managing anadromous Pacific salmon and steelhead trout. The agreement was renegotiated in 2009 and includes provisions for sustaining Chinook salmon populations. In 2009, legislation was passed to reintroduce Chinook salmon in the San Joaquin River.

Various bills were introduced to address issues related to genetically engineered fish, fish hatchery programs, and marine mammal protection. The Marine Mammal Protection Act was enacted in 1972 due to high dolphin mortality in the tuna purse-seine fishery. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) is seen as scientifically beneficial despite criticism. It has led to research advancements, increased understanding of marine life, and reduced incidental bycatch mortalities. The MMPA established a moratorium on taking marine mammals in U.S. waters and by U.S. nationals on the high seas, as well as importing marine mammals and their products into the United States. It protects marine mammals from harmful human actions and allows permits for certain purposes like scientific research. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) allows permits for the \"taking\" of marine mammals for specific purposes like scientific research and public display. The Secretary of Commerce, through NMFS, manages whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, and sea lions, while the Secretary of the Interior, through FWS, oversees walruses, otters, polar bears, manatees, and dugongs. The MMPA established the Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) to ensure compliance with the Act. Prior to the MMPA, states were responsible for marine mammal management. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) shifted marine mammal management authority to the federal government, allowing permits for taking marine mammals for specific purposes. The Act also allows states to regain management authority if they adopt conservation programs consistent with MMPA goals. Permits can be issued for scientific research or species recovery, and U.S. citizens can apply for authorization to take small numbers of mammals incidental to activities like offshore oil exploration, with minimal impact on marine mammal species. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) allows permits for taking marine mammals for specific purposes, such as scientific research or species recovery. The Act also authorizes the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations, with monitoring requirements and conditions to minimize impact. Native Americans in Alaska are exempt from the MMPA moratorium on taking for subsistence or creating authentic Native articles. Commercial fish harvesters were exempt from rulemaking and permit requirements until FY1993 for incidental taking of marine mammals. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) allows permits for taking marine mammals for specific purposes, such as scientific research or species recovery. Commercial fish harvesters were exempt from rulemaking and permit requirements until FY1993 for incidental taking of marine mammals. The eastern tropical Pacific tuna fishery was excluded from the incidental take regimes enacted in 1988 and 1994, governed by separate provisions of the MMPA. Amendments in 1997 by P.L. 105-42 focused on the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act. Section 319 of P.L. 108-136 provided a broad exemption for \"national defense\" activities and amended the definition of \"harassment\" of marine mammals for military readiness activities. The Navy's use of mid-frequency sonar and its effects on marine mammals were also addressed. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) was reauthorized in 1994, allowing for the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations. The 1994 amendments also focused on assessing marine mammal stocks, developing take-reduction plans, and studying pinniped-fishery interactions. A 2008 study by the Government Accountability Office found limitations in information available for accurately determining which marine mammal stocks meet statutory requirements for establishing take. NMFS lacks data for 39 marine mammal stocks to determine their strategic status under MMPA. Data limitations exist for the remaining 74 stocks, with NMFS citing funding constraints. Take reduction teams have not been established for 14 stocks interacting significantly with commercial fisheries. In the 111th Congress, a hearing was held on marine mammals in captivity and public education, with no bills introduced. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced to amend the MMPA, including allowing imports of polar bear trophies and prohibiting oil and gas exploration without MMPA compliance. Several bills in the 111th Congress aimed to amend the MMPA, including promoting coastal jobs creation and reauthorizing the John H. Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Grant Program. The House passed H.R. 844 to amend MMPA provisions, while H.R. 843 sought to repeal the long-term goal of reducing incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals to zero. Several bills in the 111th Congress aimed to amend the MMPA, including promoting coastal jobs creation and reauthorizing the John H. Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Grant Program. H.R. 1108 would establish regional OCS Joint Permitting Offices for MMPA consultations. H.R. 6394 would allow transport, purchase, sale, and export of pelts of Alaska sea otters.

Additionally, resolutions H.Res. 1420, S.Res. 84, and H.Res. 1314 urged for stronger protections for the polar bear and to halt the commercial seal hunt. The Obama Administration's FY2011 budget request included $973 million for NMFS, with a proposed decrease in total funding primarily due to a reduction in the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund. The House Natural Resources Subcommittee held an oversight hearing on NOAA's budget request. The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard held an oversight hearing on NOAA's FY2011 budget request, recommending about $909 million for NMFS within NOAA's OR&F Account.
