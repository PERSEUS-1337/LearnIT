    "content": "The House of Representatives' \"discharge rule\" (Rule XV, clause 2) allows a majority of Members to bring a measure to the floor for consideration if it has not been reported from committee. A Member can file a discharge petition on the measure or a special rule to extract it from committee. If a majority signs the petition, the House can schedule a motion to discharge the committee and consider the measure. This rule was first adopted in its current form in 1931. The House adopted the discharge rule in 1931, allowing Members to bring a measure to the floor if not reported from committee. From 1931 to 2002, 563 discharge petitions were filed, but only 26 motions were adopted. Additional measures reached the floor through other procedures, such as special rules from the Committee on Rules. The data presented here only covers the period since 1931. The discharge rule was established in 1931, allowing Members to bring a measure to the floor if not reported from committee. Changes to the rule include the establishment of three discharge forms and requirements for offering a motion on the floor. The rule has seen alterations, such as increasing the signatures required on a petition and eliminating provisions preventing debate on special rules in 1991. The discharge rule, established in 1931, allows Members to bring a measure to the floor if not reported from committee. Changes to the rule include the establishment of three discharge forms and requirements for offering a motion on the floor. Alterations have included increasing the signatures required on a petition and eliminating provisions preventing debate on special rules in 1991. Data presented covers overall use of the discharge procedure in Congress from 1931-2002, including the number of signatures on petitions and actions taken on measures where discharge petitions were filed. The data includes the number of discharge petitions filed, categorized by the method used, success rates in obtaining signatures, floor consideration, and passage of measures. The information covers actions under the discharge procedure and other procedures, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of legislative outcomes. Data on the number of Members signing each discharge petition is available from the 103rd Congress onwards, with no information available for earlier years. Summaries of action on individual measures date back to 1967. The data includes the number of discharge petitions filed, categorized by method used, success rates in obtaining signatures, floor consideration, and passage of measures. Summaries of action on individual measures begin in 1967, covering the period when the Committee on Rules managed the floor agenda. Table 1 shows the frequency of discharge attempts by House Members, which fluctuated over time. The use of discharge petitions remained common from 1931 to 1950, with more than 20 petitions typically filed in each Congress. Since the 72nd through 82nd Congresses, the number of discharge petitions filed declined sharply from more than 20 to no more than seven in the 84th through 90th Congresses. This decrease coincided with the Committee on Rules transitioning into a leadership organ. Since around 1970, the number of discharge petitions has stabilized at intermediate levels, with 10 to 15 petitions filed in most Congresses. The number of discharge petitions filed in Congress has remained stable since the 1970s, despite fluctuations in party majorities. The procedure saw high use in the 97th Congress by the minority party, but declined in the 100th through 102nd Congresses. A rule change in the 103rd Congress briefly increased petition signatures, but levels returned to normal afterwards. The 1931 rule established three forms for initiating discharge action, allowing consideration of measures unlikely to be acted on by the committee of referral. The 1931 rule established three forms for initiating discharge action, allowing consideration of measures unlikely to be acted on by the committee of referral. Proponents can draft a special rule with terms for amending the measure. A discharge petition filed on a special rule can still proceed even if the committee reports the measure. However, many Members have not utilized this method of discharge, as shown in data since 1931. Discharge of special rules for unreported measures re-emerged as a common form in the 98th Congress (1985-1986) and has continued since then. From the 104th Congress (1994-1995) onwards, this form of discharge attempt has been the most common. Another method of discharge involves bringing to the floor a measure that the committee has reported but has not been scheduled for action by the leadership and Committee on Rules. This method was most common during the period of \"conservative coalition\" control of the Committee on Rules (roughly 1937-1960). The discharge of special rules for unreported measures became common in the 98th Congress and has continued since. This method was most common during the period of \"conservative coalition\" control of the Committee on Rules. In recent years, the discharge attempt on special rules for unreported measures has been the most common. In the 103rd Congress, the names of Members signing a discharge petition were confidential until the required number of Members signed. The names were then printed in the Congressional Record. Names of signers are now also printed weekly in the Record and available through the Office of the Clerk. The Record lists discharge petitions by measure numbers, allowing the number of signers to be tracked from the 103rd to 107th Congress. The table lists discharge petitions from the 103rd to 107th Congress, showing the number of signatures, special rules proposed, and underlying measure subjects. It also includes the filing date and notes any withdrawals of signatures. The data reveals the levels of support for these petitions. The data from Table 2 shows distinct groupings in the levels of support discharge petitions receive. A first grouping includes four petitions that gained more signatures than the minority party's strength, with three reaching the full 218 signatures. A second grouping consists of 36 petitions signed by various members. During the 106th and 107th Congresses, most petitions had support from fewer Members than the minority party but more than half that number. Only two petitions received 60-95 signatures, while thirteen received 30-60 signatures. The party affiliation of signers is not always clear for these petitions. The third grouping of petitions represents a significant segment of the House, often viewed as factional discharge efforts. A fourth grouping consists of petitions with three signatures or fewer, seen as individualistic discharge efforts. The remaining petitions obtained between seven and 30 signatures, some of which may also be considered factional discharge efforts. The success of a discharge effort is measured by whether the petition attains the 218 signatures required to offer the discharge motion. The ultimate goal of a discharge petition is to secure floor consideration for a measure in question and potentially see it passed into law. The success of discharge efforts can be assessed by whether the discharge motion is agreed to by the House or if it prompts the House to take up the measure through other procedures. Tables 3 through 5 provide data on the success of discharge efforts in achieving these objectives. Since 1947, only a few petitions in the same Congress have received the 218 signatures needed for entry on the discharge calendar. The petition entered on the campaign finance reform bill in the 107th Congress was the first since the Republicans obtained the majority in the House in the 104th Congress. Between 1939 and 1972, when a discharge petition was entered, the motion was almost always offered on the floor and approved, enabling supporters to secure floor consideration for their measure. Since 1947, only a few petitions in the same Congress have received the 218 signatures needed for entry on the discharge calendar. Before and after that period, entry of a petition did not guarantee that a discharge motion would ever actually be offered on the floor. Committees, leadership, and the Committee on Rules often used various tactics to prevent further proceedings under the discharge rule. Proponents of the discharge effort may bring about consideration of legislation, but not necessarily their preferred measure or on their own terms. Between 1969 and 1994, measures reaching the floor through discharge were often proposed constitutional amendments, which may have majority support for discharge but lack the two-thirds support for adoption. Examples include the Equal Rights Amendment in the 91st Congress and the Balanced Budget Amendment in the 97th Congress. The discharge process in Congress has led to only two measures becoming law: a federal pay act in the 86th Congress and the Wages and Hours Act in the 75th Congress. Strong opposition often blocks consideration of measures under regular procedures, and changes in rules have been adopted in the 78th and 103rd Congresses. When a discharge petition obtains 218 signatures, supporters are almost guaranteed an opportunity to bring the measure to the floor. The discharge process in Congress has resulted in only two measures becoming law historically. When a discharge petition receives 218 signatures, supporters are almost guaranteed an opportunity to bring the measure to the floor. However, sometimes action occurs under other procedures to preempt the discharge rule's opportunity. Measures rarely receive floor action under other procedures after a discharge petition is entered, with the most recent example being campaign finance reform in the 107th Congress. Since 1979, alternative actions after a discharge petition has been entered usually involve House floor consideration of an alternative special rule or measure on the same subject. Supporters of discharge have sometimes prevented these alternative actions from halting further proceedings. Since 1979, alternative actions after a discharge petition has been entered usually involve House floor consideration of an alternative special rule or measure on the same subject. Discharge supporters have not allowed these alternative actions to stop further proceedings. For example, in the 102nd and 103rd Congresses, supporters arranged for the committee to be discharged and the measure to be considered by unanimous consent. About half of the measures considered under such circumstances proceeded to final approval, a proportion between that for measures considered pursuant to discharge and those considered under alternative procedures after a petition was entered. Since 1979, alternative actions after a discharge petition has been entered usually involve House floor consideration of an alternative special rule or measure on the same subject. Discharge supporters have not allowed these alternative actions to stop further proceedings. In Table 4, action on measures with petitions pending was common before the mid-1960s and then disappeared until the 1980s. The alternative action in these cases may represent attempts to preempt a discharge effort perceived as likely to succeed. For petitions with few signers, the force of discharge as a threat is minimal, and the alternative action may have occurred in the normal course of committee and leadership activity. Some discharge efforts may have happened because supporters underestimated success through normal procedures. Table 5 shows action under other related procedures. Table 5 summarizes action related to discharge efforts from 1931 to 2002. It combines data from the discharge rule itself and other procedures. Overall, 67 out of 563 measures with discharge petitions were considered. In 2002, 67 out of 563 measures with discharge petitions were considered in the House, with some receiving action for reasons unrelated to the filing of the discharge petition. Supporters believed discharge action was necessary for measures unlikely to reach the floor, and attempting discharge would enhance their prospects. Table 8 provides specific information on individual measures where discharge was attempted and action occurred beyond the committee stage. The data in Table 8 covers the period from 1967 to 2002, showing 221 discharge efforts with 24 resulting in House floor consideration. 11 measures were reported but not taken up for consideration. During the period from 1967 to 2002, there were 221 discharge efforts, with 24 resulting in House floor consideration. Out of the 33 measures discussed, nine were reported after petitions were filed on the measures themselves, eight of which received floor consideration. Thirteen measures were reported after petitions were filed on special rules for their consideration, with nine receiving floor consideration. Eleven measures had already been reported before petitions were filed. During the period from 1967 to 2002, there were 221 discharge efforts, with 24 resulting in House floor consideration. Out of the 33 measures discussed, eleven were reported before petitions were filed on special rules for their consideration. Only four of these received floor consideration, making up 36% of the 11 reported measures. The 33 measures were distributed among various courses of events, with some reaching the floor through discharge procedures and others through different procedures. In some cases, discharge petitions remained pending, and the measures were reported but never considered. During the period from 1967 to 2002, there were 221 discharge efforts, with 24 resulting in House floor consideration. Out of the 33 measures discussed, eleven were reported before petitions were filed on special rules for their consideration. Only four of these received floor consideration, making up 36% of the 11 reported measures. The distribution of measures among different courses of events showed that discharge attempts under various procedures did not evenly result in floor consideration. Measures filed on special rules for considering measures had higher success rates compared to those filed directly on unreported measures. During the period from 1967 to 2002, there were 221 discharge efforts, with 24 resulting in House floor consideration. The success rates varied depending on the procedure used, with measures filed on special rules for considering measures having higher success rates compared to those filed directly on unreported measures. The Committee on Rules responded more vigorously to challenges to its control of the floor agenda, leading to an increase in measures reaching the floor under alternative procedures. During the period from 1967 to 2002, there were 221 discharge efforts, with 24 resulting in House floor consideration. The success rates varied depending on the procedure used, with measures filed on special rules having higher success rates. The Committee on Rules responded more vigorously to challenges, leading to an increase in measures reaching the floor under alternative procedures. The 11 measures reported but not considered on the floor were unequally distributed among discharge forms, with some filed before petitions and others after to counter discharge attempts. During the period from 1967 to 2002, there were 221 discharge efforts, with 24 resulting in House floor consideration. The success rates varied depending on the procedure used, with measures filed on special rules having higher success rates. Of the 12 measures on which a petition was entered, the House passed only six, with all rejected measures being constitutional amendments requiring a two-thirds vote for passage. Only six of the 12 measures were considered under the discharge procedure itself. During the period from 1967 to 2002, there were 221 discharge efforts, with 24 resulting in House floor consideration. The success rates varied depending on the procedure used, with measures filed on special rules having higher success rates. Of the 12 measures on which a petition was entered, the House passed only six, with all rejected measures being constitutional amendments requiring a two-thirds vote for passage. The House adopted an amendment of its rules to make signatures public. Out of 16 measures considered under other procedures, three constitutional amendments were defeated. The House passed 13 measures, with ten becoming law. When a discharge effort succeeded in bringing a measure to the floor, the House's likelihood of passing it was excellent. Table 8 provides details on discharge attempts in the House, including the number of signatures on petitions, committee referrals, floor actions, and final status of measures. It also indicates success rates and key events in floor action. Table 8 details discharge petition filings in the House, including the type of measures, filing dates, resolution numbers, and signature requirements. It notes when petitions reach the 218 signature threshold for a motion to discharge and the subsequent process on the special discharge calendar. After a discharge motion is entered, the House may accept a unanimous consent request to consider the measure at a specific time. If a petition fails to obtain 218 signatures, no discharge motion can be offered on the floor. Table 8 reports actions under the discharge rule and other procedures separately, noting if the measure was reported from committee, taken up on the floor, and passed. The table records actions under the discharge rule and other procedures separately, including if the measure was reported from committee, taken up on the floor, and passed or rejected. Floor action may occur on a different measure on the same subject due to various reasons. Table 8 identifies cases where actions were taken to preempt consideration of a measure on which a discharge petition was filed. It notes the numbers of alternative measures and special rules used in these cases. Occasionally, a discharge petition is filed on a special rule for considering a measure after it has already received some floor consideration. The table also distinguishes actions taken on a measure before a discharge petition was filed with an asterisk. Table 8 highlights instances where actions were taken to prevent the consideration of a measure for which a discharge petition was filed. It indicates the use of alternative measures and special rules in these cases. A discharge attempt can bring a measure to the floor, but it may still fail to become law. The table shows whether a measure succeeded or failed in the legislative process, noting the last stage it reached if it did not receive final approval. This information reveals the outcome of the discharge effort or other factors influencing the measure's fate. Table 8 provides dates for legislative actions related to discharge petitions, showing intervals between referral, filing, obtaining signatures, and floor action. These intervals indicate the urgency and support for a measure, as well as the likelihood of success in the legislative process. The discharge petition and floor action on a measure can indicate attempts to supersede or forestall action. This information helps gauge the effectiveness of the discharge procedure in prompting responsive action. For example, if a discharge petition is filed but before the motion can be offered, the committee or Committee on Rules reports the measure."
