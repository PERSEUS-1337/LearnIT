This includes the establishment of a Drug Price Reporting and Drug Value Fund. The \"Fair Accountability and Innovative Research Drug Pricing Act of 2017\" defines terms like 'manufacturer' and 'qualifying drug' based on drug approval and pricing criteria. The \"Fair Accountability and Innovative Research Drug Pricing Act of 2017\" specifies criteria for a drug to be considered a qualifying drug, including not being designated as a drug for a rare disease, not designated as a vaccine, and having at least $1 of sales for Medicare enrollees in the previous year. The \"Fair Accountability and Innovative Research Drug Pricing Act of 2017\" requires manufacturers of qualifying drugs to report any price increases that exceed 10% over a 12-month period or 25% over a 36-month period to the Secretary. The term 'wholesale acquisition cost' is defined in section 1847A(c)(6)(B) of the Social Security Act. The \"Fair Accountability and Innovative Research Drug Pricing Act of 2017\" mandates manufacturers to report price increases exceeding 10% over 12 months or 25% over 36 months to the Secretary. Reports must be submitted 30 days before the planned price hike, including details like the percentage increase, justification for past increases, and the drug's initial developer. The \"Fair Accountability and Innovative Research Drug Pricing Act of 2017\" requires manufacturers to report price increases exceeding certain thresholds to the Secretary, including details like the initial developer of the drug, price history, current list price, total expenditures on materials and manufacturing, patents, and licensing. The manufacturer must report the percentage of total expenditures on research and development for the drug derived from Federal funds, as well as the total expenditures on various research activities such as basic and preclinical research, clinical research, new drug development, pursuing new indications, and postmarket requirements.

Additionally, they must disclose the total revenue and net profit of the manufacturer for specific time periods. The manufacturer must report stock-based performance metrics for executive compensation, additional information on drug pricing decisions including research and development expenditures, and other related information as deemed appropriate by the Secretary. Any manufacturer of a qualifying drug that fails to submit a required report may face a civil penalty of $100,000 per day of violation. The Secretary must post the submitted reports on the Department of Health and Human Services website within 30 days, ensuring they are user-friendly and written in plain language for public understanding.
