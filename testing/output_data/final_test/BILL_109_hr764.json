    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that the Westchester County Grand Jury report highlighted essential principles for child services programs, emphasizing the best interest of the child, continuity in case supervision, and identifying high-risk cases. It also noted the lack of a direct way for New York to report child abuse history to other states, posing a risk to children. In 2002, 896,000 children were victims of abuse or neglect, with 1,400 deaths reported. The rate of victimization decreased from 13.4 to 12.3 per 1,000 children. States struggle to prevent abuse recurrence due to difficulties in identifying abusers. A national register for child abuse cases is necessary to protect children at risk. Child abusers should be easily identifiable for child protective services like criminals in different states. Some states have child maltreatment registries to protect children from abusers but are prohibited from sharing data with other states. The National Register of Cases of Child Abuse or Neglect is established to help child protective services identify abusers across different states. The Attorney General will establish a national register of child abuse or neglect cases, with information provided by States or political subdivisions. The register will collect data on abused or neglected children in a central electronic database based on substantiated reports. Each State or political subdivision will determine the information to be provided. The Attorney General will establish a national register of child abuse or neglect cases, with information provided by States or political subdivisions. The information provided to the Attorney General shall also relate to reports of suspected instances of child abuse or neglect that were unsubstantiated or determined to be unfounded. If a State has an equivalent electronic register of cases of child abuse or neglect, the information provided to the Attorney General shall be coextensive with that register and in a standardized electronic form. Under this section, information must be in a standardized electronic form determined by the Attorney General and contain case-specific identifying information. The confidentiality of identifying information regarding individuals reporting child abuse or neglect can be maintained. This section does not require states to modify existing registers or records related to child abuse or neglect. The Attorney General will establish standards for disseminating information in the national register of child abuse or neglect cases to protect confidentiality while allowing government entities access. Compliance with these standards is required to receive funds under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act."
