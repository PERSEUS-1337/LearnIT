    "content": "The Mercosur countries are experiencing strong economic growth after a deep recession caused by financial crises in Brazil and Argentina. They have competitive exchange rates, stable macroeconomic conditions, and strong export growth due to the global commodity price boom. However, rising oil prices have offset some gains for net oil importers, contributing to deteriorating current account balances. Brazil dominates trade within Mercosur, running a sizable trade surplus. Mercosur has a well-diversified trade relationship with the EU, Asia, and the United States. The Mercosur countries, including Brazil, have a well-diversified trade relationship with the EU, Asia, and the United States. Brazil is the largest economy in South America and dominates trade within Mercosur. The United States is the third-largest trade partner, with recent addition of Venezuela increasing their share to 3.6% of total U.S. trade, mainly due to U.S. imports of Venezuelan oil. U.S. imports of Mercosur goods rose steadily from 1996 to 2006, while U.S. exports remained flat from 1996 to 2001 and then declined. The U.S. trade balance with Mercosur countries shifted from deficit to surplus in 2007, driven by increased demand in Brazil. U.S. exports to Mercosur, including high-tech goods, grew due to Brazil's economic expansion and currency appreciation. Major U.S. exports to Mercosur are capital and high technology goods like machinery, vehicles, aircraft, medical equipment, and pharmaceuticals. Mercosur, a trade bloc in South America, has evolved from bilateral agreements between Brazil and Argentina in the 1980s. The United States primarily imports machinery and mineral fuel from Brazil, mineral fuel and processed foods from Argentina, sugars and woods from Paraguay, and meat and woods from Uruguay. Despite being a small trade partner, Mercosur includes two of South America's largest economies, driving ongoing U.S. interest in maintaining cooperative relations for potential growth in trade and investment. Mercosur evolved from a period of mutual distrust under military dictatorships in Brazil and Argentina, transitioning to a regional trade agreement due to shared geographical, cultural, and economic complementarities among the four countries. Uruguay and Paraguay pushed for a four-country common market to enhance trade prospects and avoid isolation by their larger neighbors. The bloc aimed to preserve the Brazil-Argentina relationship while fostering sub-regional economic integration. Mercosur was established as a common market among Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay to accelerate economic development and social justice. The goal was to improve living conditions through balanced trade growth. The success of Mercosur depends on consistent reciprocal market access and cooperation for mutual economic growth. ALADI is a regional trade organization that promotes sub-regional trade pacts with a focus on inclusiveness and minimal harm to non-members. Mercosur, a partial customs union, follows a model of gradualism, flexibility, and balance, allowing for the accession of other countries. It transitioned from a free trade agreement to a common market in 1995, adopting a common trade policy and external tariffs. Mercosur, a partial customs union, has a common trade policy with common external tariffs applying to 80% of tariff line items. However, there are exceptions for sensitive sectors like sugar, automobiles, and technology products. The exceptions were supposed to be phased out by 2006 but have been extended to 2011, leading to complex rules of origin. The CET can be levied twice, causing double taxation issues, especially for Paraguay. Resolving the application and enforcement of the CET remains a significant unaddressed issue. The Treaty of Asunci\u00f3n established a partial customs union in Mercosur with common external tariffs on most goods, but exceptions for sensitive sectors. Revenue losses are a concern due to incomplete customs union, leading to asymmetry issues and hindering the achievement of a full common market. Sectoral cooperation aims to gradually promote inter-country factor mobility and comparative advantage. Full policy coordination is challenging due to significant differences in macroeconomic policies. Mercosur's integration process faces challenges with sectoral issues and disputes, particularly between Brazil and Argentina. Cross-border movement of goods within Mercosur and to third country markets remains a challenge. All parties must adhere to a common set of rights and obligations, with limited special treatment for smaller economies. Important protocols, such as the Protocol of Ouro Preto in 1994, have been established to formalize the common market. Dispute settlement mechanisms have been clarified and expanded, but enforcement remains a significant issue. Mercosur's institutional effectiveness is hindered by unenforceable dispute settlement mechanisms. Recent developments, such as membership expansion with Venezuela and Bolivia, raise questions about its functional capacity. The establishment of the Mercosur Parliament in 2006 aims to harmonize national laws but lacks authority. The Mercosur Parliament aims to harmonize national laws and policies but lacks authority over national government bodies. Criticized for being weak or risking unequal representation, it established a $100 million Structural Convergence Fund in 2006 to address trade asymmetries within the pact. Intra-Mercosur trade relations have been uneven due to internal policy contradictions and a hostile external economic environment in the late 1990s. The return of a beneficial global economic environment has eased some friction but highlighted the need for policy adjustments and addressing concerns from smaller members. Criticisms of Mercosur include weak institutions, incomplete integration, and decision-making based on political agreements rather than rules. This ad hoc approach generates conflict within the customs union, questioning the commitment to completing economic integration. The collapse of intra-Mercosur exports from 25% to 11% in 2002 reflected economic crises, tariff increases, and Argentina's pressure to lower tariffs on capital goods. This setback highlighted the region's dependence on trade with developed countries. Mercosur faces challenges due to structural asymmetries among its member economies, leading to difficulties in balancing trade integration and equitable benefits. The varying sizes and levels of development of Argentina and Brazil create fluctuations in their economic relationship within the pact. The prolonged recession and financial crisis in Argentina have highlighted structural differences and policy asymmetries within Mercosur. These asymmetries can lead to large trade imbalances, threatening the stability of intra-Mercosur relations during external economic shocks, as seen in the 1990s with global crises impacting investor confidence and causing capital flight in Brazil. The financial crises in the late 1990s caused capital flight in Brazil, leading to currency devaluation and the abandonment of its fixed exchange rate program. Argentina's strict dollar convertibility regime created an exchange rate policy asymmetry between the two countries, altering trade patterns. Argentina's own recession worsened its financial crisis, resulting in the abandonment of its fixed exchange rate regime and sovereign debt default in 2001. Mercosur leaders proposed a Relaunch program in 2000 to deepen integration but it failed to overcome the effects of the crises. The financial crises in the late 1990s led to capital flight in Brazil and currency devaluation. Argentina's recession worsened its crisis, causing the abandonment of its fixed exchange rate regime. Intra-Mercosur relations strained, with trade restrictions between Argentina and Brazil. By 2002, Mercosur economies rebounded, but trade imbalances persisted, especially with Brazil. The trade deficits between countries in Mercosur, particularly with Brazil, remain a concern. Brazil benefits the most from the trade imbalance, despite being the least trade-dependent member. Paraguay and Uruguay also face trade deficits with Argentina, highlighting asymmetry issues within the region. The trade deficits within Mercosur, especially with Brazil, are a concern as Paraguay and Uruguay also have deficits with Argentina. Both countries are diversifying their trade outside of Mercosur due to perceived inequalities. Efforts to address the asymmetry issue have been slow, with the creation of the Structural Convergence Fund being a key development. Argentina has trade disputes with Brazil, leading to large deficits post-crisis. Resolving these asymmetries remains a major challenge for Mercosur's long-term success. The trade deficits with Brazil were a significant problem for Argentina, as they were weighted towards high value-added industrial goods, competing directly with Argentina's industrial sector. The imbalance worsened over time, with Argentine exports decreasing and Brazilian exports increasing. Factors contributing to this imbalance included exchange rate equilibriums favoring Brazilian goods, post-recession jump in Argentine demand, Brazil's export promotion policy, and structural factors in Mercosur trade composition. Brazil's trade surplus is driven by falling import shares of smaller Mercosur economies, leading to structural problems. The export supply from Mercosur countries does not align with Brazil's import demand, and Argentine and Uruguayan exports may be less competitive. This imbalance may not naturally correct, leading Argentina to seek remedies like voluntary export restraints and quotas. The CAM, agreed to by Brazil and Argentina in 2006, allows protective measures for imports causing damage to domestic industries. It is a bilateral arrangement under ALADI, not governed by Mercosur, and represents a retreat from Mercosur's free trade philosophy. The CAM lacks enforcement mechanisms and may undermine Mercosur's agreement. The smaller Mercosur partners, Paraguay and Uruguay, face trade asymmetries and challenges in exporting due to structural impediments within the agreement. The disparity between Mercosur's goals and its actual functioning hinders their development. Ad hoc trade restrictions and bilateral diplomacy often circumvent formal decision-making processes, impacting Paraguay and Uruguay's exports. Paraguay, as the poorest and least developed Mercosur member, faces ad hoc trade restrictions within the agreement. Its economy heavily relies on Mercosur for export routes, especially during limited river access. Paraguay has struggled with bureaucratic barriers in Brazil and Argentina, hindering its exports and prompting calls for trade preferences within Mercosur. Uruguay, with a higher income and diversified economy, faces similar NTB issues as Paraguay within Mercosur. It seeks to balance trade expansion within and outside Mercosur, exploring deeper ties with the EU and the US. Frustrated by past vulnerabilities to Argentina and Brazil, Uruguay aims to diversify its trade globally while being constrained by its inability to change or enforce Mercosur agreements. Uruguay, facing NTB issues within Mercosur, is limited in its ability to enforce agreements or leave the pact. Brazil's economic dominance in Mercosur allows it to control trade movements, leading smaller countries to seek alternative trade arrangements. Uruguay is exploring deeper ties with the EU and the US to diversify its trade globally. Uruguay sought to deepen trade relations with the United States through a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) signed in January 2007. This agreement allows for ongoing discussions on specific trade deals while maintaining Uruguay's commitments to Mercosur. Uruguay's pursuit of closer U.S. ties was driven by concerns over increasing bilateralism between Argentina and Brazil. Argentina criticized Uruguay for attempting to diversify its trade outside of Mercosur. Uruguay faces criticism for seeking trade diversification outside of Mercosur, particularly from Argentina. The construction of a pulp mill on the Uruguay River, opposed by Argentina, is a major point of contention within Mercosur due to environmental concerns. Argentina alleges violations of a 1975 environmental protocol and potential negative effects on its national territory. The World Bank review found no serious environmental problems with the pulp mill project in Uruguay, but suggested design changes to reduce risks further. The International Finance Corporation provided $100 million for the project, sparking protests and diplomatic tensions. Argentine protesters periodically block bridges over the Uruguay River, leading to trade disruptions. Uruguay sought dispute settlement through Mercosur, with a ruling in 2006 finding Argentina had not upheld free movement commitments. Argentina filed a petition for arbitration with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague regarding the dispute over a pulp mill project in Uruguay. The ICJ denied Argentina's request for an injunction to stop construction and declined to require actions to remove protesters. Mediation efforts in Madrid and New York temporarily eased tensions, but the pulp mill began operations in November 2007. Brazil chose not to mediate, highlighting the lack of an effective dispute settlement system within Mercosur. Mercosur, a customs union, considers expanding membership and trade arrangements with third party countries. Chile and Bolivia joined as \"associate members\" in 1996. Associate membership focuses on pursuing free trade agreements and sector-specific cooperation, without voting rights or participation in internal functions. In 2004, Mercosur and the Andean Community signed a trade pact. The Andean Community and Mercosur signed a trade pact, leading to the creation of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR). UNASUR includes 12 countries and has bilateral arrangements for market access. Brazil made unilateral concessions for the UNASUR agreement. Sectoral initiatives like the South American gas pipeline show increased cooperation in the region. The CSN reflects increased cooperation and self-determination in the region. Mercosur's negotiations with the EU and Western Hemisphere countries have faced challenges, particularly in reaching an agricultural agreement acceptable to Brazil. Brazil has also declined offers from the US and EU for \"WTO-plus\" arrangements. South-South trade talks have made limited progress, with Mercosur engaging in preliminary discussions with various countries. On July 4, 2006, Mercosur agreed to accept Venezuela as the first additional full member of the pact, in support of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's efforts to unify South America. The accession process requires formal parliamentary approval by all four Mercosur countries, with only Argentina and Uruguay having voted to approve so far. Venezuela overcame hurdles related to its membership in the CAN and the adoption of the Mercosur CET. Venezuela withdrew from the Andean trade pact in 2006 to join Mercosur. Mercosur negotiated to give Venezuela four years to comply with the CET. The addition of Venezuela strengthens Mercosur economically. Venezuela promised immediate duty-free treatment for imports from Paraguay and Uruguay. This move may boost intra-Mercosur trade. The potential trade benefits of Venezuela joining Mercosur may be overstated. Current trade levels between Mercosur and Venezuela are low, with limited growth potential due to trade restrictions and existing tariff preferences. While cooperation in the energy sector could be beneficial, it may not require Venezuela's full integration into Mercosur. Venezuela's accession to Mercosur could complicate trade policy coordination within the bloc, raising concerns over President Ch\u00e1vez's policies that may challenge democracy. Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim emphasizes Mercosur's goal to consolidate democracy in South America. Ch\u00e1vez's actions, such as closing a radio station and attempting to abolish presidential term limits, have sparked worries over democratic principles. The debate over Venezuela's accession to Mercosur has sparked concerns over democratic principles, with some members of the Brazilian Senate pushing for a vote postponement. Venezuela's potential influence on trade negotiations within Mercosur and its impact on challenging U.S. influence in South America are key points of contention. The accession may also have unintended regional consequences, potentially forcing countries outside Mercosur to choose between U.S. and Venezuelan influence. Peru has proposed a new trade bloc called the Community of the Pacific, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, and other countries. Bolivia seeks full membership in Mercosur but is hesitant to leave the CAN. Mercosur faces challenges in aligning trade negotiation objectives within the WTO multilateral round. Mercosur has created a group to address the Doha negotiations, led by Brazil. While there is agreement on agricultural issues, there is less consensus on nonagricultural market access and services. Brazil stands to gain the most from the Doha Round, but positions benefiting Brazil may not always align with other Mercosur countries. The most sensitive areas for Mercosur's customs union are tariff levels and sensitive product lists. Differences in these areas could breach customs union or Doha agreement rules. Israel signed a free trade agreement with Mercosur countries in 2007, the first with a non-Western Hemisphere country. Mercosur signed a free trade agreement with Israel in 2007, the first with a non-Western Hemisphere country. The agreement focuses on market access for merchandise trade, with full free trade to be phased in within 10 years. Mercosur and Israel have a balanced trade relationship, with Mercosur exporting agricultural products and importing technology goods. However, challenges remain in trade negotiations with the EU, the United States, and at the Doha Round, particularly regarding agricultural exports and capital goods imports. Safeguards and restrictions will be in place during the transition to full free trade. Additionally, while Mercosur and China do not have a formal trade agreement, bilateral trade between the two has significantly increased in recent years. China's trade relationship with Mercosur countries is significant, with China representing 7.2% of exports and 11.2% of imports. Total trade ranges from 11% to 28% for different countries, with Paraguay importing mostly electronic equipment. The strong trade growth is driven by commodity exports and labor-intensive goods, but poses challenges as manufactured imports displace local products. China's expanding trade surplus could widen as it becomes a larger trade partner, leading Brazil and Argentina to pursue anti-dumping cases and import licenses. Mercosur, a limited customs union, has fostered cooperation among Brazil, Argentina, and other countries despite its \"incompleteness.\" The alliance faces challenges but remains intact due to lack of alternatives, fear of dissolution consequences, and hopes for institutional improvements. The focus on form over function hinders deeper integration within the economic bloc. Mercosur's focus on form over function has hindered deeper economic integration, leading to persistent dissatisfaction among smaller partners. Brazil's dominance and institutional disagreements within Mercosur have stalled progress towards mutual growth in trade and development. Instead of prioritizing economic integration, Mercosur has chosen to establish new institutional bureaucracies like the Parliament and engage in limited outreach to third countries. However, trade agreements with key partners like the United States and the EU have not been finalized, leaving the future direction of Mercosur uncertain. The EU and South-South agreements have progressed in Mercosur, with limited market access arrangements for South American countries. The invitation to Venezuela has raised concerns due to its impact on Mercosur's cohesiveness and trade effects. The United States has supported Mercosur for economic integration in the Western Hemisphere, but trade with Mercosur is small. Venezuela's addition could solidify Mercosur's resistance to a hemispheric-wide trade agreement. Venezuela is the only country in Latin America to reject the FTAA proposed by the United States. Mercosur is focusing on expanding within the region and with other developing countries, preferring the WTO for trade policy goals. The US is strengthening commercial ties with Mercosur and pursuing deeper trade relations with Uruguay. There is a possibility of overlapping trading systems between Mercosur and the US, which may not be economically or administratively optimal."
