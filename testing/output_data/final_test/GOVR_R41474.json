    "content": "The American health care system has fragmented care, which is costly and of lower quality. Integrated care delivery models like ACOs can reduce costs and improve quality, as directed by the Affordable Care Act. The report discusses the evolving concept of ACOs, their operation, provisions of the Medicare Shared Savings Program, arguments for and against ACOs, and the likely impact of Medicare ACOs. It also includes details on the proposed regulations by the Department of Health and Human Services, antitrust issues, and the Pioneer ACO Demonstration for experienced healthcare providers. ACOs are collaborations that integrate providers to achieve shared-saving bonuses by improving quality and reducing overall spending for a defined patient population. Key elements include integrating providers across care settings, emphasizing primary care, and sharing savings with payers without compromising quality. Providers are responsible for improving quality and coordinating care for patients. The rationale for Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) is to improve quality, reduce costs, and coordinate care across providers. ACOs aim to bring providers together under a single organization to create incentives for better quality and lower costs in healthcare delivery. Providers, particularly physicians, are responsible for these improvements, as they control a significant portion of healthcare spending. ACOs can contract with various payers to share in savings resulting from improved care coordination. ACOs aim to change provider culture and practice patterns to deliver higher-quality, lower-cost, and better integrated services. Providers come together to form ACOs, inviting others to join voluntarily to improve care quality and share in savings. The enactment of PPACA has spurred these efforts as providers position themselves relative to ACOs, which are seen as potentially altering the influence of primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and payers. ACOs are formed by providers to improve care quality, reduce costs, and integrate services. Providers may join ACOs to protect their market position, share in cost savings, and maintain autonomy. ACOs are modeled after quality leaders like Kaiser Permanente and Mayo Clinic, with highly integrated provider models. Some for-profit models also exist, such as HealthCare Partners Medical Group and Permanente Medical Group. The formation and payment methods of ACOs vary, with integrated providers like Kaiser Permanente and Mayo Clinic serving as models. New ACO efforts may involve physicians not directly employed by the ACO, which could impact their effectiveness. ACOs may be influenced by factors such as provider employment status and patient population characteristics. Limited experience in dense urban and large rural areas poses challenges for ACOs. Failed similar efforts are not well-documented in the healthcare market. ACOs aim to integrate various providers, with evolving views on the necessity of hospital participation. The composition of ACOs may vary by location, but analysts agree that they should be provider-led. Initially, ACOs were envisioned as hospital-centric models, emphasizing the hospital and its extended medical staff. In 2008, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) described a bonus-eligible organization (BEO) model of ACO which was not hospital-centric. The BEO was envisioned to be providers or physicians practicing in groups, networks of discrete physician practices, partnerships or joint ventures between hospitals and physicians, hospitals employing physicians, integrated delivery systems, or community-based coalitions of providers. MedPAC described an option for a hospital-centric model of an ACO in 2009 as one that \"would consist of primary care physicians, specialists, and at least one hospital. It could be formed from an integrated delivery system, a physician-hospital organization, or an academic medical center.\" The Fisher proposal in 2010 evolved into a non-hospital-centric model for Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), allowing for broad participation without requiring hospital involvement. ACOs can consist of various provider configurations, including integrated delivery systems, primary care groups, hospital-based systems, and virtual physician networks. Insurers like Blue Cross Blue Shield and Anthem Blue Cross are also exploring their role in ACOs. Blue Shield of Massachusetts and Anthem Blue Cross, along with insurers like Cigna, are forming ACOs with provider groups. The models of ACOs may vary in integration, hospital involvement, physician mix, and commitment to goals. Specialist physicians are also seeking to establish ACOs to maintain market position. Hospitals are likely to be essential in ACOs due to their significant share of healthcare expenditures. ACOs may require a significant capital investment in their formative years, with hospitals being a potential source for funds. Hospitals, as large organizations, are well positioned to lead ACO efforts due to their control over healthcare expenditures and available capital. The discussion below focuses on the simplest arrangements to highlight the features of an ACO and the relationships involving ACO and payers, providers, and insureds. An ACO's main function is to take responsibility for the medical care of a patient population by contracting with payers on behalf of its providers. In this example, the ACO and payer agree on selecting patients based on health status, determining historic cost of care (benchmark), calculating anticipated cost changes, setting a savings rate for ACO payments, and defining quality measures. The ACO is responsible for coordinating all medical care from primary to post-acute. The ACO is responsible for coordinating all medical care from primary to post-acute, with one entity overseeing care to ensure coordination. If actual medical expenditures are below the benchmark, savings are shared with providers based on quality measures met. The ACO and Medicare agree on spending adjustments, risk adjustments, and quality measures. Providers file claims with Medicare as usual, and if savings are achieved, the ACO can share in them based on an agreed formula. The ACO assumes no risk for the amount received for services or total medical costs. Medicare payment models can involve risk sharing, such as withholding 5% of fee-for-service payments to be paid later with shared savings if targets are met. This incentivizes providers to achieve reductions. Other models like capitation transfer more risk and incentives to ACOs. The ACO model links quality and savings, requiring providers to achieve savings while maintaining or improving quality. Quality improvements may not always result in cost savings, leading to additional costs. Payers may increase quality improvement and reporting requirements over time. Providers can affiliate with an ACO to share in savings and obligations through a contract. A provider brings all patients from a defined population to the ACO, which may consist of providers who refer to each other. Multiple ACOs can exist in a community, allowing providers to be members of different ACOs for different populations. An Accountable Care Organization (ACO) can work with its affiliated providers to reduce unnecessary services, improve care coordination, increase preventive services, and benefit from economies of scale. This collaboration aims to lower costs, reduce emergency visits, optimize equipment use, and enhance organizational efficiency. Some proposals for ACOs involve creating a separate legal entity with shared decision-making to prevent dominance by certain providers. Distribution of shared savings within the ACO is an unresolved issue, particularly regarding the contributions of primary care doctors versus specialists. Integrated staff models may mitigate disputes through employment relationships and salary certainty. In a virtual ACO or less integrated ACO, divisions may be more contentious when deciding affiliations and cost-saving efforts. A key feature of the ACO model is maintaining the provider-patient relationship without adding a new entity. The ACO is responsible for total medical care costs but insured individuals are not limited in where they receive care. The ACO model allows insured individuals to receive care from any provider without constraints or enrollment in the ACO. Providers bring patients into the ACO through affiliation, automatically enrolling the insured. There are no restrictions on provider choices or costs for insured individuals, and some models assign individuals to an ACO retrospectively based on patient-provider associations. The retrospective assignment of individuals to an ACO means that providers are not held responsible for patients not affiliated with the ACO. This encourages cost-effective treatment for all patients, as providers do not know in advance who will be assigned to their ACO. Some argue that if savings are achieved, consumers should also benefit, while others believe that improved quality of care is sufficient for consumers. When ACOs share savings with Medicare beneficiaries, issues arise regarding anti-kickback provisions, payment timing, and payment size to align interests. Medicare Advantage already offers shared savings, but decisions on enrollment may be influenced by various factors. Sharing savings may blur distinctions between ACOs and Medicare Advantage. Section 3022 of PPACA directs the establishment of a Medicare Shared Savings Program. Section 3022 of PPACA directs the Secretary to establish a Medicare Shared Savings Program by January 1, 2012, to promote the formation of ACOs and encourage investment in infrastructure for high-quality service delivery under Medicare Part A and Part B. The Secretary will determine the method to assign Medicare beneficiaries to ACOs based on their utilization of primary care services provided by ACO professionals. The CBO estimated that 20% of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries would be assigned to participating primary care physicians within two years of ACO implementation, increasing to 40% by 2019. The Secretary has the authority to assign beneficiaries to ACOs, but it is unclear if participation is voluntary. The statute does not specify if the assignment is prospective or if beneficiaries are assigned each year for the following year. The Medicare Shared Savings Program can assign beneficiaries either prospectively or retrospectively based on utilization patterns. Eligible providers include physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and hospitals in shared governance mechanisms. The Medicare Shared Savings Program assigns beneficiaries to accountable care organizations (ACOs) based on utilization patterns. ACOs must have shared governance and include physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and clinical nurse specialists. The ACOs are accountable for the quality, cost, and overall care of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries and must participate in the program for at least three years. The Medicare Shared Savings Program requires accountable care organizations (ACOs) to have a formal legal structure, a leadership and management structure, and processes promoting evidence-based medicine and patient engagement. ACOs must include primary care physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and clinical nurse specialists, with at least 5,000 fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries assigned to them. Providers of services or supplies may be paid in the same manner as other Medicare providers but share in any savings resulting from reduced utilization. The Medicare Shared Savings Program requires ACOs to establish a savings requirement based on per capita Medicare expenditures. The benchmark is adjusted for beneficiary characteristics and national expenditure growth. Alternatively, highly integrated ACOs can use a partial capitation model. The ACO model emphasizes the need for integrated and risk-bearing ACOs to improve quality and efficiency of care for Medicare beneficiaries. Alternative payment mechanisms, such as payment withholding and risk-sharing, aim to fund financial incentives for ACO initiatives. The current medical system lacks coordinated care and accountability for quality and cost of care, highlighting the need for change in financing and delivery of care to align provider incentives. ACO proponents argue for aligning incentives among providers by changing care and payments simultaneously. This includes holding Medicare providers accountable for services, rewarding cost reduction and good performance, and introducing new care models like medical homes. The goal is to improve access, efficiency, quality, outcomes, and patient experience in the healthcare system. ACO proponents advocate for new care models like medical homes to align incentives among providers, improve quality, outcomes, and patient experience, and reduce costs. The ACO model aims to shift responsibility for costs from insurers to healthcare providers, avoiding concerns about insurance companies coming between patients and providers. The ACO model shifts performance risk to healthcare providers, not insurers. Medicare beneficiaries may be assigned to ACOs without joining a health plan. Providers in closed panels may have differential pricing. Many Americans prefer open panels of providers where they can choose their own doctors without cost differences based on network status. ACOs allow Medicare beneficiaries to select providers regardless of network or cost differentials, unlike traditional Medicare Advantage plans. ACOs have critics who compare them to HMOs without real authority. Despite the appeal of having one entity responsible for delivering healthcare services, HMOs, PPOs, and Medicare Advantage plans like PFFS have shown inefficiency. The logistics of such a system are unclear due to cultural, legal, and practical obstacles. Saving money will require reducing hospital use and unnecessary services, leading to potential conflicts among providers. The failure of HMOs to deliver on their promise raises concerns about the accountability of health organizations in the future. There are doubts about whether primary care doctors, specialists, hospitals, and other providers can effectively coordinate care and reduce costs within the ACO framework. Past efforts at forming integrated provider networks have led to higher prices for consumers, who prefer open networks. The study by Berenson, Ginsburg, and Kemper (2010) warns that while Medicare may benefit from ACOs, the larger healthcare system could be negatively affected. ACOs may lead to more integrated provider groups with market power, potentially causing private insurers to pay more even if care is delivered efficiently. The Medicare Shared Savings Program focuses on Medicare Parts A and B services, excluding Part D prescription drug benefits. Suggestions have been made to incorporate Part D benefits into payment design to prevent overreliance on prescription medicines. The program is estimated to reduce Medicare expenditures by $4.9 billion from FY2013 to FY2019. The CBO projects that savings from ACOs would decrease over time as quality improves. While these savings support ACOs, there are concerns about their potential impact on healthcare markets and costs. MedPAC suggests that financial incentives for physicians in large ACOs to change individual patient decisions may be minimal. The real savings from the ACO model are projected to come from group decisions to constrain growth in capacity and specialists, and reduce Medicare spending by sharing resources. ACOs require collective decision-making and member organizations to transfer authority for enforcing decisions, which may be challenging to foster. ACOs face challenges in generating operating capital for start-up costs, developing HIT systems, and implementing compliance programs. Monitoring provider responsibility for savings and determining compensation may also pose difficulties. Providers should be compensated for their participation in ACOs, but determining responsibility and the amount of compensation can be challenging. Quality improvements may not always lead to cost savings, and some improvements could be costly. There are suggestions that Medicare beneficiaries should be informed of their physician's involvement in an ACO and have the option to opt-in or opt-out. Prospective enrollment, where beneficiaries are informed ahead of time, may have practical difficulties compared to retrospective assignment based on actual utilization. CMS may assign beneficiaries based on actual utilization, informing them yearly and offering opt-in or opt-out options for ACO enrollment. Concerns about automatic enrollment may lead to an opt-in strategy to avoid confusion and increased call-center activity. The impact of ACOs may hinge on changes in local market competition and alignment with local interests. ACOs may offer Medicare savings but raise prices for other payers as providers consolidate. Some ACOs struggle with agreeing on savings distribution and face challenges with overhead costs, leading some participants to leave over time. Some participants may drift away from ACOs over time due to financial incentives. Hospitals could become key players in creating ACOs, bringing in specialists and providers. The issue of how hospitals will share savings with partners remains unresolved. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued proposed regulations for accountable care organizations, along with joint statements from other agencies addressing antitrust issues and financial arrangements involving ACOs. Stakeholders have 60 days to comment on the NPRM before a final regulation is released. Key parts of the proposed regulation are outlined in a question and answer format in the appendix. The appendix outlines key parts of the proposed regulation for accountable care organizations (ACOs) under the Medicare Shared Savings Program. ACOs are collaborations of providers responsible for coordinating services under Medicare Parts A and B to deliver high-quality and efficient care. The Medicare Shared Savings Program allows healthcare providers to receive bonuses by meeting quality targets and reducing overall spending for a patient population. The program was required to start by January 1, 2012, with an estimated 75 to 150 ACOs and 1.5 to 4 million Medicare beneficiaries involved. ACOs must have a legal structure but are not prescriptive in other requirements. The proposed rule for Medicare ACOs requires a legal entity in the state of establishment, authorization to operate in each state, and a federal tax ID. A governing body must be established to promote evidence-based medicine, patient engagement, and coordinate care, with at least 75% ACO participants on the board. Medicare beneficiaries are assigned based on primary care services provided by primary care physicians. The proposed rule for Medicare ACOs requires a legal entity in the state of establishment, authorization to operate in each state, and a federal tax ID. A governing body must be established to promote evidence-based medicine, patient engagement, and coordinate care, with at least 75% ACO participants on the board. Primary care physicians with specific specialties provide primary care services to Medicare beneficiaries, with a minimum requirement of 5,000 beneficiaries assigned to an ACO. The Medicare ACO program requires a legal entity with a federal tax ID and a governing body promoting evidence-based medicine. ACO participants must include primary care physicians with specific specialties and have a minimum of 5,000 assigned beneficiaries. Not all Medicare beneficiaries seen by an ACO count towards this figure. Eligible providers to form an ACO include ACO professionals in group practice arrangements, networks of individual practices, partnerships between hospitals and ACO professionals, hospitals employing ACO professionals, and other groups determined appropriate by the Secretary. Critical access hospitals (CAHs) that bill for both physician and hospital services may also participate. Entities like RHCs, FQHCs, and CAHs can participate in the ACO program independently. Specialty practices can also join ACOs, but primary care services from specialists do not count towards assigning Medicare beneficiaries. A three-year agreement with CMS is required for ACOs, with provisions for early termination. The ACO, ACO participants, providers/suppliers, and other entities involved must comply with regulations, federal laws, and certify the accuracy of all submissions to CMS. Medicare beneficiaries are assigned to an ACO based on their utilization of primary care services provided by a primary care physician who is an ACO provider/supplier. Assignment involves a five-stage process including identifying primary care physicians, determining beneficiaries who received services, calculating total allowed charges, and adding together allowed charges for primary care services. Medicare beneficiaries are assigned to an ACO based on their primary care services utilization from ACO primary care physicians. Beneficiaries are assigned to the ACO where their primary care physician is affiliated. Medicare Advantage Plan enrollees cannot be in an ACO. CMS monitors for avoidance of at-risk beneficiaries by ACOs. CMS can require an ACO to submit and implement a corrective action plan if they are avoiding at-risk beneficiaries. During this probation period, the ACO will not receive shared savings payments and may be terminated if the avoidance continues. Costs for the ACO are risk-adjusted based on patient population characteristics. ACOs will have access to CMS aggregate data without personal identifiers. They can request beneficiary information for population-based activities. ACOs can request monthly claims data from CMS for potentially assigned beneficiaries to evaluate provider/supplier performance, conduct quality assessment, and improve care coordination. Medicare beneficiaries can opt out of data sharing. Data usage is limited to care coordination and quality improvement activities for all assigned beneficiaries, with protections in place to prevent care reduction for specific individuals. ACOs must comply with data protection regulations, including HIPAA Privacy Rule, to safeguard Medicare beneficiary data. Misuse or disclosure of data can result in loss of eligibility for data access and potential termination from the Shared Savings Program. An ACO must comply with data protection regulations, including HIPAA Privacy Rule, to safeguard Medicare beneficiary data. Misuse or disclosure of data can lead to loss of eligibility for data access and potential termination from the Shared Savings Program. Medicare beneficiaries have the right to opt-out of sharing their claims data with the ACO. Various protections are in place to ensure beneficiaries' free choice in determining their healthcare providers. ACOs must inform Medicare beneficiaries of their participation in the program and obtain approval for marketing materials from CMS. Prior to accessing Medicare beneficiary claims data, ACOs must inform beneficiaries and ensure their right to opt-out of sharing their data. ACO must inform beneficiaries of using their personal health information for care coordination. Beneficiaries can opt-out of data sharing with a form provided during office visits. ACO governing boards must have a Medicare beneficiary representative. CMS retains the right to terminate. CMS may terminate an agreement with an ACO if they avoid at-risk beneficiaries, fail to meet quality standards, report inaccurate information, or fail to comply with eligibility requirements. CMS may terminate an agreement with an ACO for various reasons, including material noncompliance with reporting requirements, failure to implement an approved corrective action plan, violation of laws such as the Anti-kickback statute, submission of false data to CMS, and misuse of marketing materials. Failure to comply with various requirements such as maintaining a minimum beneficiary population, offering opt-out options, limiting sharing of claims information, and misusing CMS data can lead to termination of an agreement with an ACO by CMS. If an ACO agreement is terminated before the three-year period, the ACO loses its mandatory 25% withhold of shared savings. Medicare beneficiaries can choose to fully opt-in, partially opt-out, or fully opt-out of an ACO. Opting in is passive, with the beneficiary continuing to see their primary care physician who is now part of the ACO responsible for their care. Beneficiaries have the freedom to see any physician or specialist and be admitted to any hospital without restrictions. A Medicare beneficiary can partially opt-out of an ACO by seeking services from a non-ACO provider. To fully opt-out, they must receive all Medicare covered services from non-ACO providers. Primary care physicians accepting Medicare do not have to join an ACO, but if they do, all their patients receiving primary care from them will be assigned to the ACO. Physicians cannot selectively register patients in an ACO. Exclusive To An ACO? Primary care physicians must commit to a three-year agreement with CMS and be exclusive to one ACO if their tax identification number was used for assignment. Those whose tax identification numbers were not used can choose to be exclusive. CMS expects 50% of an ACO's primary care physicians to use electronic health records by the second performance year, with the right to terminate the ACO if this requirement is not met. In one-sided and two-sided payment models, ACOs can share in savings if they meet financial and quality targets. In a one-sided model, ACOs are not liable for losses if financial targets are not met, while in a two-sided model, they are responsible for sharing losses. Savings for ACOs are calculated by establishing a historic benchmark, computing actual Medicare expenditures, and determining shared savings. To calculate historic Part A and B fee-for-service expenditures for beneficiaries assigned to the ACO, CMS will estimate a fixed benchmark adjusted for growth and beneficiary characteristics. The benchmark is updated annually based on national per capita expenditure growth for Medicare fee-for-service. The benchmark for beneficiaries assigned to the ACO is calculated by adjusting for growth and beneficiary characteristics. This involves determining national growth trend indices, establishing health status indices, and computing a three-year risk-and growth-trend adjusted per capita expenditure amount for patient populations in each benchmark year. The benchmark is weighted with BY3 at 60%, BY2 at 30%, and BY1 at 10% to give greater emphasis to the most recent data. CMS will update the fixed benchmark for ACO beneficiaries based on national per capita expenditure growth, excluding certain expenditure changes related to value-based purchasing programs or the HITECH Act. Per capita Medicare Part A and Part B expenditures will be computed for each performance year. The ACO's per capita Medicare expenditures must be below the benchmark by more than the minimum savings rate to qualify for shared savings payment. ACOs in the one-sided model have MSRs ranging from 3.9% to 2.0%, while those in the two-sided model have a 2% MSR. Meeting quality performance standards is also necessary to participate in the Shared Savings Program. Under the one-sided model of the Medicare Shared Savings Program, ACOs can participate for the first two performance years before transitioning to the two-sided model. ACOs exceeding the Minimum Savings Rate (MSR) can share savings net 2% of their benchmark. Some smaller ACOs meeting specific criteria may be exempt from the 2% net savings threshold adjustment. The final sharing rate includes the ACO's earned quality performance sharing rate, with a maximum potential savings share of 52.5%. Additional incentives may be available for meeting quality performance goals, such as including an FQHC. Under the one-sided model of the Medicare Shared Savings Program, ACOs can participate for the first two performance years before transitioning to the two-sided model. ACOs may be eligible for an additional 2.5% if they include an FQHC or RHC as a participant, depending on the number of assigned Medicare beneficiaries. The shared savings rate under the two-sided model is determined by comparing the ACO's average per capita Medicare expenditures to the benchmark, with a minimum savings rate of 2% required to qualify for shared savings. Under the two-sided model of the Medicare Shared Savings Program, ACOs must meet quality performance standards and maintain eligibility to receive shared savings payments. ACOs can receive up to 60% of savings under the benchmark based on their quality performance, with a potential increase of up to 5.0 percentage points if they include a RHC or FQHC. The shared savings received by an eligible ACO cannot exceed 10% of its benchmark. Shared losses are calculated based on the ACO's performance compared to the benchmark. Under the two-sided model of the Medicare Shared Savings Program, ACOs must meet quality performance standards and maintain eligibility to receive shared savings payments. ACOs can receive up to 60% of savings under the benchmark based on their quality performance, with a potential increase of up to 5.0 percentage points if they include a RHC or FQHC. Shared losses are calculated based on the ACO's performance compared to the benchmark, with a cap of 10% of its benchmark for shared losses. The shared loss rate is determined by the amount of the loss and the ACO's performance on quality measures, with liability capped at 5% in year 1, 7.5% in year 2, and 10% in year 3 for eligible ACOs transitioning to the two-sided model. CMS has proposed that ACOs submit data on 65 quality measures to establish a quality benchmark for performance evaluation. A quality performance score will determine eligibility for shared savings. The quality performance standard will be set relative to performance on the measures in subsequent years. The 65 quality measures proposed by CMS for ACOs span five domains and include process, outcome, and patient experience measures. These measures were selected based on criteria such as improving health outcomes, aligning with other Medicare programs, and minimizing administrative burden. Additional measures for future performance periods will be determined through rulemaking. ACO quality performance scores are calculated based on 65 measures across five domains. Points are awarded relative to FFS/MA data, with all measures weighted equally within each domain. The overall score determines shared savings. ACO quality performance scores are calculated based on 65 measures across five domains, with points awarded equally within each domain. ACOs must meet the quality performance standard by reporting on all measures to be eligible for shared savings. Failure to meet the quality requirements may result in ineligibility for savings and potential termination from the program. ACO must meet quality performance thresholds for all proposed measures to be eligible for shared savings. Failure to report on measures may result in termination from the program. Medicare Trust Funds are protected by larger MSR for small ACOs to avoid sharing savings based on random variation in spending. CMS has proposed that smaller ACOs must achieve a higher MSR before being eligible for savings to protect Medicare trust funds. ACOs must transition to a two-sided model in Year 3 and subsequent years to ensure accountability. The ACO upside is capped at 7.5% under the one-sided model and 10% under the two-sided model. Medicare trust funds benefit fully beyond these capped amounts. In both models, an ACO's share of savings will be subject to 25% withholding to repay any losses to Medicare. ACOs must obtain reinsurance, escrow funds, surety bonds, or establish a line of credit to ensure repayment of losses. The repayment mechanism must be capable of repaying losses equal to at least 1% of the ACO's per capita expenditures annually. Shared Savings and Losses Example: A large ACO with 60,000 participants and a small ACO with 5,000 participants have benchmark expenditures of $480 million and $40 million, respectively. Under the one-sided model, ACO1 could be entitled to savings if it achieves a 5% reduction in Medicare expenditures. Repayment mechanisms are required to cover losses. Under the one-sided model, ACO1 could receive $7,560,000 if it achieves a 5% reduction in Medicare expenditures. ACO2, with a larger MSR, could receive $231,000. Payments are capped at 7.5% of the benchmark. In the two-sided model, ACO1's share of savings is calculated differently. ACO1 and ACO2 are entitled to a percentage of savings if they meet quality performance requirements and achieve a 5% reduction in Medicare expenditures. ACO1 would receive $15,600,000 and ACO2 would receive $1,300,000. Payments are capped at 10% of the benchmark. In the two-sided model, ACOs share from the first dollar and also share in any losses. ACO1 and ACO2 are liable for any loss exceeding the 2% minimum loss rate or at most 3%. ACO1's liability to CMS is $5,040,000, while ACO2 would owe $420,000. CMS withholds 25% of any performance payment to encourage ACO participation for three years and protect against losses. CMS will notify an ACO in writing about eligibility for shared savings or losses, with payments due within 30 days. ACOs must publicly report information like name, location, contact, organizational details, and quality scores. The ACO will be responsible for publicly reporting information such as name, location, contact details, organizational information, and quality scores. CMS aims to align federal quality efforts with existing programs like PQRS and EHR incentive programs, as well as quality efforts established by PPACA. CMS plans to align measures used in the Shared Savings Program with the EHR Incentive Programs. They estimate federal savings from the program to range from $170 million to $960 million over three years. The estimated federal savings from the Shared Savings Program range from $170 million to $960 million over three years. There are no restrictions on how an ACO can distribute its share of savings, but they need to describe their distribution criteria in their application. CMS estimates start-up costs for an average ACO at $1,750,000. Expenditures for an average ACO are around $1,750,000. Some ACOs may need to repay funds to investors for start-up costs. Antitrust considerations for ACOs under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act encourage providers to form ACOs for Medicare beneficiaries. Joint action in forming ACOs may raise antitrust concerns. The formation of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may raise antitrust concerns due to potential competition reduction and harm to consumers. A fact-specific inquiry is needed for each proposed ACO to determine if antitrust laws would be violated. The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are working on creating an antitrust policy statement for the Medicare Shared Savings Program. The Agencies are collaborating on an antitrust policy statement for ACOs in the CMS Program. The proposal outlines tiers of antitrust scrutiny based on market share in the ACO's Primary Service Area. It aims to guide ACO formation without violating antitrust laws. The antitrust laws consider price-fixing and market allocation agreements as per se illegal, presuming them to be in violation without a full analysis. However, collaboration among healthcare market participants can be evaluated under the rules of reason if it provides procompetitive benefits and is necessary for integration. The FTC and DOJ use rules of reason analysis to assess joint actions in the healthcare market for anticompetitive effects. While they have standards for financial and clinical integration, specific criteria for clinical integration have not been established. In contrast, PPACA and CMS have outlined eligibility criteria for the Medicare Shared Savings Program. The DOJ and FTC have determined criteria for clinical integration in the healthcare market, which align with CMS regulations for the Medicare Shared Savings Program. These criteria include governance structure, evidence-based medicine, patient engagement, quality and cost reporting, and coordinated care. The Agencies will apply a rule of reason to ACOs using the same criteria in the commercial insurance market. The DOJ and FTC have developed criteria for clinical integration in the healthcare market, aligning with CMS regulations for the Medicare Shared Savings Program. A streamlined method for applying the rule of reason to ACOs in the program is based on ACO participants' market share in their PSA. ACOs falling within the safety zone pose minimal competitive risk and do not require notification to the Agencies unless under \"extraordinary circumstances.\" Physician group practices providing a common service must have a combined share of 30% or less in each participant's PSA. Hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers must participate on a non-exclusive basis. The safety zone for physicians and other service providers remains the same, regardless of exclusivity to the ACO, unless exceptions like the rural exception apply. The rural exception allows one non-exclusive physician per specialty from each rural county to be included in the ACO without affecting the safety zone qualification. The safety zone for physician group practices providing a common service is 30% or less in each participant's PSA. Hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers must participate on a non-exclusive basis. A dominant provider in an ACO must be non-exclusive for the ACO to qualify for the safety zone. The safety zone remains in effect for the duration of an ACO's participation in the Medicare Shared Savings Program. ACOs exceeding the 50% PSA share threshold will undergo mandatory antitrust agency review. The proposed CMS regulations require ACOs to undergo mandatory antitrust review if their share exceeds 50% for any common service provided in the same PSA. A letter from the DOJ or FTC stating no antitrust violation is needed for participation in the Medicare Shared Savings Program. Agencies will consider procompetitive benefits and market power when reviewing ACOs. The Agencies have proposed expedited antitrust reviews for ACOs exceeding the threshold. ACOs must provide detailed information on their impact on prices, competition plans, formation, and market effects within the PSA. ACOs below the threshold do not need a letter from DOJ or FTC to participate in the Medicare Shared Savings Program. ACOs outside the proposed safety zone may not require scrutiny by the FTC or DOJ if they offer procompetitive benefits. The Agencies have outlined five types of conduct to avoid, such as preventing favoritism towards certain providers. The ACO should avoid favoritism towards certain providers, not tie sales of services, avoid exclusive contracting, not restrict a commercial payer's information sharing, and avoid sharing competitively sensitive data. Compliance with these guidelines may reduce antitrust scrutiny. ACOs can request expedited review from Agencies for antitrust challenges. Proposed Statement of Antitrust Enforcement Policy open for public comment until May 31, 2011. Pioneer ACO Demonstration Program announced by CMS for experienced healthcare providers. The Pioneer ACO demonstration program announced by CMS for experienced healthcare providers aims to coordinate care for patients across different settings, transitioning to a population-based payment model separate from the Medicare Shared Savings Program. Applications are due by July 18, 2011, with details to be determined by final regulations."
