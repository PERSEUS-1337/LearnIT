    "content": "The \"Fixing America's Inconsistent Redistricting (FAIR) Act\" requires redistricting to be conducted through nonpartisan service agencies of state legislatures. The \"Fixing America's Inconsistent Redistricting (FAIR) Act\" mandates that Congressional redistricting in states must be done using a nonpartisan plan developed by a legislative branch agency and enacted into law by the state. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to ensure redistricting is done in accordance with the FAIR Act. Each state must establish a nonpartisan agency in the legislative branch to develop a redistricting plan before each redistricting year. The agency must provide services impartially and cannot advocate for any proposal. States may also designate an existing agency for this purpose. The nonpartisan agency established by each state in the legislative branch must develop a redistricting plan according to specific criteria, including adherence to the \"one person, one vote\" principle. If a state does not designate an existing agency, a new agency can be established but will terminate once the redistricting plan is enacted into law. The redistricting plan must adhere to the \"one person, one vote\" principle, ensure minimal population variation between Congressional districts, comply with the Voting Rights Act and other federal laws, and maintain contiguity of districts. The redistricting plan must adhere to the \"one person, one vote\" principle, ensure minimal population variation between Congressional districts, comply with the Voting Rights Act, and maintain contiguity of districts. Factors considered include geographic continuity, compact districts, and compliance with the Voting Rights Act, while factors prohibited include incumbent residence and voting history. The nonpartisan agency developing the redistricting plan must submit it to the State legislature and Temporary Redistricting Advisory Commission by April 1 of the redistricting year. The plan should not consider the voting history or political party affiliation of the population, except as required by State law for competitive Congressional districts. The redistricting plan must be enacted by the State legislature. Each State appoints a Temporary Redistricting Advisory Commission consisting of members appointed by majority and minority leaders of the State legislature. The State appoints a Temporary Redistricting Advisory Commission with members appointed by majority and minority leaders of the State legislature, as well as by a majority vote of the appointed members. Members must be eligible electors of the State and cannot hold partisan political office or serve as officers of a political party. The Commission provides guidance to a nonpartisan agency in developing the redistricting plan for the State. The agency's plan is reviewed by the Commission. The Commission analyzes and reviews the redistricting plan from the nonpartisan agency, holding public hearings to gather comments. Within 14 days, the Commission submits a report to the State legislature with recommendations on whether to adopt or reject the plan, considering feedback from the public hearings. The Commission reviews the redistricting plan from the nonpartisan agency, holds public hearings, and submits a report to the State legislature. The legislature must approve or reject the plan within 3 days, forwarding it to the chief executive for enactment. The Commission terminates upon the plan becoming law. The nonpartisan agency's redistricting plan is enacted into law if approved by the chief executive without amendment or if the legislature overrides a veto, with no amendments allowed. In a State where the chief executive cannot act on a redistricting plan, a plan developed by a nonpartisan agency becomes law if approved by the legislature without changes. If the legislature rejects the plan, they must provide reasons publicly. If the chief executive vetoes the redistricting plan, they must provide reasons publicly. The nonpartisan agency will then develop a revised plan within 35 days that meets the criteria set forth. The State legislature must consider and either approve or reject a revised redistricting plan developed by a nonpartisan agency within 7 days. The revised plan will be enacted following the same process as the original plan. If the State legislature rejects the revised redistricting plan developed by a nonpartisan agency, they must provide reasons for the rejection within 7 days. If the chief executive vetoes the plan and the legislature fails to override the veto, the plan will not be enacted. If the State legislature fails to override the veto, the chief executive must submit a statement of reasons within 7 days. A second revised redistricting plan consistent with criteria must be developed within 35 days by a nonpartisan agency if the plan is rejected. The State legislature must consider the second revised redistricting plan within 7 days of receiving it from a nonpartisan agency. They can either approve the plan with or without amendments and send it to the chief executive, or reject the plan. The process for enacting the second revised plan is similar to the initial plan. If the second revised redistricting plan is not enacted into law, the highest court of the State will develop and enact the plan by November 15 of the redistricting year, applying the same criteria used by the nonpartisan agency. Upon publication by the highest court of the State, the redistricting plan developed by the nonpartisan agency will be enacted into law. SEC. 5 defines \"redistricting year\" as the year when the State's chief executive officer receives notice of the number of Representatives. SEC. 6 states that the Act does not affect State or local elections. SEC. 7 specifies the effective date of the Act. The Act and its amendments will apply to Congressional redistricting after the 2020 census."
