    "content": "The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) was influenced by the Supreme Court's decision in Employment Division, Oregon Department of Human Resources v. Smith in 1990. The Court narrowed the scope of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, altering the standard of review for free exercise cases. This case involved two Native Americans who were fired for ingesting peyote in a religious ritual and were denied state unemployment benefits. The Supreme Court's decision in Employment Division v. Smith in 1990 changed the standard for free exercise cases, abandoning strict scrutiny and allowing religiously neutral laws to be applied without exemptions. This meant no religious exemption from Oregon's drug laws for Native American use of peyote. The Supreme Court's decision in Employment Division v. Smith in 1990 eliminated religious exemptions for Native American use of peyote in Oregon, leading to the denial of unemployment benefits for two Native Americans. The Court stated that the accommodation of religious practices should be determined by the political process, not the courts. In response, Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 1993 to restore the compelling interest test for cases where religious exercise is burdened. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) allows the government to burden religious exercise only if it serves a compelling interest and is the least restrictive means. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal (UDV) challenged the seizure of a hallucinogenic tea for religious ceremonies in 1999. The government argued that applying the Controlled Substances Act to the UDV's sacramental use of hoasca was necessary to protect the health and safety of members, prevent hoasca diversion, and comply with international treaties. The district court found the government failed to show a compelling interest justifying the burden on religious exercise. The government failed to demonstrate a compelling interest justifying the burden on the UDV's religious exercise. A preliminary injunction was issued prohibiting the enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act on the UDV's use of hoasca. The government appealed the injunction, challenging the lower court's decision. The government challenged the court's use of the wrong test for a preliminary injunction, argued against any waiver for UDV under the Controlled Substances Act, and cited compliance with the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances as a reason to prevent UDV from using hoasca. The government disputed the court's decision that evidence \"in equipoise\" was sufficient for issuing a preliminary injunction. The Supreme Court rejected the government's argument that a \"mere tie in the evidentiary record\" was insufficient for issuing a preliminary injunction. The Court found that the government failed to demonstrate that applying the burden to the UDV would be justified by the asserted compelling interest. The government's contention that the UDV bore the burden of disproving the compelling interests was also rejected by the Court. The Supreme Court rejected the government's argument that the Controlled Substances Act precludes any consideration of individualized exceptions for the UDV's religious practices. The government's view that no exemptions should be allowed due to the Act serving a compelling purpose was also dismissed by the Court. The Court rejected the government's argument that the Controlled Substances Act precludes exceptions for the UDV's religious practices, citing the peyote exemption for Native Americans as precedent. The Court found that the peyote exemption for Native Americans did not undermine the government's ability to enforce the law under RFRA, rejecting the government's argument based on slippery-slope concerns. RFRA mandates consideration of exceptions to rules of general applicability under the compelling interest test. The Court reaffirmed the feasibility of case-by-case consideration of religious exemptions to generally applicable rules, rejecting the government's argument that compliance with a treaty justified burdening religious exercises. The Court emphasized that invoking general interests alone is not sufficient under RFRA, affirming the Tenth Circuit's judgment and remanding the case for further proceedings. The Court remanded the case for further proceedings, leaving open the possibility for the government to establish a compelling interest justifying the burden on the UDV. The decision did not address the constitutionality of RFRA as it applies to the federal government. The impact of the decision is uncertain, focusing on a case-by-case approach for religious exemptions. It does not establish a broad precedent for religious exemptions from criminal statutes but sets a precedent for the type of evidence needed to establish a compelling interest. The government must do more than enforce an existing statute to establish a compelling interest. The government must provide more than just enforcing an existing statute to justify the burden on religious expression."
