    "content": "The \"Anti-Semitism Awareness Act of 2018\" may be cited as such. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including against Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, and members of other religious groups. The Department of Education issues Dear Colleague letters to help schools comply with Title VI, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including against religious groups like Jews, Muslims, Sikhs. Discrimination based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics violates Title VI. The Department of Education issued Dear Colleague letters in 2004 and 2010 regarding schools' obligations under Title VI to address incidents of religious discrimination, particularly against Arab Muslim, Sikh, and Jewish students. While Title VI does not cover discrimination based solely on religion, groups facing discrimination based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics are protected. Students from various backgrounds, including Jewish, Arab Muslim, and Sikh students, are facing threats and harassment in schools and on campuses based on their shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics. Anti-Semitism and discrimination on these grounds remain significant issues in educational settings. The 2010 Dear Colleague letter warned schools to address harassment promptly and effectively, but did not offer guidance on current forms of anti-Semitism, including anti-Israel or anti-Zionist discrimination. The definition and examples in section 3 help identify contemporary anti-Semitism, including discriminatory anti-Israel conduct. Understanding this definition will assist the Department of Education in investigating anti-Semitism under title VI. The Act defines anti-Semitism according to the Special Envoy's definition and examples. It also clarifies the application of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Department of Education will consider the definition of anti-Semitism when determining if a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has occurred based on Jewish ancestry or characteristics. The Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights will administer and enforce title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 in a manner consistent with a Dear Colleague letter issued in 2004. SEC. 6. OTHER RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. This Act does not expand the authority of the Secretary of Education, change the standards for determining actionable discrimination, or infringe upon existing rights under other laws. It also does not violate any rights protected under the First Amendment."
