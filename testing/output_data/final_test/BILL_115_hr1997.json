Congress finds the importance of US-Ukraine relations, the need for Ukraine's democratic transition, and past cyber intrusions targeting Ukraine's infrastructure. This led to US intervention in 2015 with a team including DOE and FBI representatives. In response to escalating cyber attacks on Ukraine's critical infrastructure, President Petro Poroshenko declared cyberspace as a new battlefield for state independence. Ukraine also cited Russian social media activities, including propaganda and offensive content, in May 2017. Following the Petya malware event in June 2017, NATO emphasized the importance of supporting Ukraine in strengthening its cyber defenses. In September 2017, the US and Ukraine held their first Bilateral Cyber Dialogue, reaffirming their commitment to an open and interoperable internet.
