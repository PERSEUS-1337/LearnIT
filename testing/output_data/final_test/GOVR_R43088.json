    "content": "The U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 1406, the Working Families Flexibility Act of 2013, on May 8, 2013. The bill would allow private sector employers to offer compensatory time off in place of overtime pay. A Senate version, S. 1623, was introduced in October 2013 but has not progressed further. The FLSA regulates weekly hours and overtime wages for most private and public sector employees. Employers must pay covered workers one and a half times their regular hourly wage for hours worked over 40 in a week, known as overtime pay. States can have shorter maximum work hours than the national minimums set by the FLSA. The FLSA regulates weekly hours and overtime wages for most private and public sector employees. Overtime pay is one and a half times the regular hourly wage for hours worked over 40 in a week. Work weeks are 168 hours, and exceeding 40 hours entitles workers to overtime wages. Certain workers are exempt from overtime provisions, such as executive, administrative, and professional employees. Regulations specify that workers under the EAP exemption must be paid a salary of at least $455 per week and meet certain job duty requirements. FLSA allows nonexempt state and local government employees to receive comp time instead of overtime pay. FLSA initially covered only private sector employees in 1938, but later extended to state and local government employees in 1966 and federal employees in 1974. However, a 1976 Supreme Court decision deemed the extension to state and local governments unconstitutional. In February 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a 1976 decision regarding overtime pay for state and local government employees. The Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1985 delayed the requirement for time-and-a-half pay until April 15, 1986, allowing for comp time instead. This was to give state and local governments time to adjust to the new standard, as many already had comp time arrangements in place. Federal employees may receive comp time in lieu of overtime pay, with one hour of comp time granted for each hour of overtime worked. Comp time must be used within 26 pay periods and can be paid out at the employee's overtime rate. Agency heads can direct employees to take comp time instead of overtime pay in certain situations. The 113th Congress passed a bill to expand comp time to the private sector, allowing employees to receive compensatory time off in lieu of monetary overtime compensation. The bill would amend the FLSA to pay comp time at one-and-a-half times the employee's hourly rate of pay, based on whether their pay is below or above the minimum pay of a GS-10 employee. Under H.R. 1406, employees can receive compensatory time off instead of monetary overtime pay, accruing up to 160 hours. It is optional for employers and employees to use comp time, with written agreements required. Employees with at least 1,000 hours of work are eligible. H.R. 1406 limits comp time eligibility to employees with 1,000 hours worked in the prior 12 months. Employees can withdraw from comp time agreements at any time and convert unused comp time to cash. Employers must comply within 30 days. Employers can end comp time with 30 days' notice. Employers cannot intimidate employees regarding comp time choices. H.R. 1406 allows employees to accrue and use compensatory time at their hourly rate, with unused time converted to cash annually. Unused comp time must be compensated by January 31 each year. H.R. 1406 allows employees to accrue and use compensatory time at their hourly rate, with unused time converted to cash annually. Payment for unused comp time must be provided within 31 days after the end of the specified work year. Employees can request conversion of unused comp time to monetary payment at any time, which the employer must comply with within 30 days. Any accrued comp time over 80 hours can be converted to monetary payment with 30 days' notice. Upon termination of employment, unused comp time must be converted to a monetary payment. Payment for accrued comp time would be at the higher rate of the employee's regular rate of pay when earned or the final rate of pay. This payment would be considered unpaid overtime compensation under H.R. 1406. H.R. 1406 requires the Government Accountability Office to submit reports to Congress on the utilization of comp time provisions, complaints, enforcement actions, and remedies. The changes to the FLSA made under this bill would expire five years after enactment."
