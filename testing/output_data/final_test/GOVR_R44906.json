    "content": "The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) was authorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act in 2015 to support the unique needs of rural schools. It offers two types of formula grants: Small, Rural School Achievement (SRSA) for small rural LEAs and Rural and Low-Income School (RLIS) for rural LEAs with high numbers of low-income students. The ESSA reauthorization updated the program by changing locale codes for LEA eligibility. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) was updated by the ESSA in 2015 to support rural schools. Changes included updating locale codes for LEA eligibility, clarifying eligibility for LEAs within educational service agencies, extending alternative state certification for RLIS, and giving LEAs the option to choose funding programs. Rural schools have advantages like close community ties, simple organizational structures, and adaptability to change. Rural schools face challenges such as fiscal limitations, resource shortages, declining enrollment, high transportation costs, and difficulties meeting academic accountability requirements. Despite these obstacles, they are visible within the community and can adapt quickly to change. Rural districts may struggle to meet ESEA requirements for academic accountability and teacher quality, facing challenges in implementing school improvement measures and ensuring certified teachers in core subjects. Additionally, they may encounter difficulties in accessing ESEA funds compared to non-rural districts. REAP was created by Congress to address the unique needs of rural schools. REAP was established by Congress to address the specific challenges faced by rural school districts, such as lack of resources and personnel to compete for federal grants. It authorizes two programs under ESEA Title V-B: SRSA for smaller districts and RLIS for larger districts with high poverty rates. These programs provide funding for a variety of educational activities. ESSA allocated $169,840,000 for REAP from 2017 to 2020, split equally between the two subparts. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 allocated $175,840,000 for the Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP). To be eligible for REAP funds, Local Education Agencies (LEAs) must be designated as rural by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) based on a typology classification system using locale codes. The curr_chunk provides a classification system for different types of territories based on population size and distance from urban areas. Small City, Large Suburb, Midsize Suburb, Small Suburb, Fringe Town, Distant Town, Remote Town, and Fringe Rural are the categories defined. The curr_chunk explains the eligibility criteria for the SRSA program based on the locale codes of 41, 42, or 43, average daily attendance, and population density requirements. The SRSA program allows the Secretary of Education to waive locale code requirements for rural areas. ESSA amendments expanded eligibility for SRSA funds to otherwise eligible LEAs within educational service agencies. LEAs losing eligibility receive declining grants through FY2019. RLIS program eligibility requires locale codes 32, 33, 41, 42, or 43 and 20% of children below the poverty line. Secretary can waive locale code requirement for RLIS based on rural area determination. Under the SRSA program, LEAs receive funds based on enrollment and subtracted amounts from other ESEA programs. RLIS grants are given to states and then subgranted to LEAs. SRSA is meant to supplement other ESEA grant funds, with an initial amount of $20,000 plus additional funds based on student enrollment. The SRSA program provides grant amounts based on student enrollment, with a maximum limit of $60,000. For example, LEAs with 50 or fewer students receive $20,000, while those with 55 students receive $20,500. LEAs with 449 students receive $59,900, and those with 450-599 students receive the maximum of $60,000. The SRSA program provides grant amounts based on student enrollment, with a maximum limit of $60,000. The final SRSA grant amount is determined by subtracting funds received from two ESEA grant programs in the prior fiscal year. If the initial SRSA grant amount is less than what was received from these programs, no funds are granted. Funds are reserved for BIE schools and outlying areas, with the remainder allotted to states based on student enrollment in eligible LEAs nationwide. The ESSA amendments allow LEAs in states not participating in the RLIS program to apply directly to the Secretary as a \"specially qualified agency.\" LEAs eligible for both SRSA and RLIS programs can choose which program to receive funds from, with a deadline set by the Secretary. REAP grants can be used for activities authorized by various ESEA programs. Table 2 displays the number of eligible LEAs in each state for FY2017, with a map in the Appendix. The ESSA amendments provide flexibility for LEAs to use funds from different programs for various activities. For example, LEAs eligible for SRSA grants can use funds from Title II-A and Title IV-A programs for SRSA authorized activities. Implementation issues may arise due to changes made by the ESSA amendments. The ESSA amendments allow LEAs to choose between SRSA and RLIS programs for funding, which may complicate grant administration. LEAs must declare their choice by a set date, but this decision is challenging due to changing grant amounts based on other participating LEAs. SRSA awards are currently larger than RLIS awards, with an average per pupil grant amount of $78 in FY2016. The ESSA amendments allow LEAs to choose between SRSA and RLIS programs for funding, creating uncertainty and administrative complications. SRSA grants average $78 per pupil, compared to $23 for RLIS. The decision may be influenced by former RLIS recipients switching to SRSA, potentially impacting grant amounts. This choice forces LEAs to decide with limited information, posing challenges for both LEAs and administrative officials."
