    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Civil Rights History Project Act of 2006\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. Congress finds that the actions of individuals in the Civil Rights movement, including well-known leaders like Thurgood Marshall and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., as well as lesser-known participants, were crucial in the fight for justice and equality. The Civil Rights movement participants hold valuable first-hand memories that should be recorded to provide a detailed history for future generations. A Federal project to collect oral histories would highlight the efforts to preserve and interpret materials related to the movement, serving as a model for future projects in museums and libraries. The purpose of this Act is to create a federally sponsored project to collect video and audio recordings of personal histories from individuals who participated in the American Civil Rights movement. The Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution will preserve and make these oral histories available to the public, serving as a model for future projects in museums and libraries. The Act aims to support local efforts in preserving the memories of individuals involved in the Civil Rights movement, allowing future generations to hear directly from them and understand their sacrifices. Establishment of joint project at Library of Congress and National Museum of African American History and Culture to collect video and audio recordings of histories of participants in American Civil Rights Movement. The Librarian of Congress and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution will establish an oral history project to survey collections of audio and video recordings of Civil Rights movement participants' reminiscences. The oral history project aims to collect video and audio recordings, as well as visual and written materials related to the personal histories of individuals who participated in the Civil Rights movement. The collected materials will be cataloged, indexed, and made available for public use through the Library of Congress and the National Museum. The Secretary will carry out duties through the Director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The Librarian and the Secretary may collaborate with other entities through agreements and partnerships to collect recordings for the oral history project. The Librarian and the Secretary may procure services, accept volunteer help, and make advance payments for collecting recordings under the project. They will begin collecting video and audio recordings as soon as possible after the enactment of the Act. The Act defines the Civil Rights movement as the movement for racial equality in the US for African Americans from 1954 to 1968, challenging segregation and achieving equal rights legislation. The Librarian and Secretary will collect audio recordings from the oldest individuals involved. SEC. 4. PRIVATE SUPPORT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS HISTORY PROJECT.
