Congress plays a key role in decisions regarding the future of U.S. nuclear weapons. The United States is grappling with the modernization of its ICBM force amid budget constraints. Congress is crucial in determining the future of U.S. nuclear weapons, with supporters emphasizing the importance of having the right mix of capabilities to address new challenges. Russia and China are also upgrading their nuclear arsenals, while North Korea and Iran pose nuclear threats. The U.S. continues to provide deterrence to allies through a \"nuclear umbrella.\" The United States is facing challenges in modernizing its ICBM force to maintain a credible nuclear deterrent. While some argue for the importance of sustaining and updating ICBMs due to their dispersed and resilient nature, others view them as outdated relics of the Cold War with limited relevance in today's security landscape. The debate over the role of ICBMs in meeting 21st-century security challenges continues amidst budget constraints and evolving global threats. In an era of constrained resources and declining defense budgets, experts argue that investing in new advanced conventional weapons would better serve U.S. security than sustaining and modernizing the ICBM force. The international security environment has changed since the Cold War, with the threat of global nuclear war becoming remote but the risk of nuclear attack increasing. Some nations may be relying more on nuclear weapons to counter U.S. conventional forces. The United States will continue to maintain secure and effective nuclear forces as long as nuclear weapons exist, playing a crucial role in deterring adversaries and reassuring allies worldwide. In \"A Nuclear Deterrent for the 21st Century,\" Clark Murdock discusses the increasing reliance on nuclear weapons by other states to offset conventional military superiority. Congress may need to evaluate the current plans for the nuclear enterprise and consider the deployment of ICBMs in the future nuclear force structure. The United States may need to consider deploying ICBMs in its future nuclear force structure despite financial constraints. Congress may question the affordability of forgoing ICBM sustainment and modernization programs in the face of evolving national security challenges. The U.S. nuclear force consists of strategic ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), land-based ICBMs, and long-range bomber aircraft, each with strengths and weaknesses. Some argue that strategic nuclear submarines and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) are the most survivable leg of the U.S. nuclear Triad. The ballistic missile submarine force has been a part of the U.S. nuclear deterrent since the 1960s. Experts argue that the SSBN leg of the Triad carry represent the most survivable leg of the U.S. nuclear Triad. Some argue single-warhead ICBMs contribute to stability, and like SLBMs are not vulnerable to air defenses. Bombers can be visibly forward deployed as a signal in crisis to strengthen deterrence of potential adversaries and assurance to allies and partners. Retaining all three legs of the Triad is justified by many analysts due to their complementary capabilities that enhance deterrence and reduce risk. The U.S. nuclear deterrent includes the SSBN leg of the Triad, with Ohio-class submarines serving as undetectable launch platforms for intercontinental missiles. The Navy deploys 14 Ohio-class SSBNs, each carrying 288 Trident II D5 SLBMs with up to eight nuclear warheads. These submarines have a service life of 42 years and are planned to be replaced starting in 2027. The Navy plans to replace one retiring Ohio-class submarine per year between 2027 and 2040 with the new SSBNX class. The first SSBNX is expected to be completed in 2031 due to a two-year delay announced in 2012. The FY2015 budget includes $1.4 billion for the Ohio-replacement program, while the FY2016 budget includes $1.2 billion for the Trident II Life Extension Program. The United States currently bases B-2 Spirit stealth bombers and B-52H Stratofortress bombers for nuclear missions. The Air Force Base in LA is equipped for nuclear missions with B-2 bombers carrying B61 gravity bombs and B-52s delivering gravity bombs or nuclear-armed air-launched cruise missiles. Strategic bombers offer advantages like the ability to be recalled after launch and launch quickly to survive a nuclear first strike. The Air Force is developing a new long-range penetrating bomber with nuclear capabilities, the LRS-B, with a procurement plan of 80-100 bombers at an estimated cost of $40-60 billion. The Pentagon's FY2014 budget includes $359 million for research and development of the bomber. The Air Force is investing in research and development for a new long-range bomber, the LRS-B, with plans to spend $32.1 billion over the next ten years. They are also developing a new nuclear-armed cruise missile, the LRSO, to replace the ALCM. The B-2 fleet is being modernized to extend its service life and enhance its capabilities, with over $1 billion to be invested in upgrades for survivability and mission effectiveness. The United States Air Force plans to retain 400 ICBMs under the 2010 New START Treaty, reducing warheads in Minuteman III missiles to meet START II levels. These ICBMs are geographically dispersed in hardened silos, making them difficult for adversaries to destroy. They are considered the \"promptest leg of the triad\" for launching a nuclear attack quickly. The Air Force has pursued programs to improve Minuteman fleet accuracy and reliability through 2030, addressing aging and technology issues in propulsion, guidance, and reentry systems. Currently, the ICBM fuse modernization program aims to replace the MK21 warhead fuse for operation until 2030, with plans to procure 693 modernized fuses at a cost of $830 million. Additionally, the Air Force is funding programs under the ICBM Dem/Val title to create technologies supporting the existing Minuteman fleet. The Air Force plans to sustain and modernize the Minuteman III missiles through 2030 and deploy a follow-on system after 2030. Large-scale investment is required for modernization efforts to support both sustainment and recapitalization. The Air Force is pursuing a \"hybrid\" plan for the future ICBM program. The Air Force plans to pursue a \"hybrid\" plan for the next generation ICBM, maintaining the basic design and infrastructure of the Minuteman missiles but replacing key components. The new missile could be deployed in fixed silos initially but designed for potential future use on mobile launchers. The Air Force has allocated $75 million for the program in FY2016, with an expected total expenditure of $945 million through FY2020. There are concerns about fiscal constraints potentially impacting the development of a new ground-based strategic deterrent. The RAND Corporation outlined six options to modernize the ICBM force, ranging from basic sustainment to acquiring a new system with increasing sophistication levels. Options include continuing incremental modernization of the current Minuteman system or acquiring a new all-new-design ICBM with alternative basing. The RAND Corporation outlined six options to modernize the ICBM force, ranging from basic sustainment to acquiring a new system with increasing sophistication levels. One option is to acquire an all-new-design ICBM with alternative basing schemes, which could cost significantly more than incremental modernization of the Minuteman III system. The RAND Corporation proposed six options to modernize the ICBM force, including acquiring a new missile for expanded targeting options and improved accuracy. The cost of replacing the Minuteman force was found to be lower than upgrading the current arsenal from FY2012 to FY2050. The Air Force has faced morale and operational questions since a 2007 incident at Minot Air Force Base involving nuclear warheads on B-52s. The Air Force identified safety and security issues, lack of professional pride, and cheating on proficiency exams at the 341st Missile Wing. Reports of drug use and morale problems led to concerns about the nuclear enterprise. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel initiated internal and external reviews focusing on people, systems, and infrastructure. The internal review of the DOD focused on the nuclear triad's support systems, training, testing, command oversight, and investment. It revealed systemic problems across the nuclear enterprise, including long-standing issues that were unaddressed, corrective actions that worsened problems, and lack of communication to leadership. The review concluded that the nuclear deterrent is currently safe, secure, and effective, but immediate action is needed to address the identified problems. The review identified personnel issues such as accountability, manning, skills mix, career development, morale, and recognition in the nuclear enterprise. It also found problems with the personnel reliability program and security forces. Inspections revealed a culture of excessive inspections in the Air Force. The independent review identified issues in the Air Force related to a culture of excessive inspections and a demand for perfection. It also highlighted challenges in the aging nuclear infrastructure, leading to difficulties in sustainment and investment. The review aimed to address leadership, organization, investment, morale, and policy shortcomings affecting the nuclear deterrent mission. The review team identified significant disconnects between leadership expectations and empowering forces to meet them, as well as discrepancies in personnel system measurements and workload demands. Inefficiencies were noted in logistics support and training quality, with issues stemming from micromanagement and excessive security demands. The review team identified inefficiencies in logistics support and training quality due to micromanagement and excessive security demands. Recommendations include the Secretary of Defense taking back the nuclear mission, establishing support programs, and prioritizing the nuclear mission with equal personnel, logistics, and funding support. Transition from a culture of micromanagement to empowerment of qualified individuals is advised. The Air Force has implemented reforms in response to reviews providing observations and recommendations for the missile force. Cheating incidents in the Navy and Air Force raised concerns about integrity despite a focus on integrity in Service cultures. Tests have shifted from measuring qualifications to career-defining events. The cheating in missile testing programs stemmed from pressures related to career progression and livelihood impact. The review recommended focusing on necessary knowledge for the mission without demanding higher grades. Issues raised included the intensity of ICBM combat crew duty and uncertainty in the missileer career path. ICBM combat crew duty is high pressure and vital to national security. Missile crews seek ways to reduce primary combat crew duty by excelling in proficiency exams. This contrasts with Air Force flight crews who prefer more time in the air. The long-term viability of the ICBM officer career is uncertain due to the need for junior officers on combat crews over other ICBM-related assignments. The review team recommended enhancing recognition and rewards for ICBM duty, including narrowing career path choices and offering special pay incentives. They also suggested giving full authority to Missile Combat Crew Commanders to execute their duties and be held accountable, displaying trust in their abilities. The review team identified issues with the \"nuclear enterprise\" within the services and DOD, highlighting a lack of clarity in responsibility and accountability. Recommendations were made to strengthen the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Staff's expertise in nuclear operations. The OSD oversees the nuclear enterprise, with different offices responsible for warheads, development of new platforms, and weapons policy. The Nuclear Weapons Council was created to manage the U.S. nuclear stockpile. The review team recommended realigning OSD and the Joint Staff structures to integrate nuclear activities across the entire enterprise, including policy, strategy, mission, platforms, weapons, and support. Issues within the Air Force, such as logistics changes and base closures, have strained the missile force. The team suggested creating a nuclear enterprise within the Air Force that encompasses various commands. Proposed changes to the nuclear arsenal may require significant funding. The Department of Defense (DOD) is requesting a 10% annual spending increase over the next five years to implement recommendations for modernizing the nuclear arsenal. This funding is in addition to the billions already requested for modernizing each leg of the nuclear triad. DOD plans to use the funds to improve morale, refurbish launch centers, and replace aging strategic nuclear forces in the triad. Congress will need to decide on modernizing or replacing U.S. nuclear delivery systems in the next two decades. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the Administration's plans for nuclear forces would cost $348 billion over the 2015-2024 period, averaging about $35 billion annually. The Air Force is revamping the ICBM leg of the nuclear triad, with several significant issues for Congress to consider. The Air Force is pursuing various tracks to sustain the current Minuteman force and modernize the ICBM force. The President's Budget request in FY2016 includes funding for nuclear enterprise improvements, such as facility upgrades, manning, safety procedures, and technology upgrades. DOD leadership is seeking funds to address recommendations for the nuclear enterprise and plans to increase nuclear spending by 10% annually over the next five years. This would result in at least a $7.5 billion increase between 2016 and 2020, with the 2016 budget requesting $8 billion in new spending. The 2016 budget request calls for $8 billion in new spending on the nuclear force over the next five years, including about $1 billion for FY2016. Secretary Hagel promised more troops, trainers, equipment, and leadership to nuclear forces. The Department of Defense initiated the Force Improvement Program (FIP), which includes incentive pay, bonuses for missileers, exchange programs, and infrastructure upgrades at missile bases. Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James supports implementing changes to improve morale and shift the culture of the nuclear force. The changes to the nuclear force aim to improve morale and shift from a culture of constant preparation. The workforce is mostly positive towards leadership actions, with 98% of the Force Improvement Program's recommendations implemented. Secretary Hagel established the Nuclear Deterrent Enterprise Review Group (NDERG) to ensure senior leader accountability and coherence in the nuclear force. Deputy Secretary Bob Work leads this group to review progress in the health of nuclear forces. Additionally, the Office of the Secretary of Defense/Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (OSD/CAPE) tracks and assesses the implementation of these programs. The Office of the Secretary of Defense/Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (OSD/CAPE) is leading efforts to track and assess the implementation of recommendations from internal and external reviews regarding the nuclear deterrent enterprise. Congress may request updates on the progress of these programs, with approximately $1.00 billion in additional funding allocated for the Department of Defense nuclear enterprise in the fiscal year 2016 budget. Sustained leadership, follow-through, and investment are deemed necessary for the revitalization of the nuclear enterprise. The committee emphasizes the need for sustained leadership and resources to revitalize the nuclear enterprise, with a focus on improving culture and leadership standards. Experts believe that Air Force initiatives are making a difference, as indicated by increased retention rates for missile combat crews. However, more work is needed to continue progress in the program. Some skeptics doubt that increasing resources and commitment is the solution to revitalizing the nuclear enterprise. They argue that nuclear weapons are no longer relevant in today's security environment. Addressing underlying issues, such as the lack of meaning in the mission for ICBM forces, is crucial for improving morale and effectiveness. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel emphasized the need to change the cultural perception of the nuclear enterprise to address morale issues. Some argue that the U.S. is transitioning from the Cold War era to a new era with different threats, making nuclear weapons less relevant. Those working with nuclear weapons have not been involved in recent wars and hope to avoid being called upon. The United States is planning to update and modernize its nuclear force, including the ICBM arsenal. Congress may need to consider the future role of ICBMs in the nation's defense strategy and whether they should continue to be deployed in light of expected financial constraints. The United States is planning to update and modernize its nuclear force, including the ICBM arsenal, amidst expected financial constraints. The Department of Energy is investing in life extension programs for U.S. nuclear warheads through the Stockpile Stewardship Program, avoiding the need for underground nuclear tests. Instead of designing new warheads, DOE focuses on managing and maintaining the stockpile through Life Extension Programs (LEPs) and infrastructure investments. Investments in infrastructure and workforce are crucial for the long-term safety and effectiveness of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. However, these investments could add to the cost of modernizing nuclear delivery systems, reaching over $30 billion per year in the 2020s and totaling more than $1 trillion over 30 years. Affordability problems may arise, leading to questions about pursuing all programs, with suggestions to forgo ICBM modernization programs. The United States may need to reconsider the role of ICBMs in national defense due to the high costs associated with modernizing nuclear delivery systems. The Administration's plans for nuclear forces could cost $348 billion over the 2015-2024 period, with $299 billion budgeted by DOD and DOE for various nuclear-related activities. Congress may need to assess the changing U.S. nuclear strategy and the necessity of ICBMs in today's security landscape. The U.S. nuclear strategy has evolved since the Cold War, with nuclear weapons still seen as crucial for deterring their use by other states. A \"second nuclear age\" has emerged, with the threat of nuclear terrorism and proliferation surpassing traditional nuclear-armed states. Future U.S. nuclear strategy must address these new threats, as some argue that current strategic nuclear forces are not equipped to combat them effectively. Some argue that ICBMs are outdated relics of the Cold War, no longer relevant in today's security environment. They suggest shifting focus away from nuclear weapons towards more practical defense strategies. Others believe ICBMs still serve as a deterrent against nuclear attacks on the homeland. Some argue that ICBMs are essential for deterring nuclear attacks on the United States due to their invulnerability and the direct threat they pose to potential enemies. Congress may need to reconsider supporting the nation's ICBM force amidst ongoing debates about their value in defense strategies. Some analysts question the need for the United States to continue supporting its ICBM force, arguing that the current security environment is better addressed by focusing on preventing nuclear terrorism and proliferation. They believe that the Cold War-designed ICBM force may not be suited to address modern threats such as terrorists and rogue regimes seeking nuclear weapons. The urgent priorities in nuclear security are preventing nuclear terrorism and proliferation. Analysts highlight concerns about weapon-grade nuclear materials stored in insecure locations worldwide and the availability of nuclear weaponry technology on the black market. While some argue that terrorist organizations currently lack access to nuclear weapons, there is a possibility in states with lax security or political instability. North Korea and Iran have violated nonproliferation obligations and pursued missile capabilities, posing a threat to international security efforts. The United States faces challenges in strategic security from Russia and China, and could address them through dialogue and transparency to foster goodwill and partnerships. This could help prevent neighboring countries from pursuing nuclear weapons in response to instability created by countries like North Korea and Iran. The United States aims to clarify that its missile defenses are for regional threats, not to impact the strategic balance with Russia. A strategic dialogue with China would allow both nations to discuss nuclear strategies and address concerns over ballistic missile defenses. Maintaining strategic stability with China is crucial, and the US is willing to collaborate with them. The U.S. emphasizes willingness to work with China while supporting allies in East Asia. Concerns persist over Russia's actions like the invasion of Ukraine and violation of the INF Treaty. China's assertiveness in the East and South China Seas raises worries about U.S. interests. Both countries are modernizing their nuclear forces, impacting the U.S. relationship. Some experts argue that the U.S. must maintain nuclear parity with Russia and nuclear superiority over China to ensure stability and security. They believe that a credible presence on the world stage requires prioritizing nuclear forces and capabilities. Admiral Cecil Haney, Commander of U.S. Strategic Command, emphasized the importance of the U.S. nuclear triad for strategic stability in a press conference. He warned against underfunding strategic capabilities, stating that any cuts to the budget would hinder modernization efforts and weaken national security. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter has not addressed this issue. The current ICBM force, in service since the 1970s, needs to be replaced for future viability. The Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) program aims to develop a modernized replacement missile. The President's FY2016 budget includes funds for the GBSD, with Congress playing a key role in its future."
