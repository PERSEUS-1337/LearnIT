The new policy only requires an updated passport and a visa from the destination country. Despite the initial positive outlook on this change, its significance will depend on how it is enforced. Thousands of Cubans queued at migration offices and travel agencies on the first day. However, concerns remain about political detentions in the country, with a 60% increase reported in 2012 compared to 2011. In 2012, the State Department expressed concern about Cuba's use of arbitrary detention and violence to silence critics. The Senate approved a resolution calling for the release of Alan Gross, a USAID subcontractor imprisoned in Cuba since 2009. Gross filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government and his employer for failing to disclose risks during his work on a democracy project in Cuba. On November 7, 2012, Cuban security agents arrested government critic Antonio Rodiles, charging him with \"resisting authority.\" Rodiles, a coordinator of the \"Citizens' Demand for Another Cuba\" initiative, was released on November 26, 2012, after Amnesty International's appeal. He was warned against continuing activism in Cuba. On November 2, 2012, Cuba announced that an oil well drilled offshore by a Venezuelan company was not viable. The Italian-owned oil rig left for West Africa on November 14, marking a setback for Cuba's efforts to develop offshore oil resources. Congressional concerns over Cuba's political and economic developments have been ongoing, with U.S. policy towards the island nation being a significant issue. Congress has played a significant role in shaping U.S. policy towards Cuba since the Cold War, enacting measures to strengthen economic sanctions while providing roadmaps for normalization of relations. Recent debates have focused on U.S. sanctions, particularly travel restrictions to Cuba. The George W. Bush Administration initially eased U.S. family travel to Cuba in 2003 but tightened restrictions in 2004 due to Cuba's crackdown on dissidents. In 2009, Congress passed legislation to ease restrictions on family travel and agricultural exports. The Obama Administration further lifted restrictions on family travel, cash remittances, and migration talks in 2009. In 2011, restrictions on educational and religious travel to Cuba were eased, along with non-family remittances. The report analyzes Cuba's political and economic situation, U.S. policy towards Cuba, and key issues in U.S.-Cuban relations. It includes discussions on historical background, human rights, political prisoners, economic policy changes under Ra\u00fal Castro, and U.S. policy under the Obama Administration. The third section delves into key issues in U.S.-Cuban relations, including travel restrictions, remittances, agricultural exports, trademark sanctions, anti-drug cooperation, offshore development, terrorism concerns, democracy projects, broadcasting, and migration. Cuba gained independence in 1902 after being a Spanish colony from 1492 to 1898. The Spanish-American War in 1898 led to Cuba gaining independence in 1902 after being a Spanish colony for centuries. The United States ruled Cuba for four years post-war and retained the right to intervene to maintain stability. The Platt Amendment, part of the Cuban Constitution of 1901, allowed for U.S. intervention until its repeal in 1934. Cuba's political system underwent changes following these events. In 1921, order was restored in Cuba, but the Platt Amendment was repealed in 1934. Cuba's political system saw domination by authoritarian figures, including Gerardo Machado and Fulgencio Batista. Batista's rule turned into a brutal dictatorship, leading to popular unrest and Fidel Castro's rise to power through an unsuccessful attack on military barracks in 1953. Fidel Castro rose to power in Cuba after leading a revolutionary movement from the Sierra Maestra to overthrow the Batista dictatorship. He ruled for over 45 years, consolidating his power, repressing dissent, and aligning with the Soviet Union while relations with the United States deteriorated. Castro stepped down in 2006 due to poor health, after promising a return to democratic rule but instead implementing authoritarian measures. After rising to power in Cuba, Fidel Castro aligned with the Soviet Union and declared the Cuban revolution socialist. Cuba became a close ally of the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. Castro ruled by decree until 1976 when a new Constitution established the Cuban Communist Party as the leading force in state and society. Legislative authority was vested in a National Assembly of People's Power. The National Assembly of People's Power in Cuba meets twice annually, with a Council of State acting on its behalf when not in session. The president of the Council of State serves as the head of state and government. Fidel Castro held this position from 1976 until February 2008, despite temporarily stepping down in 2006 due to poor health. He was re-elected to the National Assembly in January 2008. Fidel Castro announced his departure as president of the Council of State in February 2008, confirming his retirement from leading the Cuban government. This marked a stable political succession to his brother Ra\u00fal Castro. Ra\u00fal Castro officially became Cuba's president on February 24, 2008, after serving as the designated successor to Fidel Castro. Despite Fidel still holding the title of first secretary of the PCC, Ra\u00fal took over key positions in the government. In 2008, Ra\u00fal Castro officially became Cuba's president, succeeding his brother Fidel. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado Ventura was appointed as the Council of State's first vice president, known for being a hard-line communist party ideologue. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado Ventura, a hard-line communist party ideologue, is the official successor to Ra\u00fal Castro according to the Cuban Constitution. Carlos Lage, responsible for Cuba's economic reforms in the 1990s, was expected to be chosen as first vice president but Machado's position is significant. General Julio Casas Regueiro, a key military officer and confidant of Ra\u00fal, also became a member of the Council of State, increasing the military's role in the government. Casas Regueiro was selected as the country's new minister of the FAR, officially replacing Ra\u00fal. In March 2009, Ra\u00fal orchestrated a government shake-up that combined four ministries into two and ousted a dozen high-ranking officials, including Foreign Minister Felipe P\u00e9rez Roque, Council of Ministers Secretary Carlos Lage, and Minister of Economy and Planning Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodriguez Garc\u00eda. Casas Regueiro, chairman of GAESA, was selected as the new minister of the FAR, replacing Ra\u00fal. He died in 2011 and was replaced by Gen. Leopoldo Cintra Fr\u00edas. In March 2009, Ra\u00fal Castro orchestrated a government shake-up, combining ministries and ousting high-ranking officials including Foreign Minister Felipe P\u00e9rez Roque and Council of Ministers Secretary Carlos Lage. The changes were part of Ra\u00fal's efforts to make the government more efficient. Perez Roque was replaced by diplomat Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla, while Lage was replaced by military General Jos\u00e9 Amado Guerra. Their simultaneous ouster was unexpected as they represented different tendencies within Cuba's communist political system. Ra\u00fal Castro orchestrated a government shake-up in March 2009, ousting high-ranking officials including Foreign Minister Felipe P\u00e9rez Roque and Council of Ministers Secretary Carlos Lage. The move was seen as a way for Ra\u00fal to replace Fidelistas with his own supporters and to remove potential contenders for power in a post-Castro Cuba. Observers noted that Ra\u00fal was putting his mark on the Cuban government bureaucracy through these changes. Ra\u00fal Castro's government shake-up in March 2009 aimed to make the Cuban government more efficient by appointing relatively unknown technocrats as ministers and bringing in more military officials. While some limited economic reforms were implemented, tight government control over the political system remains unchanged. The reduced number of political prisoners is seen as a sign of less repression, but overall, the situation has not significantly improved. The Cuban Communist Party's sixth congress in April 2011 saw changes to Cuba's economic model and political leadership. Fidel Castro was officially replaced by Ra\u00fal as first secretary, and the party's Political Bureau was reduced in size with new members added. Despite some improvements, concerns remain about government intimidation tactics and short-term detentions. At the April 2011 party congress, Ra\u00fal Castro proposed two five-year term limits for top positions in the party and government, aiming for systematic rejuvenation. This change was confirmed at a January 2012 PCC national conference, potentially paving the way for political succession to a younger generation. Cuba's revolutionary leadership has been criticized for staying in power too long without passing leadership opportunities. Leadership changes were expected at the January 2012 meeting, but did not occur. At the January 2012 meeting, leadership changes were expected but did not occur. The conference approved a resolution allowing the replacement of up to 20% of the PCC Central Committee members. Analysts were disappointed by the lack of significant political reforms. Cuba is scheduled to hold elections in February 2013 for over 600 National Assembly members and 1,200 provincial government representatives for five-year terms. The National Assembly will then select the next president of the Council of State within 45 days. Most observers expect Ra\u00fal Castro to be reselected as Cuba's head of government for a five-year term. Critics argue that the elections are controlled by the Communist Party, with limited opposition. Ricardo Alarc\u00f3n, the former president of the National Assembly, will not seek re-election, sparking speculation about potential leadership changes. Cuba's poor human rights record includes severe restrictions on freedoms of expression, association, and movement. The Cuban government has faced criticism for its poor human rights record, including restrictions on freedoms of expression, association, and movement. Despite some improvements such as the release of political prisoners, there are still reports of government attacks on activists and dissidents. Public discussion on economic and social issues has increased, but political detentions and harassment of critics continue. Cuba signed two U.N. human rights treaties in 2008, but has not ratified them or taken significant action to ensure civil and political freedoms. Human rights activists urge the government to implement the guarantees in the covenants. In a symbolic move, the Cuban government lifted the ban on Cubans staying at tourist hotels, ending \"tourism apartheid.\" However, dissent continues to be suppressed by Cuban authorities. Cuban authorities have been criticized for their poor human rights record, with activists like the Ladies in White calling for the release of political prisoners through peaceful protests. In 2008, members of the group were forcibly removed from a park in Havana for demanding freedom. The Ladies in White protested near the Plaza of the Revolution in Havana to demand the release of their imprisoned husbands and other members of the \"group of 75\". Cuban security forces and government-orchestrated mobs forcefully broke up the protests in March 2010. Despite facing harassment, they were allowed to resume their weekly marches with the help of Cardinal Jaime Ortega in May 2010. However, they continued to face harassment, including \"acts of repudiation\" by mobs in March 2011. In August 2011, pro-government mobs attacked members of the Ladies in White in Santiago and Havana as they tried to peacefully protest. The group faced harassment and attacks, with police using tear gas to disrupt their street march in Palma Soriano. Amnesty International and the Department of State called for an end to the violence against the human rights group. In September 2011, pro-government supporters prevented the Ladies in White in Havana from attending Mass on the feast day of the Virgin of Mercy. In October 2011, Laura Poll\u00e1n, a leader of the Ladies in White, died from respiratory complications. Two human rights activists, Ivonne Malleza Galano and Ignacio Mart\u00ednez Montejo, were arrested in November 2011 after a peaceful protest in Havana. Amnesty International adopted them as prisoners of conscience. They were released in January 2012 and warned against continuing their dissident activities. In February 2012, Cuban Archbishop Dionisio Garcia helped evacuate 14 members of the Ladies in White from El Cobre Basilica in Santiago, Cuba, due to threats of police beatings. Repression against the group increased before Pope Benedict XVI's visit in March 2012, with detentions to prevent their participation. In June 2012, the Ladies in White met with Cardinal Ortega to improve Church-dissident relations, with leader Berta Soler asking for help to stop government repression. Amnesty International urged Cuban authorities to either charge or release three protestors detained in March 2012, including Ladies in White members Niurka Luque \u00c1lvarez and Sonia Garro Alfonso. Luque \u00c1lvarez was released pending trial, while Garro Alfonso and her husband remain incarcerated. Additionally, 68 members of the Ladies in White were arrested in September 2012 but were all released by the next day after being detained en route to a Havana event. On October 14, 2012, 22 members of the Ladies in White were detained to prevent them from commemorating the one-year anniversary of their leader's death. On December 9, 2012, over 90 members were reportedly beaten and detained. Independent Cuban blogs critical of the government are hosted on overseas servers, countered by a team of 1,000 official Cuban bloggers. Yoani S\u00e1nchez's blog, Generaci\u00f3n Y, has gained international attention since 2007. Yoani S\u00e1nchez gained international attention for her website, Generaci\u00f3n Y, critical of the Cuban government. In 2008, she won Spain's Ortega y Gasset award for digital journalism but was denied an exit permit to accept it. In 2009, S\u00e1nchez and other bloggers were assaulted by state security agents. In 2012, she was denied an exit visa by the Cuban government. In early February 2012, Yoani S\u00e1nchez was denied an exit visa by the Cuban government to travel to Brazil for a documentary screening on freedom of expression. This denial highlighted the Cuban government's practice of forbidding citizens from leaving without official permission. S\u00e1nchez aimed to test Cuba's new migration policy, which eliminated the required \"exit permit\" starting January 14, 2013. She and other dissidents were detained for 30 hours in October 2012 after traveling to the city. In early October 2012, dissidents were detained for about 30 hours after traveling to Bayamo to cover the trial of a Spanish politician accused of causing the death of Oswaldo Pay\u00e1. The Cuban government conducted a severe crackdown in March 2003, imprisoning 75 democracy activists, but talks with the Cuban Catholic Church led to their release by March 2011. Over 125 political prisoners have been released since mid-2010, with most going into exile in Spain. In April 2012, the Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation reported that there were at least 50 political prisoners in Cuba, compared to over 200 in 2010. Two Cuban political prisoners conducting hunger strikes have died in recent years. The accurate number of political prisoners is difficult to determine due to the Cuban government denying access to independent monitors. The Cuban government released almost 3,000 prisoners in late December 2011 in anticipation of Pope Benedict XVI's visit. The Cuban government released around 3,000 prisoners in late December 2011, including about 7 political prisoners. In May 2012, they claimed to have released over 10,000 prisoners in the past six months, leaving around 57,000 incarcerated. However, the CCDHRN estimates the actual number to be between 65,000 and 70,000. The death of Cuban dissident Orlando Zapata Tamayo in 2010 brought attention to the plight of political prisoners in Cuba. He died after an 83-day hunger strike, demanding the release of political prisoner Oscar Biscet. In January 2004, Amnesty International declared Orlando Zapata a prisoner of conscience. He was sentenced to three years in prison for various charges, but ended up serving a total of 36 years. His death in 2010 sparked international concern about human rights abuses in Cuba, leading to calls for the release of political prisoners and respect for basic rights. President Obama expressed deep concern over the situation and called for an end to repression. The death of Orlando Zapata in 2010 sparked international concern about human rights abuses in Cuba, leading to calls for the release of political prisoners and respect for basic rights. Amnesty International and the European Parliament criticized Cuba's repression of political dissidents, calling for the release of prisoners and inviting international human rights experts to verify respect for human rights. Spain also urged the release of Cuban political prisoners. The death of Orlando Zapata in 2010 sparked international concern about human rights abuses in Cuba. President Ra\u00fal Castro expressed regret but denied torture or murder in Cuba. Cuban dissidents protested and some went on hunger strikes, including Guillermo Fari\u00f1as. Fari\u00f1as ended his strike in July 2010 after the Cuban government agreed to release 52 political prisoners. In 2012, Wilman Villar Mendoza died in custody. The death of Wilman Villar Mendoza in 2012, following a 50-day hunger strike after being convicted of \"contempt\" of authority, sparked international concern. The Cuban government tried to portray him as a common criminal, but human rights organizations blamed the government for his death. Amnesty International called his death a \"shocking reminder\" of the government's intolerance for dissent. The White House described Villar Mendoza as a \"young and courageous defender of human rights\" and highlighted ongoing repression in Cuba. The Senate approved S.Res. 366 honoring dissident Wilman Villar Mendoza and condemning the Castro regime for his death. Human rights groups report a deteriorating situation in Cuba, with an increase in short-term detentions. Cuban authorities claim dissident Juan Wilfredo Soto Garcia died of natural causes after being beaten by police. Press rights groups detail continued government persecution of independent journalists. The Cuban government has been persecuting independent journalists through arbitrary arrests, beatings, and intimidation. The number of short-detentions for political reasons increased significantly in 2011 and 2012, with a total of 6,602 detentions in 2012. Amnesty International reported that the government harasses political opponents to prevent them from demanding civil and political rights, despite the release of political prisoners in 2011. Amnesty International criticized Cuba for not improving human rights despite releasing political prisoners in 2011. The government used new tactics like intimidation, harassment, and surveillance to suppress dissent. In 2012, a Senate hearing on human rights in Cuba featured Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson and Cuban activists, one of whom was later arrested and beaten by Cuban police. On June 9, Cuban police arrested and beat a government critic in Villa Clara, who was released five days later. U.S. Senators, including John F. Kerry, condemned the Cuban government for intimidation tactics. In November 2012, security agents arrested Antonio Rodiles for \"resisting authority\" along with other dissidents. Amnesty International called for Rodiles' immediate release. Antonio Rodiles, a government critic in Cuba, was arrested in November 2012 for \"resisting authority\" but was released on November 26, 2012. Amnesty International called for his immediate release and warned him against continuing his activism in Cuba. Rodiles is a coordinator of the \"Citizens' Demand for Another Cuba\" initiative, urging the Cuban government to uphold human rights treaties. Antonio Rodiles, a Cuban government critic and coordinator of the \"Estado de Sats\" forum, promotes open debate on cultural, social, and political issues. In November 2012, Cuban authorities assaulted journalist Guillermo Fari\u00f1as and threatened Elizardo S\u00e1nchez after attending a civil society meeting. Amnesty International called for an investigation and an end to harassment of those exercising freedom of expression. Pope Benedict XVI visited Cuba in March 2012, the first papal visit since 1998. The Pope's visit to Cuba in 2012 marked the first papal visit since 1998, coinciding with the 400th anniversary of Our Lady of Charity. He celebrated mass in Santiago and Havana, highlighting the Catholic Church's increased influence in Cuba and its efforts to engage with the government. The Cuban Catholic Church's influence grew in the 1990s with bishops openly criticizing the government, leading to Archbishop Ortega becoming a Cardinal in 1994. Under his leadership, Caritas Cuban expanded its social assistance work, and a seminary was opened in 2010. The Church has been vocal about the need for change in Cuba through publications like Palabra Nueva and Espacio Laical. The Cuban Catholic Church, led by Cardinal Ortega, played a key role in engaging with the government on political prisoners, resulting in the release of over 125 prisoners. Pope Benedict's visit in 2012 urged Cubans to strive for a more open and just society, referencing Father Felix Varela as a model for social transformation. During his visit to Cuba, Pope Benedict XVI emphasized reconciliation and the need for social transformation. He criticized U.S. economic sanctions as unfair to the Cuban people. Some criticized the Pope for not confronting the Cuban government more forcefully or meeting with dissidents. Some in the dissident community felt the Cuban Catholic Church lost credibility due to the Pope's visit, while others highlight the Church's support for political prisoners and the Ladies in White. Cardinal Jaime Ortega faced criticism for not openly confronting the government, especially for defending the eviction of dissidents in 2012. The Cardinal in Cuba faced strong criticism for his perceived ties to the government, with some calling him a \"lackey.\" Despite this, defenders point to his support for political prisoners and dialogue in the country. The Catholic Church, as Cuba's largest independent civil society group, is expected to continue playing a significant role in the country's changing landscape. On July 22, 2012, Cuban democracy activist Oswaldo Pay\u00e1 was killed in a car accident in Granma province. Pay\u00e1 founded the Christian Liberation Movement in 1988 and the Varela Project in 1996, advocating for peaceful democratic change and human rights. His death will impact Cuba's future political and economic changes. The Varela Project, initiated by Cuban democracy activist Oswaldo Pay\u00e1, aimed for political reform through a national plebiscite. Over 11,000 signatures were submitted to the National Assembly, surpassing the required amount. Former President Jimmy Carter highlighted the project's significance in promoting peaceful change through direct voting for the country's future. In response to the Varela Project, the Cuban government held a referendum in 2002, amending the Constitution to declare socialism irrevocable. Despite a crackdown in 2003, the project persisted, with activist Oswaldo Pay\u00e1 delivering signatures for democratic reforms. Pay\u00e1's death garnered global sympathy, with the White House and State Department praising his dedication to human rights in Cuba. The State Department and Members of Congress praised Oswaldo Pay\u00e1's leadership and dedication to political dissent and fundamental freedoms in Cuba. Pay\u00e1's death was mourned globally, with calls for democratic reforms in Cuba. Senator Bill Nelson introduced a resolution honoring Pay\u00e1's life and leadership, urging the Cuban government to allow impartial third-party involvement. The resolution condemns the Cuban government for detaining pro-democracy activists after Oswaldo Pay\u00e1's death. Carromero Barrios was convicted of vehicular manslaughter in Cuba, sentenced to four years in prison, and later repatriated to Spain. He was released from prison in January 2013 under a work-release program. Cuba's economy is state-controlled, with key sectors including tourism, nickel and cobalt mining, and a biotechnology industry. Remittances from abroad, especially from the United States, are a significant source of hard currency for Cuba. Cuba's economy heavily relies on remittances from abroad, particularly from the United States, amounting to over $1 billion annually. The sugar industry has drastically declined over the past two decades, with production dropping from 8.4 million tons in 1990 to 1.4 million tons in 2012. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba faced severe economic challenges from 1989 to 1993, with a decline of 35% to 50%. However, there has been significant improvement since 1994, with average annual economic growth of 3.7% due to limited market-oriented reforms. Notably, the economy experienced strong growth from 2004 to 2008, reaching 11.2% in 2005, 12.1% in 2006, and 7.3% in 2007 before slowing to 4.1% in 2008. Cuba's economy saw growth from 2004 to 2008, benefiting from tourism, nickel, and oil sectors, as well as support from Venezuela and China. However, economic growth slowed to 1.4% in 2009 due to the global financial crisis, lower world prices for nickel, reduced tourism, and hurricane damage. Austerity measures were implemented, but growth improved slightly in 2010 with 2.4% growth. Cuba's economy experienced growth from 2004 to 2008, driven by tourism, nickel, and oil sectors, as well as support from Venezuela and China. However, growth slowed to 1.4% in 2009 due to various factors. Economic growth improved slightly in 2010 with 2.4% growth. Since then, Cuba has made efforts to expand the private sector and boost productivity, aiming for an average economic growth of over 4% in the 2013-2017 period. Cuba has also achieved high levels of life expectancy and adult literacy, with a per capita income level higher than many other countries in the Americas. In 1993, Cuba implemented market-oriented economic reforms, allowing Cubans to use U.S. dollars, engage in self-employment, and establish agricultural cooperatives. The government also opened agricultural and artisan markets, and permitted private food catering, including home restaurants. In 1993, Cuba implemented market-oriented economic reforms, allowing the use of U.S. dollars and self-employment. The government also approved new foreign investment laws and established free trade zones. However, in the early 2000s, the government began to backtrack on reforms, making it difficult for small entrepreneurs. In 2004, Cuban government restricted dollar use by state companies for non-core services. Ra\u00fal Castro's 2006 provisional power raised hopes for economic changes. In 2007, he acknowledged low salaries, calling for structural changes to boost efficiency. Public demand for economic reform grew, with meetings held nationwide to discuss future direction and address complaints about low wages. After Ra\u00fal Castro assumed the presidency in 2008, his government announced economic changes including lifting restrictions on consumer product sales, revamping the state's wage system, and eliminating excessive bans and regulations to boost productivity in Cuba. The Cuban government announced economic changes to boost productivity and address low wages. The wage system revamp has been delayed, and the challenge of unifying the two official currencies remains. Many Cubans struggle with low wages, while those with access to convertible pesos are better off. President Castro tasked Minister Marino Murillo with addressing these economic challenges in March 2011. Marino Murillo, previously tasked by President Castro to address economic challenges, has been replaced by Adel Yzquierdo Rodriguez. Murillo, known as the country's economic czar, continues to oversee economic reforms and is a key member of Ra\u00fal Castro's inner circle. Cuba's Communist Party held its sixth congress in 2011 to discuss changes to the economic model, focusing on the Draft Guidelines for Social and Economic Policy issued in November 2010. The guidelines approved at the party congress consist of 313 economic goals, including significant reforms like liquidating state enterprises, unifying currencies, developing a tax system, creating special zones for foreign investment, expanding the non-state sector, and eliminating the ration system gradually. Cuba's National Assembly approved economic guidelines in August 2011, including the sale of cars and homes, small peso loans, and opening commercial bank accounts. Reforms under Ra\u00fal Castro focused on agriculture to boost food production and give farmers more land use discretion. In 2008, the Cuban government gave farmers more control over land use and supplies. They also initiated a land grant program to convert idle land into productive use. By May 2012, 200,000 leases were granted. In September 2012, measures were approved to improve autonomous farming cooperatives. In October 2012, new rules allowed private farmers to lease more land. Despite these efforts, food production in Cuba has fallen below targets. In 2011, food production in Cuba was lower than in 2007, with a 20% increase in food prices due to reduced imports and stagnant farm production. Coffee production decreased by 25% in 2012 despite renovation efforts. The agricultural sector faces challenges with farmers relying on the government for resources in exchange for a majority of their produce. Government limitations on resources and distribution hinder production and market delivery. Micro credits were introduced in 2011 to boost food production, but the program's impact remains limited. The Cuban government reimposed duties on imported food in 2012, affecting food parcels brought by Cuban Americans and private restaurants. The sugar sector saw a decline in production, with the industry being turned into a state-run holding company. In 2012, the Cuban sugar industry faced challenges with production below expectations. The government announced significant reforms to reduce the public sector, lay off state workers, and expand private enterprise. Over the next five years, 1.2 million state employees would be cut, with an emphasis on increasing self-employment opportunities. The Cuban government announced an expansion of self-employment with 178 categories of work allowed, including small businesses hiring non-family members. New tax provisions were introduced to generate income, including sales and social security taxes. Despite delays in state sector layoffs, 137,000 employees were cut in 2011 and 228,000 in 2012. The number of self-employed Cubans rose to 400,000 by December 2012. The number of self-employed in Cuba rose to around 400,000 by December 2012, compared to 156,000 in 2010. The government announced plans to cut taxes and lift restrictions to stimulate the private sector. In 2012, Cuba experimented with private sector contracting for services from state companies and planned to convert some state companies into non-state cooperatives. Cuba aims to transition half of its economic activity from the state sector to the non-state sector in the next four to five years, with the private sector eventually contributing 40%-45% of GDP. However, government actions in mid-2012 raised concerns about its commitment to developing the private sector. In mid-2012, the Cuban government imposed higher duties on imported goods, threatening small entrepreneurs who rely on these goods. Hurricane Sandy caused significant damage in eastern Cuba in October 2012, with 11 deaths and over 226,000 homes affected. Hurricane Sandy in 2012 caused significant damage in Cuba, with 17,000 buildings destroyed and 3 million people affected. Santiago suffered power outages, home damages, and water service disruptions. Nearly 100,000 hectares of crops, especially sugar cane, were affected. The storm also damaged Cuba's coffee production. International aid was provided by various countries and organizations, including the Red Cross, to support vulnerable families in Cuba. Several U.S. humanitarian aid organizations, including Catholic Relief Services, are providing assistance to Cuba in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. The United Nations has allocated significant funds for relief efforts in Cuba, with food rations and emergency funds being mobilized to help those affected by the storm. The Cuban government has secured $30.6 million for humanitarian projects in sectors like shelter, water sanitation, food security, health, and education. These projects will be implemented over the next six to 18 months to aid in recovery efforts. Cuba's historical ties with the Soviet Union provided substantial subsidies during the Cold War, supporting their activist foreign policy and revolutionary movements in Latin America and Africa. After the Cold War and the loss of Soviet support, Cuba had to open up its economy and establish trade relations with various countries like Canada, Spain, China, and Venezuela. Venezuela, under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, became a key supporter by providing subsidized oil imports and investments. Cuba's top trading partners were Venezuela, China, Canada, and the Netherlands for exports, and Venezuela, China, Spain, Brazil, and the United States for imports. Relations with Russia were also strengthened in 2008. Relations between Cuba and Russia, which had diminished after the Cold War, were strengthened with visits by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Cuban leader Ra\u00fal Castro in 2008 and 2009. Trade relations between the two countries are not significant, but Russian energy companies have been involved in oil exploration in Cuba. Additionally, relations with China have also increased in recent years. Relations with China have increased in recent years, with high-level visits and agreements signed. President Castro visited China in 2012, signing cooperation agreements and focusing on trade and investment issues. With El Salvador restoring relations in 2009, all Latin American nations now have diplomatic ties with Cuba. Cuba is becoming more engaged in Latin America beyond its existing close relationships. Cuba has strengthened its engagement in Latin America, including close relations with Venezuela. It is a member of ALBA and CELCAC, aiming to boost regional cooperation. Despite interest, Cuba was not invited to the sixth Summit of the Americas in 2012 due to opposition from the US and Canada. The Summit of the Americas has historically excluded Cuba, but in 2009 the OAS voted to potentially allow Cuba to rejoin. However, Cuba has stated it has no intention of returning to the OAS. Several Latin American nations have threatened to boycott the 2015 Summit in Panama if Cuba is not included. Cuba is actively involved in international forums like the United Nations and the United Nations Human Rights Council. The U.N. General Assembly criticizes the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba annually. Cuba has received support from the UNDP and UNESCO. Cuba hosted the 14th summit of the Non-aligned Movement in 2006. In the early 1960s, U.S.-Cuban relations deteriorated sharply. In the early 1960s, U.S.-Cuban relations deteriorated sharply due to Fidel Castro's communist dictatorship and close ties with the Soviet Union. Tensions included covert operations, the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban missile crisis, Cuban support for insurgencies, the Mariel boatlift, and the 1994 exodus of Cubans to Guantanamo and Panama. Since the early 1960s, U.S. policy towards Cuba has involved isolating the nation through economic sanctions, including a trade embargo and financial restrictions. The Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) were first issued in 1963, prohibiting most financial transactions with Cuba and freezing Cuban government assets in the U.S. These sanctions were strengthened with the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, also known as the Helms/Burton legislation, prohibits U.S. subsidiaries from trading with Cuba and restricts entry into the U.S. for vessels involved in Cuban trade. This law codified the Cuban embargo and limits the executive branch's ability to lift restrictions on Cuba. The U.S. policy towards Cuba includes restrictions on lifting the economic embargo without congressional approval, with some flexibility in travel-related restrictions. The law holds those trafficking in confiscated U.S. property liable for damages, but Presidents have suspended its implementation. Support measures for the Cuban people, such as private humanitarian donations, are also part of U.S. policy. The U.S. policy towards Cuba includes support measures for the Cuban people, such as private humanitarian donations, medical exports, democracy-building efforts, and radio and television broadcasting. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allowed for agricultural exports to Cuba, making the U.S. one of Cuba's largest suppliers of agricultural products. The Clinton Administration made changes to U.S. policy after Pope John Paul II's 1998 visit to Cuba, including the resumption of direct flights and cash remittances. In January 1999, President Clinton announced measures to support the Cuban people, including broadening cash remittances to all U.S. residents, expanding direct passenger charter flights to Cuba from more U.S. cities, and loosening travel restrictions for certain categories of travelers. The George W. Bush Administration continued the U.S. policy of isolating Cuba through economic sanctions while supporting the Cuban people. They emphasized stronger enforcement of sanctions and tightened restrictions on travel, remittances, and humanitarian aid. An interagency Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba was established in 2003 to help the Cuban people bring about an end to the dictatorship. The Commission made recommendations to tighten restrictions on family visits and other categories of travelers in their first report in May 2004. The Commission recommended tightening restrictions on family visits, travel, remittances, and gift parcels. The Administration implemented these restrictions in 2004 and tightened payment terms for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba in 2005. A second report in 2006 urged political change in Cuba, leading to increased U.S. funding for democracy and human rights efforts. The Bush Administration maintained sanctions pending political change. President Bush urged the Cuban government to release political prisoners, respect human rights, and pave the way for free and fair elections to improve U.S.-Cuban relations. Various approaches have been suggested to achieve the goal of bringing democracy and human rights to Cuba, including maintaining pressure on the government while supporting the Cuban people. Efforts have been made to ease U.S. sanctions on Cuba through legislative initiatives over the past decade. Some advocate for constructive engagement to lift certain sanctions hurting the Cuban people, while others call for a swift normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations by lifting the embargo. Congressional actions in 2009 marked the first easing of Cuba sanctions since the approval of previous measures. In response to Fidel Castro's departure, there have been calls to reevaluate U.S. policy towards Cuba. Two main approaches have been proposed: maintaining the current dual-track policy or increasing engagement with the Cuban government and society. Advocates for easing sanctions argue that increased travel, trade, and dialogue could lead to reform in Cuba. Advocates for changing U.S. policy towards Cuba emphasize the need for peaceful reform on the island to prevent violent upheaval and mass migration to the United States. They suggest a more pragmatic approach to bring about change in Cuba, citing international support for lifting the embargo, missed business opportunities, and increased suffering for the Cuban people. They also argue for consistency in U.S. policies towards remaining communist governments worldwide. Opponents of changing U.S. policy towards Cuba argue that maintaining the current two-track policy of isolating Cuba while supporting the Cuban people is the best approach for promoting political change. They believe that softening U.S. policy without concrete Cuban reforms would strengthen the Castro government and prolong the communist regime. They advocate for sustained sanctions to uphold democracy and human rights in Cuba. The Obama Administration has eased some restrictions on travel and remittance to Cuba for Cuban Americans, while maintaining other embargo restrictions on trade and financial transactions. They have expressed concern about human rights in Cuba and welcomed the release of political prisoners. Cuba's detention of U.S. Agency for International Development has been a key impediment to improved relations. Cuba's detention of USAID subcontractor Alan Gross, convicted in 2011, is hindering improved relations with the US. President Obama pledged to ease restrictions on family travel and remittances to Cuba but maintained the embargo for leverage. Release of political prisoners is seen as a key step for the US to take further actions towards Cuba. The Obama Administration announced measures to ease U.S. sanctions on Cuba, including lifting restrictions on family travel and remittances, increasing telecommunications links, and expanding the scope of relations. This followed President Obama's pledge to pursue direct diplomacy with Cuba without preconditions, contingent on the release of political prisoners. Measures were announced to increase telecommunications links with Cuba and expand humanitarian donations. President Obama expressed a desire for a new beginning with Cuba, willing to engage on various issues. There was momentum towards improved relations after the Summit of the Americas. In June 2009, the State Department turned off the electronic billboard at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana that had featured news and pro-democracy messages. Cuba and the United States restarted migration talks in July 2009, and held discussions in September 2009 on resuming direct mail service. Relations soured in late 2009 with the arrest of Alan Gross. In 2009, Alan Gross, an American subcontractor working on USAID-funded Cuba democracy projects, was arrested in Havana. The Obama Administration expressed concern over Cuba's deteriorating human rights situation in early 2010. After the death of hunger striker Orlando Zapata Tamayo, U.S. officials called for the release of over 200 political prisoners held by Cuba. President Obama issued a statement in March 2010, condemning the repression of the Ladies in White and criticizing Cuban authorities for responding to the Cuban people's aspirations with a clenched fist. The President called for the end of repression, immediate release of political prisoners, and respect for the basic rights of the Cuban people. He remains committed to supporting the Cuban people's desire for freedom and universal rights. The US welcomed the release of 52 political prisoners by the Cuban Catholic Church. The United States welcomed the release of 52 political prisoners by the Cuban Catholic Church. The State Department expressed hope for increased respect for human rights in Cuba. The White House announced new measures to ease travel restrictions and allow remittances to Cuba. The new measures announced by the White House aim to ease travel restrictions and allow remittances to Cuba, similar to policies from the Clinton Administration in 1999. Secretary of State Clinton called for the release of Alan Gross on humanitarian grounds after he was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The State Department welcomed the release of political prisoners by Cuba but urged for the release of all remaining political prisoners. The Obama Administration believes in supporting exchanges and constructive relationships with Cuba to advance fundamental rights. They have eased restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba but have not seen genuine transformation in Cuba to justify eliminating the embargo. President Obama wants to foster deeper connections and work towards Cuba's transition to democracy. The Obama Administration has tried to signal openness to a new relationship with Cuba if the Cuban government improves human rights. Concerns about human rights violations and the imprisonment of Alan Gross persist. The State Department has called for an end to harassment of peaceful critics and reiterated the call for Gross's release. In early December 2011, the State Department called for the release of Alan Gross, expressing disappointment that he was not included in a prisoner release by the Cuban government. President Obama condemned the death of Cuban hunger striker Wilman Villar Mendoza in January 2012, highlighting ongoing repression in Cuba. The State Department praised Cuba's antidrug efforts in its March 2012 report and mentioned ongoing review of a bilateral counternarcotics accord. The State Department released its 2011 human rights report on May 24, 2012, highlighting an increase in short-term detentions in Cuba and other human rights abuses. Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson expressed strong U.S. support for democracy and human rights activists in Cuba in a congressional testimony on June 7, 2012. The Obama Administration's priority is to empower Cubans to determine their own future through building connections between the Cuban and American people. The Assistant Secretary emphasized U.S. support for democracy and human rights activists in Cuba, highlighting the importance of engaging with pro-democracy advocates. She praised the release of political prisoners but noted that it did not lead to significant changes in Cuba's human rights record. The Assistant Secretary criticized the Cuban government for its poor human rights record, citing ongoing political repression and arbitrary detentions. She also mentioned the imprisonment of Alan Gross and a $619 million settlement with a Dutch bank for violating U.S. sanctions against Cuba. The State Department issued a press statement expressing deep concern about Cuba's crackdown on human rights, calling for an end to arbitrary detention and violence. Restrictions on travel to Cuba have been a contentious component of U.S. efforts to isolate the communist government of Fidel Castro. Restrictions on travel to Cuba have been a contentious component of U.S. efforts to isolate the communist government of Fidel Castro. From 1977 to 1982, there were no restrictions on travel. Under the Bush Administration, enforcement of U.S. restrictions on Cuba travel increased, and restrictions on travel and remittances were tightened. The Obama Administration eased restrictions on family travel and travel related to U.S. agricultural and medical sales to Cuba in 2009. In 2009, the Obama Administration eased restrictions on family travel and travel related to U.S. agricultural and medical sales to Cuba. Family travel was allowed once every 12 months to visit a close relative for an unlimited length of stay, and the definition of \"close relative\" was expanded. Travel related to marketing and sale of agricultural and medical goods to Cuba was allowed under a general license. President Obama lifted all restrictions on family travel and remittances to Cuba, surpassing Congress' previous actions. The new policy allows for unlimited family visits with no baggage limits, and remittances are no longer capped at $300 per quarter. Authorized travelers can now carry up to $3,000 in remittances. In September 2009, regulations were issued allowing travelers to carry up to $3,000 in remittances to Cuba. In January 2011, the Obama Administration further eased restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba, aiming to support the Cuban people's desire for self-determination. The changes were enacted through modifications to existing regulations published in the Federal Register on January 28, 2011. The Obama Administration eased restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba in 2011, allowing for certain types of travel and remittances to non-family members. These measures were similar to those implemented by the Clinton Administration in 1999 but were later restricted by the Bush Administration. Additionally, all U.S. international airports became eligible to provide services to licensed charter flights to and from Cuba. OFAC delayed processing applications for new travel categories requiring a specific license until guidelines were updated in April 2011. The Department of Homeland Security approved 12 additional airports for passenger air service between the US and Cuba. Major arguments were made for lifting the Cuba travel restrictions. Major arguments for and against lifting the Cuba travel ban were discussed, with concerns about supporting Castro's rule and the rights of Americans to travel being key points. OFAC approved licenses for U.S. people-to-people organizations to bring visitors to Cuba in 2011. In August 2011, U.S. people-to-people organizations began trips to Cuba after OFAC issued an advisory clarifying that travel must involve educational exchange activities, not tourist activities. OFAC also emphasized that advertising for these trips must comply with regulations. The Treasury Department tightened restrictions on people-to-people travel in May 2012, requiring all advertisements to include the name of the licensed organization and warning that misleading advertising could prompt an investigation. Organizations failing to meet license requirements risked license revocation or a civil penalty of up to $65,000 per violation. The Treasury Department tightened restrictions on people-to-people travel in May 2012 by revising license guidelines. Organizations applying for a people-to-people license must now describe how the travel would enhance contact with the Cuban people, support civil society, or promote independence from Cuban authorities. The guidelines also require that the sample itinerary specify how meetings with prohibited Cuban government or Communist Party officials advance purposeful travel objectives. In September 2012, there was a slowdown in the Treasury Department's approval of licenses for people-to-people travel, causing companies to cancel trips and lay off staff. However, by early October 2012, companies reported receiving license approvals again. In the 112th Congress, legislation was introduced regarding Cuba travel and remittances, but none were enacted. During the 112th Congress, legislation regarding Cuba travel and remittances was introduced but not enacted. FAA Reauthorization bill S. 223 in February 2011 included an amendment that would have restricted flights to countries on the State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism, including Cuba. The House Appropriations Committee's FY2012 bill H.R. 2434 aimed to reverse President Obama's easing of restrictions on remittances and family travel to Cuba. The provision in the Cuban Assets Control Regulations aimed to restore and maintain regulations on family travel and remittances as of January 19, 2009, rolling back President Obama's easing of restrictions. This would have limited family travel to once every three years and restricted remittances for non-family members and religious institutions. The provision aimed to restrict family travel to once every three years for up to 14 days to visit immediate family members, requiring a specific license from OFAC. Licensed travelers would only be allowed to carry $300 in remittances and family remittances would be limited to $300 per quarter. Non-family remittances up to $500 per quarter, allowed by the Obama Administration, would not be permitted. The general license for remittances to religious organizations would be eliminated, but could be allowed on a case-by-case basis. The White House opposed this provision as it would reverse the President's policy on family travel and remittances. The White House opposed a provision in a bill that aimed to restrict family travel and remittances to Cuba, stating that it would undermine efforts to increase contact between Cuban families and support economic independence. A legislative battle ensued over including this provision in a \"megabus\" bill, but ultimately it was not included. Congressional leaders decided not to include the Cuba provision in the \"megabus bill\" and also omitted a provision clarifying the definition of \"payment of cash in advance\" for U.S. exports to Cuba. The White House pressured against the Cuba provision, which would have rolled back travel and remittance restrictions. The removal of the payment provision was seen as a political tradeoff. Additionally, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs marked up the FY2012 Foreign Relations Authorization Act on July 21, 2011. H.R. 2583, the FY2012 Foreign Relations Authorization Act, included a provision to enforce travel regulations to Cuba from January 19, 2009, with penalties for violators. The provision aimed to tighten travel restrictions to Cuba. Amendments to the Cuban Adjustment Act were also proposed to curb travel by recent Cuban immigrants to the U.S. The legislation proposed adjustments to the Cuban Adjustment Act, specifying that a Cuban national must be physically present in the U.S. to qualify for permanent resident status. It also stated that returning to Cuba before becoming a U.S. citizen would make an alien ineligible for adjustment. Additionally, H.R. 2831 introduced measures to restrict travel and remittances to Cuba. In the 112th Congress, several initiatives were introduced to lift travel restrictions to Cuba, including H.R. 1886, H.R. 1888, H.R. 255, H.R. 1887, and H.R. 380. These initiatives aimed to prohibit restrictions on travel, export of U.S. agricultural products, and overall Cuba embargo. U.S. commercial agricultural exports to Cuba were also addressed. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows for one-year export licenses for selling agricultural commodities to Cuba, but without U.S. government assistance or financing. Transactions must be conducted in cash in advance or with financing from third countries. The Act also authorizes travel to Cuba for business related to agricultural sales. From 2002 to 2010, the United States was the largest supplier of food and agricultural products to Cuba. Since 2002, the United States was the top supplier of food and agricultural products to Cuba, with exports peaking at $712 million in 2008 due to increased food needs after natural disasters. However, exports declined to $363 million in 2011, with Brazil surpassing the U.S. in agricultural exports to Cuba. In 2011, U.S. exports to Cuba declined to $363 million, just a 1.23% drop from 2010. Analysts cite reasons for the decline such as Cuba's shortage of hard currency, credits from other governments, financial support from Venezuela and China, and ineffective efforts to change U.S. sanctions policy. U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba began to increase in 2012, reaching $338 million through September, a 22% increase from the previous year. Leading products include cereals, poultry, pork, soybeans, prepared animal feed, and edible. In February 2005, OFAC clarified that \"payment of cash in advance\" for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba means payment must be received before shipment. This caused objections from exporters and Congress, but OFAC maintained it aligns with international trade norms. Amid pressure, OFAC later allowed vessels to depart U.S. ports once a foreign bank confirms payment receipt. In December 2009, Congress overturned OFAC's February 2005 clarification on \"payment of cash in advance\" for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. The new definition allowed vessels to leave U.S. ports once a foreign bank confirms receipt of payment from Cuba. In early March 2010, regulations were maintained regarding the \"payment of cash in advance\" provision for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. The provision applied to items delivered by September 30, 2010, or pursuant to a contract entered into by that date. The 111th Congress approved a full-year measure in April 2011 (P.L. 112-10) continuing this provision through FY2011. Additional legislative initiatives introduced in the 111th Congress aimed to permanently make this change, but no action was completed on these measures. In June 2010, a committee addressed travel restrictions and proposed changes to the definition of \"payment of cash in advance\" for U.S. agricultural and medical sales to Cuba. The FY2012 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations measure included provisions clarifying payment terms and allowing direct transfers between U.S. and Cuban financial institutions. The Senate bill also included a provision prohibiting restrictions on direct transfers from Cuban to U.S. financial institutions for exports to Cuba. The Senate Appropriations Committee added a provision allowing direct transfers from Cuban to U.S. financial institutions for licensed agricultural and medical exports to Cuba. Supporters argued that current restrictions make U.S. agricultural sales costly, while opponents cited concerns about Cuba being on the list of states sponsoring terrorism. However, these provisions were not included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2012. In FY2012, H.R. 2055 (P.L. 112-74) included the Financial Services and General Government bill. Cuba provisions were dropped as a tradeoff for not rolling back travel and remittance restrictions. In FY2013, no Cuba provisions related to U.S. exports were included in the House or Senate versions of the Appropriations bills. Senator Jerry Moran paused advocating for easing restrictions on financing for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba until Alan Gross's detention is addressed. Senator Jerry Moran paused advocating for easing restrictions on financing for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba until Cuba addresses the detention of Alan Gross, a USAID subcontractor imprisoned since late 2009. Other bills introduced in Congress aimed to change payment definitions for export sales to Cuba but saw no action. Some groups support further easing restrictions on agricultural exports to Cuba, believing U.S. farmers are missing out on a nearby market. Some exporters want to change U.S. restrictions to sell agriculture and farm equipment to Cuba. The U.S. International Trade Commission reported that lifting trade restrictions could increase the U.S. share of Cuba's agricultural imports. Opponents argue that U.S. policy already allows for significant sales to Cuba since 2001. Since 2001, there have been significant sales to Cuba, with billions of dollars in private humanitarian donations licensed by the United States. Opponents argue that easing pressure on Cuba would support the Castro regime and its repressive policies. Some agricultural producers support the prohibition on financing for exports to ensure payment. The U.S. has imposed sanctions denying trademark protection for businesses confiscated by the Cuban government. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations measure prevents the U.S. from accepting payment for trademark registrations from Cuban or foreign nationals related to confiscated assets in Cuba without the original owner's consent. This measure arose from a dispute between Pernod Ricard and Bacardi over the Havana Club trademark rights. Pernod Ricard secured the Havana Club trademark from the Arechabala family, who originally produced the rum before their assets were confiscated by the Cuban government in 1960. Despite being unable to market Havana Club in the US due to the trade embargo, Pernod Ricard aims to protect its future distribution rights. The WTO ruled in January 2002 that the US trademark sanction violated international trade agreements, leading to a deadline for the US to comply with legislative action by January 3, 2003. In 2003, the US faced a deadline to comply with WTO ruling on the Havana Club trademark. The deadline was extended multiple times. In 2005, the EU and US reached an agreement regarding retaliation authorization. In 2006, the US Patent Office cancelled Cuba's Havana Club trademark registration. Legal battles ensued, with the US Court of Appeals upholding the denial to renew the trademark in 2011. Bacardi started marketing Havana Club rum in the US in 2006. In 2010, a U.S. District Court ruled in Bacardi's favor regarding the labeling of Havana Club rum. There are two approaches in Congress to address Section 211 compliance with the WTO ruling: one advocates for a narrow fix applying to U.S. companies, while the other calls for the repeal of Section 211. The House Committee on the Judiciary discussed the trademark implications of HAVANA CLUB and Section 211 of the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009. Several bills were introduced in Congress to address compliance with the WTO ruling, including both narrow fixes and broader measures to lift U.S. sanctions on Cuba. The EU-U.S. bilateral agreement in July 2005 included a provision repealing Section 211, reducing pressure on Congress to comply with the WTO ruling. Cuba, although not a major producer or consumer of illicit drugs, faces challenges due to its geographic location, making it susceptible to narcotics smuggling. Cuban officials have expressed concerns about drug transit through their waters and airspace, leading to measures to combat the drug problem. Cuba has implemented measures to combat the drug problem, including legislation to increase penalties for traffickers, enhanced training for counternarcotics personnel, and cooperation with other countries on anti-drug efforts. The State Department's 2012 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report highlights Cuba's anti-drug agreements with other nations, focusing on maritime and air interdiction, and the recovery of narcotics washed up on Cuban shores. Cuba interdicted 9.01 metric tons of illegal narcotics in 2011 and has been actively enforcing its internal drug market since 2003. Cuba has implemented measures to combat the drug problem, including legislation to increase penalties for traffickers and enhanced training for counternarcotics personnel. Cooperation with other countries on anti-drug efforts has also been a focus, with varying levels of U.S.-Cuban cooperation over the years. In 1996, Cuban authorities cooperated with the United States in the seizure of 6.6 tons of cocaine aboard a ship bound for Miami. Cooperation has increased since 1999, with discussions on improving anti-drug cooperation leading to upgrades in communication links and the stationing of a U.S. Coast Guard Drug Interdiction Specialist in Havana. In 2011, the U.S. Coast Guard and Cuban Border Guard had increased anti-drug cooperation, leading to multiple at-sea interdictions. Cuba provided real-time reports of narcotics trafficking events to the U.S. Coast Guard, improving communication with email and phone notifications, occasionally including photographs of suspected vessels. Cuba expressed a desire to collaborate with the United States in combating drug trafficking. Cuba seeks cooperation with the United States to combat narcotics trafficking, proposing a bilateral anti-drug agreement. The State Department acknowledges Cuba's efforts and suggests that increased cooperation could enhance counternarcotics efforts and lead to more interdictions and disruptions of illegal trafficking. The U.S. acknowledges Cuba's efforts in combating narcotics trafficking and suggests increasing cooperation for more interdictions and disruptions. Senator Feinstein recommends steps to enhance counternarcotics collaboration with Cuba. Cuba is working towards developing its offshore oil resources, with potential reserves estimated at 4.6 billion barrels. This could reduce Cuba's dependence on Venezuela for oil supplies. Cuba has had several offshore oil projects with foreign companies, but Repsol's exploratory drilling in 2012 came up dry, leading to their likely departure. The Scarabeo-9 rig was then used by Petronas and Gazprom for oil exploration off the coast of western Cuba. Cuba's offshore oil exploration faced setbacks in 2012 as multiple wells, including those with foreign companies like PdVSA, PetroVietnam, Sonangol, and ONGC, were found to be not commercially viable. The Scarabeo-9 oil rig left Cuba in November 2012 after unsuccessful drilling attempts, leading to uncertainty about future exploration in Cuba's deepwaters. The Scarabeo-9 oil rig's unsuccessful drilling in three wells in 2012 is a setback for Cuba's deepwater offshore hydrocarbon development. Concerns arise about Cuba's proximity to the US and disaster preparedness post-Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Zarubezhneft, a Russian company, is drilling in shallow waters near Havana using the Songa Mercur oil rig, with completion expected in June 2013. The poor state of relations between Cuba and the United States complicates preparedness and coordination for potential oil spills in the waters northwest of Cuba. If an oil spill were to occur, currents in the Florida Straits could carry the oil to U.S. waters and coastal areas in Florida, posing a risk to marine and coastal resources in southern Florida. The National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling recommended negotiating with Mexico and Cuba to establish common drilling standards in the Gulf of Mexico. Negotiations are needed between countries to establish common standards, regulatory oversight, safety culture, and response protocols for oil spills. The United States and Cuba have participated in regional meetings under the International Maritime Organization to share information on oil spill prevention and response. U.S. oil spill mitigation companies, like Clean Caribbean & Americas, can be licensed by the Treasury and Commerce Departments to provide support in Cuba. The U.S. Coast Guard also has licenses for response activities in case of an oil spill. Some analysts urge easing regulatory restrictions for private companies to transfer equipment and personnel to Cuba for spill prevention. Interest in Cuba's offshore oil development remains high, with a focus on potential spill prevention efforts. In the 112th Congress, interest was focused on a potential oil spill and attempts to sanction foreign companies supporting Cuba's oil development. Several legislative initiatives were introduced, but only one, H.R. 372 (Buchanan), aimed to sanction companies involved in Cuba's oil development. S. 405 (Nelson, Bill) would have required companies conducting oil or gas operations off the coast to meet certain safety standards. In the 112th Congress, legislative initiatives were introduced to address potential oil spills and sanction foreign companies supporting Cuba's oil development. H.R. 2047 (Ros-Lehtinen) proposed visa restrictions on foreign nationals and economic sanctions on companies assisting in oil operations off the coasts of Cuba. The bill proposed visa restrictions and economic sanctions on companies aiding Cuba's offshore oil development, with penalties for investments over $1 million. It was also included in another legislative proposal. H.R. 4135, the Western Hemisphere Energy Security Act of 2012, would have authorized U.S. companies to engage in oil activities in Cuba's offshore sector. H.R. 4310 had a provision prohibiting the Department of Defense from contracting with businesses operating in state sponsors of terrorism. The House bill H.R. 4135 allowed U.S. companies to work on oil activities in Cuba's offshore sector, while H.R. 4310 included a provision preventing the Department of Defense from contracting with businesses operating in state sponsors of terrorism. An amendment was added to H.R. 4310 to stop Repsol from partnering with Cuba in oil exploration while benefiting from DOD contracts. Senate hearings were held on Cuba's offshore oil development and U.S. response capabilities. On November 2, 2011, House committees held hearings with officials from the U.S. Coast Guard, Department of the Interior, and private witnesses. Cuba has been on the State Department's list of states sponsoring terrorism since 1982 due to alleged ties to terrorist groups in Latin America. Cuba's change in policy in 1992 was influenced by the breakup of the Soviet Union, leading to economic decline. Critics argue that Cuba's presence on the terrorism list is a Cold War holdover, while supporters point to evidence of Cuba supporting terrorism in Latin America and Africa. The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2011 highlighted Cuba's hosting of members of foreign terrorist organizations and U.S. fugitives. It mentioned that Cuba provided medical care and political assistance to groups like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA), but there was no evidence of providing weapons or paramilitary training. Three suspected ETA members were arrested in Venezuela after sailing from Cuba and deported back. In September 2011, Jose Ignacio Echarte, a fugitive with ties to FARC, is sought by Spain for extradition. Cuba facilitated peace talks between FARC and the Colombian government in 2012. The Cuban government harbors fugitives wanted in the U.S., providing support like housing and medical care. Legislation was introduced in Congress to extradite fugitives in Cuba. The President and Congress have the power to remove a country from the state sponsors of terrorism list. This can be done by certifying a change in leadership and policies or by providing assurances that the government is not supporting acts of international terrorism. The President and Congress have the power to remove a country from the state sponsors of terrorism list by certifying a change in leadership and policies or providing assurances that the government will not support such acts in the future. Congress can also independently remove a country from the list through legislation, as seen with Cuba in the 111th Congress. Cuba has been involved in various terrorist incidents, including bombings in 1976 and 1997. In March 1999, individuals were sentenced to death for bombings, later commuted to 30 years in prison. In January 2002, three Guatemalans were sentenced for planning bombings in 1998. Cuban exiles were accused of funding the bombings. In November 2000, four anti-Castro activists were arrested in Panama for a plot to kill Fidel Castro. Luis Posada Carriles, linked to previous bombings, was among the accused. They were sentenced in March 2004 on weapons charges. Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso pardoned them in August 2004. In 2005, Luis Posada Carriles entered the United States illegally and faced removal proceedings. Despite concerns of torture in Cuba or Venezuela, he was allowed to stay in the US. Posada applied for naturalization but was denied and faced criminal charges for false statements. The indictment was initially dismissed in 2007 but reversed in 2008, leading to a superseding indictment in 2009. In 2005, Luis Posada Carriles faced criminal charges for false statements in immigration proceedings regarding the 1997 Havana bombings. His trial was delayed multiple times before starting in January 2011. Posada was acquitted of perjury charges in April 2011, criticized by Cuban officials. An associate, Francisco Ch\u00e1vez Abarca, extradited to Cuba in 2010 for alleged involvement in the bombings. Abarca had been imprisoned in El Salvador but charges were dropped. Arrested in Venezuela in 2010, he confessed to planning protests in the country. In late September 2010, Cuban government released Ch\u00e1vez Abarca's video confessions and reenactment of bombings, linking him to Luis Posada. Ch\u00e1vez Abarca confessed Posada recruited him for Cuba bombings, paying $2,000 per bomb. Only one bomb detonated in Havana in 2007. Ch\u00e1vez Abarca sentenced to 30 years in prison for his role. United States provided assistance through USAID, State Department, and NED since 1996. The USAID, State Department, and NED have been providing support to increase information flow on democracy, human rights, and free enterprise to Cuba. Congress has allocated almost $197 million from FY2001-FY2012 for these efforts, with the Administration requesting $15 million for FY2013. The funding aims to promote a peaceful transition to democracy, develop civil society, and support human rights activists in Cuba. The USAID, State Department, and NED have been providing support to increase information flow on democracy, human rights, and free enterprise to Cuba. Congress has allocated almost $197 million from FY2001-FY2012 for these efforts, with the Administration requesting $15 million for FY2013. The funding aims to promote a peaceful transition to democracy, develop civil society, and support human rights activists in Cuba. In FY2010, Congress fully funded the Administration's $20 million request for Cuba democracy programs, focusing on humanitarian assistance, strengthening civil society, weakening the information blockade, and promoting dialogue about democratic change and reconciliation. In April 2011, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry placed a hold on the Administration's $20 million request for Cuba democracy programs, citing the need for a full review of the programs' effectiveness. Senator Patrick Leahy also placed a hold on the assistance, but both holds were lifted by early August 2011. The funding aimed to support democracy and human rights projects in Cuba, focusing on providing humanitarian assistance to prisoners of conscience and their families, strengthening civil society, and supporting human rights activists. The Senate version of the State Department and Foreign Operations appropriations measure, S. 3676, aimed to provide $2 million for democracy programs in Cuba by transferring funds from the ESF. Congress approved the full $20 million for Cuba democracy assistance in FY2011, with a focus on supporting prisoners of conscience, strengthening civil society, and promoting fundamental freedoms. In FY2012, $20 million in assistance was requested for democracy, civil society, and human rights programs. USAID, State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affair, and Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor will administer the funds. The budget request for FY2012 aimed to promote democratic principles with Congress supporting the full amount. The budget request for FY2012 includes increased efforts to support Cuban civil society, focusing on transparency, youth, marginalized groups, and human rights. Assistance aims to strengthen independent elements, provide humanitarian aid to political prisoners, and promote leadership skills. Additionally, programs aim to disseminate information on market economies and economic rights. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported version of the FY2012 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations bill would have provided $15 million in ESF for Cuba, including humanitarian and democracy assistance, support for economic reform, private sector initiatives, and human rights. The committee expected funds to be used transparently and directed the USAID Administrator to provide updates on assistance to Cubans. The FY2012 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations bill recommended $20 million in ESF for Cuba for democracy-building purposes only, excluding business promotion and economic reform. The FY2013 Administration requested $15 million for human rights and democracy programs in Cuba, focusing on basic freedoms and humanitarian assistance for prisoners of conscience. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported version of the FY2013 State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, S. 3241, proposed $15 million in ESF for Cuba for humanitarian assistance, economic reform, private sector initiatives, democracy, and human rights. In contrast, the House Appropriations Committee-reported version of the bill, H.R. 5857, suggested $20 million in ESF to be merged with funds for the National Endowment for Democracy to promote democracy and civil society in Cuba. The House and Senate bills for FY2013 appropriations for Cuba aim to promote democracy and civil society in the country. Assistance is restricted to activities authorized by the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, with a prohibition on direct funding to the Cuban government. Funding is to be provided through regular notification procedures of the Committees on Appropriations. Congress approved a continuing appropriations resolution to continue FY2013 funding through March 27, 2013. The National Endowment for Democracy's funding for Cuba democracy programs has increased annually, with recent funding amounts as follows: $1.4 million in FY2008, $1.5 million in FY2009, $2.4 million in FY2010, and $1.65 million in FY2011. Funding is now provided through the State Department's appropriations measure. The State Department's annual report for FY2011 revealed funding for various organizations and projects in Cuba, including the National Endowment for Democracy receiving $4 million from the $20 million appropriated by Congress for Cuba programs. This almost doubled NED funding compared to FY2010, with the funds intended to support independent civil society activists on the island. The House Appropriations Committee-reported version of the FY2013 foreign aid appropriations measure, H.R. 5857, would have appropriated $20 million in ESF for Cuba democracy funding, with the intention to support civil society activists, enhance analytical capacity, and promote adherence to international norms. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified significant problems in U.S. democracy assistance for Cuba from 1996 to 2005, emphasizing the need for better management and oversight. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified significant problems in U.S. democracy assistance for Cuba, emphasizing the need for better management and oversight. GAO reported that internal controls for awarding grants and oversight of grantees were inadequate, leading to concerns about fund usage and compliance with regulations. Investigative news reports highlighted high shipping costs and lax oversight, diminishing program effectiveness. USAID took steps to address these issues since 2006, including awarding grants competitively, hiring more staff, and enhancing oversight through financial services contracts. The GAO report highlighted issues with USAID's oversight of the Cuba program, noting improvements in program oversight but also a lack of staffing for effective grant oversight. Recent procurement reviews identified weaknesses in internal controls, financial management, and procurement at three grantees. GAO recommended that USAID ensure proper staffing levels for monitoring activities and periodically assess the program's overall efforts. The GAO report identified issues with USAID's oversight of the Cuba program, recommending proper staffing levels for monitoring activities and periodic assessments of the program's efforts. In 2009, Cuban authorities arrested an American subcontractor, Alan Gross, distributing communications equipment to Cuban civil society organizations. In 2010, Cuban authorities detained an American contractor accused of working for American intelligence, which was denied by U.S. officials. The contractor was actually working with a peaceful, non-dissident civic group recognized by the Cuban government to improve communication. U.S. officials have called for the contractor's release, with 40 House Members also advocating for his freedom. In 2010, American contractor Alan Gross was detained in Cuba, accused of espionage. US officials and lawmakers called for his release, citing his humanitarian work with the Jewish community. Secretary of State Clinton expressed concern for Gross's well-being and stated his continued detention was harming US-Cuba relations. Assistant Secretary of State Valenzuela also met with Cuban officials to push for Gross's release. In early December 2010, the State Department issued a statement calling for the release of Alan Gross, emphasizing that his detention was hindering dialogue between the US and Cuba. The US delegation raised the issue at migration talks in January 2011, with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson meeting with Gross. There were reports of optimism regarding Gross's potential release, but on February 4, 2011, he was officially charged with actions against Cuban independence. Alan Gross was officially charged with \"actions against the independence and territorial integrity of the state\" in Cuba, leading to a 15-year prison sentence. Despite pleas for his release on humanitarian grounds due to his deteriorating health and family circumstances, the State Department called for his immediate release. Former President Jimmy Carter visited Gross in March 2011 during a trip to Cuba. In March 2011, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter visited Alan Gross in Cuba. Gross had lost significant weight and expressed a desire to come home. Cuba's Supreme Court rejected Gross's appeal in August 2011. Efforts by former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson to secure Gross's release were unsuccessful. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez hinted at a possible resolution to the Gross case in a New York Times interview. Bruno Rodriguez suggested resolving the Gross case on humanitarian grounds and reciprocity. 72 House Members urged Cuba to release Gross immediately, stating his incarceration hinders bilateral relations. The State Department also called for Gross's release and expressed disappointment in the Cuban government. In late December 2011, the Cuban government did not release Alan Gross among 2,900 prisoners on humanitarian grounds. Investigative reporting in February 2012 revealed Gross's trips to Cuba and the equipment he brought, raising questions about USAID-supported democracy programs. In April 2012, there was hope Cuba would respond to Gross's humanitarian request to visit his sick relative. Cuba did not allow Alan Gross to visit his sick mother in the US, despite his request. The US granted one of the \"Cuban five\" spies the right to visit his dying brother in Cuba. Cuba is linking Gross's release to the \"Cuban five,\" while the US rejects this. Judy Gross expressed concerns about her husband's health and fears of continued imprisonment. In late November 2012, Alan Gross's health was disputed by the Cuban government, with a biopsy showing no cancer. His lawyer requested an independent medical examination. Alan and Judy Gross sued the US government and his employer for not disclosing risks. Judy Gross urged President Obama to prioritize her husband's release. On the third anniversary of his imprisonment, the State Department called for his release. The Senate approved a resolution calling for Alan Gross's release and for him to receive medical treatment. Cuba denounced a U.N. ruling characterizing Gross's detention as arbitrary and called for talks with the U.S. The Cuban government has called for \"serious talks\" with the United States regarding the Alan Gross case and the \"Cuban five\" through a prisoner exchange. U.S.-government sponsored Radio and TV Mart\u00ed aim to provide news and information to the people of Cuba using various media platforms. The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) oversees these broadcasting programs. The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) oversees Radio and TV Mart\u00ed, which provide news and information to Cuba through various media platforms. Radio Mart\u00ed broadcasts on short and medium wave channels for 24 hours six days per week, and for 18 hours one day per week. TV Mart\u00ed programming has been broadcast through multiple transmission methods since 1990. TV Mart\u00ed programming was broadcast via various methods from 1990 to present, including an aerostat, Commando Solo, contracted private aircraft, and AeroMart\u00ed. Currently, broadcasts are transmitted via two privately contracted airplanes for five days weekly, as well as through the internet and satellite television. In 2011, a contract was awarded for a text messaging system. The BBG awarded a contract to a Maryland firm to design and operate a text messaging system for broadcasting to Cuba, with funding amounts decreasing in recent years. The system aims to distribute messages to mobile phone users in Cuba, potentially circumventing censorship. Cuba has raised concerns about the system violating laws and international agreements. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $28.789 million for broadcasting to Cuba in FY2011, slightly less than the requested amount. They did not support certain expansions until a strategic plan was submitted. Actual funding for FY2011 was $28.416 million. In FY2012, the Administration requested $28.475 million for broadcasting to Cuba. In FY2012, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $28.181 million for Cuba broadcasting, slightly less than the request. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $30.175 million. Congress approved full funding of $28.475 million for broadcasting to Cuba in the FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The BBG's estimate for FY2012 funding is $28.062 million. The Administration requested $23.594 million for Cuba broadcasting in FY2013, almost $4.5 million lower than FY2012 funding. Program reductions are possible due to OCB's planned streamlining in news coverage and reliance on technical support from the BBG. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported FY2013 State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act would have provided $23.4 million, while the House Appropriations Committee-reported bill would have provided $28.062 million. Congress did not complete action on FY2013 appropriations. In FY2012, Congress approved a continuing appropriations resolution (H.J.Res. 117, P.L. 112-175) to continue FY2013 funding through March 27, 2013. Two bills in the 112th Congress aimed to discontinue Radio and TV Mart\u00ed broadcasts to Cuba. Amendments related to Cuba were submitted during House consideration of the FY2011 Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act. Radio and TV Mart\u00ed have faced controversies and funding cuts over the years. TV Mart\u00ed has struggled to reach an audience due to Cuban jamming efforts. In 2006, reports highlighted issues with cronyism and bias in the OCB's operations. In 2007, the former director of TV Mart\u00ed programming pleaded guilty to receiving kickbacks. Various government studies and audits have been conducted on the OCB, including investigations by the GAO. Various government studies and audits, including those by the GAO, have criticized the OCB's practices in awarding contracts to Radio Mamb\u00ed and TV Azteca. The best available research suggests that Radio and TV Mart\u00ed's audience is small, with less than 2% of respondents tuning in. According to a GAO report, TV Mart\u00ed has consistently had less than 1% viewership in telephone surveys since 2003. Concerns were raised about adherence to laws and standards, including interference with Cuban broadcasts. GAO testified on these issues in a 2009 hearing. The staff report found that Radio and TV Mart\u00ed are ineffective in influencing Cuban society, politics, and policy due to issues with broadcast standards, audience size, and Cuban government jamming. Recommendations included moving the Office of Cuba Broadcasting back to Washington and integrating it fully into the Voice of America. A GAO report in December 2011 assessed the BBG's strategic plan for broadcasting to Cuba. The relative priority of broadcasting to Cuba is determined by various factors, including audience sizes for Radio and TV Mart\u00ed, operating costs, obstacles to increasing audience size, alternative dissemination options, and program efficiencies. The GAO found that the BBG's strategic plan lacked key information, addressing some but not all requirements set by Congress. Challenges in obtaining audience size information were noted, with potential for cost savings through shared resources between Radio and TV Mart\u00ed and the Voice of America. An editorial controversy involving OCB Director Carlos Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez and Cuban Cardinal Jaime Ortega also occurred in early May 2012. The editorial controversy involving OCB Director Carlos Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez and Cuban Cardinal Jaime Ortega raised questions about OCB's editorial policy and adherence to broadcast standards. Some Members of Congress criticized the strong language used and called for the Administration to reject the comments against Cardinal Ortega. The controversy highlighted the need for clarity on OCB's editorial policy and the distinction between broadcaster views and U.S. government views. The editorial controversy involving OCB Director Carlos Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez and Cuban Cardinal Jaime Ortega raised questions about OCB's editorial policy and adherence to broadcast standards. Some Members of Congress criticized the strong language used and called for the Administration to reject the comments against Cardinal Ortega. The controversy highlighted the need for clarity on OCB's editorial policy and the distinction between broadcaster views and U.S. government views. Policymakers are considering OCB's editorial policy, including whether it should follow guidelines similar to Voice of America, and the history of migration accords between Cuba and the United States. President Clinton changed U.S. migration policy on August 19, 1994, redirecting Cubans rescued at sea to Guantanamo Bay. Despite this, Cubans continued fleeing, leading to talks between Cuba and the U.S. resulting in a bilateral agreement on September 9, 1994. The agreement aimed to regulate Cuban migration, ensuring a minimum of 20,000 legal migrants annually to the U.S. In a policy change, the United States stopped granting parole to Cuban migrants reaching the country, while Cuba agreed to prevent unsafe departures. An accord in May 1995 allowed over 30,000 Cubans at Guantanamo to be paroled into the U.S., but future sea migrants would be intercepted and returned to Cuba. The last group of 32,000 intercepted Cubans left Guantanamo in January 1996, with most being paroled into the U.S. Since the 1995 migration accord, the U.S. Coast Guard has interdicted thousands of Cubans at sea and returned them to Cuba, while those deemed at risk for persecution have been transferred to Guantanamo and then found asylum in a third country or eventually the United States. Most interdictions result in a return to Cuba, while Cubans who reach shore can apply for permanent resident status in one year under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966. The \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy has been criticized for encouraging risky migration to the U.S. and alien smuggling, but others argue for welcoming migrants fleeing communist Cuba. The number of Cubans interdicted at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard fluctuated over the years, with a significant decline in maritime interdictions from FY2007 to FY2010 due to factors like the U.S. economic downturn and more efficient patrolling. However, there was an increase in interdictions in FY2011 and FY2012, with speculation on reasons including Cuba's deteriorating economic situation and the Coast Guard's improved interdiction methods. In FY2013, the number of Cubans interdicted was 232 as of January 14. In FY2013, 232 Cubans were interdicted by the U.S. Coast Guard, leading to increased prosecution of migrant smugglers in Florida. Violent incidents involving Cuban migrants brandishing weapons have occurred, prompting calls for the Cuban American community to denounce smuggling. Additionally, Cuban nationals were charged with conspiracy, kidnapping, and extortion related to the abduction of Cuban migrants in Mexico. The Cuban government has also taken action against alien smuggling, imposing prison sentences of up to three years. In FY2009-FY2011, unauthorized Cubans reached the US through various means, with Border Patrol apprehensions in coastal Florida decreasing significantly compared to previous years. Arrival of unauthorized Cubans at US ports of entry from Mexico also decreased during this period, following a migration accord between Mexico and Cuba in 2008. In October 2008, Mexico and Cuba negotiated a migration accord to curb irregular migrant flow. Cuba updated its migration policy in 2013, eliminating the exit permit requirement for travel abroad. This change allowed Cubans to travel with an updated passport and visa, up to two years without losing their citizenship rights. Cuba's action was seen as a move towards human rights. Cuba updated its migration policy in 2013, eliminating the exit permit requirement for travel abroad. The new policy applies to health care professionals, including doctors, and thousands of Cubans lined up to take advantage of the change. Travel under the new policy will require an updated passport and any necessary visas. Ecuador now requires Cubans to provide a letter of invitation from a legal resident to visit, covering expenses. The U.S. State Department supports changes allowing Cubans to travel freely, in line with human rights. However, concerns remain about how Cuba will implement the new travel policies. In the 112th Congress, two bills were introduced to amend the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, aiming to restrict travel to Cuba by recently emigrated Cubans in the U.S. One bill proposed extending the time required for Cuban nationals to qualify for permanent resident status, while the other would make them ineligible if they return to Cuba before becoming U.S. citizens. The House Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Immigration on Policy Enforcement held a hearing on H.R. 2831 on May 31, 2012, regarding adjustments to permanent resident status under the CAA for Cuban nationals returning to Cuba before becoming U.S. citizens. U.S.-Cuban talks on migration accords were suspended in 2004 due to disagreements over various issues identified by the United States. The U.S. Coast Guard uses a port for repatriating Cubans intercepted at sea. Cuba is responsible for allowing U.S. diplomats to monitor returned migrants and accept Cuban nationals deemed inadmissible to the U.S. Talks between Cuba and the U.S. on migration issues were canceled, with Cuba expressing readiness to discuss all concerns. Under the Obama Administration, biannual migration talks were restarted, with four rounds held since mid-2009. The Cuban team held talks with the U.S. in New York City on July 14, 2009, and in Havana on February 19, 2010. The State Department outlined objectives including effective operation of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, access to a deep-water port for Cuban migrants, monitoring welfare of returned Cubans, and Cuban government acceptance of excluded individuals. Cuba proposed a new immigration agreement, cooperation to combat alien smuggling, and opposed the \"wet foot/dry foot policy.\" The talks aimed to advance U.S. interests. The U.S. and Cuba held constructive discussions to advance mutual interests, including the full implementation of Migration Accords and safety of citizens. Cuba proposed a new draft migration accord and discussed improving the Cuban Interests Section in Washington. U.S. officials raised concerns about political prisoners and detainees, urging for necessary medical care and release. The third round of talks took place on June 18, 2010. In December 2009, the U.S. called for the release of Alan Gross during the third round of talks in June 2010. Secretary of State Clinton expressed concern about Gross's health and urged for his immediate release. The fourth round of migration talks in January 2011 covered various topics, including safe migration. The Cuban delegation recognized the reduction in illegal departures from Cuba due to joint efforts with the U.S. to combat migrant smuggling. The U.S. delegation reiterated concerns about Alan Gross's detention and called for his release. Several individuals, including U.S. government officials, have been convicted of spying for Cuba in the past decade. In the past decade, several individuals, including U.S. government officials, have been convicted of spying for Cuba. Kendall Myers was sentenced to life in prison, while Gwendolyn Myers received an 81-month sentence for passing classified information to the Cuban government. Ana Montes, a Defense Intelligence Agency analyst, was arrested for spying for Cuba and divulged sensitive information for 16 years. In October 2002, a woman was sentenced to 25 years in prison for divulging information about U.S. intelligence agents in Cuba and a \"special access program.\" This led to the expulsion of four Cuban diplomats in November 2002. In June 2001, members of the \"Wasp Network\" were convicted on espionage charges, with sentences ranging from 15 years to life in prison. In January 2002, the \"Cuban five\" intelligence agents were sentenced to prison terms for infiltrating Cuban exile groups and trying to penetrate U.S. military bases. The Cuban government sought their return, but a proposed exchange for imprisoned Cuban dissidents was rejected by the State Department. In 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal for a new trial for the \"Cuban five.\" In 2009, sentences for three of the \"Cuban five\" were reduced: Antonio Guerrero to almost 22 years, Ram\u00f3n Laba\u00f1ino to 30 years, and Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez to 18 years. Gerardo Hern\u00e1ndez is serving two life sentences for murder conspiracy, while Ren\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez was released in 2011 but must serve three years of probation in the United States. Cuba requested Gonz\u00e1lez's return for humanitarian reasons, and he was allowed to visit his dying brother in Cuba in 2012. The text chunk discusses the funding for Cuba broadcasting and democracy programs in FY2011 and FY2012. The bills P.L. 112-10 and P.L. 112-74 were passed in 2011 and 2012 respectively, with provisions for Cuba-related activities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, was passed in December 2011, combining nine full-year appropriations bills. It continued funding for Cuba broadcasting and democracy programs, with $28.475 million for broadcasting and $20 million for democracy and human rights funding. The bill was signed into law on December 23, 2011, after a legislative battle over Cuba provisions. The potential inclusion of two Cuba provisions in the FY2012 Financial Services Appropriations bill aimed to roll back Obama Administration's actions on remittances and family travel, and clarify payment terms for U.S. exports to Cuba. These provisions were also included in a \"megabus\" appropriations bill introduced by House Republicans. The FY2012 Financial Services Appropriations bill included two Cuba provisions aimed at rolling back Obama Administration's actions on remittances and family travel, and clarifying payment terms for U.S. exports to Cuba. However, congressional leaders agreed to exclude these provisions from H.R. 2055 after strong pressure from the White House. The second provision on the definition of \"payment of cash in advance\" for U.S. agricultural and medical products was dropped as a political tradeoff. P.L. 112-175 (H.J.Res. 117) continued funding for FY2013 for all 12 regular appropriations until March 27, 2013, with a 0.612% across-the-board increase. The FY2012 Financial Services Appropriations bill included provisions for Cuba, but they were excluded from H.R. 2055 after pressure from the White House. Funding for Cuba democracy programs and broadcasting was continued until March 27, 2013. S.Res. 366 honors Wilman Villar Mendoza, while S.Res. 525 recognizes Oswaldo Pay\u00e1. The Senate resolution praises the bravery of Oswaldo Pay\u00e1 and his colleagues for their efforts in the Varela Project, calls for respect of religious freedom, democracy, and human rights in Cuba, urges the Cuban government to uphold civil and human rights standards, demands an impartial investigation into Pay\u00e1's death, and condemns the detention of pro-democracy activists. Introduced on July 24, 2012, the resolution was passed by the Senate on July 31, 2012. S.Res. 609 (Moran) calls for the release of Alan Gross from Cuba and urges medical treatment for him. H.R. 1 (Rogers) includes amendments to eliminate funding for Radio and TV Marti. H.R. 255 (Serrano) aims to lift the trade embargo on Cuba. Introduced in 2011, these bills address Cuba-related issues. H.R. 256 (Serrano) Baseball Diplomacy Act waived prohibitions for Cuban nationals to play professional baseball in the U.S. H.R. 372 (Buchanan) aimed to deny leases to those engaging with sanctioned foreign governments. H.R. 380 (Lee) PIE Act of 2011 restricted Treasury funds for international education. H.R. 833 (Conaway) Agricultural Export Enhancement Act of 2011 aimed to facilitate legal sales of U.S. agricultural commodities to Cuba by defining payment terms and authorizing direct transfers between Cuban and U.S. financial institutions. Introduced on January 20, 2011, and referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs. H.R. 1317 (McCollum) aimed to stop taxpayer money on Cuba broadcasting by repealing certain acts. H.R. 1886 (Rangel) proposed the Export Freedom to Cuba Act to lift travel restrictions. H.R. 1887 (Rangel) introduced the Free Trade with Cuba Act to lift the trade embargo. H.R. 1888 (Rangel) aimed to promote American agricultural and medical exports to Cuba by facilitating exports, removing impediments, and prohibiting travel restrictions. H.R. 2047 (Ros-Lehtinen) sought to protect Caribbean coral reefs by excluding investors from the U.S. who enhance Cuba's ability to develop petroleum resources. The bill H.R. 2434/S. 1573 introduced sanctions for investments over $1 million in Cuba's petroleum development. Both bills included provisions clarifying advance payment definitions for U.S. agricultural and medical sales to Cuba. The Senate and House bills included provisions clarifying advance payment definitions for U.S. agricultural and medical sales to Cuba, with additional provisions related to financial transfers and travel restrictions. In 2009, the President eased restrictions on remittances for non-family members and religious institutions. The Cuba provision in H.R. 2434 and S. 1573 was not included in the FY2012 appropriations measure. An attempt to include the Senate version of the Financial Services appropriations measure in a \"minibus\" failed due to disagreement over direct transfers from Cuban to U.S. financial institutions for agricultural and medical exports. H.R. 2583 introduced the FY2012 Foreign Relations Authorization Act, requiring full enforcement of U.S. regulations. The provision in H.R. 2771 aimed to reinstate travel restrictions to Cuba as they were in January 2009, increasing the period for Cuban nationals to qualify for adjustment of status to five years. H.R. 2831 (Rivera) proposed amending the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 to make aliens ineligible for adjustment if they returned to Cuba after entering the United States. The Secretary of Homeland Security would have been required to rescind the status of aliens who returned to Cuba before becoming U.S. citizens. Introduced on August 30, 2011, and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. The curr_chunk discusses H.R. 4135, the Western Hemisphere Energy Security Act of 2012, which would allow U.S. companies to participate in hydrocarbon exploration in foreign maritime zones adjacent to the U.S. It also mentions H.R. 4310, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013, which included a provision prohibiting the Department of Defense from certain procurement contracts. Section 803 of H.R. 4310, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013, prohibited the Department of Defense from contracting with any person doing business with a state sponsor of terrorism. This provision was added to the bill during House floor consideration on May 17, 2012. The Senate-approved version of the bill did not include a similar provision. Both H.R. 5857 and S. 3241 bills prohibit direct funding assistance to Cuba and require assistance to go through regular notification procedures. The House bill allocates $20 million in ESF, while the Senate bill allocates $15 million for humanitarian assistance, economic reform, private sector initiatives, democracy, and human rights in Cuba. The House and Senate bills allocate funding for assistance in Cuba, with the House bill providing $28.062 million for broadcasting and the Senate bill providing $23.4 million. Congress approved a continuing resolution to fund Cuba democracy programs and broadcasting through March 27, 2013. The 113th Congress will need to address foreign aid appropriations for the rest of FY2013. H.R. 6067 (Ros-Lehtinen) introduced provisions on Cuba, including travel notifications, visa restrictions, and nuclear cooperation restrictions. H.Res. 226 (King) called for the extradition of convicted felon William Morales and other fugitives to the United States. H.Res. 536 (Diaz-Balart) introduced to condemn the murder of Wilman Villar Mendoza and honor his sacrifice for Cuban freedom. S. 223 (Rockefeller) focused on FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act, with an amendment by Rubio to restrict flights to state sponsors of terrorism. S. 405 (Nelson, Bill) aimed at Gulf Stream Protection Act of 2011, requiring regulations for oil or gas operations off the coasts of Cuba. The bill would require companies conducting oil or gas operations off the coasts of Cuba to submit an oil response plan for their operations and demonstrate resources to respond to a worst-case oil spill affecting US waters. The Secretary of the Interior would need to carry out an oil spill risk analysis and planning process for non-domestic oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico, including recommendations for a joint contingency plan with Mexico, Cuba, and the Bahamas. The bill introduced on February 17, 2011, focuses on a joint contingency plan with Mexico, Cuba, and the Bahamas for oil spill response in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Another bill introduced on March 3, 2011, aimed to discontinue Radio and TV Mart\u00ed broadcasts to Cuba. Additionally, bills introduced on March 16 and 17, 2011, sought to modify certain rights relating to marks, trade names, or commercial names.
