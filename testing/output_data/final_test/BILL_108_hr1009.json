    "content": "The \"Clear Your Good Name Act\" may be cited as the official title. It references voidable arrests in federal records. Any reference in a Federal law enforcement record to an arrest of a person living after the effective date of this Act shall be expunged within 30 days if the arrest is voidable. A person can petition a Federal district court for expungement if the arrest occurred before the effective date. The court orders the expungement of any reference or record of an arrest within 30 days. Failure to comply is a class B misdemeanor. Individuals with voidable arrests can act as if the arrest never happened. The Attorney General will issue regulations for compliance. Voidable arrest refers to an arrest where the person is released without formal charges, proceedings are dismissed, or it is determined that the arrest was without probable cause. This section will take effect on the first day of the fiscal year following two years after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 3. REFERENCES IN STATE RECORDS TO VOIDABLE ARRESTS. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended to provide a grant incentive for states that have laws similar to the Clear Your Good Name Act regarding expungement procedures, criminal penalties, and individual rights for voidable arrests. The Attorney General will issue regulations to ensure compliance with these requirements. The amendments made by this section will take effect on the first day of the fiscal year following the first fiscal year starting two years after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. REPORTS. After each fiscal year with section 2 of this Act, the Attorney General must report to Congress on the implementation, including the number of voidable arrests and expungements under different sections. The Attorney General must report to Congress annually on the implementation of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, including the number of voidable arrests and expungements in each state."
