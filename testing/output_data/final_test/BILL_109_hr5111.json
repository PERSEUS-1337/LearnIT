    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Royalty In-Kind for Energy Assistance Improvement Act of 2006\". The Congress finds that rising energy costs make it difficult for vulnerable residents to afford heating and cooling their homes. The Energy Information Administration projects higher fuel costs this winter. High summer electricity usage can lead to debt and disconnection. Over 13 million households in poverty will spend a significant portion of their income on energy bills. The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is crucial as it helps low-income Americans afford heating and cooling without sacrificing other necessities. Current funding levels only serve less than 15% of eligible individuals. The Secretary of the Interior can mandate Federal oil and gas lessees to meet their royalty obligations under specific acts. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires Federal oil and gas lessees to fulfill royalty payments through oil instead of monetary value. Section 342(j) of the Act aimed to give preference to low-income consumers when disposing of oil or gas received by the Government, but legal deficiencies prevent its implementation. The purpose of the Act is to amend section 342(j) to address these issues. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 aims to assist low-income consumers with their energy needs by amending section 342(j) to address legal deficiencies. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 amends section 342(j) to allow discounted sales of royalty oil and gas from federal leases to support LIHEAP. Section 342(j) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 allows discounted sales of royalty oil and gas from federal leases for LIHEAP support. The Secretary may sell royalty oil or gas at a discounted price not less than 50% of fair market value, with conditions required for the sale. The discounted price requires an agreement with the Secretary for additional resources for a low-income energy assistance program, ensuring the value covers the difference between the fair market value of purchased oil or gas and the amount paid, including administrative costs. The Secretary may issue rules and enter agreements with agencies or individuals for the sale of oil at a discounted price, ensuring compliance with the Anti-Deficiency Act."
