    "content": "The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a federal land retirement program for private land, established in 1985 to control soil erosion and stabilize land prices. Administered by USDA's Farm Services Agency (FSA) and funded by USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), the program offers rental payments and cost-share assistance for approved conservation practices. Incentives are available for socially disadvantaged farmers, new farmers, and limited-resource farmers. Participants in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) include farmers and ranchers, with options for new and beginning farmers, limited-resource farmers, and socially disadvantaged farmers. CRP contracts last 10 to 15 years, with participants bidding to retire land from production based on its environmental value. Landowners receive annual rental payments and must maintain the land under an approved conservation plan. After the contract expires, federal payments cease, and if the land is highly erodible, participants must manage it under a NRCS-approved conservation system to be eligible for federal farm programs. There are two types of sign-ups for enrolling land in the CRP: general and continuous. As of March 2011, there were 748,858 CRP contracts nationally on 415,311 farms, with contracts under continuous sign-ups exceeding general sign-ups. Acreage under continuous sign-ups currently exceeds 5 million acres nationally. Land eligible for CRP enrollment must meet specific criteria outlined in the 2008 farm bill. The farm bill clarified that alfalfa grown in an approved rotation practice is considered an agricultural commodity. General sign-ups are enrollment periods for the CRP, with the most recent sign-up enrolling 4.0 million acres. A new sign-up (number 41) was announced for March 14, 2011, through April 15, 2011. The CRP general sign-ups are set to take effect on October 1, 2011. FSA has partnered with conservation organizations for outreach efforts. 84% of CRP acreage is currently enrolled through general sign-ups. Applicants must meet eligibility criteria and submit bids based on environmental benefits. General sign-ups are competitive. For general sign-up number 39, nearly 4.8 million acres were offered by farmers, with 4 million acres finally enrolled. The previous sign-up (number 33) selected 1 million acres out of 1.4 million offered, including land in conservation priority areas, highly erodible land, and areas to be restored to rare habitats. FSA has adjusted categories and points under the EBI to include broader environmental goals, such as awarding points for carbon sequestration. The FSA ranks all applications nationally based on an EBI score cutoff above which applications will be accepted. For the most recent general sign-up (number 41), decisions on the EBI cutoff will be made after analyzing all individual offers. Environmentally desirable land can be enrolled in the CRP at any time for 10- to 15-year contracts under continuous sign-ups. Offers with willingness to accept less than the maximum rental rate and to reenroll land may receive additional points. Continuous sign-up contracts are automatically accepted for environmentally desirable land, with no competitive bidding. Additional incentive payments are included, with options for specific conservation needs like restoring wetlands and native trees. The Bush Administration announced initiatives to restore bobwhite quail habitats and wetlands outside floodplains. Various sign-ups have added acres over the years, with the FY2010 sign-up enrolling 607,000 acres as of March 2011. As of March 2011, the Continuous sign-up program has enrolled over 5 million acres, representing 16% of the total CRP acres. The CREP program targets areas with agriculture-related environmental issues and has agreements in 33 states. USDA provides 80% of the funding for CREP, which has enrolled over 1.2 million acres by March 2011. In February 2011, USDA and Louisiana entered into a new CREP agreement to improve water quality in the Louisiana Coastal Prairie Region, including portions of Acadia, Allen, Calcasieu, Evangeline, Jefferson Davis, St. Landry, and Vermilion parishes. The farm bill allows for the enrollment of farmable wetlands in the CRP on a continuous basis, with 272,224 acres enrolled in the farmable wetlands program as of March 2011. The 2008 farm bill expanded land eligibility for the FWP. The 2008 farm bill expanded land eligibility for the Farmable Wetlands Program (FWP) to include various types of land such as constructed wetlands, commercial pond-raised aquaculture land, intermittently flooded land, and buffer acreage. Enrollment is now limited to a maximum of 40 contiguous wetland acres on a single tract of land. Commercial use of the land is not permitted, and other Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) initiatives support additional conservation practices. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) supports various conservation practices such as upland bird habitat buffers, bottomland hardwood trees, wetlands, and pine plantings. In 2010, Secretary Vilsack announced an expansion of acreage for wildlife enhancement, bird habitat buffers, and duck nesting habitat. The 2008 farm bill reauthorized the CRP with a maximum acreage cap of 32 million acres. The 2008 farm bill (P.L. 107-171) directed the Secretary of Agriculture to prioritize contract bids from producers residing in the county where CRP acreage is located. FY2009 enrollment was 33.7 million acres, decreasing to 30.93 million acres in FY2010. Current enrollment is 31.2 million acres, 767,000 acres below the cap. The bill also amended the pilot program for wetland and buffer acres in CRP, allowing each state to enroll up to 100,000 acres, with a national maximum of 1 million acres. Eligible lands include wetlands cropped in three of the last 10 years, land for developing constructed wetlands, and land for commercial use. The 2008 farm bill allows for cost-share payments on land used for hardwood trees, windbreaks, shelterbelts, and wildlife corridors. Funding of $100 million is authorized for tree thinning. Evaluation criteria for CRP contracts include improving soil resources, water quality, and wildlife habitat. Preference is given to landowners and operators who are residents of the county where CRP acreage is located. Preference in new CRP contracts will be given to local residents. The Chesapeake Bay region is a priority area for the program, with funding priority for specific rivers. Incentives are in place to increase participation of beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers. The CRP Transition Option aims to help these farmers transition land to sustainable production methods, with additional rental payment incentives. The CRP Transition Option offers extra rental payments for CRP contract holders who lease or sell land to beginning or socially disadvantaged farmers. It also provides assistance for organic certification costs and land transfers, with $25 million allocated for this purpose. Participants can join with farmers to make conservation improvements and begin organic certification one year before the CRP contract ends. The CRP Transition Option allows CRP contract holders to sell or lease land to beginning or socially disadvantaged farmers. The farmers must implement a conservation plan and have the option to enroll in conservation programs upon taking possession of the land. The farmer/rancher can re-enroll land into the CRP through the continuous sign-up program. FSA will make payments to the retired owner for two years after the CRP contract ends. FSA divided CRP changes into two parts: those needing an EIS and those needing an EA. The EA process is quicker than the EIS process. In June 2009, FSA implemented Part 2 changes, including new practices under the Farmable Wetlands Program. The Farmable Wetlands Program introduced three new practices: eligibility for commercial pond-raised aquaculture, flooded prairie farmland, and constructed wetlands. Other changes included $50 million cost-share assistance for tree trimming, refined income limits, and a 32 million-acre cap. The Part 1 CRP regulation will require an EIS and implement various provisions, such as updating crop history eligibility, exempting certain acres from enrollment caps, and implementing transition incentives for farmers. The CRP Transition Option program is delayed due to the EIS process. The CRP Transition Option program is delayed by the EIS process. FSA published the draft SEIS in February 2010, with the final SEIS available for public comment from June 18 to July 19, 2010. A final rule is expected in mid-2011, allowing beginning farmers to work the land a year before the contract expires. The Sustainable Agriculture Coalition and the Center for Rural Affairs campaigned for the program's implementation in 2009. In 2009, various groups campaigned for the implementation of the CRP Transition Option program without an EIS. The National Grain and Feed Association suggested lowering CRP acreage to 24 million acres and focusing conservation spending on working farmland. An interim rule published in May 2010 allowed retired farm owners to amend their CRP contracts if due to expire within a year. The 2008 farm bill allows retired or retiring owners to amend expiring CRP contracts to transition land to beginning or socially disadvantaged farmers. Acquiring farmers can return land to production using sustainable methods. Incentive payments are available for selling or leasing land to new farmers. Managed haying and grazing are permitted under certain conditions, with the option to graze for invasive species control. The 2008 farm bill allows retired owners to transition CRP land to new farmers. Managed haying and grazing for invasive species control are permitted under specific conditions, with reduced rental payments. Wind turbine installation is also allowed under certain conditions. USDA announced in May 2008 that 24 million acres of CRP land could be used for managed haying and grazing after the bird nesting season, limited to the least environmentally sensitive land. The National Wildlife Federation and six state chapters sought an injunction against USDA for not conducting an appropriate environmental review of the proposed Conservation Reserve Program (CFU) program. The U.S. District Court issued a permanent injunction suspending the CFU provision, except for those approved or applied before the temporary restraining order. Approximately 28 million acres under CRP contracts expired between 2007 and 2010, with no plans for a CFU program in FY2011. Between 2007 and 2010, 28 million acres under CRP contracts expired. Contracts for 5.9 million acres expired in FY2008, 3.9 million in FY2009, and an additional 4.4 million in 2010. 86% of the expired acreage has been reenrolled or extended as of March 2011. 86.6% of the 15.7 million acres that expired in 2007 were approved for extensions or new contracts. 81.6% of the 5.9 million acres that expired in 2008 also have extensions or new contracts. About 75% of the 4.4 million acres that expired in 2010 have been reenrolled or extended. Contracts for 4.4 million acres are scheduled to expire, with extensions or renewals based on the Environmental Benefit Index (EBI) score and location within national priority areas. FSA ranked contracts into five tiers based on EBI scores, with top-tier participants eligible for new 10-year contracts and wetland owners eligible for 15-year contracts. Lower-tier participants could extend their contracts for shorter durations. Acreage under specific programs may be eligible for higher payments. Enrollments in farmable wetlands program receive higher payments due to environmental benefits, location, and incentives. Average payments are $129 per acre for CREP and $113 for FWP, compared to $46 for general sign-ups. FSA projects $1.85 billion in CRP payments for FY2011, similar to FY2010. CRP contract obligations were estimated at $2.4 billion annually before acreage reduction to 32 million acres. Monetized CRP benefits were estimated by NRCS before 2003. Prior to 2003, NRCS estimated that monetized CRP benefits averaged about $1.4 billion per year, excluding non-monetized benefits like improved groundwater quality. The average rental rate for all CRP land was around $55 per acre in March 2011, with rates ranging from $46 to $130 depending on the type of acreage. Participants can receive a signing incentive payment (SIP) of $100 to $150 per acre and a practice incentive payment (PIP) equal to 40% of eligible installation costs. In 2008 and 2011, producers raised concerns about low CRP rental rates compared to potential production income. This could lead to producers not enrolling or renewing contracts, potentially impacting environmental conservation efforts. The 2008 farm bill directs USDA to conduct an annual survey of land rental rates for agricultural assistance programs. A 2011 study by ERS modeled the effect on CRP of increasing commodity prices, including biofuels production. Maintaining CRP under its current configuration could have significant environmental costs. The study suggested that maintaining CRP could lead to significant expenditure increases. Constraints on rental rates could still meet enrollment goals with moderate rate increases, but may result in lower EBI as producers with profitable, environmentally sensitive acreage may choose not to enroll. Early contract termination incurs a penalty fee of 25% on rental payments plus repayment with interest. CRP rental payments are considered income subject to self-employment Social Security taxes. Producers prefer to treat CRP payments as rental income. The IRS considers CRP payments as subject to self-employment taxes, but a 2008 farm bill exempts disabled and retired contract holders from these taxes. Retiring land in rural areas could lead to fewer farmers and farming-related jobs. A USDA report found that high CRP enrollment between 1986 and 1992 led to some job loss in rural areas, but this trend did not continue in the 1990s. Some groups argue that retiring land from productive agricultural use through the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) could have negative economic impacts on agricultural production and rural communities. CRP enrollment is capped at 25% of a county's cropland, with exemptions for certain programs. Critics believe that local economic adjustments could be significant if existing CRP acreage is lost or new enrollments are halted. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is crucial for economic growth in U.S. agriculture and rural communities. It helps prevent soil erosion, improves water quality, and provides habitats for wildlife. Right-sizing and reforming the CRP is essential to maintain economic vitality and ensure abundant food supply. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has provided natural habitats for wildlife, restored over 2 million acres of wetlands, and reduced erosion by more than 454 million tons per year. It has also sequestered 48 million metric tons of carbon annually, established 3.2 million acres of wildlife habitat, and reduced nitrogen and phosphorus application. Additionally, participants have planted nearly 3 million acres of trees, making it the largest federal tree-planting program in history."
