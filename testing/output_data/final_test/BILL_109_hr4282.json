    "content": "The \"Health Freedom Protection Act\" amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to include claims to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease. Section 403(r) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include claims for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease or health-related condition. Publications of the United States Government are exempt from certain restrictions under this Act. The Secretary shall not construe the distribution or sale of a publication of the United States Government in connection with the sale of a food or dietary supplement as evidence of an intent to sell that food or dietary supplement as a drug. Accurate quotations from a publication of the United States Government referred to in clause (G) shall not be subject to certain restrictions under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Secretary shall allow accurate quotations from a United States Government publication regarding the relationship of nutrients to disease prevention, with concise disclaimers not exceeding three sentences. Claims of the type described in subparagraph (1)(B) are not authorized unless the Secretary determines that there is no scientific evidence supporting the claim and that the claim is inherently misleading. The Secretary cannot use consumer perception tests for this determination and must prove each element by clear and convincing evidence. The Secretary is also not allowed to exclude studies. The Secretary cannot exclude studies on the treatment effects of nutrients on disease from evaluating health claims. Members of advisory committees cannot be granted exemptions for personal financial interests when evaluating certain claims. The Secretary is not bound by prior decisions regarding the relationship of saw palmetto to benign prostatic hyperplasia. Authorized health claims for nutrients include Saw Palmetto improving urine flow, reducing nocturia and voiding urgency in benign prostatic hyperplasia, and Omega-3 Fatty Acids reducing the risk of coronary heart disease. Omega-3 Fatty Acids may reduce the risk of sudden death heart attack, Glucosamine and Chondroitin Sulfate may reduce joint stiffness and pain associated with osteoarthritis, and Calcium may reduce the risk of bone fractures. The Secretary must act on claims under subparagraphs (3)(B), (3)(C), or (3)(E) within 100 days of receiving the petition, without seeking extensions. Failure to do so will result in authorization or allowance of the claim. The new provision allows for statements in dietary supplement labels that imply disease prevention or treatment without mentioning specific diseases, as long as they comply with regulations. SEC. 4. DIETARY SUPPLEMENT LABELING EXEMPTIONS. Amends Section 403B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to allow truthful scientific publications used in connection with the sale of food or dietary supplements to consumers without being defined as labeling or evidence of intent to sell a drug. The distribution of exempt publications shall not be restricted. Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act is amended to include new regulations regarding the advertising of dietary supplements and ingredients. Definitions for dietary supplement and dietary ingredient are provided, along with exemptions from regulation for certain publications. The new regulations under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act provide exemptions for certain publications from being regulated as advertising, including truthful summaries of peer-reviewed scientific publications. The Commission is prohibited from attributing false advertising claims to an advertiser for statements they did not make. Before authorizing an investigation into false advertising of dietary supplements or ingredients, the Commission must send the advertiser a 'Notice of Suspected Violation and Opportunity to Cure' detailing the specific advertising statement in question, the scientific basis for the suspicion, and a deadline of at least 30 days. The Commission must provide a notice to advertisers suspected of false advertising regarding dietary supplements or ingredients, allowing them at least 30 days to voluntarily cease using the statement in question. If the advertiser complies, they will not be investigated for false advertisement by the Commission. The burden of proof in false advertisement cases for dietary supplements lies with the Commission to establish that the advertisement is misleading and causes consumers to be misled. The advertiser must prove by a preponderance of evidence that the advertisement is not false before an investigation begins."
