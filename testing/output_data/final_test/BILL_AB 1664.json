    "title": "AB 1664",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 30515 of the Penal Code is amended to include definitions of an \"assault weapon,\" such as specific features on semiautomatic rifles and pistols. These features include pistol grips, thumbhole stocks, folding or telescoping stocks, grenade launchers, flash suppressors, and more. The amended Penal Code includes definitions of an \"assault weapon,\" detailing features like handgrips, shrouds, detachable magazines, fixed magazines with over 10 rounds, semiautomatic shotguns with specific features, and shotguns with revolving cylinders. The amended Penal Code defines \"assault weapons\" based on specific features. However, pistols designed for Olympic target shooting events are exempt from this definition if sanctioned by the International Olympic Committee and USA Shooting. Specific models from manufacturers like Benelli and Hammerli are listed as exempt. The Department of Justice will create a program to exempt new models of competitive pistols from being classified as assault weapons. The exempt pistols may be based on recommendations from USA Shooting or other relevant organizations. This is outlined in Section 30680 of the Penal Code. Section 30680 of the Penal Code exempts individuals who lawfully possessed assault weapons before January 1, 2017, from certain registration requirements. Any person who lawfully possessed an assault weapon before June 1, 1989, must register the firearm by January 1, 1991. Those who possessed an assault weapon before it was specified as such must register within 90 days with the Department of Justice. Any person who lawfully possessed an assault weapon prior to the date it was defined as an assault weapon must register the firearm by January 1, 2001, with the department, providing unique identification details and owner information. The department may charge a fee of up to $20 per person for registration, not exceeding processing costs. Fees will increase based on cost-of-living adjustments or Budget Act limits, deposited into the Dealers\u2019 Record of Sale Special Account. Any person who lawfully possessed an assault weapon without a fixed magazine from 2001 to 2016 must register the firearm before January 1, 2018, using an online application provided by the department. The registration for firearms must include unique identification details, acquisition information, and personal details of the registrant. A fee of up to $15 per person can be charged for processing, to be paid at the time of submission. The fee is deposited in a special account for this purpose. The department will adopt regulations exempt from the Administrative Procedure Act to implement the subdivision. No reimbursement is required by this act as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing crimes or infractions. This act will only take effect if Senate Bill 880 of the 2015-16 Regular Session is enacted by January 1, 2017."
