The Electric Transportation Advancement Act of 2009 aims to enhance energy security, reduce oil dependence, improve transportation efficiency, and expand grid-supported transportation. It includes programs to develop plug-in electric drive vehicle technology, increase employment in electric drive design and manufacturing, and optimize existing electric infrastructure for light duty transportation fueling. The Electric Transportation Advancement Act of 2009 aims to optimize existing electric infrastructure for fueling light duty transportation and other vehicles to reduce petroleum use. The Electric Transportation Advancement Act of 2009 focuses on optimizing electric infrastructure for light duty transportation to reduce petroleum use. SEC. 3 specifically addresses near-term electric transportation. The Electric Transportation Advancement Act of 2009 aims to optimize electric infrastructure for light-duty transportation by establishing a competitive grant and revolving loan program to fund qualified electric transportation projects based on cost-effectiveness in reducing emissions and petroleum usage. The Electric Transportation Advancement Act of 2009 establishes a competitive grant and revolving loan program to fund electric transportation projects based on cost-effectiveness in reducing emissions and petroleum usage. The Secretary will establish criteria for loans and use unused grant funds for loans. Priority is given to grants and loans under the program. The Electric Transportation Advancement Act of 2009 establishes a program to inventory and analyze electric transportation technologies and markets, as well as promote their applications. Additionally, it includes a program for electricity usage certification. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, amended by the Electric Transportation Advancement Act of 2009, introduces a program to develop low-cost methods for using off-peak electricity and managing on-peak electricity use. It also aims to enable plug-in electric drive vehicles to provide emergency back-up power and collaborate with utilities for this purpose. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, amended by the Electric Transportation Advancement Act of 2009, aims to study the implications of plug-in electric drive vehicles on renewable energy production and the potential value of using energy stored in these vehicles to improve grid efficiency and reliability. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, amended by the Electric Transportation Advancement Act of 2009, aims to develop a program for certifying emissions, fuel economy, and petroleum usage of plug-in hybrid electric drive vehicles and other electric transportation technologies. The certification process considers the entire vehicle propulsion system, not just the engine. The Administrator will establish a task force to recommend certification protocols for plug-in hybrid electric drive vehicles and other electric transportation technologies, involving various stakeholders. The Administrator will publish certification protocols for public comment within 2 years and adopt final protocols within 3 years for certifying emissions, fuel economy, and petroleum usage of plug-in hybrid electric drive vehicles and other electric transportation technologies. The Administrator will evaluate and modify certification protocols every 2 years to ensure accurate measurement of emissions, fuel economy, and petroleum usage for plug-in hybrid electric drive vehicles and other electric transportation technologies. The Administrator will modify certification protocols for plug-in hybrid electric drive vehicles and electric transportation technologies to maximize emissions reductions, energy efficiency, and petroleum use reductions. This includes considering the entire vehicle propulsion system and off-board charging. The term 'plug-in hybrid electric drive vehicle' refers to vehicles propelled by an electric motor and rechargeable energy storage system, along with an internal combustion engine using combustible fuel. Nightly off-board charging and different engine turn-on control strategies are also included. SEC. 6. CITY CARS. Section 131 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to study and report on the benefits and barriers of widespread deployment of City Cars with performance capabilities between low-speed and passenger vehicles, using electric or hybrid drive technologies. The study will recommend safety requirements for electric, fuel cell, or plug-in hybrid vehicles based on their usage patterns. It will also consider the benefits and issues of limiting City Cars to a maximum speed and make a recommendation on the appropriate speed. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this purpose. Transition to fuel neutral EPA regulations. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to establish fuel and technology neutral mobile source emissions control programs in light of advances in automotive engine technologies. A program promoting fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly vehicles covers various technologies like spark-ignited engines, compression-ignited engines, dual-fueled vehicles, electric vehicles, and fuel cell vehicles. The Administrator must report on fuel and technology definitions in Federal law within a year of this subsection's enactment. The Administrator must report to Congress on how to make definitions in Federal law fuel and technology neutral within 18 months. This report should include ways to incorporate petroleum reductions, emissions reductions, and reductions in full fuel cycle criteria pollutants into the emissions reduction program required by the Electric Transportation Advancement Act of 2009. Rulemaking must be completed within 2 years after the report submission. The Administrator must adopt final rules for a fuel and technology neutral program to reduce emissions from mobile sources within 10 years. This program includes emissions controls and a credit-based compliance mechanism for manufacturers, ensuring public health protection. Authorization of appropriations is granted for the emissions control program. SEC. 8. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DIVERSIFICATION. Amendment to allocate 30 percent of funds for programs to National Laboratories."
