Large sections of the cities were burned, with up to 1,000 people killed and many more wounded. Over 100,000 ethnic Uzbeks fled to Uzbekistan due to economic disparities and discrimination. Prejudices worsened after the 2010 coup against Kurmanbek Bakiyev, leading to the violence. The April 2010 coup against Kurmanbek Bakiyev led to tensions between northern and southern Kyrgyz interests. Southern ethnic Uzbeks supported the interim government for promised democracy. Some officials believed violence was instigated by elements of the former Bakiyev government. Interim leader Roza Otunbayev requested Russian \"peacekeepers\" to restore order, but Russia declined pending a CSTO meeting. Military reservists were mobilized, and the CSTO decided to send equipment to Kyrgyz security forces. On June 14, the CSTO decided to send equipment to Kyrgyz security forces. President Medvedev mentioned the possibility of convening a summit of CSTO heads of state to discuss sending \"peacekeepers\" if the situation in Kyrgyzstan worsened. Clashes between ethnic groups in Osh, Jalal-Abad, and other areas led to barricades and roadblocks, hindering the delivery of food and medical supplies. Various organizations, including the World Health Organization and Red Cross, sent aid to Osh. Russia, Turkey, and China evacuated their nationals from Osh. Uzbekistan opened refugee camps for those fleeing violence in Kyrgyzstan and temporarily closed its borders to further refugees. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has urged Uzbekistan and Tajikistan to keep their borders open for refugees from Kyrgyzstan. Russia has deployed troops to defend its airbase near Bishkek.

The United States is providing assistance to help remedy the results of the violence in Kyrgyzstan. Secretary of State Clinton has spoken with officials in the interim Kyrgyz government, the UN, the OSCE, and Russia for a coordinated international response. The U.S. transit center dispatched supplies to Osh. Kyrgyzstan gained independence in 1991 and the U.S. aims to enhance its sovereignty, increase democratic participation, bolster economic reform, strengthen human rights, prevent weapons proliferation, and combat terrorism and trafficking. The United States has strategic interests in Central Asia, particularly in oil-rich Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. After the 9/11 attacks, Kyrgyzstan allowed the U.S. to use an airbase at Manas international airport for military operations in Afghanistan. In 2010, the Manas Transit Center hosted U.S., Spanish, and French troops. The April 2010 coup in Kyrgyzstan was partly due to utility price increases. The April 2010 coup in Kyrgyzstan was influenced by utility price increases and popular discontent with President Kurmanbek Bakiyev's administration, which was perceived as corrupt and nepotistic. Demonstrators protested against price hikes and privatization of energy companies, triggering security concerns and efforts to suppress media freedom. Protests by the opposition in Kyrgyzstan led to suppression of media freedom, closure of internet websites and opposition newspapers. Opposition accused President Bakiyev of power usurpation, political repression, and unjustified price increases. Roza Otunbayeva was elected as the opposition bloc leader, announcing nationwide rallies for reforms. President Bakiyev faced criticism at a meeting of the Assembly of Peoples of Kyrgyzstan. President Bakiyev faced criticism at a meeting of the Assembly of Peoples of Kyrgyzstan for his policies, which some participants harshly criticized. He defended himself by stating that critics from rural and mountainous areas were uninformed and suggested legislators visit these areas to educate voters. Bakiyev claimed the assembly endorsed his plans to change the constitution for a new \"consultative democracy,\" similar to Turkmenistan's authoritarian regime. He also relocated government offices to Osh, citing the need for increased security in the south. Observers saw the moves as a shift of economic power to the south, where Bakiyev's family resides. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon highlighted democratization and human rights issues during his visit to Kyrgyzstan. He emphasized the importance of protecting human rights, including free speech and freedom of the media. This visit further fueled popular discontent against Bakiyev. Faced with rising discontent, Kyrgyz Prime Minister Daniyar Usenov ordered the government to pay half of rural households' power bills.

Otunbayeva announced the formation of an interim government after the previous government was illegitimately elected. The interim government included key officials in charge of economic issues, finances, constitutional reform, and public prosecution. Otunbayeva stated that the interim government would rule until presidential elections are held in six months. As one of her first acts, she rolled back prices for water, electricity, and heat to last year's levels and pledged to comply with all international agreements. The interim government under Otunbayeva announced key appointments and measures, including investigating corruption in commercial contracts, reappointing defense minister Ismail Isakov, and authorizing the use of force against looters.

The interim government released a list of wanted individuals, including Bakiyev's family members, for their involvement in crimes. The interim government of Kyrgyzstan stripped Bakiyev of his presidential immunity, leading to his arrest and prosecution. Bakiyev claimed his guards fired in self-defense during protests. Otunbayev was appointed interim president until a December 2011 election, with pro-Bakiyev demonstrations quelled after clashes. The May 19 clashes in Jalal-abad resulted in two deaths and many injuries. The coup led to 85 deaths and over 1,000 injuries, with significant damage to government and commercial buildings in Bishkek. Some believe the uprising was driven by unemployed youth, while others claim it was planned by political party opposition leaders. Moscow's criticism of Bakiyev also fueled anti-regime sentiments. The recent coup in Kyrgyzstan was carried out by youth groups, with parallels to the 2005 coup against authoritarian regimes. The more recent coup had higher casualties due to government forces firing on demonstrators. The 2005 coup was led by elites, while the recent one was a grassroots effort. Opposition leaders struggle to restore peace amidst economic downturn. The recent coup in Kyrgyzstan led to economic problems due to declining remittances from migrant workers in Russia and Kazakhstan. The interim government's nationalization of businesses owned by Maksim Bakiyev raised concerns among investors, leading to canceled projects. Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan delayed reopening borders, with accusations of bias against the interim government. Some hope the coup will reverse Kyrgyzstan's authoritarianism and promote democratization. The interim government in Kyrgyzstan, led by Atambayev, aims to restore civil peace and advance democratization. Efforts include proposing constitutional changes for a parliamentary system of government and preparing for upcoming elections.

A draft constitution, finalized by a constitutional commission, is set for a referendum on June 27, 2010. Otunbayeva supports the shift to a parliamentary system to prevent authoritarianism. Legislative elections are planned for October 10, 2010, and a presidential election is scheduled for December 2011, in which Otunbayeva is ineligible to run. Ethnic tensions persist in the country following the aftermath of a coup. The coup in Kyrgyzstan highlighted ethnic tensions between Kyrgyz ultranationalists and minority groups like Uzbeks, Russians, and Meskhetian Turks. Incidents of violence and land seizures occurred, leading to five deaths. North-south tensions in the country are also related to ethnic divisions, with Uzbeks feeling excluded from the central government in Bishkek and some Kyrgyz families in the south feeling marginalized. The coup could worsen these tensions if northerners are perceived as leading the overthrow of the southerner Bakiyev. Some supporters of Bakiyev want a federal government with equal powers for the north and south, but Tekebayev opposes federalism due to concerns about separatism. In the south, there are calls for secession and the formation of the Democratic Republic of Southern Kyrgyzstan. Leaders of the interim government, including Otunbayeva, Tekebayev, and Beknazarov, are southerners. During the violence on April 7, the OSCE called for an end to censorship, while UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed shock over the deadly clashes in Kyrgyzstan and appealed for restraint.

Prime Minister Putin denied direct involvement in the coup but supported the new interim government and offered humanitarian aid. Some Western and Russian media suggest Russia orchestrated the Kyrgyzstan coup due to dissatisfaction with Bakiyev not closing the Manas Transit Center as promised. In contrast, the 2005 coup was attributed to US influence through pro-democracy assistance. The US denied direct involvement, but Russia sees Bakiyev's ouster as removing a US-backed leader. Russian influence in Kyrgyzstan was seen as successful, leading to warnings for other regional leaders like President Saakashvili of Georgia to pursue pro-Russian policies. Prime Minister Putin hinted at withholding $1.7 billion in loans to Kyrgyzstan, linking it to the closure of the US military base. Russian websites published anti-Bakiyev articles, prompting the Kyrgyz government to block them. In March 2010, the Kyrgyz government blocked websites, leading to Russian embassy denouncement. Russia increased contacts with Kyrgyz opposition leaders after Kyrgyzstan agreed to keep the U.S. Manas Transit Center. Russian umbrage grew over reports of U.S. funding an anti-terrorism training center in Kyrgyzstan. Russia also announced increased customs duties on petroleum products exported to Commonwealth members. Increased customs duties on petroleum products exported to Commonwealth members disrupted supplies to Kyrgyzstan, leading to higher prices and potentially reducing profits for Kyrgyz firms linked to Bakiyev. Russian officials also renewed calls to close the Manas Transit Center. The Russian government deployed paratroopers to various locations in Kyrgyzstan to protect Russian military families, following unrest in the region. The Russian government deployed troops to Kyrgyzstan to protect Russian military families. Additional troops were sent on April 11 and 30.

Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin visited Kyrgyzstan to affirm Russia's support and praised the government's efforts to protect Russian citizens. Other Central Asian states showed little reaction to the turmoil in Kyrgyzstan. In response to the popular uprising against Bakiyev in Kyrgyzstan, Central Asian presidents were alarmed by the potential contagion effects. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan closed their borders, impacting regional trade and economic cooperation. Georgia raised concerns about Russia's involvement in the coup, but Kyrgyz officials denied it. Kazakhstan later announced it would reopen borders and provide humanitarian assistance to Kyrgyzstan. The coup in Kyrgyzstan was a result of discontent with the former authorities due to social and economic issues, nepotism, and corruption.

Russia had objected to the center, as Kyrgyzstan had previously resisted allowing Russia to establish another airbase there. The United States hesitated to recognize the interim government in Kyrgyzstan, emphasizing that it was not an anti-American or Russian-sponsored coup. Instead of competing for influence, President Medvedev discussed possible cooperative actions with President Obama, including involving the OSCE for peace facilitation. The US provided medical supplies worth over $200,000 to treat the wounded after the coup. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Blake was involved in these efforts. The United States provided medical supplies worth over $200,000 to treat the wounded in Kyrgyzstan. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Blake visited Bishkek on April 14 to meet with Otunbayeva, showing U.S. support for the interim government. This visit may have influenced Bakiyev to resign.

Michael McFaul announced $15 million in lease payments for the Manas Transit Center would be delivered to the interim government. He emphasized U.S. commitment to democratization and human rights in Kyrgyzstan, denying complicity in corruption. Some argue the U.S. de-emphasized human rights concerns to maintain good relations with the Bakiyev government. The U.S. embassy in Bishkek is accused of eschewing contacts with opposition politicians. Observers disagree that the U.S. de-emphasized human rights concerns. Some Kyrgyz politicians criticize the U.S. but not Russia or China for the same issue. Russia is not asked to close its airbase at Kant like the U.S. is asked to close the transit center. Michael McFaul held meetings with civil society representatives and emphasized human rights during his visits to Kyrgyzstan. The U.S. embassy in Bishkek faced criticism for not engaging with opposition politicians, but the ambassador claimed to have met with them and raised human rights concerns. Russia's stance on the Manas Transit Center had shifted, focusing on stability and troop monitoring. McFaul dismissed the alleged statement by a Russian official about closing the Manas Transit Center in Kyrgyzstan as spurious. Analysts called for increased U.S. foreign assistance to counter perceptions of waning support for democracy and human rights. They also recommended aiding the interim government in investigating corruption from the previous administration. The interim government is investigating Bakiyev government corruption related to transit center operations. Analysts recommend more U.S. aid for hydroelectric projects and launching visible aid projects beyond the transit center, such as supporting educational institutions. Despite views of Russian involvement in the coup, Russian analyst Tatyana Stanovaya argues that U.S. officials are familiar with members of Kyrgyzstan's interim government, who have been pro-Western. The Manas Transit Center near Bishkek is crucial for the U.S. surge in Afghanistan. The Transit Center near Bishkek is vital for the U.S. surge in Afghanistan, serving as a key entry and exit point for troops. It also provides refueling services for U.S. and NATO aircraft. The center is part of the Northern Distribution Network, facilitating the delivery of supplies to Afghanistan via various routes. In March 2010, around 50,000 troops passed through Manas on their way to or from Afghanistan. The Manas airfield in Afghanistan experienced a temporary interruption in troop flights through the transit center, but resupply and refueling missions continued. The leasing arrangement for the transit center is up for renewal in July 2010, with some officials suggesting a review of the lease conditions. Otunbayeva warned about potential corruption issues related to commercial supplies. Otunbayeva warned about potential corruption issues with commercial supplies for the transit center and announced the automatic renewal of the lease for one year. The status of the transit center is expected to be a campaign issue in the upcoming presidential and legislative elections, with some candidates likely to run on an anti-base platform. In April 2010, analyst Eugene Huskey warned of a potential party bloc campaigning against corruption and the transit center. Diplomat Baktybek Abdrisaev argued that the center benefits Kyrgyzstan's national security. Controversy surrounds jet fuel purchases from a Russian-owned oil refinery. Chuck Squires, a former American Army lieutenant colonel, was hired to handle the contract for fuel procurement and transportation to Manas. Red Star's business was taken over by the Mina Corporation Limited, which sold Russian jet fuel to the American base. Russian government imposed a tariff on refined products for Kyrgyzstan, affecting the previously tariff-free exports. Kyrgyz companies, controlled by Maksim Bakiyev, held contracts with Red Star and Mina for fuel services. The United States has denied allegations of making payments to the Bakiyev family for transit center operations. Assistant Secretary of State Blake stated that fuel contracts are awarded through competitive and transparent tenders. Roza Otunbayeva, head of the Social Democratic Party, is involved in the investigation of fuel supply arrangements. Several key political figures in Kyrgyzstan include Roza Otunbayeva, Temir Sariyev, Omurbek Tekebayev, Almazbek Atambayev, and Azimbek Beknazarov. They hold various positions in different political parties and have been involved in opposition movements and government roles.
