The \"Ivanpah Valley Airport Public Lands Transfer Act\" authorizes the Secretary to convey Federal public lands to Clark County, Nevada for an airport facility development, subject to specified conditions. The \"Ivanpah Valley Airport Public Lands Transfer Act\" authorizes the Secretary to convey Federal public lands to Clark County, Nevada for an airport facility development. The County must fulfill conditions including conducting an airspace assessment, obtaining FAA certification, and retaining ownership of Jean Airport. Payment for the conveyance of each parcel is based on fair market value. The Secretary deposits payments into a special account for acquiring private inholdings in Mojave National Preserve and protecting petroglyph resources in Clark County, Nevada. Funds can only be used for specified purposes and cannot be spent until certain conditions are met. The Environmental Policy Act of 1969 allows for the development of an airport at the Ivanpah site. If it is determined that an airport should not be constructed on the conveyed lands, the Secretary of the Interior will refund all payments made to the County, and the lands will revert back to the United States.
