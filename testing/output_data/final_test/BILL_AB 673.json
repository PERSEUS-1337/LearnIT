    "title": "AB 673",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1203.9 of the Penal Code is amended to require the transfer of probation cases to the superior court in the county where the person permanently resides, unless the transferring court deems it inappropriate. Upon notice of the motion for transfer, the court of the proposed receiving county may provide comments for the record regarding the proposed transfer. The court and the probation department shall prioritize investigating these transfers to ensure they are completed promptly. The transferring court must determine victim restitution before transfer, unless not feasible within a reasonable time. The receiving county court gains full jurisdiction upon transfer, effective immediately. Upon transfer, the probationer or supervised person is committed to the care of the probation officer in the receiving county. The receiving court gains full jurisdiction over the case and may request transfer again if necessary. Reimbursement of processing costs to the sending county is required. Upon transfer, the defendant must pay any outstanding fines, fees, or restitution to the collection program for the transferring court. The receiving court may impose additional local fees, which will be paid to the transferring court for proper distribution. Upon approval, a receiving court can collect court-ordered payments from a defendant and transmit the revenue to the transferring court. Administrative fees cannot be charged without a written agreement. Revenue collected for the transferring court should not be reported as part of the annual court collections to the Judicial Council. The Judicial Council will establish rules for the transfer of cases between counties, including factors like offender's residence, available programs, and victim issues. Additionally, rules will be adopted for the collection and disbursement of court-ordered payments."
