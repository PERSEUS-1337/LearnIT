    "content": "The \"Family Farm Preservation and Conservation Estate Tax Act\" is cited as the short title. It excludes certain farmland from the gross estate as long as it continues to be used as farmland. The \"Family Farm Preservation and Conservation Estate Tax Act\" excludes qualified farmland from the gross estate if the executor elects to do so. This applies to estates where the decedent was a U.S. citizen or resident and owned the farmland for at least 5 years within an 8-year period before their death with material participation. The section defines material participation in the operation of farmland for estate tax purposes, including rental of real estate for agricultural production. Rules similar to other sections apply. The section defines \"qualified farmland\" as real property used for farming purposes in the US, acquired or passed to a qualified heir, and actively used for farming by the decedent or their family. \"Member of family\" includes lineal descendants of any spouse. The term 'adjusted value' in this section refers to the value of farmland for estate tax purposes, reduced by certain deductions. Any term used in this section that is also used in section 2032A has the same meaning as defined in section 2032A. The recapture tax is imposed if a qualified heir disposes of farmland or ceases to use it for farming purposes after the decedent's death. The tax amount is the excess of what would have been imposed on the estate by section 2001. The recapture tax is imposed on the estate of the decedent if a qualified heir disposes of or ceases to use farmland after the decedent's death. The value of the farmland interest is determined at the date of disposition or cessation, and regulations may be prescribed by the Secretary for implementation. The subsection outlines regulations for record-keeping and information reporting, with restrictions on imposing liens on the estate or qualified farmland. Rules from section 2032A apply, and the election must be made by the due date for filing the tax return. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. The amendments made by this section apply to estates of decedents dying after the date of the enactment of this Act. Additionally, a new section, 2033B, is added to provide a temporary exclusion of qualified conservation easements. In the case of an estate of a decedent, if the executor elects to exclude land with a qualified conservation easement from the gross estate, a tax will still apply. If the qualified heir disposes of the land or uses it in a way that violates the easement terms, a recapture tax will be imposed. If the qualified heir violates the terms of a conservation easement, a recapture tax will be imposed based on the excess of the tax that would have been imposed on the estate of the decedent, reduced by allowable credits. For purposes of this section, the value of any interest in land subject to a qualified conservation easement shall be the fair market value as of the date of disposition. The Secretary may issue regulations for record keeping and reporting, but cannot impose a lien on the estate or land with a conservation easement for this purpose. The terms 'land subject to a qualified conservation easement' and 'qualified conservation easement' are defined by section 2031(c)(8). The election must be made by the due date for filing the tax return under section 2001. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subchapter B of chapter 62 of the Code. The amendments in sections 4 and 5 of the Act modify the definition of qualified conservation easement and rules relating to the valuation of certain farm real property for estates of decedents dying after the enactment date. The amendments in sections 4 and 5 of the Act modify the definition of qualified conservation easement and rules relating to the valuation of certain farm real property for estates of decedents dying after the enactment date. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 include changes to the disposition of interests subject to qualified conservation easements and exceptions for woodlands subject to a management plan. The amendments in sections 4 and 5 of the Act modify the definition of qualified conservation easement and rules relating to the valuation of certain farm real property for estates of decedents dying after the enactment date. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 include changes to the disposition of interests subject to qualified conservation easements and exceptions for woodlands subject to a management plan. A qualified forest management plan must be equivalent to a forest stewardship plan or a third-party audited forest certification system. The sale of a conservation easement limiting the use of qualified real property is not considered a disposition. The definition of farm in the Internal Revenue Code is amended to exclude orchards and woodlands. The definition of farming purpose in the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include creating, restoring, enhancing, or maintaining habitat for nature-oriented recreational opportunities. This includes hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, and related fish and wildlife dependent recreation. The amendments made by this section apply to estates of decedents dying after the enactment of this Act."
