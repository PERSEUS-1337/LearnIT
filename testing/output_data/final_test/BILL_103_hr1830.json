The Congress finds that the lack of environmental pollution controls in foreign countries gives them an unfair competitive advantage, posing a direct threat to US citizens. The US is the largest export market for international polluters, leading to the proposal of a Global Cleanup Fund using foreign assistance funds to finance pollution control measures in these countries. The proposal aims to use foreign assistance funds to finance pollution control equipment and services from the United States, with benefits including no extra costs to US taxpayers, increased employment, and promoting international environmental efforts as a US foreign policy priority. SEC. 3. ANNUAL COUNTRY REPORTS ON POLLUTION PREVENTION PRACTICES. The Secretary of State must annually report on environmental protection requirements of foreign countries, including air and water quality, and hazardous waste disposal. Reports must describe conditions and government laws, policies, and practices, with a determination on enforcement effectiveness. The Secretary of State must annually report on environmental protection requirements of foreign countries, including air and water quality, and hazardous waste disposal. The report is submitted to Congress, the United States Trade Representative, and agencies involved in foreign assistance programs for consideration in trade negotiations and determining foreign aid recipients. The Global Cleanup Fund is established. The section applies to countries receiving US foreign assistance funds unless they comply with pollution control standards. 20% of foreign assistance funds must be used for loans to these countries for acquiring US environmental goods and services. The President can make loans to countries to purchase US pollution control products and services, with funds also allocated for administrative expenses. An annual report to Congress must detail the loans made, the products and services purchased, and the amount allocated to each country. The annual report to Congress must detail loans made for purchasing US pollution control products and services in countries, including the status of pollution control efforts in each country. SEC. 5. International financial institution loans to countries not enforcing environmental standards to protect local environments from damaging industrial practices. The Secretary of the Treasury directs the US Executive Director of international financial institutions to oppose lending unless the borrowing country ensures compliance with pollution control standards or the project won't harm air or water quality. The project is designed to protect the local environment from damaging industrial practices. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The term \"foreign assistance\" refers to assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or section 23 of the Arms Export Control Act. The term \"international financial institution\" includes the IMF, World Bank, and regional multilateral development banks."
