    "content": "The \"Saving Fishing Jobs Act of 2011\" may approve certain limited access privilege programs. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to change eligibility requirements for signing petitions and initiating fishery management plans in specific regions. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to require a petition for a limited access privilege program to harvest fish to be submitted, an estimate of fees to be provided to fishermen, and a waiting period of at least 90 days before the program can take effect. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to require a petition for a limited access privilege program for a fishery. The proposed plan or amendment must be approved by a two-thirds vote of eligible fishermen in the fishery, or a petition can be submitted by a group of fishermen constituting more than 50% of eligible fishermen in the fishery. The Secretary will review and certify a petition for a limited access privilege program if signed by over 50% of eligible fishermen holding permits in the fishery. Eligible fishermen are defined as permit holders under a fishery management plan. The limited access privilege program can be terminated according to Section 3. Section 303A of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act can terminate a limited access privilege program if the number of eligible fishermen decreases by 15% compared to the previous year. Eligible fishermen are defined in the subsection. The term 'eligible fishermen' is defined in subsection (c)(6)(D)(iv) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to allow for fees collected for limited access privilege programs to recover all program costs, including observer costs, without a 3-percent limitation."
