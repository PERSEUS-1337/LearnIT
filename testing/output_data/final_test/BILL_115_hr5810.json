The amendment allows for the extension of Federal medical assistance to payments for health home services for SUD-eligible individuals under a State plan amendment. Additionally, states can have both SUD-focused and non-SUD-focused State plan amendments approved. The extension of Federal medical assistance for health home services for SUD-eligible individuals requires states to submit a report on the quality of care, access to healthcare, and total expenditures for these individuals. The Secretary will specify measures for quality, access, and expenditures. Best practices for SUD-focused State plan amendments will be available by October 1, 2020. Definitions include SUD-eligible individuals. \"SUD-eligible individual' refers to an individual in a State with chronic conditions, substance use disorder, and who has not received health home services under any other State plan amendment. The term 'SUD-focused State plan amendment' is also defined.\" A 'SUD-focused State plan amendment' is a State plan designed to provide health home services primarily to individuals eligible for substance use disorder treatment. State Medicaid plans must cover medication-assisted treatment as per Section 3 of the legislation. State Medicaid plans are required to cover medication-assisted treatment under the Social Security Act, with specific amendments made to include this form of treatment as medical assistance until September 30, 2025. Medication-assisted Treatment Defined under the Social Security Act includes drugs approved to treat opioid use disorders and counseling services. The exception to paragraph (29) of subsection (a) under the Social Security Act allows a State to certify a shortage of providers for medication-assisted treatment to be exempt from certain provisions. The effective date of these amendments applies to medical services. The amendments made by this section apply to medical assistance from October 1, 2020, to October 1, 2025. State plans under title XIX of the Social Security Act may require legislation to comply with the new requirements. The Act allows for a 2-year legislative session to be considered as separate regular sessions of the State legislature.
