    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Solar Utilization Now Demonstration Act of 2007\" or the \"SUN Act of 2007\". It includes a Photovoltaic Demonstration Program. The Secretary will establish a grant program for States to demonstrate advanced photovoltaic technology. States must meet requirements and demonstrate compliance to receive funding. Funding allocation will be based on qualifying criteria. Funding for the program will be allocated to States based on their population proportion according to the 2000 census. If more than $25,000,000 is available, 75 percent of the funds will be distributed according to population proportion, and the remaining 25 percent will be awarded competitively to States with qualifying proposals. The Secretary will solicit proposals from States to participate in a program promoting photovoltaic technologies. Funds will be awarded based on criteria such as encouraging technology demonstration and maximizing non-Federal cost share. State programs funded under this section must provide competitive awards for advanced photo-voltaic technologies, with a requirement of at least 60% non-Federal funding per award. They should aim to fund recipients in various sectors and limit administrative costs to 10%. Reporting on fund disbursement is also mandatory.

They should aim to fund recipients in various sectors and limit administrative costs to 10%. Reporting on fund disbursement is also mandatory. The funds disbursed, photovoltaics purchased, and monitoring results must be reported. Measurement and verification of photovoltaic systems' output over 20 years is required, along with an independent energy efficiency audit for applicant buildings. Unexpended funds must be returned to the Treasury if not used within 3 years. The Secretary shall report to Congress 5 years after funds are first distributed to the States under this section. The funds distributed to States under this section include the amount of photovoltaics demonstrated, number of projects undertaken, administrative costs, unreceived funds due to lack of qualifying proposals, monitoring results, and total funds distributed by State. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2008-2012 is $15,000,000, $30,000,000, $45,000,000, $60,000,000, and $70,000,000 respectively."
