    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Great Ape Conservation Act of 1999\". Great ape populations are declining, endangering their long-term survival in the wild. Chimpanzees, gorillas, bonobos, and orangutans are listed as endangered species. Conservation efforts are insufficient to address habitat loss and population decline due to human activities. Great apes serve as flagship species for conservation. Conservation of great apes is crucial for protecting tropical forest habitats and benefiting other wildlife species. Threats to great apes include habitat loss, population fragmentation, hunting, and live capture. They play a vital role in their ecosystems, and efforts to ensure their long-term viability require joint commitment from countries. The Great Ape Conservation Act aims to support conservation programs in countries where great apes are found and to maintain viable wild populations. This is essential for protecting tropical forest habitats and other wildlife species. The Great Ape Conservation Act aims to support conservation programs in countries where great apes are found and to maintain viable wild populations. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

The Secretary may approve conservation projects for great apes that focus on population numbers, habitat threats, and cooperative efforts among governments, communities, and organizations. Preference is given to projects that ensure long-term conservation and have matching funds available. Project recipients must submit periodic reports to the Secretary and Administrator for evaluation purposes. These reports, along with other project-related documents, must be made available to the public.
