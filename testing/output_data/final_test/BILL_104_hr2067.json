The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 is amended to specify conditions for boundary revisions, limiting acreage adjustments to 5 percent of total Federal acreage and $500,000 total appraised value. The proposed revision should not be a major Federal action affecting the environment or part of a larger boundary modification proposal. The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 is amended to set conditions for boundary revisions, limiting adjustments to 5 percent of total Federal acreage and $500,000 total appraised value. The Director of the National Park Service needs written support from all property owners affected by the boundary modification, except for minor revisions involving only deletions of acreage which require an Act of Congress. Authorization is granted for certain park facilities to be located outside of units of the National Park System. Section 4 of the Act allows the Secretary of the Interior to establish essential facilities outside national park boundaries for administration, visitor use, and employee housing to ensure conservation and proper management. The Secretary of the Interior can establish facilities outside national park boundaries to avoid degradation of natural resources, enhance public service, or save costs. The Secretary may use federal lands through agreements or acquire real property through purchase or donation. The Secretary of the Interior can acquire real property (other than Federal land) through purchase or donation for specified purposes. Guidelines are established to ensure acquisitions do not compromise the Department's integrity or the ability of employees to carry out their duties. The Secretary is authorized to construct and maintain buildings and facilities as needed. The Secretary of the Interior can construct buildings and facilities on land near national parks, with the requirement of a binding agreement for non-federal land."
