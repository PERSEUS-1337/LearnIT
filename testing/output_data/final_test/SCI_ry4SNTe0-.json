    "content": "Improved GAN is a successful method for semi-supervised learning but suffers from unstable training due to vanishing gradients on the generator. A new method using collaborative training with Wasserstein GAN improves stability. Experiments show it outperforms the original Improved GAN in stability and achieves comparable classification accuracy on various datasets. The original GAN method involves a generator G creating fake data G(z) from a random variable z with distribution density p(z), and a discriminator D distinguishing real data x from generated data G(z). Various GAN variants have been developed to enhance performance and extend applications, such as LS-GAN and cat-GAN. The GAN concept has evolved from unsupervised to semi-supervised learning approaches. In BID14, Salimans et al. introduced the Improved GAN for simultaneous generation and classification of data. Efforts have been made to address training stability issues in GANs, such as using Wasserstein distance to train GAN by ensuring network functions are 1-Lipschitz. Various methods have been proposed to address training stability issues in GANs, including clipping weights, gradient penalty, gradient norm-based regularization, mode collapse solutions, and variance regularization. These approaches aim to stabilize GAN training and improve convergence rates, but challenges such as computational complexity and mode collapse persist. In this work, the authors investigate the training stability issue for semi-supervised GANs, specifically addressing the vanishing gradients problem on the generator. They propose a collaborative training method to improve stability, showing through theory and experiments that it effectively prevents vanishing gradients and enhances training stability. The proposed method aims to improve the training stability of the Improved GAN by using collaborative training. It can also be applied to the Triple GAN to enhance its stability. The paper presents the generator vanishing gradient theorem in Section 2. In Section 2, the Improved GAN introduces the generator vanishing gradient theorem. Section 3 introduces the collaborative training Wasserstein GAN (CTW-GAN) with a nonvanishing gradient theorem. Experimental results are presented in Section 4, and conclusions are drawn in Section 5. The Improved GAN BID14 combines supervised and unsupervised learning for semi-supervised classification through adversarial training. Theorem 2.1 proves vanishing gradients on the generator for Improved GAN, leading to training instability. When the discriminator converges, the generator gradients vanish, causing training saturation. A new method is proposed in this section to address this issue through collaborative training. The proposed method aims to solve the instability issue of the Improved GAN by using collaborative training between two GANs. This approach involves optimizing two discriminators simultaneously in a minimax game, followed by optimizing the generator using the optimized discriminators. The overall architecture for CTW-GAN is illustrated in Figure 1, addressing concerns about vanishing gradients and training instability. The proposed CTW-GAN method addresses the instability issue of the Improved GAN by utilizing collaborative training between two GANs. It ensures training stability by proving that vanishing gradients do not occur on the generator. The algorithm includes a gradient penalty and specific constraints to improve training stability.

Experiments are conducted on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets to evaluate the method's stability and classification performance. The study involves using a small set of labeled data from MNIST dataset for semi-supervised learning with different selection sizes. Three networks are used with batch normalization and Gaussian noise added to the output. Only one parameter is tuned while others are kept constant. The study focuses on semi-supervised learning using a small set of labeled data from the MNIST dataset. Only one parameter is tuned while others are kept constant. Results show that the proposed method improves training stability without reducing classification accuracy compared to the original Improved GAN. In this section, the study evaluates different methods for data representation, including Virtual Adversarial, Cat-GAN, and Ladder network. The proposed method is tested on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing promising results. The study suggests that utilizing various information sources can enhance classification accuracy, with potential for further improvement by using deeper networks. In this section, the study tests the proposed method on the CIFAR-10 dataset, consisting of colored images in 10 classes. A 9-layer deep convolutional network is used for the discriminator Dc, while the generator G is a 4-layer deep CNN. Results on semi-supervised learning task are summarized in TAB2, showing no failure cases for the Improved GAN in three runs on CIFAR-10 dataset. The study tested the proposed method on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of colored images in 10 classes. The discriminator Dc trained on CIFAR-10 does not easily converge compared to MNIST due to the richness of image features in color. However, with proper training, the gradients on the generator can vanish, ensuring training stability. The proposed method achieves comparable results to the original Improved GAN and provides a theoretical guarantee for training stability. The network for Dw is simple due to limited GPU resources, which may not capture rich characteristics. The study addresses training instability in the Improved GAN by proposing a collaborative training method with Wasserstein GAN. Results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate improved training stability and classification accuracy. More GPU resources could further enhance performance.
