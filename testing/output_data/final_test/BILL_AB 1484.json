    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the unique challenges faced by military families, including frequent moves and parental deployment during times of war. California is home to 150,000 active duty personnel, with children experiencing constant transitions due to family mobility. Officers and enlisted personnel move more often than civilian families, with lower-ranking members moving most frequently. During parental deployment, children experience anxiety and stress. Child care providers and preschools offer stability and routine, cushioning the impact of deployment. Early education plays a crucial role in the academic success of military children by providing enrichment and a nurturing environment. The Legislature aims to ensure military families have access to necessary child care services. Section 8209.5 of the Education Code exempts military personnel's basic housing allowance from income calculations for service eligibility. This does not impact the priorities for subsidized child development services. Section 35035.5 is also added to the Education Code. Section 35035.5 of the Education Code prohibits the transfer or assignment of a certificated employee with the primary responsibility of being the classroom teacher of record if it would reduce the average effective teacher experience factor at the schoolsite below 90% of the district average. The maximum teaching experience factor that can be counted for a single employee is 60 months. The governing board of a school district can count a certificated instructional employee with the highest rating for up to 60 months, regardless of their length of service. Unsatisfactory evaluation ratings and noninstructional duties months are excluded. The state board can waive this section upon request if specific conditions are met. To transfer or assign a certificated employee, they must have the appropriate credential, consult with the employee representative, and get approval from the school principal. This is to ensure the placement addresses critical shortages and helps achieve the school's goals for all students. In the Education Code, a pupil cannot be placed in a classroom with a teacher who received an unsatisfactory performance rating unless they are in a Peer Assistance and Review Program or specific conditions are met. The teacher of record must receive assistance from a certified employee with relevant experience and a good performance record. The local governing board of a school district can waive any provision of this section with parent approval in writing. Reimbursement for costs mandated by the state will be made to local agencies and school districts if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
