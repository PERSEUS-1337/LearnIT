    "content": "In 2013, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta warned of potential military readiness crisis due to budget uncertainty. Four years later, there is debate on the current readiness of the U.S. military and what steps should be taken to improve it. The term readiness is interpreted differently by observers, with DOD justifying increased funding for addressing immediate challenges. The FY2017 budget focuses on future capability improvements, while the FY2018 budget prioritizes training and maintenance to address current shortfalls, all aimed at enhancing readiness. The report explores the different uses of the term \"readiness\" in the military, discussing its narrow sense related to training and maintenance, and its broader sense encompassing overall capability and future planning. It provides historical examples and highlights the challenges in defining the term, aiming to help Congress understand the complexities involved. The report discusses the various uses of the term \"readiness\" in the military, including its broad sense of overall capability and its narrow sense related to training and maintenance. It highlights the challenges in defining readiness and how it impacts the evaluation of military issues by Congress. The readiness of military forces is crucial for conducting a full range of operations to defeat enemies. It is achieved through manning, training, and equipping units. General Gordon Sullivan emphasized the importance of readiness in maintaining a strong defense force. Readiness is also seen as a component of overall military capability, along with force structure and modernization. The readiness of military forces is crucial for conducting operations and is achieved through manning, training, and equipping units. General Stephen Wilson and General Norton Schwartz emphasized the importance of readiness in balancing force structure, modernization, and operational effectiveness. Adjectives are often used to clarify the different aspects of readiness. The readiness of military forces is crucial for conducting operations and is achieved through manning, training, and equipping units. Adjectives are often used to clarify the different aspects of readiness, with various terms like \"structural readiness,\" \"operational readiness,\" \"institutional readiness,\" and \"unit readiness\" being used to distinguish different levels of readiness. Marine Corps institutional readiness is built upon five pillars: Unit Readiness, Capability and Capacity to Meet Joint Force Requirements, High Quality People, Installation Capability, and Equipment Modernization. Additionally, there is a distinction made between \"strategic readiness\" and the ability of the military to accomplish tasks demanded by the national command authority. The definition of readiness in military forces encompasses the ability to perform combat tasks and meet assigned missions. It acknowledges the broader concept of achieving overall goals and the narrower concept of maintaining capabilities. The interdependence of these concepts is highlighted in the Department of Defense's official definition of readiness. The definition of readiness in military forces includes the ability to perform combat tasks and meet assigned missions. The Department of Defense doctrinally defines \"operational readiness\" as the capability of a unit/formation, ship, weapon system, or equipment to perform its organized or designed functions. Users often use the term readiness broadly or narrowly, leading to inconsistent definitions. The concept of military readiness is complex and can be broadly or narrowly defined. It involves factors such as personnel training, equipment sophistication, and budget allocation. There is no authoritative list of what constitutes readiness, but it is crucial for a military's ability to perform combat tasks effectively. The concept of military readiness is complex and can be broadly or narrowly defined. Budget allocation, specifically Operating and Maintenance (O&M) funding for operational units, can be a proxy for narrow readiness funding. However, the full O&M appropriations title includes funding for activities not directly related to readiness. Focusing on Budget Activity 1, Operating Forces, may provide a better measure of readiness in the narrow sense. While these funding categories can give a rough idea of readiness, they are not exclusive to either sense, making absolute judgments difficult. The Trump Administration directed the Department of Defense to conduct a 30-day readiness review and develop a budget amendment for military readiness. Secretary of Defense Mattis outlined a three-phase approach to strengthening the U.S. Armed Forces, focusing on immediate challenges in FY2017, balancing programs in FY2018, and preparing for FY2019. The Department of Defense is preparing the FY2019 budget request and defense program, informed by the 2018 National Defense Strategy. The focus is on enhancing lethality against high-end competitors and effectiveness against various threats. The FY2017 budget amendment blurs the phases outlined by Secretary of Defense Mattis, emphasizing the importance of increasing readiness and addressing future warfighting readiness. The FY2017 budget amendment aims to address future warfighting readiness by filling programmatic holes created by previous budget cuts. Investments in new planes and ground vehicles are crucial for maintaining a higher state of warfighting readiness in the future, despite not achieving full readiness in FY2017. The requested funding focuses more on broader readiness for the future rather than immediate concerns. Table 1 displays the proposed percentage change in the budget amendment for O&M and procurement for each military department. The FY2017 budget amendment aims to address future warfighting readiness by filling programmatic holes created by previous budget cuts. The military departments requested larger increases in procurement than O&M, indicating a focus on future readiness. The budget prioritizes investments in procurement and O&M related to operating forces, preparing the military for future tasks. Congress mostly supported the Trump Administration's approach in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 supported the Trump Administration's approach with lower funding levels. The agreement emphasized improving military readiness through increased training, depot maintenance, and base operations support. Funding in Title X followed a pattern of greater increases for operating forces O&M and procurement, except for Navy procurement which received a smaller increase due to already higher funding levels. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 provided $12.5 billion in additional appropriations compared to DOD's request for $24.7 billion, with a focus on improving military readiness through increased training and equipment procurement. The funding prioritized immediate readiness concerns over broader readiness needs, emphasizing the importance of maintaining high levels of readiness in the narrow sense. During the time between World War I and World War II, there was a debate on military readiness. Observers argued that maintaining high levels of readiness in the narrow sense could compromise broader readiness goals. General John Pershing advocated for lower readiness levels to achieve readiness in a broader sense. During the early Cold War, President Eisenhower prioritized economic power alongside military strength to counter the Soviet threat. He accepted less ready forces to maintain U.S. economic competitiveness, recognizing the need to address both external and internal threats posed by Soviet power and excessive federal spending. In the post-Cold War era, some argued for prioritizing developing leap-ahead technologies over maintaining current military readiness, believing it would better prepare the U.S. military for future challenges. This \"Transformation Approach\" suggested accepting short-term risk by limiting global engagement and canceling procurement of current weapons systems. In the post-Cold War era, there was a push to prioritize developing advanced technologies over maintaining current military readiness by canceling procurement of weapons systems and cutting force structure to accelerate the adoption of advanced systems and concepts. Sacrificing readiness in the narrow sense was considered acceptable by some officials in order to focus on future challenges and readiness in a broader sense. The Institute emphasizes the importance of operational capability over operational readiness. Former DOD Comptroller Robert Hale urges skepticism towards broader readiness concerns while acknowledging narrow readiness issues. Carter Ham of the Association of the U.S. Army agrees that America's fighting forces are ready for current battles against ISIL and other terrorist organizations. Justin Johnson of the Heritage Foundation believes that the U.S. military is in a crisis due to lack of training, worn-out equipment, and insufficient support. He advocates for increasing the military size and procuring new equipment. Todd Harrison of the Center for Strategic and... Todd Harrison of the Center for Strategic and International Studies argues that the U.S. military is facing a force structure crisis rather than a readiness crisis due to insufficient funding. Increasing the military size would exacerbate existing problems according to Harrison. Former CIA Director David Petraeus and Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution dismiss concerns of a readiness crisis altogether. O'Hanlon from the Brookings Institution downplays concerns of a readiness crisis but supports expanding the military and acquiring specific equipment. General Milley highlights the complexity of readiness in terms of emerging threats and great power conflicts, emphasizing the military's ability to handle counterinsurgency and counterterrorism. General Milley assesses the U.S. Army's readiness for counterinsurgency and counterterrorism but expresses concern about its preparedness for great power conflict. The assessment of readiness depends on the type of missions the military should be prepared for. For more information on potential missions, refer to CRS Report R44023 and CRS Report R43838. The recurring issue for Congress is how to measure readiness in the military, especially with the new classification of information. Congress has required quarterly reports on readiness since 1996, leading to the establishment of the Defense Readiness Reporting System in 2002. The Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) assesses personnel, equipment, supplies, and training levels compared to targets, resulting in a C-rating for overall unit assessment. Commanders can adjust the rating based on their judgment. The Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) uses SORTS data but with finer metrics, requesting subjective mission assessments for core, assigned, and real-world operations. The Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) combines quantitative metrics with subjective mission assessments to provide a comprehensive overview of unit readiness. Commanders can adjust the C-rating to align with their broader assessment, allowing for subjective influence in the reporting process. This entwining of readiness measures limits accuracy but provides a holistic view of readiness at the unit level, which is then rolled up through the military hierarchy for larger units. The Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) allows commanders to adjust ratings based on their broader assessment, potentially distorting readiness reporting. The system may label units as \"not ready\" even when operationally deployed, raising questions about what the military should be prepared for. The DOD's readiness reporting system has not resolved debates on readiness crisis, as highlighted by the Government Accountability Office in 2013. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) notes that without DOD guidance on the content of quarterly reports, Congress may not receive complete and useful information. Congress has made multiple changes to the readiness reporting system and quarterly reports, including amendments to required content and frequency. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlights flaws in the readiness reporting system, with Congress making multiple changes to the content and frequency of quarterly reports. Provisions have expanded the topics covered in the reports, but ongoing issues prevent Congress from effectively evaluating the U.S. military's readiness. The readiness reporting system for the U.S. military has various mechanisms like the Defense Readiness Reporting System and the Joint Forces Readiness Review. However, there are challenges in developing metrics to measure progress towards readiness recovery goals, hindering Congress from establishing common standards for readiness discussions. The FY2018 budget request from DOD focuses on addressing readiness challenges in phases, favoring narrow over broad readiness funding with double-digit increases for O&M accounts for the Army and Navy. The FY2018 budget request from DOD focuses on narrow readiness funding, with smaller percentage increases for procurement accounts. Some critics argue that the budget fails to fulfill the promise to rebuild the armed services, as it does not include growth in force structure, shipbuilding plan, or modernization program. Senator John McCain called the defense budget request \"inadequate to the challenges we face.\" The FY2018 budget request from DOD focuses on narrow readiness funding, with smaller percentage increases for procurement accounts. The Trump Administration justifies increased defense spending by emphasizing readiness. However, the term readiness is used in various ways, leading to a debate on the military's actual readiness levels. Clarifying the use of readiness in specific cases can help Congress determine the necessary steps and spending levels to maintain or improve readiness. The Military Departments aim to enhance deployment missions across various military operations. This includes assessing dental, family, financial, physical, equipment, logistics, and contingency contracting readiness. Contracting readiness evaluates if officers approved to sign contracts are prepared to deploy in support of military operations. This differs from mission-specific readiness, as servicemembers' fitness, families' financial choices, and equipment readiness are crucial regardless of specific tasks. Overall readiness in these areas is essential for the military to succeed in both narrow and broader senses. Healthier servicemembers cannot compensate for missing equipment, highlighting the importance of readiness across various aspects. Medical readiness, also known as individual medical readiness, assesses the health status of servicemembers regardless of their deployment tasks. It also evaluates the capability of the military medical force to support the tasks assigned to them. Medical readiness is crucial for military forces, ensuring competence, currency, and satisfaction in patient-centered healthcare services. The readiness of medical forces at home directly impacts the care provided during deployment. In situations where access to medical infrastructure is limited, medical readiness becomes a critical factor in overall military readiness. The military medical establishment's readiness is crucial for overall military readiness, with a dual mission to provide care for beneficiaries and servicemembers during wartime. This interdependence can impact the ability to provide medical care in war versus beneficiary care."
