    "content": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) is a regional free-trade agreement signed by 12 member countries, including the United States, in 2016. The agreement aims to eliminate tariffs on textile and apparel products made in the TPP region. Textile trade provisions were a major point of contention during negotiations. The TPP could benefit U.S. textile manufacturing by providing duty-free access to the U.S. market. The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) aims to eliminate tariffs on textile and apparel products in the TPP region, benefiting Asian manufacturers facing U.S. import duties of up to 32%. This could impact the competitive position of Western Hemisphere apparel suppliers in the U.S. market and U.S. textile exports to those countries. Textile manufacturing, with $18 billion in value added in 2015, produces yarns and fabrics from raw materials like cotton and man-made fibers, supplying three industrial sectors. Apparel manufacturing, consuming 11% of U.S.-manufactured fibers in 2014, is more labor-intensive and globally dispersed. The apparel industry is characterized by decentralized production networks coordinated by lead firms. Most apparel retailing firms in the US import clothing rather than producing domestically. Over 60% of clothing purchased by US consumers is produced outside the country. US apparel value added was $11 billion in 2015, with limited domestic manufacturing capabilities. Large retailers often contract with third-party suppliers, mainly in Asia. The United States accounted for 1.3% of global apparel exports in 2014, with China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Mexico being the top suppliers. Domestic functions like design and marketing are also crucial. The home furnishings industry has fared better due to automation, with carpet-tufting machines leading to a decline in employment at U.S. carpet mills. The decline in employment at U.S. carpet and rug mills from 49,200 workers in 2005 to 31,300 in 2015 is tied to conditions in domestic housing and commercial building construction, raw material prices, and competition from foreign producers. The output of technical textile mills is used across various industrial sectors, with the U.S. market value of technical textiles estimated at $32.5 billion in 2015. Textile manufacturing begins with fiber harvested from natural resources, manufactured from cellulosic materials, or made of man-made synthetic materials. The textile industry involves processing raw fibers into yarn, fabric, finishing, and fabrication of various products. In 2015, global textile production reached 94.9 million metric tons, with man-made fibers accounting for over two-thirds of the total. China led the growth in man-made textile manufacturing, producing about two-thirds of the global output. Textile manufacturing is dominated by China, accounting for two-thirds of global production in 2015. The United States produced about 4% of man-made fibers. Other key producers include India, Taiwan, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey, and Japan. India is the largest producer of cotton, followed by China and the United States. Pakistan, Brazil, Uzbekistan, and Turkey are also significant cotton producers. China, India, Pakistan, and Turkey are the top consumers of cotton, with Mexico and Central American countries being major customers of U.S. cotton. Central American and Caribbean countries are the main buyers of U.S. cotton, with U.S. textile mills experiencing a significant decline in cotton consumption since 1997. Competition from imported textile products has led to a 70% drop in domestic textile production. The U.S. textile industry has not fully recovered from the downturn in 2008 and 2009, with production levels still below pre-recession levels. Textile shipments totaled around $55 billion in 2015, accounting for 1.2% of total U.S. manufacturing shipments. The U.S. textile industry has seen a decline in establishments, but manufacturers have invested in technology to increase efficiency. Modern textile mills are highly automated, with significant investments in plants and equipment. Textile production requires higher worker skills compared to apparel manufacturing, making it less likely to relocate to lower-wage countries. The textile industry in the United States, Japan, and South Korea has remained stable due to skilled labor and capital investment in weaving and spinning mills. Despite automation and closures of less efficient mills, productivity has increased. While imports have impacted employment, automation has led to the loss of over 200,000 jobs in the past decade. However, industry employment has stabilized since 2009, with a modest rebound in recent years, employing about 232,000 workers by the end of 2015. The domestic textile industry in the United States employed about 232,000 workers by the end of 2015, accounting for 2% of factory jobs. Average annual pay was $41,500 in 2015, below the manufacturing average. Employment has declined by two-thirds since 1990, with a slight increase in 2015. Factors hindering industry growth include automation, consolidation, and import competition. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a decrease to 174,000 employees by 2024. In 2015, the domestic textile industry in the United States employed about 232,000 workers, with Georgia and North Carolina having the highest concentration of textile jobs. Apparel manufacturing has seen a decline in employment over the past two decades, with 820,000 fewer jobs in 2015 compared to 1990. Over 90% of apparel sold in the US is imported, but some companies still maintain US manufacturing for high-value or quick delivery products. Developed countries have sought to protect their textile and apparel sectors for over 40 years. The Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA) and the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) were used by states and the European Union to limit textile and apparel imports from developing countries. The quota system required sourcing from countries with available quotas, leading to manufacturing spreading to more countries. The expiration of the ATC in 2005 eliminated quotas but not import tariffs, which vary among countries. In 2014, the average U.S. tariff rate for textiles was 7.9% and for clothing was 12.0%. China was the largest exporter of textiles with a 35% global market share. Apparel trade is more diversified than textile trade, with China, the EU-28, and others being top importers. In 2015, the top clothing exporters were China, the EU-28, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, and Vietnam. The United States had a strong export position in yarns and fabrics, with a trade surplus in these products. However, there was a textile trade deficit of $20.5 billion in 2015. Import penetration in the U.S. reached approximately 40% in 2015. The majority of yarns and fabrics exported from the United States were sold to NAFTA, CAFTA-DR, and CBI countries. In 2015, U.S. exports of textiles to NAFTA, CAFTA-DR, and CBI countries were more expensive but used in products exported back to the U.S. without tariffs. Mexico was the largest market for U.S. textiles, with $4.7 billion in exports. Additionally, $700 million of U.S.-made textiles were exported to TPP member countries. The U.S. trade deficit in apparel was $82 billion in 2015, with China being the source of nearly 40% of imported apparel. Vietnam and Mexico were also significant sources of apparel imports. Vietnam and Mexico were significant sources of apparel imports for the U.S. in 2015, with Vietnam providing 12% and Mexico 4% of imports. Central America, the Caribbean, Mexico, and Canada collectively accounted for 15% of U.S. apparel imports in 2015, down from one-third in 2000. These regions have limited textile production but ample capacity for cut, make, and trim (CMT) apparel assembly. Canada's textile sector is higher-value-added compared to CMT operations in Latin America. Canada's higher-value-added textile sector differs from CMT operations in Latin America. U.S. textile exports to Canada totaled $1.7 billion in 2015. Several U.S. textile manufacturers have established manufacturing capabilities in Central America, along with companies from South Korea, Taiwan, and China. Mexico is a significant producer of fabric and yarn, relying heavily on the U.S. market for exports. Mexico's cut and assembly operations use U.S.-made fabrics to produce garments like denim jeans and T-shirts for export to the United States. However, competition from countries with lower wages is impacting the competitiveness of Mexican apparel in the U.S. market. U.S. clothing imports from Mexico decreased from $6.3 billion in 2005 to $3.7 billion in 2015. Honduras, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Guatemala are key markets for U.S. textile exporters in the CAFTA-DR region, with Honduras being the largest at $1.4 billion in 2015. Cotton and man-made fibers are top export categories from the U.S. to Honduras for making basic apparel. Apparel manufacturers in the Caribbean region, including the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Guatemala, rely on U.S.-made fabrics and yarns for production. The Caribbean Basin Trade Preference Act (CBTPA) program provides preferential access to the U.S. market for these manufacturers. U.S. retailers primarily source garments from Asia, but use Western Hemisphere producers for quick replenishment. Apparel producers in the Western Hemisphere, such as Bangladesh, focus on sourcing basic knitwear garments like shirts, pants, underwear, and nightwear for the U.S. market. They benefit from geographic proximity, lower transportation costs, and duty-free access for apparel made from U.S. textiles. U.S. imports of industrial fabrics from the CAFTA-DR region were minimal at $2.5 million in 2015. If the proposed TPP agreement is implemented, it could impact apparel producers in the Western Hemisphere by potentially displacing U.S. textile exports with duty-free access for apparel produced in Asian TPP countries. This could lead to a contraction of industrial employment in the CAFTA-DR region and hurt U.S. textile exports if Vietnam develops a larger textile industry. The proposed TPP agreement could hurt apparel producers in the Western Hemisphere by allowing duty-free access for apparel made in Asian TPP countries like Vietnam, which has become a major exporter of apparel to the United States. Vietnam sells more shirts, suits, and overcoats in the U.S. market compared to basic apparel products like T-shirts and trousers. Vietnam's apparel sector imports yarns and fabrics from non-TPP nations, including China. The Ministry of Trade and Industry aims to increase fabric production to 2 million metric tons and fiber production to 650,000 metric tons by 2020. Textile manufacturing investment is rising, with manufacturers from China, Japan, and South Korea establishing mills in Vietnam. The textile industry in Vietnam includes spinning, weaving, knitting, dyeing, finishing, and nonwoven mills. Vietnamese garment producers obtain about a fifth of fabrics and inputs locally. Vietnamese garment producers mainly rely on imported fabrics and inputs. Vinatex, the largest textile and garment producer in Vietnam, is partially state-owned and has multiple projects in progress. They plan to expand cotton production and invest in chemical plants for synthetic fabrics. Foreign-invested enterprises are increasing investment in Vietnam's garment and textile sector due to the benefits from trade agreements. In 2015, Vietnam issued investment licenses for 30 textile and garment projects, attracting foreign investment of $2 billion. Major Chinese companies like Texhong have opened new textile plants in Vietnam due to lower labor costs and tariffs under the proposed TPP. Manufacturers from Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Austria, and Australia are also expanding production in Vietnam. The proposed TPP agreement could create new business opportunities for U.S. fiber, yarn, and fabric producers in Vietnam. The United States' textile exports to Vietnam are currently limited, with raw cotton being the main export. Vietnam's tariff rate on cotton yarn is 5%, which would be eliminated under the TPP. The U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts a 20% increase in U.S. cotton exports to Vietnam. Bilateral and regional trade agreements, including the TPP, have strict rules for textiles and apparel, particularly regarding rules of origin. Rules of origin for textile and apparel products in free-trade agreements require specific production processes, such as Fiber Forward, Yarn Forward, and Fabric Forward, to qualify for trade benefits. These rules dictate that fibers, yarns, and fabrics must be produced within the trading area to access duty-free benefits. Under the TPP, textile and apparel tariffs would be eliminated or phased out over a decade. The United States will phase out its tariffs on textile and apparel products over 10 to 12 years. Tariffs increase with each stage of manufacturing, with higher rates on apparel than on yarn or fabric inputs. Fabric must be knitted or woven in FTA member countries, while cutting and sewing must occur in FTA member countries for maximum flexibility in sourcing. The United States will phase out tariffs on textile and apparel products from Vietnam over 10 to 12 years under the TPP. The agreement includes a yarn-forward rule for duty-free treatment, endorsed by the NCTO in January 2016. Vietnam and other TPP members initially opposed this rule, preferring a \"cut-and-sew\" approach. The TPP agreement includes a yarn-forward rule for textiles and apparel, with exceptions for limited quantities of materials sourced from outside TPP partner countries. U.S. apparel companies favored immediate tariff elimination and more liberal rules of origin. Trade groups like the American Apparel and Footwear Association and the National Retail Federation supported the TPP despite the yarn-forward rule. The TPP agreement includes a short supply list for products not commercially available in the region, with exceptions for sourcing from non-TPP countries like China. Concerns have been raised about the permanence of the list, limiting the use of new yarns and fabrics. The Earned Import Allowance Program encourages the use of American fabrics in Vietnamese-manufactured apparel, exempting some U.S. imports from Vietnam from the yarn-forward rule. This allows limited apparel made in Vietnam to enter the United States. The proposed TPP allows limited apparel made in Vietnam to enter the United States duty-free, even if it contains fabric from non-TPP countries. A textile and apparel safeguard is included in the agreement to reimpose tariffs in case of import surges causing harm to domestic industry. The United States may suspend tariff phaseouts after five years if Vietnam does not allow independent labor unions and the right to strike. Specific customs procedures to enforce commitments are also outlined in the TPP. Under the proposed TPP, a Committee on Textile and Apparel Matters would be established to address industry concerns. The USITC predicts a negligible impact on the domestic textile industry, with a slight increase in imports and exports of textiles. However, output and employment in the domestic textile industry are forecasted to decrease slightly under the TPP. There is a possibility of apparel made in Vietnam displacing apparel in the U.S. market. The proposed TPP agreement could lead to apparel from Vietnam displacing apparel from the Western Hemisphere in the U.S. market, potentially impacting U.S. textile producers in Mexico and other Latin American countries. There is a possibility of TPP member countries shifting textile sourcing from the U.S. to Japan or Vietnam, leading to increased competition for U.S. industrial textile manufacturers from Japan. According to an industry expert, Vietnam and other Asian TPP members are likely to source textiles, including industrial textiles, from Japan instead of the United States. In 2015, the largest export markets for U.S. industrial fabrics were Mexico and Canada, with Vietnam accounting for less than 1% of shipments. Japan's main export markets for industrial fabrics were China, Vietnam, and the United States. Despite Vietnam's expansion in certain industrial fabrics, it is unlikely to be a significant global competitor in the near future."
