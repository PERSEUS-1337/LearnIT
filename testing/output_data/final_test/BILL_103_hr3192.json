    "content": "SECTION 1. DENIAL OF CERTAIN TAX BENEFITS. Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include special rules for certain campaign committees. Excess campaign contributions will be included in gross income and exemptions for exempt function income will not apply. The special rules under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code apply to campaign committees of candidates for the House of Representatives if contribution limitations are not met. The contribution limitations for candidates in an election cycle are satisfied if the total amount of cash, property, and political contributions does not exceed $600,000. The contribution limitations for candidates in an election cycle are satisfied if the aggregate amount of political contributions from multicandidate political committees accepted by the candidate or campaign committees does not exceed $300,000. Excess campaign contributions refer to contributions that exceed the permitted amount under the contribution limitations. The amendment made by subsection (a) applies to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act. The term 'election cycle' refers to the period between general elections for the House of Representatives. The term 'multicandidate political committee' is defined as per the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. SEC. 2 amends the Communications Act of 1934 regarding charges for campaign ads for House of Representatives candidates. SEC. 3 addresses reduced third-class mailing rates. Section 3626(e) of title 39, United States Code is amended to include definitions related to candidates for the House of Representatives. The rates for campaign committees of House of Representatives candidates are contingent on certifying no excess campaign contributions. Congress believes any extra costs for reduced postage should be covered by revenues from the amendment."
