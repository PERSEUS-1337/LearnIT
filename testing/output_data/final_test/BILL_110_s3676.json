    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Volunteer Firefighter and EMS Support Act of 2008\". It includes findings related to volunteer firefighters and EMS support. Congress finds that volunteer firefighters and emergency medical service personnel are crucial first responders in the United States, saving lives and property daily. The financial savings from their services amount to over $37 billion annually. However, many volunteer stations face challenges due to volunteers' competing responsibilities. Some governments offer financial incentives to support these volunteers. The Federal Government and the Administrator of the United States Fire Administration play a crucial role in supporting volunteer firefighters and emergency medical services personnel by providing funds for incentives to recruit and retain volunteers, especially in communities lacking resources for such incentives. The Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 is amended to include a new section providing assistance for volunteer firefighters and emergency medical services personnel. The Secretary will establish a program to provide funds for volunteer firefighter incentive programs, including approved benefits such as retirement, travel reimbursement, health insurance, life insurance, tuition forgiveness, and tax reduction. The term 'volunteer firefighter' refers to individuals who provide firefighting or emergency medical services without pay. They may receive benefits and incentives, including tax reductions, as part of a volunteer firefighter incentive program approved by the Administrator. The volunteer firefighter incentive program is carried out by State or local governments, non-profit firefighter associations, or emergency medical services organizations to provide approved benefits or incentives. The Secretary will pay these entities an amount equal to their expenditures for the program from non-Federal funds. The volunteer firefighter incentive program is funded by the Federal Government through budget authority in advance of appropriations Acts. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for implementation, and recipients must submit reports on the use of funds for the program. The firefighter incentive program requires recipients to report on the use of funds and programs to recruit or retain volunteer firefighters. The Secretary must also submit annual reports to Congress on activities and the status of recruitment and retention programs nationwide."
