    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 5374 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to require applicants for transportation permits to demonstrate fitness and financial responsibility. This includes compliance with highway safety regulations and adherence to hours of service regulations for all personnel. The company must have a preventive maintenance program, participate in the pull-notice system for checking driving records, provide safety education and training for employees, and ensure vehicles are maintained in compliance with safety regulations. The charter-party carrier must have workers' compensation insurance, provide an address for document inspection, implement a substance and alcohol testing program, and certain requirements do not apply to hired driver services. The commission may require a performance bond for fines and penalties. Charter-party carriers must comply with state and federal regulations. The commission can delegate permit issuance authority to its executive director. A transportation network company must participate in driver record checks, implement substance testing, and register vehicles with the commission. Drivers hired by a transportation network company after January 1, 2016, must undergo mandatory drug and alcohol testing before employment. Those hired before this date must complete the testing by January 1, 2017. Section 1808.1 of the Vehicle Code requires prospective employers of drivers of specified vehicles to obtain a current public record report less than 30 days old before hiring. The report must be reviewed, signed, and maintained at the employer's place of business until the pull-notice system report is received. These reports must be available for inspection by the California Highway Patrol upon request. Employers of drivers of specified vehicles must participate in a pull-notice system to receive reports on their drivers' public records, convictions, accidents, and license status. This system requires obtaining a requester code and enrolling all drivers of specified vehicles under that code. Employers must obtain a periodic report from the department every 12 months to verify driver's license status, traffic violation points, and convictions. The report must be signed, dated, and maintained at the employer's place of business, and presented to the California Highway Patrol upon request. Upon termination of a driver's employment, the employer must notify the department to discontinue enrollment in the pull-notice system. For the pull-notice system and periodic report process, owners, employers, family members, and volunteer drivers of specified vehicles must be enrolled as employees. Employers who hire or retain drivers with disqualifying actions on their driving record are subject to penalties. The California Highway Patrol inspects bus maintenance facilities and terminals annually to ensure compliance with safety regulations. Transit operators must be certified by the CHP to receive funding under the Public Utilities Code. Employers requesting to participate in the pull-notice system must pay a fee determined by the department to cover the costs. Failure to pay the fee will result in automatic cancellation of participation. Regularly organized fire departments with official recognition are exempt from the fee. The Board of Pilot Commissioners for Monterey Bay and the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun, along with its port agent, must participate in the pull-notice system without fees. The department may establish a procedure for employers to receive reports regularly without individual requests. Employers of casual drivers are not required to enter their names in the pull-notice system, but must have a current report of their public record from the department before allowing them to drive specified vehicles. A casual driver is defined as someone employed for less than 30 days in the preceding six months, excluding those operating vehicles requiring a passenger transportation endorsement. This section applies to vehicles requiring specific driver's licenses or certificates for operation, including passenger vehicles operated for compensation by certain carriers authorized by the Public Utilities Commission. The term \"employer\" or \"prospective employer\" includes transportation network companies subject to specific permit requirements. Motor carriers contracting drivers for owned or leased vehicles must adhere to specified obligations and employer responsibilities. Reports for taxicab drivers engaged in transportation services must be presented to the administrative agency upon request. This act does not require reimbursement as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
