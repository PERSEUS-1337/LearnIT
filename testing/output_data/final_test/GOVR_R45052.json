    "content": "The Dodd-Frank Act created the FSOC and OFR in response to the financial crisis. The FSOC's mission includes identifying risks from large financial institutions and promoting market discipline. The OFR supports the FSOC in monitoring the financial system, conducting research, and identifying systemic risks. The FSOC fosters communication among financial regulators, designates systemically important institutions, provides annual reports on emerging risks, and alerts Congress to potential systemic risks. The FSOC and OFR have various responsibilities, including making recommendations to member agencies, promoting financial stability research, and setting data standards for the industry. The FSOC has 15 members, with 10 voting members and 5 nonvoting members. The voting members include the Treasury Secretary and heads of federal financial regulatory agencies. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) consists of 15 members, including representatives from various financial regulatory agencies and an independent insurance expert appointed by the President. Its primary purposes are to identify risks to the financial stability of the United States and require supermajority council votes for certain actions. The Dodd-Frank Act aims to address distress or failure in large financial companies, promote market discipline, and respond to threats to the US financial system. It outlines 14 specific duties, including financial market monitoring, designating systemic firms for regulation by the Federal Reserve, and making nonbinding recommendations. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) has several duties, including making nonbinding recommendations to primary regulators, providing a forum for regulatory discussions, identifying regulatory gaps with systemic significance, and submitting an annual report to Congress. The Treasury Secretary serves as the chair of the FSOC and has powers and responsibilities related to meetings, congressional reports, and rulemakings. Meetings can be called by the Secretary or a majority of members. The Secretary of the FSOC has special powers in designating systemic nonbank firms, requiring a two-thirds vote from the FSOC with the Secretary's affirmative vote. The Secretary also has an effective veto over the designation and rescinding of systemic importance for individual firms. In emergencies, the chair's affirmative vote is required for determining systemic designation of a nonbank. A two-thirds vote, along with the chair's affirmative vote, designates an FMU as systemically important under the Dodd-Frank Act. Heads of financial regulatory agencies are FSOC members and have sole discretion over their agency's vote. These agencies often use board or commission votes for internal matters like issuing rules or changing policies. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) holds regular meetings chaired by the Treasury Secretary to discuss emerging threats to financial stability and systemic risks posed by financial firms or market utilities. Meetings may be open or closed to the public, with public meetings potentially aired via live webcast. Minutes are recorded but may be redacted at the chairperson's discretion. Non-member SEC commissioners have reportedly complained about lack of access to FSOC meetings in the past. Nonmember SEC commissioners and a Member of Congress faced access issues at FSOC meetings in 2014. The Dodd-Frank Act directs the OFR to support the FSOC in data collection and analysis. The OFR, funded independently, consults with the Treasury Secretary but operates autonomously. The OFR director is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The OFR director, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, serves a six-year term. The relationship between OFR and FSOC is complex, with OFR having some independence but also consulting with the council's chair on budget and priorities. FSOC has separate staff and administrative expenses, with a proposed budget of $8.8 million for FY2017. The FSOC designates nonbank financial firms and financial market utilities as systemic, triggering heightened prudential regulation by the Fed. Large bank holding companies are automatically considered SIFIs. The Dodd-Frank Act directs the FSOC to consider 11 factors in designations, including leverage and relationship to other SIFIs. The FSOC designates nonbank financial firms and financial market utilities as systemic, triggering heightened prudential regulation by the Fed. Factors considered include consequences of material distress, nature, size, interconnectedness, and mix of activities. The FSOC determines a \"threat to the financial stability of the United States\" based on potential transmission of financial distress or activities to other firms. Financial distress in nonbank financial companies can lead to broader impairment of financial intermediation and market functioning. This can happen through exposure, asset liquidation, or disruption of critical functions or services, posing a threat to U.S. financial stability. The final rule established a three-stage evaluation process for nonbank financial companies. Stage 1 involves the FSOC reviewing existing public and financial regulatory information. Nonbanks proceed to stage 2 if they have at least $50 billion in total assets and meet certain criteria. These criteria include credit default swaps, derivative liabilities, total debt outstanding, leverage ratio, and short-term debt-to-asset ratio. During stage 2, the FSOC utilizes information provided by the designated firm to assess their financial stability. The FSOC's three-stage evaluation process for nonbank financial companies involves reviewing public and regulatory information in stage 1, followed by a detailed assessment in stage 2 for firms meeting specific criteria. In stage 3, firms are notified immediately and provided with the opportunity to submit additional information for the FSOC's final designation decision. The FSOC meets at the end of stage 3 analysis to vote on a firm's designation as a SIFI or FMU. Designation requires a two-thirds vote, with the FSOC chair needing to be one of the affirmative votes. The FSOC has designated four nonbank SIFIs and eight nonbank FMUs since issuing final rules in 2011 and 2012. The FSOC is required to review designations annually and has rescinded the designation of two SIFIs, GE Capital and American International Group, Inc., after structural changes were made. After addressing FSOC's systemic concerns, GE Capital and American International Group, Inc. had their SIFI designations rescinded. Firms have 30 days to challenge their designation in court using the arbitrary and capricious standard. The FSOC and OFR issue reports on financial stability and systemic risk, with the FSOC required to provide an annual report to Congress with recommendations for statutory changes. The FSOC annual report includes statutorily required elements such as activities of the Council, financial market developments, emerging threats, determinations, recommendations, and suggestions to enhance financial market integrity and stability. The most recent report was issued in December 2017 with various recommendations. The December 2017 FSOC annual report included recommendations for a private sector council to collaborate on cybersecurity threats, transitioning from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing rate, encouraging private capital in housing finance, and monitoring regulatory effectiveness for financial stability. Voting members must affirm efforts to ensure financial stability or provide a statement if they disagree. The FSOC annual report includes recommendations for collaboration on cybersecurity threats, transitioning from LIBOR to SOFR, encouraging private capital in housing finance, and monitoring regulatory effectiveness for financial stability. FSOC members must affirm efforts for financial stability or provide a statement if they disagree. The Dodd-Frank Act specifies the FSOC's direction to the OFR for data and analyses to support its work. The OFR assists the FSOC in compiling its yearly report to Congress and issues occasional topical reports. The FSOC, under the Dodd-Frank Act, collaborates with the CFPB on rulemaking and can evaluate CFPB rules for systemic risk implications. However, to date, no CFPB rules have been subject to a vote, stayed, or set aside by the FSOC. The FSOC aims to coordinate member agencies within a complex regulatory architecture, addressing regulatory gaps and overlaps in authority. The FSOC, established under the Dodd-Frank Act, helps resolve jurisdictional disputes among regulatory agencies regarding financial firms or products. It serves as a facilitator of agency communication and cooperation, providing nonbinding recommendations for resolving disputes. FSOC recommendations are nonbinding and require approval by two-thirds of voting members. Section 120 of the Dodd-Frank Act allows FSOC to recommend additional regulation for financial activities that may pose a risk of instability. If a regulatory agency already has authority, FSOC can work with them to develop new standards. If no agency has authority, FSOC can recommend legislation. Bills have been introduced to change FSOC's structure and mission. Several bills have been introduced to alter the FSOC's structure and mission, including the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017 (H.R. 10) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act of 2017 (H.R. 4061). These bills aim to make changes such as rescinding the FSOC's authority to designate firms as systemically important, eliminating the OFR, and implementing broader regulatory changes. The Financial Stability Oversight Council Insurance Member Continuity Act (P.L. 115-61) modified the FSOC's independent insurance member's term to allow the current member to continue serving in case of a delay in naming a successor. H.R. 10 proposes making all board members or commissioners members of the FSOC, with the agency's vote determined collectively by the board or commission. The FSOC's voting rule would align with its own activities, potentially broadening perspectives but weakening individual influence. The OFR provides staff for monitoring the financial system, but H.R. 10 aims to eliminate it due to perceived duplicative research efforts by other regulatory agencies. Some observers believe OFR research may duplicate efforts, with private sector research seen as more effective in identifying financial risks. OFR conducts broad research on the entire financial system, while other agencies focus on specific areas. Funding for FSOC and OFR comes from assessment fees on designated SIFIs and large bank holding companies, not congressional appropriations. FSOC's funding needs are modest compared to other financial agencies, while OFR requires similar resources for professional researchers. H.R. 10 proposes eliminating the OFR and making FSOC's funding subject to annual appropriations, potentially increasing Congress's oversight. Currently, FSOC and OFR receive funding from assessment fees, granting them independence from political influence. BHCs meeting certain requirements are automatically subject to enhanced prudential regulation. H.R. 10 aims to remove FSOC's authority to designate systemic firms, including those that received TARP funds, from enhanced prudential regulations under Dodd-Frank. This would eliminate additional regulations on designated financial firms. The FSOC's systemic designations may increase the risk of financial instability by signaling firms as \"too big to fail,\" potentially leading to riskier behavior. H.R. 4061 would modify FSOC's criteria for designating systemic firms. The bill aims to change the evaluation process for nonbank financial companies designated by FSOC, allowing for more interaction and input from the companies throughout the process. Companies under evaluation would have multiple opportunities to provide materials, participate in hearings, and present a plan. FSOC would also be required to give written notice at each stage of the evaluation process. The bill proposes changes to the evaluation process for nonbank financial companies designated by FSOC, allowing companies to present a plan to alter their business, structure, or operations. FSOC can approve the plan with a two-thirds vote, and implement a five-year periodic reevaluation process for systemic companies. Companies would have opportunities for interaction and input throughout the process, with written notice provided at each stage. The bill proposes changes to the evaluation process for nonbank financial companies designated by FSOC, allowing them to present a plan for changes. Approval by FSOC with a two-thirds vote, including the chairperson, would lead to rescinding the designation. The additional evaluation criteria aim to prevent redundant regulations, but may signal a preference for alternative regulations. FSOC may lack authority to apply these alternatives, relying on member agencies. The changes would enhance transparency through increased written correspondence and in-person meetings. The bill proposes changes to the evaluation process for nonbank financial companies designated by FSOC, allowing them to present a plan for changes. Approval by FSOC with a two-thirds vote, including the chairperson, would lead to rescinding the designation. The additional steps and requirements established by the bill may increase the risk of regulatory capture and slow the evaluation process, resulting in longer lag times between identifying sources of financial instability and implementing prudential regulation. FSOC meetings are generally open to the public, but can be closed for discussing confidential or market sensitive information. H.R. 10 proposes changes to increase congressional oversight of FSOC meetings and actions. It would allow Members of Congress on committees of jurisdiction to attend public meetings, require transcripts for nonpublic meetings, and mandate confidential briefings to key committees. These changes aim to ensure greater accountability and oversight of FSOC. Increased oversight by Congress can reduce FSOC's independence and affect regulatory decisions. FSOC members can halt CFPB rules if they threaten financial stability, but H.R. 10 would remove this power. Some argue that CFPB prioritizes consumer protection over financial stability, making FSOC's ability to stay rules important for safeguarding stability. The CFPB is subject to additional oversight from the FSOC, which can stay rules if there is a threat to financial stability. H.R. 10 would remove this power, putting the CFPB on par with other regulators. The Treasury's Federal Insurance Office and an independent insurance expert serve on the FSOC, with the expert being a voting member. H.R. 10 would combine these two offices into one distinct from the Treasury."
