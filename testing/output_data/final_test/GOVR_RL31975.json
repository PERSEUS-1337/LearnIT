    "content": "The Bay-Delta, a vital water supply hub in California, has faced challenges due to competing water demands, leading to environmental degradation and water supply issues. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, fish species declines and water quality problems threatened the operation of water supply projects. To address this, California and federal agencies formed a partnership to prevent shutdowns or operational changes to key water supply pumps. The Bay-Delta Accord led to the creation of the CALFED Bay-Delta Program, aimed at restoring ecological health, improving water quality, fortifying infrastructure, and increasing water supply reliability in the Bay-Delta area. A federal appropriation of $143 million annually from FY1998 to FY2000 supported ecosystem protection and restoration projects, but expired in 2000 after $220 million in funds were allocated. In 1998 and 2000, $220 million in federal funds was appropriated for the CALFED program. Three bills were introduced in the 108th Congress to authorize appropriations for federal participation in CALFED, but none authorized the full implementation of the program. The controversy surrounding the reauthorization of federal participation in CALFED is partly due to the complex nature of water allocation in the Bay-Delta. The complex nature of water allocation in the Bay-Delta stems from the State Water Project (SWP) and the federal Central Valley Project (CVP) moving water from northern California to southern California. Decisions on water distribution are based on various laws, rights, contracts, and agreements, leading to concerns from water users about potential water loss or reduced quality. Some attribute the Bay-Delta's deterioration to low water supplies from project management, calling for operational changes to address issues like declining fish species. The decline of certain fish species has led to operational changes in project operations affecting water pumping from the Bay-Delta. Environmental groups advocate for increased water supplies to protect fish and wildlife, improve water quality, and restore the ecosystem. The CALFED program aims to balance competing interests in managing Bay-Delta water resources, but some agricultural stakeholders are concerned about water allocation. Some stakeholders are concerned about water allocation in the Bay-Delta region, fearing their supplies may be threatened. They question the balance of the CALFED program between ecosystem restoration and water storage facilities, as well as the adequacy of funding for surface water storage. There are doubts about the legitimacy of scientific findings on environmental water needs and the allocation for recovering threatened species. Legislative efforts to address these issues could potentially undermine the program's ability to restore fisheries and other resources in the Bay-Delta ecosystem. Some environmental groups advocate for increased water flows to natural areas to support endangered species recovery and suggest investing in water conservation and new technologies like desalination. They oppose new surface storage projects and prefer managing existing water supplies efficiently. Stakeholders fear that any deviation from the agreed-upon Restoration Operations Determination (ROD) may not serve their interests well. The report discusses the historical conflicts and agreements that led to the creation of CALFED, focusing on governance, ecosystem restoration, and water use issues related to its reauthorization in the 108th Congress. The Bay-Delta, a large estuary on the West Coast, provides habitat for diverse plant and animal life. The Bay-Delta is home to a diverse array of plant and animal species, with over 750 species found in the area. It also includes farmland, attracts 12 million recreationists annually, and has had its water regime altered since the 1930s to divert water for agricultural use in California's Central Valley. The Bay-Delta supplies water to 22 million people and millions of acres of farmland in California through networks of pumps, dams, canals, and reservoirs. The CVP and SWP projects take an estimated 5.9 million acre-feet of water from the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers, altering the physical environment of the Central Valley and Bay-Delta. The annual water taken ranges between 20% and 70% of the total inflow, impacting water quality and endangered species. The Bay-Delta ecosystem faces challenges with water quality, habitat loss, and endangered species due to drainage, saline water influx, pollutants from agriculture, cities, and ranches. Only 8,000 acres of original tidal marshland remain out of nearly 350,000 acres. Species like steelhead trout and winter-run chinook salmon are on endangered lists. Limited water supply in California has led to conflicts among competing interests for decades, particularly in distributing water to urban areas and agriculture. In 1986, a Coordinated Operation Agreement was established to coordinate water operations between the CVP and SWP during a six-year drought from 1987 to 1992, leading to water rationing in urban areas. Compliance issues with the Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act have also arisen due to water quality concerns in the Bay-Delta ecosystem, impacting species like winter-run chinook salmon. In 1987-1992, water rationing occurred in urban and agricultural areas in California due to limited water supplies during a drought. The implementation of the federal Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act in the Bay-Delta further complicated water distribution. The Central Valley Project Improvement Act in 1992 allocated specific water supplies for natural areas and wildlife for the first time, impacting water allocation and creating controversies among farmers, urban users, and environmentalists. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has led to controversies over water distribution in the Bay-Delta, with several fish species listed as endangered or threatened. Actions under the ESA have resulted in changes to dam operations and water flow to protect species like the winter-run chinook salmon. The Endangered Species Act has caused disputes over water allocation in the Bay-Delta due to listed fish species. Restrictions on water exports and project changes have been made to protect species like the delta smelt and spring-run chinook salmon. Controversy arose over water for recovering fish, leading to a lawsuit against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regarding the Sacramento splittail. The splittail was removed from the threatened species list in 2003 after a population analysis. The CVPIA in 1992 removed the splittail from the threatened species list, prioritizing water allocation for endangered species and the environment. It aimed to benefit fish and wildlife in the Bay-Delta and Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers system by reallocating CVP water back to natural areas. Limited funds and litigation have been challenges in providing water for restoration efforts. The CVPIA, implemented in the late 1980s, has faced controversy over water allocation for the environment and contract renewal provisions. The CWA, enforced by the EPA, led to disputes between the State Water Board and the federal government regarding water quality standards. EPA rejected California's water standards, prompting a lawsuit and the issuance of federal water quality regulations in 1993. In 1993, the EPA issued federal water quality guidelines for California after a lawsuit by environmentalists, but the state rejected them. To address CWA requirements and prevent cutbacks in water project operations, state and federal authorities agreed on water quality standards and regulations for the CVP and SWP, known as the Bay-Delta Accord. This included provisions for springtime flow regulation, export limits for fish species, operational flexibility for ESA compliance, and measures to improve the Bay-Delta Estuary. The Bay-Delta Accord, in effect until 2000, addressed water quality standards and regulations for the CVP and SWP, focusing on springtime flow regulation, export limits for fish species, operational flexibility for ESA compliance, and environmental improvements in the Bay-Delta Estuary. This led to the creation of the Bay-Delta Framework Agreement in 1995, marking the beginning of the CALFED process and emphasizing federal-state coordination on key issues. The CALFED Program was established in 1996 to address environmental, water supply, and water quality issues in the Bay-Delta through a joint federal-state process. Initial federal funding of nearly $430 million was authorized for FY1998 to FY2000, with specific amounts allocated for each year. Although the funding authorization expired in 2000, some activities supporting CALFED goals continued to receive federal funding. The program brought together state, federal, and other stakeholders to develop a comprehensive response to restoration and water supply challenges in the Bay-Delta. The CALFED Program was established in 1996 to address environmental, water supply, and water quality issues in the Bay-Delta. A \"Preferred Program Alternative\" was selected as the long-term plan for improving water quality, stabilizing Bay-Delta levees, restoring the Bay-Delta ecosystem, and improving water supply reliability. This plan was announced in August 2000. The CALFED Program was established in 1996 to address environmental, water supply, and water quality issues in the Bay-Delta. The California legislature adopted its own governance structure for the CALFED program, establishing the California Bay-Delta Authority (CALFED Authority) in September 2002 to oversee its implementation. The CALFED Authority oversees the state implementation of the CALFED Program, develops policies, tracks timelines, reports to legislatures, manages the science element, reviews and approves program plans and budgets, and administers the program. It consists of representatives from state and federal agencies, the Bay Delta Public Advisory Committee, members of the public, and appointed members from the State Senate and Assembly. The CALFED Authority oversees the state implementation of the CALFED Program and manages policies, timelines, budgets, and program administration. It includes representatives from state and federal agencies, public advisory committees, and appointed members from the State Senate and Assembly. The Authority will dismantle in 2006 unless federal legislation authorizing appropriate federal agency participation is enacted. P.L. 108-361 allows non-voting participation of federal agency heads in the Authority, but the sunset clause removal is pending a determination by the Secretary of the California Resources Agency. The debate over the reauthorization of CALFED in the 108th Congress focused on issues such as water storage projects, cost allocation, governance, and implementation of the ROD. Oversight issues in the 109th Congress are expected to include project financing and implementation of various plans. Three bills were introduced in the 108th Congress for federal participation in CALFED, with two bills approved by respective committees and one passing the House. The House passed H.R. 2828 on September 15, 2004, which was later signed into law as P.L. 108-361 on October 25, 2004. This law approves the ROD as a framework for the CALFED Bay-Delta Program and authorizes various activities and projects related to CALFED components. S. 1097 would have authorized federal agencies to conduct projects similar to those in the ROD, ranging from floodway improvements to water conservation projects. The House passed H.R. 2828 on September 15, 2004, approving the ROD as a framework for the CALFED Bay-Delta Program. S. 1097 would have authorized federal agencies to conduct projects related to water conservation and ecosystem benefits, with funding of $389 million from FY2005 to FY2010. H.R. 2828, passed by the House in July, had similar provisions but differed in authorizing appropriations from FY2005 to FY2008 and including additional requirements for land acquisition and ecosystem restoration projects. The major areas of bill differences for the CALFED Bay-Delta Program include implementation of the ROD, managing program activities, project approval process, cost allocation, and land acquisition requirements. Congress will also address funding levels, water storage, supplies, land acquisition, and science in the future. The estimated cost of CALFED implementation is $10 billion over 30 years, with $8.7 billion in Stage 1. Funding responsibility is split between the federal government, state government, and local users. The CALFED Program's funding is expected to come from federal appropriations, state bond measures, restoration fees, and local user fees. A draft finance plan was released in 2004, specifying the distribution of funding among the government, water users, and local grant matching. Congress has funded discrete projects within the program in the past, but no appropriations were provided due to the lack of an authorizing statute. The CALFED program lacked an authorizing statute and received no appropriations from FY2001 to FY2005. Federal funding has been allocated for various projects supporting CALFED goals, such as fish screens, pollution control, habitat management, and water storage studies. Despite no direct funding for CALFED during this period, appropriations were provided for related projects. For FY2002-FY2005, Congress allocated funds for projects supporting CALFED goals, totaling $70.5 million. P.L. 108-361 authorized $389 million for CALFED from FY2005-FY2010. Increasing water supplies in California is crucial due to population growth and lower Colorado River supplies. Stakeholders advocate for more investments in surface water storage to address this issue. Stakeholders, including Members of Congress, argue for increased investments in surface water storage in California. Existing water supplies can be extended through conservation, reuse, conjunctive use, transfers, and policy changes. Concerns were raised during a House Resources committee hearing in 2003 about more funding going towards environmental activities than storage. Program officials explained that funding for water storage projects was delayed but will increase relative to ecosystem spending in the future. The CALFED program aims for balanced implementation over time, with $1.3 billion already invested in the CVP for ecosystem restoration. Both S. 1097 and H.R. 2828 included provisions for program balance, with H.R. 2828 proposing streamlined project approval. This provision sparked controversy and was a key difference between the House and Senate. The controversial provision in the House and Senate bills regarding program balance was ultimately dropped and replaced with a requirement for re-evaluation of water storage options. The Environmental Water Account (EWA) was established by CALFED agencies to enhance water supply reliability without harming the Bay-Delta ecosystem, allowing for the acquisition and transfer of water for agricultural and urban users. The Environmental Water Account (EWA) was established by CALFED agencies to transfer water for compensation when pumps are shut down to mitigate \"fish take.\" Five agencies are partners in the EWA, authorizing exports for species protection, generating controversy over the amount of water needed. The EWA, established by CALFED agencies, aims to transfer water for compensation during fish protection measures. Stakeholders have differing opinions on its operation, with concerns about water levels for fisheries, unclear operating rules, and allocation for farming. Legislation like H.R. 2828 and S. 1097 address the EWA but differ in certain aspects. The EWA, addressed in legislation like S. 1097 and H.R. 2828, aims to provide additional water for Delta fisheries beyond regulatory requirements. P.L. 108-361 authorizes the use of funds for EWA purposes. Ecosystem restoration efforts may face uncertainties and require untested technologies. Some stakeholders question the level of scientific uncertainty in restoration activities and regulations of CALFED, particularly regarding water allocations for endangered fish species. Calls have been made for an independent scientific review of water allocations and the implementation of adaptive management. Legislation like H.R. 2828 and S. 1097 address the need for oversight and peer review through the establishment of an independent science board. The CALFED Program involves oversight, peer review, monitoring, research programs, and adaptive management. Land acquisition is deemed necessary for ecosystem restoration and water projects, but it is controversial due to potential conflicts among stakeholders. Some argue for expedited land acquisition for ecosystem restoration, while others call for guidelines to minimize economic impacts. Guidelines and assurances are needed to minimize economic impacts of land acquisition for ecosystem restoration and water projects. Legislation like S. 1097 and H.R. 2828 would authorize federal funds for land acquisition only if consistent with the CALFED Program. Additional requirements in H.R. 2828 include reporting and mitigating potential impacts, creating management plans, and identifying federal land acquisitions. Some argue these requirements could constrain ecosystem restoration activities, while others believe they are necessary to reduce pressure on acquiring private property. P.L. 108-361 incorporates language from H.R. 2828 for federal funds to acquire land for CALFED, with provisions for acquiring fee title only where consistent with the ROD. It also requires the Secretary of the Interior to identify parcels of land to be acquired and provide notice to appropriate committees and affected Senators and Representatives. Reporting provisions describe the process of notifying the public and local governments, reducing impacts on agricultural lands, and including preliminary management plans. The CALFED process in California Bay-Delta aimed to address water quality, water supply, and ESA issues through a $10 billion plan. Despite efforts to reauthorize federal funding during the 107th Congress, no legislation was enacted, leading to piecemeal appropriations for specific projects. The debate to reauthorize CALFED continued in the 108th Congress, resulting in the passage of H.R. 2828 (P.L. 108-361) on October 6, 2004. Issues debated included water supply project approval, program activity balance, federal and state funding levels, and the quality of science supporting policy decisions. Increasing water supply through storage projects has become a priority for California due to population growth and limited water supplies. The Bay-Delta faces water supply challenges due to limited resources from the Colorado River, potentially impacting the CALFED Program. Oversight issues for the 109th Congress include budgeting, storage projects, and program balance. In 1978, Water Rights Decision 1485 and a water quality control plan were adopted for the Bay-Delta, with subsequent legal challenges in 1986 leading to the determination that the 1978 plan was inadequate. In 1987, EPA officials notify State Board that the 1978 water quality plan is inadequate under federal Clean Water Act. In 1989, winter-run chinook salmon listed as endangered. In 1991, State Board adopts water quality control plan for the Bay-Delta. In 1992, State Board releases interim Delta standards, Decision 1630. In 1993, EPA releases draft federal water quality standards. In 1994, the Bay-Delta Accord is established. In 1994, the Bay-Delta Accord is signed, creating the CALFED Bay-Delta Program and coordinating CVP and SWP operations to meet water quality standards. In 1995, the State Board adopts a water quality plan similar to the accord, approved by EPA, and federal standards are withdrawn. In 1996, Congress authorizes the CALFED plan with annual funding, and the program releases a report outlining core programs and potential solutions. In 1998, the CALFED Bay-Delta Program releases phase II draft EIS/EIR with three alternatives. In 2000, the Record of Decision (ROD) is signed, and CALFED Program implementation begins. In 2002, the CALFED Bay-Delta Authority is established to oversee program implementation. In 2004, the Water Supply, Reliability, and Environmental Improvement Act is signed into law, reauthorizing the CALFED Program and authorizing federal funds."
