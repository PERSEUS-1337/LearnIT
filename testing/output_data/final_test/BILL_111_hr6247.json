The Congress finds that congestion on roadways is causing significant problems, including wasted time, fuel, and money, as well as environmental pollution. Additionally, traffic fatalities remain a concern, with nearly 34,000 people killed on U.S. roads in 2009. The economic cost of traffic fatalities and injuries is estimated at $230 billion annually, with the transportation sector contributing one third of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions. To address these issues, the United States must utilize intelligent transportation systems to improve safety, efficiency, and connectivity. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technologies offer cost-effective solutions to reduce congestion, emissions, and improve safety and connectivity. Synchronized and adaptive traffic signals can yield significant returns in time and fuel savings, reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 22%, and decrease travel delays by 25%. A nationwide real-time traffic information system has a benefit-cost ratio of 25 to 1, with a $1.2 billion investment returning substantial benefits. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technologies offer cost-effective solutions to reduce congestion, emissions, and improve safety. Collision avoidance technologies could prevent 31% of traffic crashes, while a comprehensive communication network could prevent up to 82% of non-alcohol related traffic fatalities. Investing in ITS technologies is crucial for creating a more efficient transportation network and financing mechanisms. ITS can provide real-time traffic information, support dynamic pricing, and create job opportunities. Investing in ITS technologies stimulates job creation across various sectors, including green jobs, high-tech, automotive, and information technology. It also leads to long-term benefits such as government cost savings and improved quality of life. The lack of Federal investment in ITS has caused the Nation to fall behind other world innovation leaders. The United States is lagging behind other world innovation leaders in the deployment of ITS technologies, such as Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and European nations. These countries have seen significant benefits for their citizens, economy, and environment by investing heavily in ITS solutions. Encouraging the accelerated development and deployment of intelligent transportation systems is crucial for strengthening the Nation's economic competitiveness and quality of life. The curr_chunk is a section titled \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" In this Act, definitions include \"eligible entity\" referring to various government entities eligible for funding, \"ITS\" for intelligent transportation systems, and \"multi-jurisdictional group\" for collaborative entities implementing the SMART Communities program across boundaries. The SMART Communities program involves a multi-jurisdictional group that must consist of eligible entities to receive grants under the Act, with the Secretary of Transportation overseeing the program. The SMART Communities program involves a multi-jurisdictional group of eligible entities overseen by the Secretary of Transportation. The program includes the Smart Communities Technology Initiative. The Secretary will establish the Smart Communities Technology Initiative to provide grants for pilot programs improving safety, mobility, and the environment through ITS deployment. Criteria for grant selection include environmental benefits, energy consumption reduction, operational performance improvement, and traffic collision reduction. The Smart Communities Technology Initiative aims to improve safety, mobility, and the environment through ITS deployment. It includes providing user-friendly transportation information, managing multimodal systems, and delivering economic benefits. The Secretary will request applications for participation in the initiative within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Smart Communities Technology Initiative aims to improve safety, mobility, and the environment through ITS deployment. The Secretary will request applications for participation in the initiative within 6 months of the Act's enactment. SEC. 5. GRANT PROGRAM. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, an entity must submit a deployment plan to the Secretary for intelligent transportation systems. This plan should include real-time traffic information, advanced management systems, collision avoidance, and technologies to enhance transit and commercial operations. Operational improvements like synchronized traffic signals are also required. The deployment plan for intelligent transportation systems must include adaptive traffic signals, ITS applications, and partnerships with various entities to achieve performance goals such as reducing crashes, congestion, and emissions. The plan should also outline quantifiable improvements in safety, mobility, and environmental benefits through data-driven projections. The deployment plan for intelligent transportation systems includes leveraging existing investments, ensuring interoperability with other systems, and awarding grants to diverse geographic areas. The deployment plan for intelligent transportation systems includes awarding grants to diverse geographic areas of the United States, encompassing urban, suburban, and rural areas. The grant recipient can use funds to deploy various ITS and ITS-enabled strategies, including advanced traveler information systems, transportation management systems, infrastructure technology, public transportation systems, safety systems, electronic pricing systems, and mobility technologies. The grant recipient must submit annual reports to the Secretary detailing the deployment and operational costs, benefits, savings, and project outcomes compared to original expectations. This includes data on reducing traffic crashes, congestion, emissions, optimizing multimodal system performance, and providing real-time information. The Secretary shall submit a report to Congress on the effectiveness of grant recipients in meeting their deployment plan, including reducing traffic-related fatalities, congestion, emissions, and providing real-time transportation information. The Secretary may cease additional grant funds if a recipient fails to meet grant requirements. Remaining funds can be redistributed to other eligible entities for pilot programs under this Act. SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Funding of $350 million for fiscal year 2012, $225 million for fiscal year 2013, $200 million for fiscal year 2014, $125 million for fiscal year 2015, and $125 million for fiscal year 2016 is authorized from the Highway Trust Fund. Funds can be used without transferability and obligation limitations, remaining available until expended. The Secretary is limited to awarding no more than 25% of the appropriated amount to a single grant. The Act authorizes funding from the Highway Trust Fund for fiscal years 2012-2016. The Secretary can award grants up to 25% of the appropriated amount to a single recipient. Grant recipients can use up to 5% of the award for planning and reporting. The Secretary may set aside $1,000,000 each fiscal year for program reporting and administrative costs before awarding grants."
