    "content": "U.S. importers can request legislation to reduce, repeal, or suspend duties on certain imports. The House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees typically include these requests in miscellaneous tariff and technical corrections bills (MTBs). MTBs may also contain minor trade law corrections and instructions to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Duty suspensions in MTBs must be noncontroversial, revenue-neutral, and manageable by CBP and other agencies. The previous process for assembling MTBs involved Members introducing duty suspension bills, but recent controversy led to a halt in new legislation. Efforts to pass subsequent MTB legislation have stalled since the United States Manufacturing Enhancement Act of 2010. Recent developments propose a revised process for vetting duty suspension bills, which previously involved Member introduction and vetting by relevant agencies. The report tracks MTB legislation introduced from the 109th to the 114th Congresses, highlighting House and Senate rules on \"earmarks\" and \"limited tariff benefits.\" MTB legislation in Congress from 1983 to the present is summarized. A bill to establish a process for MTBs is being considered, with H.R. 4923 introduced by House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady. The Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee and full committee have held hearings and markup on the bill. Brady emphasized the bill's transparency and bipartisan nature. The bipartisan bill for MTB process transparency is set to reach the House floor in late April. The Trade Facilitation and Enforcement Act of 2015 urged a regular legislative process for duty suspension. H.R. 4923 and S. 2794 propose a new MTB consideration process. The new MTB process under S. 2794 involves the U.S. International Trade Commission receiving duty suspension petitions directly from the public, with specific time and reporting requirements. The process includes consultation with various agencies, consideration of duty suspension requests, and drafting the final MTB through a committee with the authority to exclude duty suspensions objected to by a Member or involving domestic production. The House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committee chairs initiated the process by sending out letters inviting Members to introduce stand-alone legislation on proposed duty suspensions. Members had to file disclosure forms affirming no financial interest in the duty suspension entity. The deadline for introduction was before an MTB was expected to be reported. The goal was for the MTB to be \"non-controversial\" and pass both houses easily. Interested parties were requested to provide comments at the subcommittee level due to the large number of bills submitted. The subcommittee considers duty suspensions for inclusion in the MTB only if the goods are deemed \"noncontroversial\" or \"noncompetitive.\" Duty suspensions must be in the interest of U.S. manufacturers and consumers, with a revenue loss generally not exceeding $500,000 per product per year. For example, duty suspensions in H.R. 4380 would cost the government about $286 million over 10 years. The duty suspension bills were reviewed by various federal agencies and committees, including the USTR, CBP, Department of Commerce, and ITC. Committee staff may seek public comments directly or through Administration channels. All relevant information is posted on committee websites for public input, with the ITC being the first agency to examine duty suspensions. The ITC is the only agency required by statute to respond to duty suspensions and contacts U.S. manufacturers for their input. The Department of Commerce coordinates the overall Administration response to duty suspension bills, with Commerce generally not objecting unless a U.S. producer is found. The Department of Commerce and CBP do not oppose duty suspensions for multinational companies importing products from their overseas plants, even if a similar product is made in the US. CBP shares information with the ITC and other agencies, communicating directly to committees on certain issues. The USTR focuses on larger trade policy issues rather than individual duty suspension bills. During the MTB process in Congress, a significant increase in the number of individual duty suspension bills was observed. The Administration prefers temporary tariff modifications to allow for more permanent revisions in trade negotiations. Over 1,800 duty suspension bills were introduced in the 112th Congress. Stand-alone MTB legislation was not passed in the 109th Congress, with almost 700 MTB provisions attached to other bills. During the 109th Congress, almost 700 MTB provisions were attached to other legislation, including duty suspensions on about 300 products in the \"Pension Protection Act of 2006\" and an additional 380 products in a trade legislation agreement. These provisions were ultimately included in tax break extensions bills that were signed into law, suspending tariffs until December 31, 2009. During the 110th Congress, no MTB legislation was introduced, despite calls for duty suspension bills. Lawmakers viewed the end of 2009 as the deadline for MTB legislation passage, increasing the likelihood of consideration in the 111th Congress. House and Senate procedures were implemented to enhance transparency. During the 110th Congress, no MTB legislation was introduced, despite calls for duty suspension bills. Lawmakers viewed the end of 2009 as the deadline for MTB legislation passage, increasing the likelihood of consideration in the 111th Congress. House and Senate procedures aimed at increasing transparency in congressionally directed spending, including limited tariff benefits. House rules require disclosure of earmarks, limited tax benefits, and limited tariff benefits in bills or reports. House Rule XXIII, clause 17(a) mandates written disclosure for limited tariff benefits, including sponsor's name, beneficiaries, purpose, and financial interest certification. Committees must maintain and make these disclosures public, with potential additional administrative requirements. In the 110th Congress, the Senate passed the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act of 2007, which included disclosure requirements for congressionally directed spending. The legislation was signed into law on September 14, 2007. Senate Rule XLIV was amended to restrict the consideration of bills or resolutions without committee approval. The Senate passed the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act of 2007, which included disclosure requirements for congressionally directed spending. The legislation was signed into law on September 14, 2007. Senate Rule XLIV was amended to restrict the consideration of bills or resolutions without committee approval, requiring disclosure of spending items and benefits. The Miscellaneous Tariff and Technical Corrections Act of 2009, introduced by House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee Chairman Sander M. Levin and Ranking Member Kevin Brady, aimed to renew duty suspensions for over 600 products. The Senate Finance Committee also planned to move forward on a similar bill, with a deadline for individual bill submissions by October 30, 2009, following a bipartisan agreement on disclosure requirements for lobbyists. The agreement between the House and Senate involved additional disclosure requirements for lobbyists, requiring them to register under a separate issue code (\"TAR\") for lobbying activities related to the MTB process. Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Chuck Grassley pushed for this to improve transparency. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Levin and Trade Subcommittee Chairman Tanner urged support for the MTB legislation (H.R. 4380) in a letter differentiating MTB from earmarks. The House Rules highlighted definitions of \"earmark\" and \"limited tariff benefit,\" emphasizing the potential for increased U.S. production and job support. H.R. 4380 was passed by the House and Senate, signed into law as P.L. 111-227. A discussion draft for a second MTB package was posted by the House Ways and Means Committee. The MTB process during the 111th Congress saw the introduction of H.R. 6517, the Omnibus Trade Act of 2010, which included duty suspensions for 290 products. The bill was approved by the House and Senate, with the Senate passing an amendment that removed the duty suspension measures. The MTB process for the 112th Congress began in March 2012, with Members invited to submit duty suspension bills by April 30, 2012. In the 113th Congress, duty suspension bills were due in the Senate on March 30. H.R. 6727, the U.S. Job Creation and Manufacturing Competitiveness Act of 2013, was introduced but did not receive floor consideration. H.R. 2708, the United States Job Creation and Manufacturing Competitiveness Act of 2013, introduced on July 17, 2013, saw no floor action. Members have introduced legislation to change the MTB process by authorizing the ITC to develop draft legislation for Congress. Some Members propose having an agency, rather than Congress, handle duty suspension requests to avoid violating the earmark ban. Others argue that changing the MTB process would mean relinquishing Congress's constitutional trade and appropriations responsibilities. The ITC is suggested as a potential lead agency for MTB reform due to its independence and existing role in researching duty suspensions. The MTB debate in Congress focuses on duty suspensions as potential limited tariff benefits, with supporters arguing that duty suspensions in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule provide broad economic benefits by lowering production costs for American manufacturers and creating jobs. They suggest that duty suspensions are freely available to any importer and can benefit American consumers. The ITC is proposed as a potential alternative for handling duty suspension requests to avoid violating the earmark ban. MTB opponents argue that duty suspensions have limited benefits as only requesting companies benefit, and the process may be influenced by lobbyists. They also claim that MTBs do not offer enough economic advantages, distract Congress from broader trade legislation, and are temporary with narrow relief qualifications. Supporters argue that MTB provisions undergo a transparent vetting process unlike most earmarks. Most earmarks and MTB provisions go through a transparent vetting process, including public comment, review by the ITC and executive branch agencies, and scoring by the Congressional Budget Office. Some in Congress suggest having an outside agency review duty suspensions before any congressional action. Legislation introduced in previous Congresses aimed to authorize the ITC to oversee the MTB process and provide a completed package to Congress. Supporters of the current process argue that shifting duty suspension oversight to the ITC could make the MTB process less transparent and diminish Congress's constitutional power to levy tariffs. Non-MTB measures have caused delays in floor consideration of MTB legislation in the past, especially in the Senate. The last omnibus MTB reported out of the Senate in 2002 faced opposition due to various provisions, including one related to preferential access for beneficiaries of the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act. Ultimately, the bill passed in late 2004."
