    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 26909 of the Government Code is amended to require the county auditor to conduct an annual audit of special districts within the county or contract with a certified public accountant. The audit must meet minimum requirements set by the Controller and adhere to auditing standards. The audit of special districts must meet minimum requirements set by the Controller and adhere to auditing standards. The report must be filed with the Controller and county auditor within 12 months of the fiscal year end. Costs incurred for the audit shall be borne by the special district. A special district located in multiple counties must follow auditing requirements set by the county where its treasury is located. The governing board can request to replace the annual audit with a biennial or five-year audit, or one conducted at specific intervals recommended by the county auditor. A special district may replace the annual audit with a financial review or agreed-upon procedures engagement if certain conditions are met, including all revenues and expenditures being transacted through the county's financial system and annual revenues not exceeding $150,000. The district is responsible for covering any costs incurred by the county auditor for the agreed-upon procedures engagement. If the board of supervisors is the governing board of the special district, they can replace the annual audit with a financial review or agreed-upon procedures engagement if certain conditions are met, including all transactions being through the county's financial system. The special district's annual revenues must not exceed $150,000. The district is responsible for covering any costs incurred by the county auditor for a financial compilation. A special district cannot replace an annual audit with a financial compilation for more than five consecutive years. However, the district may be exempt from an annual audit if the financial statements are audited by the Controller to meet federal requirements. The county auditor can appoint a CPA to audit a special district after a financial review, agreed-upon procedures engagement, or financial compilation. This section is effective until January 1, 2027, and will be repealed after that date. The county auditor or a contracted CPA must conduct an annual audit of special districts within the county as per the Controller's guidelines and auditing standards. The audit of special districts must meet minimum requirements set by the Controller and adhere to auditing standards. The audit report must be filed with the Controller and county auditor within 12 months of the fiscal year end. Costs incurred for the audit will be borne by the special district from available funds.

Audits must be conducted at least once every five years as recommended by the county auditor. A special district may replace the annual audit with a financial review if approved by the governing board and board of supervisors, under certain conditions. Special districts can be exempt from annual audits if financial statements are audited by the Controller for federal requirements. This provision will be effective from January 1, 2027."
