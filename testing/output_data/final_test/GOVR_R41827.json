    "content": "Members of Congress and the Obama Administration are debating efforts to reduce the federal deficit and stabilize the national debt. The bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform issued recommendations for spending reductions and revenue increases. President Obama submitted a detailed FY2012 budget request to Congress and released deficit reduction policies. The House Budget Committee reported a concurrent resolution on the FY2012 budget. The House Budget Committee reported a concurrent resolution on the FY2012 budget (H.Con.Res. 34) based on the Path to Prosperity document by Chairman Paul Ryan. The full House passed H.Con.Res. 34 on April 15 after defeating substitute versions. The Senate has not yet acted on a budget resolution for FY2012. This CRS report highlights spending trends and key policy initiatives in the President's budget and the House-passed budget resolution for human resources functions. The human resources superfunction, including education, health, income security, Social Security, and veterans benefits, accounts for the majority of federal spending. This report provides an overview of spending trends and policy recommendations in the FY2012 budget proposals without quantifying specific costs or savings. The federal budget is divided into 20 functional categories, which are further divided into subfunctions. These categories provide a broad statement of budget priorities and are used for informational purposes in the congressional budget process. Some budget functions are grouped into \"superfunctions\" for analysis purposes. The federal budget is divided into functional categories and superfunctions for analysis. Congress uses the annual budget resolution as a blueprint for legislation and spending, setting targets for spending, revenues, deficit, and national debt. The congressional budget resolution sets aggregate spending targets for functional categories, based on assumptions about specific programs. Enforcement mechanisms ensure compliance with these targets. The report provides an overview of the human resources superfunction's historical and projected trends. The report compares human resources spending under current law with the President's budget request and the House budget resolution. It also discusses policies aimed at reducing spending and stabilizing the national debt. The focus is on the six categories within the human resources superfunction, comparing baseline projections for FY2011 through FY2021. The report compares human resources spending under current law with the President's budget request and the House budget resolution in constant FY2011 dollars. It includes tables showing federal budget authority and outlays for each of the six functions. Sources of information used in the report include the Obama Administration's FY2012 budget documents, White House fact sheet on The President's Framework for Shared Prosperity and Shared Fiscal Responsibility, an Analysis of the President's Budgetary Proposals for Fiscal Year 2012 by the Congressional Budget Office, and The Path to Prosperity: Restoring America's Promise by the House Budget Committee. The House Budget Committee report (H.Rept. 112-58) and a Long-Term Analysis of a Budget Proposal by Chairman Ryan from the Congressional Budget Office show the trend in federal outlays for major categories of the federal budget from FY1962 through FY2010. The growth in spending for human resources over the last five decades is highlighted, with outlays for human resources as a percentage of GDP substantially increasing since 1962. CBO projects this trend to continue through FY2021. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that spending for human resources as a percentage of GDP peaked in FY2010 at 16.4% and is expected to fall to 14.8% by FY2014. However, it is projected to rise again starting in FY2015, reaching 15.7% by FY2021. This increase is fueled by factors such as the effects of the baby boom generation's retirement and increased enrollment in Medicare and Social Security. The trend in outlays for human resources budget functions, as a share of GDP, has been dominated by health, Medicare, income security, and Social Security. Factors such as wage indexing, medical cost inflation, and new spending from the health care reform law of 2010 contribute to this trend. The trend in federal spending for human resources budget functions, such as education, training, employment, social services, veterans benefits, and health care, is projected to shift over the next decade. While spending for education, training, and veterans benefits will decrease, expenditures for health care (mainly Medicaid), Medicare, and Social Security are expected to increase due to the aging population and rising healthcare costs. This shift indicates a growing share of the economy being allocated to healthcare services. The analysis shows that federal spending for low-income programs will peak in FY2010, then rise again in FY2013, with projected growth mainly in health programs like Medicaid and CHIP. Non-health low-income program spending will decrease over the next decade. Comparisons of estimated outlays for human resources functions under different budgets are shown in Figure 4. The President's budget closely follows and slightly exceeds the CBO baseline, while the House budget resolution would result in significantly lower spending as a share of the national economy. All three budgets project an immediate drop in spending, with variations in spending trends throughout the decade. CBO projects that human resources spending will equal 15.7% of GDP in FY2021 with no change in policy, compared to 15.9% under the Administration's budget and 13.5% under the House resolution. Later sections of the report discuss trends in projected outlays for human resources functional categories. The CBO projects growth in health-related functions and Social Security spending. The House budget resolution aims to lower spending on Medicaid but not on Medicare or Social Security. It also targets reductions in education, training, employment, social services, and income security. Both the Administration and House proposals aim to address the federal deficit concerns. The Administration and House budget proposals aim to constrain federal spending growth and reduce the deficit. The Administration's proposal includes freezing non-security discretionary spending at FY2010 levels through FY2015, with targeted increases in critical areas. President Obama's April Framework suggests additional reductions in non-security discretionary spending in line with the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility's recommendations. The White House and House budget proposals aim to reduce federal spending and the deficit. President Obama's April Framework includes a \"debt failsafe\" provision for automatic spending cuts if the debt to GDP ratio is not stabilized by 2014. The House budget resolution targets a reduction in discretionary non-security spending and a five-year freeze. Social Security, low-income programs, and Medicare benefits are exempt from the trigger. The House budget resolution does not set spending levels for individual programs, which are determined through the appropriations process. It includes mechanisms to enforce spending caps, with automatic reductions if targets are not met, except for Social Security. These proposals align with the Administration's budget plan and focus on projected outlays for human resources functions. Function 500 encompasses funding for various human resources programs including education, social services, and employment and training. It also includes funding for cultural and art agencies. Most spending under this function is discretionary, with some mandatory spending on student financial assistance and Social Services Block Grants. The Function 500 programs cover education, social services, and employment and training. The Administration's budget request slightly exceeds the CBO baseline, while the House budget resolution proposes significantly lower spending levels. By FY2021, the Administration's budget would be 1% higher than the baseline, while the House resolution assumes spending 36% below the baseline. The Administration's budget proposes reductions in discretionary spending for Function 500, affecting education and workforce development programs. Changes to Pell grants and student loans would offset costs, while the American Opportunity Credit would be extended and indexed. The House budget resolution includes sharp cuts to Function 500, impacting education and workforce programs. Changes to Pell grants and student loans are assumed, with a sustainable maximum Pell grant award proposed. Function 550 covers health care services programs, including Medicaid and anti-bioterrorism activities. Function 550 funds health programs such as anti-bioterrorism activities, biomedical research, health services for under-served populations, and training for the healthcare workforce. Major agencies funded include NIH, CDC, HRSA, and FDA. Mandatory programs include Medicaid, CHIP, federal health benefits, and Medicare-eligible military retiree healthcare. Spending is divided into health care services, research and training, and consumer and occupational health and safety. The estimated outlays for Function 550 programs from FY2011 to FY2021 show different trends between the CBO baseline, the Administration's budget request, and the House budget resolution. The Administration's budget closely tracks with CBO projections, with an initial drop in Medicaid spending in FY2012 followed by a sharp increase starting in FY2013. In contrast, the House budget resolution projects a decrease in spending until FY2014, followed by a relatively flat line through FY2018 and a slight increase thereafter. By FY2021, the Administration's budget would result in estimated outlays only slightly lower than the others. The February budget would lead to estimated outlays slightly lower than the CBO baseline, while the House budget resolution's spending targets would result in outlays 50% lower. Medicaid is the main driver of spending in Function 550. The Administration's FY2012 budget includes proposals to improve Medicaid program integrity, limit reimbursement rates for medical equipment, simplify federal-state matching formulas, and enhance patient safety. The budget also supports reforming service delivery for high-cost beneficiaries, including dual eligibles. The House Budget Committee calls for Medicaid reform, including converting federal Medicaid spending into a block grant indexed for inflation and population growth. They advocate repealing Medicaid expansions and subsidies under PPACA, as well as eliminating the individual mandate. Savings are expected from repealing unspent funds provided under ARRA. The House Budget Committee proposes Medicaid reform by converting federal spending into a block grant and repealing Medicaid expansions and subsidies under PPACA. Savings are expected from repealing unspent funds provided under ARRA. Function 570 includes only the Medicare program, with almost all spending being mandatory for Medicare benefits. Estimated outlays for Medicare show increasing spending throughout the decade due to an aging population and rising healthcare costs. The President's February budget proposes a 10-year freeze on physician payment rates under Medicare at FY2011 levels to offset rising healthcare costs. The budget also includes various proposals to build on changes to Medicare enacted in PPACA. The April Framework assumes additional savings to fully pay for the \"doc fix\" provision over the 10-year budget window. The Framework includes proposals to lower Medicare growth per beneficiary, cut prescription drug costs, reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare. The House budget resolution envisions converting Medicare into a premium subsidy program by FY2022 and includes changes to the physician payment rate formula. The House budget resolution includes provisions for reforming the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) without increasing the deficit, reinvesting potential Medicare savings, eliminating the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), and changing laws on medical liability. Function 600 covers income security programs for low-income individuals, retirees, disabled persons, and the unemployed, with housing assistance programs receiving the most discretionary funding. Major entitlement programs in this function include Unemployment Insurance, Trade Adjustment Assistance, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Function 600 encompasses income security programs such as SNAP, TANF, foster care, and SSI. It also includes refundable tax credits like EITC and ACTC. Approximately one-third of funds in Function 600 go towards federal retirement and disability programs. Spending is divided among six subfunctions including general retirement and disability insurance, federal employee retirement, unemployment compensation, housing assistance, food and nutrition assistance, and other income security programs. The Administration's budget proposal aligns with the CBO baseline until FY2013, then shows slower spending decreases through FY2018. The House budget resolution indicates a sharper spending drop until FY2015, with outlays leveling off through FY2021. The President's budget projects higher FY2021 outlays compared to CBO, while the House budget resolution forecasts lower outlays. All budgets assume reduced recession-related spending for UI and SNAP as the economy improves. The budget assumes reduced recession-related spending for UI and SNAP as the economy recovers. The Administration proposes to reduce discretionary spending, including a deep cut in the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Certain tax provisions are proposed to be permanently extended, such as the EITC and the ACTC. The President's budget includes provisions to address unfunded liabilities in the UI system and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The House budget resolution assumes lower spending for Function 600 programs, partly due to deeper cuts in discretionary non-security spending. The House Budget Committee also mentions converting SNAP into a block grant to states. The Budget Committee suggests converting SNAP into a block grant to states, with state allotments indexed for food inflation and eligibility. Chairman Ryan's budget resolution includes work requirements and time limits for recipients of SNAP benefits and housing assistance. Other provisions in the resolution involve federal employees contributing more towards their retirement, eliminating the Home Affordable Modification Program, and reforming the PBGC. Function 650 includes Social Security programs funded by payroll taxes, covering Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance. Outlays for Function 650 from FY2011 to FY2021 show minimal differences between the CBO baseline, Administration's budget request, and House budget resolution, with no significant policy changes expected. President Obama supports bipartisan efforts to strengthen Social Security. President Obama supports bipartisan efforts to strengthen Social Security for the long term by proposing principles such as maintaining robust benefits, ensuring solvency, and avoiding privatization or benefit reductions. The House Budget Committee sees potential in the recommendations of the President's Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform as a bipartisan path forward for Social Security reform. The resolution would require the Social Security Board of Trustees to suggest statutory reforms annually. The Board of Trustees recommends statutory reforms to the President when there is a deficit in the 75-year actuarial balance. This includes programs for veterans' medical care, compensation, education, and housing. Mandatory funding supports various benefits for veterans. Function 700 programs provide a range of benefits and services for veterans, including health care, education, and housing. The majority of funding goes towards veterans' health care, with discretionary funding supporting other services. Estimated outlays for these programs from FY2011 to FY2021 show that budgets for veterans benefits are consistent across different proposals. Federal spending on human resources programs has increased over the last five decades but is expected to decrease from FY2010 to FY2014 before rising again in FY2015. The growth will be mainly in health care and Social Security, while other components of human resources spending will decrease. The debate over reducing the federal deficit includes proposals to change federal spending. The debate over federal spending includes proposals to reduce spending for certain programs and increase spending for others. The Administration's budget request for FY2012 includes deficit reduction principles, with the House resolution aiming to reduce outlays in the human resources superfunction by 14% below the CBO baseline by FY2021. The House resolution for FY2021 aims to reduce spending in three key functions: Function 500 (ETESS) by 36%, Function 550 (health) by 50%, and Function 600 (income security) by 11%. These reductions would impact federal programs for low-income populations primarily in the human resources superfunction. The House budget resolution envisions significant cuts in spending across these functions. The House budget resolution aims to reduce spending in Function 500 (ETESS) by 36%, Function 550 (health) by 50%, and Function 600 (income security) by 11%. However, the reduction in Function 500 would contribute little to deficit reduction due to its small size compared to other functions like Medicaid and income security. The House resolution also includes a proposal to convert Medicare into a premium subsidy program, but this would not take effect until FY2022, which is beyond the 10-year budget window. The Administration's budget and the House budget resolution do not propose specific changes to Social Security or veterans benefits. Social Security remains the largest human resources function in both proposals, with projected spending in FY2021 significantly higher than Function 500 (ETESS) and Function 600 (income security). Medicare spending is also projected to be significantly higher than Function 500 and Function 600 in FY2021."
