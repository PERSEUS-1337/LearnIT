Self-employment taxes for eligible small businesses will also be reduced based on the income during the holiday period. The compensation of the taxpayer subject to tax under section 3211(a) for the taxable year shall be reduced by the payroll tax holiday period income for purposes of applying the tax rate determined by reference to the taxes imposed by sections 3101(a) and 3111(a).
