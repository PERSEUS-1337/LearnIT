The United Nations estimated that between 1.6 million and 2.5 million people were affected by the storm, left homeless or without basic sources of livelihood. Foreign governments, the United Nations, and international relief organizations offered disaster relief to Burma, with the Bush Administration pledging $16.25 million. The Burmese government initially resisted foreign aid but eventually allowed limited assistance. The SPDC imposed severe restrictions on foreign aid after Cyclone Nargis, limiting the entry of relief workers and barring direct military assistance. However, restrictions gradually eased by June 2008. The SPDC in Burma agreed to allow ASEAN members to coordinate foreign relief aid with the United Nations, permitting a larger presence of relief and medical workers from neighboring Asian countries. Despite criticism from foreign governments and aid groups, there were proposals to send aid into Burma without SPDC permission. China's reluctance to support forcible \"humanitarian intervention\" in Burma has hindered international efforts. Despite providing aid, China has not pressured the SPDC to grant wider access to foreigners for relief efforts. Chinese President Hu Jin-tao was unresponsive to appeals to influence Burma to open up for international aid. China emphasized the need for \"due respect\" towards the Burmese government for relief work. Burma's military-led government announced a national referendum on a new constitution in May 2008, leading to a \"multi-party election\" in 2010 to transition from military to civilian rule. This followed a long process since 1992, including a constitutional convention in 2007 and a commission writing the constitution in 2008. A government-appointed commission completed drafting a new constitution in February 2008, giving the military a prominent role in the state. The constitution established a presidential form of government with two legislatures, where the military would hold 25% of seats. Political parties could participate in elections, but individuals married to foreigners were barred from running for office. The UN Security Council resolution urged the SPDC to ensure political freedoms during the referendum, which China initially blocked. The SPDC proceeded with the referendum despite concerns, reporting high approval rates for the constitution. However, reports suggested the process was not free and fair, with the SPDC allegedly implementing measures to guarantee a wide margin of approval. The Burmese military government implemented various coercive measures to ensure a wide margin of approval for the constitution, including arrests of \"no\" campaigners, restricting media access for rejection advocates, and forcing civil servants and teachers to publicly vote \"yes\". The regime also limited precinct monitors, organized its supporters to vote last, and announced results centrally without counting at the precinct level. The Burmese military government suppressed large-scale anti-government protests in Rangoon and Mandalay led by Buddhist monks and pro-democracy activists, with objectives shifting towards political reforms including the release of political prisoners and negotiations with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Several hundred monks visited Aung San Suu Kyi at her home while she was under house arrest. The All Burma Monks Alliance called for protests to overthrow the regime, leading to a crackdown by the government with military force on September 25, 2007. Troops used tear gas, warning shots, and fired into crowds of protesters, resulting in mass arrests, especially of monks. The government reported ten deaths, but opposition groups claimed a higher toll. Internet access was cut off, and both domestic and foreign individuals were arrested. The government crackdown on protests in September 2007 led to arrests, including of journalists. A Japanese journalist was killed by Burmese soldiers. By December 2007, at least 31 people were killed and 500 to 1,000 were detained. General Than Shwe offered dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi if she stopped promoting confrontation and sanctions. The SPDC appointed a cabinet minister as a liaison with Aung San Suu Kyi, but little was accomplished. Since 1988, reports have described human rights abuses by the Burmese military. The U.S. government still refers to the country as Burma. The State Department's reports have consistently highlighted human rights abuses by the SPDC and Burmese military, including extra-judicial killings, torture, and restrictions on press and assembly. The number of political prisoners has remained high, with prominent figures like Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest. The Burmese military, led by NLD deputy leader Tin Oo, has been accused of committing human rights abuses against ethnic minorities. Cease-fire agreements were negotiated with 17 insurgencies in the 1990s, but conflicts with the Karen, Karenni, and Shan groups persist. Ethnic minorities account for the majority of internally displaced people and refugees in eastern Burma. The government's oppressive policies target the Muslim Rohingya minority in western Burma, denying them citizenship. The deteriorating political situation has worsened the human rights abuses in the country. The deteriorating political situation in Burma since 2002 has led to worsening human rights abuses. This includes the physical attack on Aung San Suu Kyi in 2003, her subsequent house arrest, and the arrest of Khin Nyunt in 2004. Khin Nyunt, who advocated for negotiations with the NLD and international criticism, was removed from power within the SPDC. Since Khin Nyunt's removal from power within the SPDC, younger Burmese military commanders have taken on higher positions, some with ties to human rights abuses. Power now lies with Senior General Than Shwe and Vice Senior General Maung Aye, with rumors of a power struggle between them unsubstantiated. Than Shwe is seen as the top decision-maker and is hostile towards Aung San Suu Kyi, while Maung Aye's influence has grown post-Khin Nyunt's ouster. In 2005, the SPDC ordered government ministries to relocate to a new capital in Pyinmana. In 2005, the SPDC ordered ministries to move from Rangoon to a new capital in Pyinmana without notifying foreign embassies. The move was made as a new U.S. Embassy was being built in Rangoon. Despite economic and diplomatic sanctions, the SPDC has not been pressured to make political reforms due to the lack of uniformity in sanctions imposed by different countries. Sanctions imposed by the EU on Burma include a visa ban, arms embargo, asset freeze, and suspension of trade treatment. Despite these measures, there is no ban on Burmese imports or EU private investments in Burma. Japan has provided aid projects totaling over $18 million in 2004, including hydro-electric power and the Rangoon airport. Japan considered new sanctions after a reporter was killed in Rangoon in 2007 but pledged $1.79 million in humanitarian aid in January 2008. Japan pledged $1.79 million in humanitarian aid to Burma in January 2008. The aid is considered \"humanitarian\" by the Japanese government, but other governments argue it is actually infrastructure aid. U.S. sanctions do not include the Yadana offshore natural gas production and pipeline in Burma, operated by a consortium including Chevron, Total, and PTT Exploration. The Yadana project earned $2.16 billion in 2006. The Yadana project, operated by a consortium including Chevron, Total, and PTT Exploration, earned $2.16 billion in 2006. An estimate for the consortium's earnings in 2007 is $2.8 billion. Chevron's 28% share of the profit in 2006 would be approximately $600 million. The Burmese government's income from the project in 2006 is estimated at about $500 million. Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise would receive about $330 million based on its 15% share. Top Burmese military officials are believed to profit from government corporations. Burma's corporate income tax intake from the project in 2006 is estimated at about $183 million. Burma's ability to expand exports of various commodities to Asia and beyond, including natural resources like natural gas, nickel, precious gems, and timber, as well as shrimp and illegal drugs. Textile exports have increased since the 2003 U.S. import ban, with earnings from natural gas reaching $1 billion in 2004 and 2005. New gas explorations could lead to substantial growth, with a gas field discovery by Daewoo potentially producing for the next 20-25 years. China and India have signed deals with Burma for gas reserves estimated at 19 trillion cubic feet. Burma's gas reserves are estimated at 19 trillion cubic feet. China and India have signed deals with the SPDC to become primary customers for the gas. Russia's Zarubezhneft oil company also signed an agreement with the SPDC for investments in Burma's oil and gas industry. Burma earns between $1 billion and $2 billion annually from exports of illegal drugs. Burma earns between $1 billion and $2 billion annually from exports of illegal drugs, with most earnings going to drug traffickers connected to ethnic groups along Burma's borders. Burmese military officials also gain a substantial share of these earnings through taxes, fees, and allowing drug traffickers to invest in domestic businesses. Senior officials in the Burmese Government are not directly involved in the drug trade, according to U.S. State Department reports. The SPDC in Burma benefits from drug traffickers investing in domestic businesses, with military officers sometimes being partners. The traffickers deposit earnings into military-controlled banks, and officers often stash drug money in foreign accounts. The military has close ties with the Wa tribe, allowing them autonomy to produce drugs, leading to their dominance in the heroin trade. The Wa tribe became dominant in the heroin trade after an agreement with Burmese military officials in 2001. Opium production decreased while methamphetamine production and smuggling into Thailand increased. Wa earnings from methamphetamine sales were estimated at $300 million in 2002, and earnings from heroin smuggling were estimated at $250-$300 million. The agreement included profit sharing. The agreement between Burmese intelligence officials and Wa leaders involved profit sharing provisions, with the military possibly receiving up to 50% of Wa earnings from drug trafficking. ASEAN's \"constructive engagement\" policy limits the impact of international sanctions on Burma, with countries like Thailand and Singapore having significant economic interests in Burma. Singapore has investments in Burma, serves as a travel destination for the Burmese elite, and reportedly sold arms to Burma's military. Several ASEAN governments became more critical of Burma after the re-arrest of Aung Sann Suu Kyi in 2003, due to increasing democratization within the region. Malaysian and Indonesian officials intensified their criticisms of the SPDC, leading to the formation of an ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Caucus on Democracy in Myanmar. In 2005, ASEAN pressured Burma to implement political reforms or relinquish its chairmanship of ASEAN in 2006, which the SPDC eventually gave up. Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar's visit to Burma in 2006 as an ASEAN envoy to discuss democratic reforms yielded little progress. The special ASEAN envoy visited Burma to discuss democratic reforms but was not allowed to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi. ASEAN leaders emphasized that their assertiveness has limits and will not include economic sanctions against Burma. However, ASEAN called on China and India to encourage Myanmar to speed up reform measures. Indonesia suggested that China, India, and South Korea should use their aid and investments in Burma to push for democratic changes. Indonesia abstained from a U.N. Security Council vote in 2007 condemning the SPDC and calling for reforms. In September 2007, ASEAN leaders criticized the Burmese government but did not support the U.S.-EU effort for U.N. sanctions. ASEAN's reactions to the SPDC's 2008 announcements were cautiously positive. China's economic and military aid to Burma, along with its stance on Burma's internal affairs, played a significant role. China pledged unwavering support and opposed U.N. economic sanctions, as seen when it vetoed a U.S. resolution. China vetoed U.S. resolutions in the U.N. Security Council in 2007, arguing that Burma does not pose a threat to regional peace. Despite concerns over narcotics flow and internal issues, China has not publicly pressured the SPDC to release Aung San Suu Kyi. China's extensive role in Burma includes providing military aid, facilitating diplomatic meetings, and potentially seeking to facilitate a sustained U.S.-Burma dialogue. This involvement may have pressured the SPDC to announce a constitutional referendum and elections in 2008. China's involvement in Burma includes military aid, economic assistance, and significant investment in infrastructure projects. Chinese companies have invested in over 800 projects in Burma, with direct investment close to $3 billion. China is estimated to control more than 60% of the Burmese economy and has a large economic presence in the country, including an influx of Chinese migrants since 1995. Additionally, China is Burma's third largest trading partner. China's interest in Burma includes being its third largest trading partner, with projected bilateral trade close to $2 billion in 2007. China is also interested in Burma's natural gas and potential pipelines to transport resources to China. This has led to plans for oil and gas pipelines from Burma's coast to China, reducing reliance on sea routes. India's \"constructive engagement\" policy towards Burma is partly driven by China's growing role in the region. India's \"constructive engagement\" policy towards Burma includes agreements on aid, trade, and counter-insurgency cooperation. India also began selling arms to Burma in 2006 but later halted shipments after the crackdown on protests in 2007. Burma reestablished diplomatic relations and military links with North Korea, purchasing artillery and ammunition from them since the late 1990s. North Korea and Burma have engaged in military cooperation, with North Korean technicians visiting a Burmese naval base. North Korean ships and diplomats have been caught smuggling heroin from Burma. There are reports of Burma's interest in acquiring North Korean missiles and submarines. Speculation exists about potential collaboration on nuclear facilities, but evidence is lacking. The ruling elite in Burma, consisting of high-ranking military officers and their families, require significant income, including foreign exchange. The ruling elite in Burma, comprised of high-ranking military officers and their families, are involved in various business ventures and manage state corporations. They have sufficient income from domestic and foreign transactions, ensuring a high standard of living. The United States has imposed sanctions on Burma since 1988, including a suspension of aid and opposition to new loans. The United States imposed sanctions on Burma, including prohibiting new investments and banning imports and travel related to the Burmese government. Executive orders froze financial assets, prohibited business dealings, and barred travel to the U.S. for Burmese officials and businessmen. President Bush announced new sanctions on Burmese state-owned companies on May 1, 2008, following previous sanctions. He and First Lady Laura Bush criticized the SPDC after Cyclone Nargis, expressing a desire to help the Burmese people and promote a free society. Their statements were met with criticism from various groups. The United States has not had an Ambassador to Burma since 1992 due to human rights abuses. The State Department found Burmese officials profiting from drug production despite some efforts to limit it. Burma is on the U.S. list of uncooperative drug-producing countries. The Bush Administration focused on strengthening international sanctions against Burma and raised the issue at the APEC summit in November 2005. They also increased bilateral diplomacy with ASEAN countries, including Burma on the U.S. agenda for the first time. The Bush Administration included Burma on the U.S. bilateral agenda with China for the first time. They pushed for Burma to be placed on the U.N. Security Council agenda, leading to a private Security Council meeting in December 2005. The Administration proposed a formal resolution on Burma in the Security Council, calling for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners. The SPDC should allow full freedom of expression, political parties to operate freely, and start a political dialogue for a democratic transition. They should also stop military attacks on civilians, end human rights violations against ethnic minorities, and cooperate with international organizations. Despite U.S. diplomatic efforts, China and Russia vetoed a U.S. resolution in the U.N. Security Council in January 2007. The U.S. faced challenges in bringing the U.N. due to China's blockage of initiatives. In 2007, the Bush Administration engaged in diplomacy with China, agreeing to a meeting with a Burmese official. However, details of the meeting were not disclosed. The Administration had previously considered using sanctions as part of a \"road map\" process with the SPDC. Business groups were also involved in the discussions. The U.S. faced challenges in engaging the SPDC due to China's blockage of initiatives. Business groups and academic experts support lifting sanctions in response to positive measures by the SPDC. The State Department discussed resuming anti-narcotics aid when Aung San Suu Kyi was released in 2002, but faced strong opposition from the press and Congress. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill indicated a shift towards engagement with the SPDC in 2006. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill suggested a road map process in 2006 if the SPDC took specific actions, such as releasing political prisoners and Aung San Suu Kyi, and resuming dialogues with the opposition. However, Congress favored maintaining U.S. sanctions until major human rights abuses were terminated and fundamental political concessions were made for a democratic system. The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, renewed in 2006, requires the President to certify progress in ending human rights violations, releasing political prisoners, and allowing political freedoms for sanctions to be lifted. A Senate resolution urged the Bush Administration to secure a U.N. resolution for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and condemned atrocities by the Burmese army. U.S. human rights organizations and Burmese exile groups support these efforts. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 3890, passed in 2007, differ in names and provisions. Both versions ban the import of jade, rubies, and jewelry from Burma, while the Senate version also bans teak and hardwood timber imports. The Senate version lacks a key provision from the House version. The Senate version of H.R. 3890 does not include a key provision from the House version that prohibits \"United States persons\" from engaging in economic transactions with Burmese government entities under U.S. sanctions. It also requires the President to appoint a Special Representative for Burma to promote sanctions, dialogue with the government, and support NGOs in the region. The Special Representatives would consult with key government officials and assist the United Nations special envoy in securing the release of Burmese political prisoners and promoting dialogue between the SPDC and pro-democracy leaders, including Aung San Suu Kyi."
