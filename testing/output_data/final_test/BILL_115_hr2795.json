    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Yemen Security and Humanity Act\". Congress finds that Yemen has been plagued by violence and civil war since 2015, leading to a severe famine crisis affecting millions, primarily children. The conflict has destroyed public services, infrastructure, and the economy, exacerbating food insecurity in the country. According to the United Nations, a Yemeni child dies every ten minutes from malnutrition, diarrhea, or respiratory infections. Disease, war, and poverty in Yemen threaten US core values and strategic priorities in combating global terror. Food insecurity in weakly governed countries could destabilize nations important to US national security. Yemen imports 90 percent of its food through the port of Hodeida, currently controlled by the Houthis. The replacement of port cranes funded by the United States Agency for International Development after a bombing in August 2015 has not been delivered due to current conditions on the ground, hindering the rapid delivery of food. Relief organizations are concerned about the closure of the port. Relief organizations are worried that the closure of the port of Hodeida could worsen famine in Yemen as most humanitarian aid enters through that port. The sense of Congress is that addressing famine conditions in Yemen is crucial for national security interests, interventions should consider the impact on humanitarian operations, and bureaucratic procedures for humanitarian aid need urgent improvement. Coordination in famine-risk areas is emphasized. SEC. 4 amends the Global Food Security Act to facilitate coordination in famine-risk areas between USAID, UN OCHA, and US military personnel. SEC. 5 focuses on the US security and humanitarian support strategy for Yemen. SEC. 5 requires a report on US security and humanitarian interests in Yemen, including strategic objectives, coordination of civilian and military efforts, and diplomatic strategies with regional partners."
