The \"National Defense Oil Equity Act of 2003\" finds that Iraq has significant oil reserves, with 112 billion barrels of proven reserves and 220 billion barrels of probable resources. The United States, on the other hand, has 21 billion barrels of proven reserves, which have decreased by 20% since 1990. Despite consuming 25% of the world's oil supply, the US only holds 2.2% of the world's proven oil reserves. Foreign oil companies from various countries have contracts to develop Iraqi oil fields. The Administration is discussing plans to revive and expand Iraq's oil fields with experts, executives, and opposition leaders. US Special Forces have been monitoring the oil fields since 2002. Oil prices could rise to $45 per barrel due to a potential war in Iraq, with prices already increasing to $33 per barrel.
