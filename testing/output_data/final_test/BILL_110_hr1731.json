Sec. 401. Cultural resource challenge. Sec. 501. Progress on annual appropriations. Sec. 601. Reports assessing the national parks. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. The National Park Service faces chronic funding shortfalls, leading to operational funding deficits exceeding $800 million annually and a maintenance backlog of $4.5 to $6.8 billion. Without adequate resources, future generations will experience reduced visitor services. Future generations will receive diminished visitor services, experience a weakening National Park System, and inherit parks in worse condition than before due to chronic funding shortfalls. Congressional oversight and additional funding are necessary to address these issues effectively. Congress can improve national park operations by removing certain funding responsibilities from the appropriations process, enabling focus on fully funding core operations to eliminate deficits and maintenance backlogs by the National Park System's centennial anniversary. The Centennial Fund aims to preserve America's national parks by providing dedicated funding separate from the appropriations process. The National Park Centennial Fund, established in the Treasury, receives appropriations each fiscal year to fund programs for preserving national parks. Appropriations include amounts designated under the Internal Revenue Code and additional funds to meet the total amount specified in section 103. SEC. 102.

This designation must be made at the time of filing the tax return and in the manner prescribed by the Secretary. Overpayments designated in this way are treated as refunded.
