    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Science and Technology Emergency Mobilization Act\". It includes Congressional findings and purpose. The \"Science and Technology Emergency Mobilization Act\" acknowledges the valuable assistance provided by private-sector technology and science experts after 9/11. It highlights the need for a coordinated volunteer base to aid in future emergencies and minimize vulnerabilities. Efforts to develop and deploy innovative technologies for government emergency agencies would benefit from a designated contact point within the Federal Government for evaluating ideas. Creating compatible communication systems would enhance emergency response efforts for police, fire, and other personnel. The purpose of this Act is to reinforce ongoing efforts to mobilize America's technology and science capabilities in responding to terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and emergencies by creating a national emergency technology guard called the \"NET Guard.\" Some programs like CapWIN have made progress in improving communications interoperability among emergency service providers, but many states and localities still lack sufficient interoperability. The Act aims to establish a national emergency technology guard, known as \"NET Guard,\" comprising rapid response teams of volunteers with technology expertise at the local level. It also includes a national clearinghouse for innovative civilian technologies related to emergency prevention and response, along with a pilot program to enhance communications systems interoperability for fire, law enforcement, and emergency response agencies at the state level. The National Emergency Technology Guard, or \"NET Guard,\" is established under Section 3 of the Act. The President will designate a department to compile a database of nongovernmental technology and science experts to help counter terrorism. Additionally, procedures will be developed to encourage volunteers with expertise to team up with local and state agencies for disaster response. The designated department will help form local volunteer teams by connecting interested individuals. Criteria for team certification will include required expertise, equipment, training, and participation in emergency drills. The department will also handle team certification and credentials. The designated department will certify and issue credentials to NET Guard disaster response teams that meet established criteria. They can also suspend or terminate certification as deemed necessary. Compensation and expenses will be provided by the designated department. The designated department can authorize payment and provide compensation and travel expenses to NET Guard disaster response team members. The head of the department can also activate these teams in emergencies. The NET Guard volunteers can be assigned to work on technology projects to improve emergency preparedness and prevention, including database maintenance and access procedures. SEC. 4. CENTER FOR CIVILIAN HOMELAND SECURITY TECHNOLOGY EVALUATION. The President will establish a Center for Civilian Homeland Security Technology Evaluation to evaluate and serve as a national clearinghouse for innovative technologies related to security and emergency preparedness. The Center will intake, evaluate, and provide timely responses to inquiries about new technologies, as well as consult with Federal agencies on technology development and deployment. The Center for Civilian Homeland Security Technology Evaluation will evaluate and serve as a national clearinghouse for innovative technologies related to security and emergency preparedness. It will provide individuals and companies with the ability to track the status of their technology submissions online. The Center may be modeled after the Technical Support Working Group for coordinating research and development of technologies for combating terrorism. The President will create an online portal for individuals and companies to access the Center and contact Federal agencies participating in it. The Center portal will provide access to open solicitations and points of contact for submission of proposals. It will include safeguards for protecting proprietary information and personally identifiable information. Technology submission to the Center is not required for procurement by Federal agencies. SEC. 5. COMMUNICATIONS INTEROPERABILITY PILOT PROJECTS. The President will establish a pilot program for interoperable communications systems for emergency response agencies. Grants of $5,000,000 each will be given to seven States for pilot projects. Criteria for eligibility, fund use assurance, and reporting requirements will be determined by the head of the department, agency, or office overseeing the program. The head of the department, agency, or office will consult with existing projects on public safety communications interoperability for best practices and lessons learned. SEC. 6. REPORTS. Within a year of this Act's enactment, the President must designate a department to submit a report to Congress on policy options for ensuring emergency officials and first responders have reliable wireless communication. The report will consider priority access for government officials to commercial wireless systems. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, in consultation with other agencies, must submit a report on barriers to accepting technology donations during emergencies within a year of the Act's enactment. Authorization of appropriations for various emergency technology programs is outlined in the Act. $5,000,000 is authorized for the National Emergency Technology Guard for fiscal years 2003 and 2004. Additionally, $35,000,000 is authorized for pilot programs in fiscal year 2003, and $500,000 is authorized for a report in the same year. SEC. 8. EMERGENCY RESPONSE AGENCIES. The term \"emergency response agency\" includes agencies providing Law Enforcement, Fire, Emergency Medical, Public Safety Communications, and Emergency Preparedness services. Passed the Senate on July 18, 2002."
