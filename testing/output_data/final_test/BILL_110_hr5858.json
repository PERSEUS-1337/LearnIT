    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Combating Climate Change Through Individual Action Act of 2008\". Congress acknowledges the importance of agricultural, grassland, and forestry practices in capturing atmospheric carbon and promoting natural carbon sinks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These practices include improved grassland management, tree planting, forest preservation, and agronomic and irrigation enhancements. Large potentials exist through known cropping and land management practices such as adoption of no-till, reduced fallow, use of cover crops, and conservation set-asides with perennial grasses and trees. SEC. 3. CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND SOIL CONSERVATION CREDIT. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a new section on carbon sequestration and soil conservation. The new section on carbon sequestration and soil conservation introduces a tax credit for farmers. The credit is 30% of qualified carbon sequestration and soil conservation expenses, not exceeding $10,000 per year. The tax credit for farmers covers expenses incurred for carbon sequestration and soil conservation, including conservation tillage, cover cropping, nitrogen use efficiency, and multiple year rotations with perennial crops. Conservation tillage expenditures involve methods where at least 30% of previous crop residue remains on the soil. The term 'cover cropping expenditures' refers to expenses for preparing and seeding land with grass, legume, or small grain crops that are not the primary crop of the taxpayer. The primary purpose is to reduce erosion, improve soil fertility, and conserve water. Various tilling practices like no till, ridge till, minimum till, and mulch till are included in conservation tillage methods where 30% of previous crop residue remains on the soil. The Secretary will establish a per acre credit alternative for carbon sequestration and soil conservation in farming, with credit amounts not exceeding $15 per acre. The Secretary will establish a per acre credit alternative for carbon sequestration and soil conservation in farming, with credit amounts not exceeding $15 per acre. An election to use this alternative method must be made in the form and manner prescribed by the Secretary, applying to the taxable year it is made and all subsequent years. Land used in farming is defined as land used for crop production or livestock sustenance before or simultaneously with the described expenditures. Expenditures for livestock sustenance must align with a soil conservation plan approved by the Soil Conservation Service or a comparable State agency. Any credit determined for such expenditures will not result in an increase in property basis. The carbon sequestration and soil conservation credit reduces property basis for qualifying expenditures and cannot be used for double benefits. The credit will not apply to taxable years after December 31, 2013, and is included in the general business credit under section 38 of the tax code. The tax code is amended to include adjustments to basis under section 1016 and a new provision under section 45O(e) for carbon sequestration and soil conservation credit. The tax code is amended to include a new section 30D for qualified planting expenditure credit, effective for expenditures after December 31, 2008. The tax code is amended to allow a credit against the tax for qualified planting expenditures, limited to $5,000 for principal residence, $50,000 for business, and zero for other cases. The tax code allows a credit for qualifying planting expenditures, including the purchase and planting of trees, plants, shrubs, bushes, and vegetated roof systems. Expenditures must meet specific requirements to qualify for the credit. The tax code allows a credit for qualifying planting expenditures, including vegetated roof systems, with specific requirements to qualify. The vegetation must be quick-growing, region-appropriate, and effective in capturing carbon. The credit cannot exceed the excess of the regular tax liability reduced by other allowable credits over the tentative minimum tax for the year. The tax code allows a credit for qualifying planting expenditures, including vegetated roof systems, with specific requirements to qualify. The credit cannot exceed the excess of the regular tax liability reduced by other allowable credits over the tentative minimum tax for the year. Definitions and rules regarding principal residence, joint occupancy, cooperative housing corporations, condominium management associations, and expenditures outside the United States are outlined. Basis adjustment is also addressed for expenditures eligible for the credit. The tax code allows a credit for qualifying planting expenditures, including vegetated roof systems. Basis adjustment for eligible expenditures is addressed, with a termination of the section for taxable years after December 31, 2013. Conforming amendments are made to section 1016 and the table of sections for subpart B of part IV of the tax code. The tax code allows a credit for qualifying planting expenditures, including vegetated roof systems, with amendments effective after December 31, 2008. Additionally, a grassland, rangeland, and forest conservation credit is introduced. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, will establish a tax credit for converting cropland to pasture or grassland, and for reforestation and afforestation of land not used for commercial timber production. The credit will be per acre. The Secretary will establish credit amounts per acre for conservation methods approved in a plan submitted by the taxpayer and approved by the Secretaries of the Treasury and Agriculture. The credit amount will be based on the method's effectiveness in sequestering carbon and preventing soil erosion, related expenditures, and the number of years the land will remain under the approved plan. The Secretary will establish credit amounts per acre for approved conservation methods based on effectiveness in sequestering carbon and preventing soil erosion. The credit can be recaptured if the property is not used according to the approved plan, and rules are in place to avoid double benefits. The credit applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2008. The Secretary of the Treasury will study any significant changes in the carbon sequestration market and submit a report to Congress with recommendations for modifying credits based on the results."
