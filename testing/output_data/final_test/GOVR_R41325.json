    "content": "Congressional interest in carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) has increased as a strategy to reduce CO2 emissions without changing reliance on fossil fuels. The success of CCS in the US depends on widespread deployment of CO2 capture technology. The success of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) in the United States hinges on the widespread deployment of CO2 capture technology. This report analyzes the factors affecting the cost of current CO2 capture technologies and advanced systems, as well as efforts to commercialize other advanced technologies like sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) capture to reduce air pollution. The transportation and storage aspects of CCS are less technology-dependent than capture, but their costs could still be significant, depending on regulatory frameworks for long-term CO2 injection and storage. The report by Carnegie Mellon University examines the technological development and regulatory framework for long-term CO2 injection and storage for CCS deployment. It also discusses public acceptance, emerging technologies, and past experiences to shape energy policy. Led by Edward S. Rubin, the assessment was part of a multiyear project on U.S. energy. The report funded by the Joyce Foundation examines CO2 capture technologies as part of a multiyear project on U.S. energy policy. It includes 10 chapters and was led by Edward S. Rubin from Carnegie Mellon University. The material is current as of July 19, 2010 and will not be updated. This report focuses on the atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from power plants and industrial sources, specifically the CO2 capture process. It assesses technologies for post-combustion capture using solvents like MEA and ammonia, pre-combustion capture from coal gasification, and oxy-combustion capture using high-purity oxygen in coal power plants. CO2 can be captured without a post-combustion chemical process. Post-combustion, pre-combustion, and oxy-combustion capture technologies are used for gas stream purification in industrial processes. Oxy-combustion capture is still under development. These methods have high CO2 capture efficiencies but are costly and energy-intensive. Plans for their development are discussed in the report. At present, there are no full-scale applications of CO2 capture on coal-fired or gas-fired power plants. Large-scale demonstration projects are planned or underway to address this lack of capabilities. These projects, along with R&D activities, aim to develop lower-cost capture systems. Development of lower-cost CO2 capture systems is a key focus in the United States and globally. Five stages of development are outlined: conceptual designs, laboratory scale, pilot plant scale, full-scale demonstration plants, and commercial processes. Current R&D activities include testing new solvents and exploring breakthrough technologies like novel solvents, sorbents, membranes, and oxyfuel systems for more cost-effective capture systems. Most of these technologies are still in early stages of development. The development of lower-cost CO2 capture systems is a key focus globally. Current R&D activities are focused on new solvents and breakthrough technologies for more cost-effective capture systems. Many of these technologies are still in early stages of research and development, with credible estimates of performance and cost lacking at this time. Advanced solvent formulations and pilot-scale oxy-combustion processes are being tested and evaluated for potential commercial use in the near future. Installing pilot plants to evaluate pre-combustion capture options with a focus on cost reduction rather than efficiency gains. R&D programs aim for lower-cost retrofit technologies for existing power plants, which also apply to new plants. The availability of advanced CO2 capture systems for commercial rollout and cost reduction are key questions for both new and existing power plants. The report reviews technology roadmaps predicting commercial availability of advanced CO2 capture systems by 2020, including novel, lower-cost technologies like solid sorbent systems. Aggressive efforts are needed to advance these concepts to reality. The development of advanced CO2 capture technologies, similar to past R&D programs for SO2 and NOx capture, faces challenges. Previous efforts took decades to bring new concepts to market, with costs often increasing over time. The lack of a significant market for novel technologies further complicates their adoption. Despite the risks, there is potential for cost reductions based on past experiences. Future cost reductions for CO2 capture technologies are expected based on past experiences with environmental technologies. Costs tend to decrease over time, as seen with SO2 and NOx capture systems, which declined by 50% after about two decades of deployment. Other factors like power plant design and efficiency improvements can also lower the unit cost of CO2 capture. Future cost reductions for CO2 capture technologies are expected based on past experiences with environmental technologies. Recent studies by the U.S. Department of Energy foresee a 27% and 31% cost reduction for advanced PC and IGCC power plants with CO2 capture. However, there is uncertainty in cost estimates for technologies not yet commercial, with more reliable estimates linked to expected commercial deployment. Future cost reductions for CO2 capture systems are closely tied to their level of commercial deployment, which serves as a measure of their market size. Government actions or policies are necessary to create markets for these systems, either through regulations or incentives like tax credits. The technical literature and historical evidence suggest that cost reductions for CO2 capture systems are linked to their commercial deployment levels. Future technology costs, including R&D expenditures and knowledge gained through learning-by-doing and learning-by-using, are projected to decrease by 30% for electricity from power plants with CO2 capture after 100,000 MW of capacity is installed globally. This reduction would bring the cost and efficiency of these plants close to those without capture, similar to the deployment timeline of SO2 capture systems at coal-fired power plants following the 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments. The key insight for improved carbon capture technology is that achieving cost reductions will require vigorous R&D and commercial deployment. Government actions are needed to establish a market for CO2 capture technologies. Incentive programs can accelerate development, but significant emissions limitations are ultimately necessary for substantial progress. Global climate change is a major international concern, with a focus on reducing CO2 emissions through carbon capture and storage technology. The need for substantial emission reductions from electric power plants is crucial to avoid serious climate impacts. This technology has gained worldwide interest due to the consensus on the necessity of reducing global CO2 emissions to combat climate change. Large emission reductions cannot be achieved easily or quickly by using less energy or replacing fossil fuels with alternative sources. The world relies on fossil fuels for over 85% of its energy use. CCS offers a way to reduce CO2 emissions from power plants and industrial sources until sustainable technologies are widely deployed. Adding CCS to other GHG reduction measures significantly lowers the cost of mitigating climate change. Studies show that by 2030, CCS is a major component of cost-effective emission reduction strategies. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an industrial process where CO2 from fossil fuels or biomass is captured, compressed, and stored underground. CCS is not yet widely used in large-scale applications like power plants due to high costs, mainly from CO2 capture and compression. Research programs are working on developing more cost-effective methods for CO2 capture. This information is intended to assist the U.S. Congress in analyzing national policy on climate change. The objective is to provide information to the U.S. Congress on national policy regarding climate change, focusing on realistic assessments of improved, lower-cost CO2 capture systems for power plants and industrial processes. The report discusses three current approaches to CO2 capture: post-combustion chemical treatment, pre-combustion chemical removal, and oxyfuel combustion. Issues related to CO2 transport and storage are not covered in this report. The study investigates research in the United States and elsewhere to assess the evolution of current technologies for CO2 capture, including potential breakthrough technologies such as advanced catalysts and novel solvents. It aims to provide Congress with an understanding of the research status, from concept to pilot scale, and the potential for efficiency gains and cost reductions in CO2 capture technologies. Chapter 3 provides an overview of CO2 capture technologies and their application to new and existing facilities, including current costs. Chapter 4 discusses the five stages of technological development for CO2 capture technologies. Chapter 5, 6, and 7 focus on the status of post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture, and other related topics. Chapter 6: Status of Pre-Combustion Capture, Chapter 7: Status of Oxy-Combustion Capture, and Chapter 8: Cost and Deployment Outlook for Advanced Capture Systems discuss the current status and challenges of CO2 capture technologies. Chapter 9: Lessons from Past Experience reflects on past technology innovation and deployment for controlling power plant pollutants. Chapter 10: Discussion and Conclusions summarizes key findings and conclusions from the study on carbon capture systems. Various technologies for capturing CO2 from gas mixtures are available, with the choice depending on product purity requirements and gas stream conditions. Common applications include removing CO2 impurities in natural gas treatment and industrial chemical production. The captured CO2 stream is typically vented to the atmosphere in most cases. In most cases, captured CO2 is either vented to the atmosphere or used in the manufacture of other chemicals. It can also be sold as a commodity to nearby industries. CO2 capture technologies are classified as pre-combustion or post-combustion systems, depending on when carbon is removed. Oxyfuel or oxy-combustion is a third approach that does not require a CO2 capture device and is still under development. Oxy-combustion is a concept still under development that does not require a CO2 capture device. Industrial processes aim to produce pure CO2 for storage in geological formations by compressing it to a supercritical state for transportation and injection underground. This process captures CO2 from flue gases after burning fossil fuels or carbonaceous materials. In modern coal-fired power plants, combustion of pulverized coal with air generates steam to drive a turbine-generator. The combustion gases contain nitrogen, water vapor, and CO2, along with pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that need to be removed to meet emission standards. Additional removal of pollutants may be necessary for CO2 capture. Post-combustion CO2 capture technology involves scrubbing flue gas with an organic solvent like monoethanolamine in an absorber to capture 85-90% of CO2. The CO2-laden solvent is then regenerated in a separate vessel using heat to release the CO2, which is then compressed and stored. This technology can be used in coal-fired power plants as well as natural gas-fired boilers or combined cycle power plants. For post-combustion CO2 capture at natural gas-fired boilers or combined cycle power plants, high removal efficiencies can be achieved with amine-based capture systems due to the clean flue gas stream. To remove carbon from fuel before combustion, coal is reacted with steam and oxygen to produce synthesis gas, which can be burned for power generation. The integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power generation process involves converting coal into synthesis gas (syngas) consisting of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The syngas is then processed to remove impurities and convert carbon monoxide to CO2, leaving a stream of nearly pure hydrogen. This hydrogen is burned in a combined cycle power plant to generate electricity, with CO2 captured using a chemical solvent like Selexol. Despite the elaborate fuel conversion steps, CO2 separation is easier and cheaper in IGCC plants due to high operating pressure and CO2 concentration. Pre-combustion capture is a method that involves physical adsorption of CO2 onto a solvent surface, followed by release when the sorbent pressure is dropped. This process is used in power plants using natural gas to produce hydrogen. The hydrogen can be burned to generate electricity, with CO2 captured in a pre-combustion capture system. In an IGCC plant, pre-combustion capture is used for CO2 capture, which can be more costly than post-combustion capture for natural gas-fired plants. Oxy-combustion systems are being developed as an alternative for coal-fired power plants, using pure oxygen for combustion to eliminate nitrogen in the flue gas. The resulting flue gas consists mainly of water vapor and CO2, with some pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. The CO2 stream can be easily separated after removing pollutants. Oxy-combustion uses pure oxygen for combustion to eliminate nitrogen in the flue gas, resulting in a nearly pure CO2 stream for storage. This method avoids the need for costly post-combustion CO2 capture but requires an air separation unit (ASU) to generate the oxygen. Additional flue gas processing may be necessary to reduce air pollutants and meet environmental standards. The high combustion temperatures with pure oxygen also require additional measures for compliance and purity specifications. Oxy-combustion with pure oxygen requires recycling a large portion of inert flue gas to maintain normal temperatures and prevent air leakage. Various designs have been proposed for commercial systems, but the capture efficiency is around 90% due to additional gas treatment systems. Studies have been conducted on oxy-combustion at laboratory and pilot plant scales, but not yet at a commercial level. Gas treatment systems reduce capture efficiency to about 90% in most current oxy-combustion designs. Oxy-combustion can be applied to natural gas or distillate oil power plants but would require costly modifications to current equipment. The focus of oxy-combustion development is on coal-fired power plants due to energy requirements being 10 to 100 times higher than other environmental control systems. This energy \"penalty\" lowers plant efficiency and increases CO2 capture costs. Post-combustion capture on PC plants is the most energy-intensive method, requiring nearly twice the energy of pre-combustion capture on an IGCC plant. This results in lower plant efficiency, increased solid waste production, and the need for more chemicals to control emissions. Plant water use also rises significantly due to additional cooling water requirements. Despite removing 90% of CO2, the net emissions reduction per kilowatt-hour is typically around 85%. Replacing old, inefficient power plants with new, more efficient units with CO2 capture can lead to a net efficiency gain and decreased emissions. Innovations in power generation efficiency can also reduce the impacts and costs of carbon capture. The energy requirements for PC and IGCC plants are divided between electricity for operation and thermal energy for solvent regeneration or the water-gas shift reaction. Recent cost estimates for power plants and industrial processes show that thermal energy requirements are the main source of power losses, especially for solvent regeneration and the water-gas shift reaction. In oxy-combustion systems, the energy needed for oxygen production is a significant contributor to the energy penalty. Benchmarking the cost of current systems is essential to assess the potential benefits of carbon capture technology. Studies indicate the cost of electricity generation from new power plants with and without CCS, capturing and sequestering 90% of CO2 emissions. The total cost of electricity generation is shown in dollars per megawatt-hour ($/MWh) based on current commercial capture processes. The cost of electricity generation (COE) for power plants burning bituminous coal or natural gas is influenced by the CO2 emission rate. The majority of the cost is for capture, with factors like plant efficiency, size, fuel quality, and operating hours affecting costs. Assumptions about design and operation of the power plant and capture technology also impact overall costs. The cost of CO2 capture varies based on different assumptions and factors such as plant efficiency and fuel type. Estimates show that CCS can increase electricity generation costs by 30% to 80% at new coal plants. The cost per tonne of CO2 avoided is equivalent to the \"carbon price\" and ranges from $30 to $70/MWh for different plant types. The CO2 capture step makes up the majority (80% to 90%) of this cost. The cost of CO2 capture varies depending on plant type and fuel source. For new supercritical coal plants, the cost is around $60-$80/tonne CO2, while for IGCC plants it is $30-$50/tonne CO2. Comparing an IGCC plant with capture to a SCPC plant without capture, the cost is roughly $40-$60/tonne CO2. Costs are lower if the captured CO2 can be sold for enhanced oil recovery. Retrofitting existing power plants with a capture system depends on site-specific factors. The cost of retrofitting a CO2 capture system for existing power plants depends on factors like plant size, age, efficiency, and type of existing air pollution control systems. The added cost of electricity generation is higher for existing plants compared to new supercritical plants due to lower thermal efficiency, resulting in a larger energy penalty and higher capital cost per unit of capacity. Other factors include added capital costs, physical constraints, site access difficulties, and the need for upgrades or additional equipment. Studies show that the cost per ton of CO2 avoided increases for existing plants. The most cost-effective strategy for existing plants with access to geological storage areas is to combine CO2 capture with a major plant upgrade, known as repowering. This involves replacing the existing subcritical unit with a high-efficiency boiler and steam turbine system or a gasification combined cycle system. The cost of CO2 capture approaches that of a new plant in these cases, with potential savings from using existing plant components and infrastructure. Studies on CO2 capture costs for industrial processes other than power plants are limited, with the incremental cost being lowest for processes where CO2 is already separated as part of normal operations. The cost of CO2 capture for industrial processes varies depending on site-specific factors. Construction costs for power plants and industrial equipment increased significantly from 2004 to 2008, along with fuel prices. Uncertainty about future cost trends and the lack of full-scale projects make it challenging to determine the true cost of facilities with or without CCS. Experience with IGCC power plants is limited, and neither PC nor IGCC plants with CCS have been operated at full scale yet. Neither PC nor IGCC plants with CCS have been built and operated at full scale, leading to uncertainty in the absolute and relative costs of these systems. The technological development of carbon capture systems ranges from current commercial systems to new concepts or processes that are still in early stages of development. These advanced technologies aim for higher effectiveness and lower costs compared to current systems, but their performance and costs are inherently uncertain as they advance towards commercialization. The chapter discusses ways to characterize the technological development of CO2 capture systems towards commercialization. It outlines the stages of technological change: Invention, Innovation, Adoption, and Diffusion. These stages are crucial in bringing new technologies to commercial reality. The new technology Diffusion involves increasing adoption and use of the technology. Innovation refers to the creation of a commercially offered product or process, which may or may not be widely adopted. The four stages of technological change - Invention, Innovation, Adoption, and Diffusion - are interactive and influenced by R&D support, early adopters' experiences, and knowledge gained as technology spreads in the marketplace. The reductions in product cost as a technology matures reflect the impacts of sustained R&D and \"learning by doing\" and \"learning by using\". This report focuses on the current status and future outlook of carbon capture technologies at different levels of development. Later discussions will cover the influence of adoption and diffusion on innovation and lower-cost capture technologies. The maturity of a technology is assessed using Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), with nine levels ranging from basic principles to successful operation in its environment. TRLs are used to evaluate technology maturity and risks for deployment. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that commercial firms wait until technology reaches TRL 8 or TRL 9 before integrating it into products. Projects using unproven technologies tend to be behind schedule and over budget. DOE's Office of Management published a Technology Readiness Assessment Guide for developing critical technologies. TRLs now include lab scale, bench scale, engineering scale, and full scale. The technology readiness levels (TRLs) categorize the development stages of carbon capture technologies, ranging from lab scale to full scale. TRLs 2 and 3 are considered lab scale, TRL 4 is bench scale, TRLs 5 and 6 are engineering scale, and TRL 7 and beyond are full scale. This report uses a simplified five-category system to describe the maturity of carbon capture technologies, reflecting different levels of maturity and physical size and complexity at various development points. The maturity of carbon capture technologies is categorized into five stages, with significant financial commitments required to advance. A commercial technology at TRL 9 is available for routine use in applications like power plants, meeting standard commercial guarantees. This level of maturity is necessary for electric utility companies to install carbon capture systems in U.S. power plants. The full-scale demonstration stage for carbon capture systems at U.S. power plants corresponds to TRL levels 7 and 8. It involves integrating CO2 capture technology into a full-size system to demonstrate its viability and commercial readiness. This stage typically involves power plants with a gross size of around 250 MW and a CO2 capture rate of 1-2 million tonnes per year for coal-fired plants. The pilot plant stage for carbon capture processes involves testing the technology at a smaller scale than full-scale demonstration, typically one to two orders of magnitude smaller. Pilot plants gather data to refine processes and design larger demonstration plants, representing TRL levels 6 and 7. At the early stage of process development, bench scales are used to construct and operate an apparatus in a controlled environment. These scales simulate commercial processes using materials and test gases. Laboratory-scale experiments validate specific components of a system, while conceptual designs for CO2 capture processes are tested with computer models before any physical prototypes are built. This allows for process optimization before progressing to more expensive laboratory work. The conceptual design stage involves process optimization before moving to the laboratory or bench-scale stage. This stage corresponds to levels 1 and 2 on the TRL scale. The next chapters discuss the current status of carbon capture technologies, focusing on post-combustion, pre-combustion, and oxy-combustion systems. The chapter also addresses cost reductions and commercialization timelines for advanced capture systems. Post-combustion CO2 capture technologies are summarized, with advanced systems using amine-based solvents and early-stage processes exploring novel solvents, solid sorbents, and membranes for CO2 capture. The chapter discusses the development of novel solvents, solid sorbents, and membranes for CO2 capture. It highlights the rapid expansion of carbon capture R&D programs worldwide and synthesizes key findings from various investigations. The report does not aim to cover all capture-related R&D activities comprehensively but draws upon publicly available databases and CCS project status reports. The chapter discusses the development of novel solvents, solid sorbents, and membranes for CO2 capture, drawing upon publicly available databases and CCS project status reports from organizations like DOE/NETL, IEAGHG, MIT, and GCCSI. It aims to summarize the current status of post-combustion capture technology developments, potential advantages, key technical barriers, and challenges to advance the method. Brief descriptions of new processes or capture methods are also provided. Post-combustion CO2 capture systems using amines have been commercially used for decades in various industries. Several vendors offer amine-based processes like Fluor Daniel Econamine FG Plus, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries KM-CDR, and others. These systems typically vent captured CO2 to the atmosphere. Among the projects listed, some are at natural gas treatment plants in Norway and Algeria, where CO2 is captured and stored in geological formations. The Statoil natural gas facility at Sleipner has been operating since 1996, making it the longest-running commercial CCS project. CO2 capture also occurs at coal-fired and gas-fired power plants, with amine systems installed at U.S. power plants for this purpose. The oldest and largest commercial CO2 capture system operates at the IMC Global soda ash plant in California, where CO2 is combined with trona to produce sodium carbonate. ABB Lummus, Fluor Daniel, and MHI have commercial CO2 capture units at coal-fired and gas-fired power plants, using amine-based solvents for capture. Currently operating CO2 capture systems use amine-based solvents with proprietary compositions. Lummus systems use 20% MEA in water, while Fluor systems use a solvent with 30% amine concentration. Higher amine concentrations reduce energy penalties and capital costs, but require chemical additives or costly construction materials to prevent corrosion. Different vendors offer capture system designs with tradeoffs in factors like solvent concentration. Commercial systems by Fluor and MHI boast reductions of roughly 25% in CO2 capture. No full-scale demonstrations of post-combustion CO2 capture have occurred yet, despite calls for such projects in Europe and the United States. Systems offered by Fluor and MHI boast a 25% reduction in capture energy requirements compared to older designs. Demonstrations at full scale are crucial for gaining acceptance of this technology by electric utility companies and regulatory institutions. No full-scale demonstrations of post-combustion CO2 capture have occurred yet, despite high costs and cancellations of previous projects. However, it is expected that some large-scale projects for CO2 capture will materialize in the next few years, with costs shared between the public and private sectors. Table 6 lists major announced demonstration projects for CO2 capture at power plants in the US and other countries. Most projects involve installing capture systems at existing coal-fired plants, with captured CO2 transported via pipeline for storage. Some projects use amine-based systems, while others use ammonia-based processes. Scale-up plans depend on successful operation of pilot plants, with most demonstration projects expected to start in 2014 or later. DOE plans to support demonstration projects for CO2 capture at power plants and industrial facilities. Projects are in early design stages with no final funding commitments yet. Pilot-scale projects are testing new amine-based solvents for CO2 capture. Several research groups are developing ammonia-based capture processes using a class of solvents called amines, which are organic compounds with an \"amino\" group in their chemical structures. MEA, a type of amine, has fast reaction times and can remove high percentages of CO2 but has drawbacks like high corrosivity and energy requirements for regeneration. Various groups are working on synthesizing amine mixtures and designer amines with more desirable properties for CO2 capture. One major focus in developing ammonia-based CO2 capture processes is to lower the energy needed for solvent regeneration, impacting process costs. However, reducing regeneration energy may increase the amount of solvent and absorber size required, raising capital costs. Pilot plant projects are evaluating tradeoffs and optimizing the process, with a 2005 study suggesting ammonia-based capture shows promise pending engineering challenges. The potential cost advantages of an ammonia-based system for CO2 capture are promising, with the ability to capture multiple pollutants simultaneously. Early estimates suggested a significant reduction in energy penalty compared to amine systems, but subsequent testing did not substantiate these claims. Ammonia's higher volatility allows for easier release into the flue gas stream. The development of ammonia-based capture technology has advanced to the pilot plant stage, with plans to scale up to commercial sizes. In the chilled ammonia process by Alstom, the flue gas and CO2 absorber are cooled to prevent ammonia slip, using ammonium carbonate to capture CO2. The chilled ammonia process by Alstom uses carbonate to capture CO2, with a rich CO2 stream sent to a stripper column for separation. The energy required for regeneration is lower than amine systems, but there are tradeoffs between cooling energy and ammonia slip reduction. Optimization is needed for best performance at minimum cost. Alstom's chilled ammonia process for CO2 capture is being tested in pilot plants in the US and Norway. The pilot plant at AEP Mountaineer power station in West Virginia is the first successful integration of CO2 capture, transport, and geological sequestration at a coal-fired power plant. Data from this pilot plant will inform the proposed demonstration plant. Powerspan's ECO process uses ammonia to capture SO2 and NOx from power plant flue gas streams. Powerspan expanded the ECO process in 2005 to capture CO2 using ammonium carbonate. The ECO 2 process operates at a higher temperature and uses ammonium sulfate to control ammonia slip. Ammonia does not degrade in the presence of acid gases like SO2 and NO2, forming valuable fertilizer by-products. Powerspan is testing the ECO 2 process at a 1 MW pilot plant at First Energy's R. E. Burger plant. A variety of new processes and materials for post-combustion CO2 capture are in early stages of development, including liquid solvents, solid adsorbents, and membranes. These approaches have the potential to reduce costs and improve efficiency compared to current systems, but their success in commercial applications is uncertain at this point. Many new approaches for post-combustion CO2 capture are in early development stages, including liquid solvents that selectively absorb CO2. Challenges remain in developing these materials into viable and economical capture technologies. The aim of solvent research is to develop new solvents with improved CO2 capture capacity and other desirable characteristics. These include faster reaction rates, thermal and oxidative stability, and lower regeneration energy and corrosivity. Most solvents have a mix of good and bad properties, so research focuses on finding optimal blends. Table 9 summarizes the advantages and challenges of liquid solvent-based approaches for post-combustion CO2 capture. Promising solvents include new amine formulations, carbonates, blends of amines and carbonates, and ionic liquids. Piperazine is a new amine with faster kinetics and lower energy requirements than MEA. Potassium carbonate solvents are being studied for CO2 capture, with efforts to improve absorption rates through blending. Researchers are exploring ways to speed up CO2 absorption by blending potassium carbonate with amines, showing promising results. Ionic liquids, with low vapor pressure, can absorb CO2 and SO2 at high temperatures with low regeneration energy requirements. Georgia Tech Research Corporation is developing reversible ionic liquids that chemically react with CO2 for enhanced absorption. Solid sorbents capture CO2 on their surfaces and release it through temperature or pressure changes for regeneration, offering energy savings over liquid solvents. However, efficiently transferring heat into and out of solid sorbents remains a challenge. Solid sorbents capture CO2 on their surfaces and release it through temperature or pressure changes for regeneration, offering energy savings over liquid solvents. Efficiently transferring heat into and out of solid sorbents remains a challenge, along with the need for durable sorbents with efficient materials handling schemes and increased CO2 carrying capacity. The aim of solid sorbent research is to reduce the cost of CO2 capture by designing sorbents with lower regeneration energy requirements, faster reaction rates, and minimum pressure drops. The effectiveness of different absorber designs utilizing solid sorbents is still being determined. Researchers are focusing on designing sorbents with high surface area for CO2 capture, which can involve chemical or physical surface interactions. Solid sorbents like supported amines and carbonates work through chemical mechanisms, while materials like activated carbon, zeolites, and metal organic frameworks rely on physical interactions. Supported amines offer benefits similar to liquid solvents but require less energy for regeneration. These sorbents can be physically supported by materials like activated carbon. Current research is focused on developing sorbents with high CO2 carrying capacities, such as activated carbon and sodium carbonate-based sorbents. Issues of thermal stability and fouling are being addressed, with a focus on a CO2 capture system using a sodium carbonate-based sorbent for power plants. Carbon-based adsorbents like activated carbon are attractive due to their low cost and ability to readily adsorb CO2. Researchers are working on a Carbon Filter Process that can potentially capture 90% of flue gas CO2. The Carbon Filter Process has the potential to capture 90% of flue gas CO2 and regenerate it with high purity at a lower cost than other processes. Metal organic frameworks and zeolites are also being explored for CO2 capture, with zeolites being combined with amines for improved performance. Solid sorbent-based approaches to post-combustion CO2 capture offer better performance than current amine systems but are more complex and difficult to scale up due to handling large amounts of solids. Sorbents need high selectivity for CO2 and must be insensitive to trace impurities in flue gas. Multiple contacting stages may be necessary for high CO2 capture efficiencies, increasing process costs. Current R&D programs aim to address these challenges. Membranes are porous materials that selectively separate CO2 from gas streams, acting as a filter to allow only CO2 to pass through. Membranes selectively separate CO2 from gas streams by allowing only CO2 to pass through. The driving force is a pressure differential across the membrane, determining selectivity and permeability. Selectivity to CO2 over N2 determines the purity of the captured CO2 stream, while permeability reflects the membrane surface area needed for separation. Researchers at the University of Mexico are working on incorporating amine functional groups into membrane materials to improve CO2 selectivity. Another research area involves gas absorption membranes where CO2 is selectively absorbed by a liquid solvent. Biomimetic membranes using processes found in nature, such as carbonic anhydrase enzyme, are also being explored for CO2 separation. The liquid membrane system catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase developed by Carbozyme Inc. shows potential for reducing energy penalty and cost in CO2 capture. However, challenges like membrane fouling and scale-up to power plant applications remain. Membranes currently lack the selectivity needed to compete with amine-based systems for post-combustion CO2 capture. Additional challenges include the need for large surface areas, limited temperature ranges, low tolerance to impurities, and high parasitic requirements. Despite challenges such as impurities and high energy requirements, membranes are supported for post-combustion CO2 capture. Favre (2007) believes engineering solutions can address these challenges, especially in industries with higher CO2 concentrations like cement and steel. Membrane-based separation could be more competitive with amines in such applications, especially in power plants using oxygen-enriched air to increase CO2 concentration in flue gas. This stage involves engineering analyses or computer-based modeling studies of novel capture technology concepts lacking experimental data for verification. Research is ongoing on novel approaches to carbon capture, including the development of ultra-high surface area porous materials like metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and porous organic polymers. These materials have tunable properties that can maximize CO2 capture performance, but further testing under realistic conditions is needed. Hybrid approaches to new solvents and sorbents aim to combine components to mitigate undesirable properties. For example, some CO2 capture solvents become viscous when interacting with CO2, but supporting the solvent on a membrane or solid sorbent can solve this issue. Solid sorbents face challenges in heat transfer during regeneration, but immobilizing them on a solid support material can improve efficiency. These hybrid approaches offer solutions to enhance carbon capture technologies. Hybrid approaches in carbon capture technologies aim to combine components to improve efficiency. The cost of these systems compared to single-component systems is uncertain, with potential higher capital costs. Regenerating CO2 capture solvents typically involves energy-intensive methods like heat or vacuum, but researchers are exploring more efficient and cost-effective alternatives, such as electrochemistry. Electrochemistry is used in carbon capture technologies to separate acid and base solutions for capturing and regenerating CO2. This process requires electrodes and specialized membranes to selectively separate species. There are two variations of the pH swing concept: electrolysis and electrodialysis. Electrolysis generates hydrogen and oxygen in addition to capturing CO2, while electrodialysis is a more efficient process. Electrodialysis is a more efficient process for separating gases like hydrogen, oxygen, and CO2. While it has been used commercially for water desalination, it is now being studied for CO2 capture. Another electrochemical approach uses membranes to separate gases, but high efficiencies have not been achieved due to material limitations. Although electrochemical CO2 capture fundamentals have been proven at the bench scale, complete process designs are still conceptual. Other concepts for regenerating CO2 sorbents involve photochemical processes or microwave heating, but these approaches may not progress beyond the conceptual stage due to technical or economic constraints. Improved heat integration between power plants and CO2 capture units is a promising method to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Large-scale demonstration plants are needed to evaluate the feasibility of such designs further. Major R&D activities are focused on reducing the cost of post-combustion CO2 capture. The focus of major R&D activities is on reducing the cost of post-combustion CO2 capture. Most current efforts are in the early stages of technology development, with the majority of projects ranked between TRLs 1 and 5, using absorption methods for CO2 capture. Only a small number of projects are at TRL 6, corresponding to the pilot plant stage. The focus of R&D is on reducing post-combustion CO2 capture costs. Most projects are in early stages, using absorption methods. Few projects explore membranes or solid sorbents for CO2 capture due to challenges. Key questions address the prospects, performance improvement, and deployment timeline of new CO2 capture processes. Pre-combustion CO2 capture is used in power plants and industrial processes. Advanced systems like Selexol TM and Rectisol\u00ae use chemical solvents, while early-stage processes use novel methods like solid sorbents or membranes. The chapter discusses commercial processes and technologies in development. Carbon capture R&D programs have expanded globally, leading to a wide range of activities and projects. This report synthesizes key findings on CO2 capture technology developments from various sources like DOE, IEAGHG, MIT, and GCCSI. It aims to summarize the current status and technical barriers of pre-combustion capture methods, along with potential benefits in terms of performance and cost reduction. Currently, there are no commercial applications of pre-combustion CO2 capture at electric power plants. The Selexol TM and Rectisol\u00ae processes used in IGCC power plants are widely used in other applications for removing contaminants and capturing CO2. An example is the Farmlands chemical plant in Coffeyville, Kansas, which uses the Selexol system to separate and capture CO2 from a hydrogen-CO2 gas mixture. At the Coffeyville plant, a hydrogen-CO2 gas mixture produced by gasification of petroleum coke is used for CO2 capture, with over 93% captured annually. The captured CO2 is used to manufacture urea, while the rest is vented. The separated hydrogen is used to produce ammonia for fertilizers. This project has been operational since 2000 and is similar to other industrial applications using the Selexol process for CO2 capture. The Coffeyville plant employs coal gasification for synthetic natural gas production and captures 3 million tons/year of CO2 using the Rectisol process. The captured CO2 is transported to a Canadian oil field for EOR and sequestration. These examples demonstrate pre-combustion CO2 capture technologies used at gasification-based power plants. The choice of solvent or process depends on project conditions. Plans for full-scale demonstrations of pre-combustion capture at power plants are discussed. Several IGCC-CCS projects have been announced globally, with some being canceled or delayed. The FutureGen project in Illinois is still being negotiated. Large-scale projects for pre-combustion CO2 capture are planned in the United States and other countries, with costs shared between public and private sectors. Major demonstrations of pre-combustion CO2 capture are listed in Table 12, including fuels production plants and IGCC power plants, set to begin operation in 2014 or later. Several large-scale projects for pre-combustion CO2 capture are planned globally, with the captured CO2 being sequestered in depleted oil reservoirs. The projects vary in the percentage of CO2 captured, with Selexol being the preferred technology for some. China's GreenGen project is set to be the first full-scale IGCC plant with CO2 capture, with construction started in 2009. Other proposed projects have not yet begun construction. These projects aim to demonstrate the commercial viability of CO2 capture in industrial processes. Most large-scale projects in Table 12 aim to demonstrate various aspects of IGCC technology, such as gasifier reliability and hydrogen use for power generation after CO2 capture. Operational data from these projects is expected to accumulate in about five years. There is limited development of pre-combustion CO2 capture at pilot plant scale, but projects in Europe like Nuon's Buggenum plant and Elcogas's Puertollano plant are significant advancements in this area. The Nuon Buggenum and Elcogas's Puertollano plants in Europe are significant developments in pre-combustion CO2 capture at operating IGCC facilities. These projects aim to optimize performance efficiency and test different solvents for CO2 capture. The pilot plant experience will be used for the much larger Nuon Magnum IGCC power plant. Pre-combustion CO2 capture has lower energy penalty and cost compared to post-combustion processes. Current research is focused on improving capture efficiency in pre-combustion CO2 capture systems using liquid solvents, solid sorbents, and membranes to reduce equipment size and cost. Physical absorption is the main mechanism for selectively absorbing CO2 from gas streams in these systems. Research on physical solvents aims to enhance CO2 carrying capacity and reduce heat of absorption. Higher capacity means more CO2 is captured, lowering costs. Lower heat of absorption reduces energy needed for CO2 stripping during regeneration. Main focus is on improving carrying capacity, as heat of absorption is already low. Factors affecting carrying capacity include solvent properties, CO2 partial pressure, and process temperature. Current research focuses on developing new solvents for pre-combustion CO2 capture at higher pressures and temperatures to increase plant efficiency and reduce costs. Solvents must have low corrosive properties to prevent equipment damage. Capturing CO2 at higher temperatures can eliminate the need for cooling and reheating syngas, improving overall efficiency. Ionic liquids are being studied as potential solvents for CO2 capture in pre-combustion applications. They have high CO2 absorption potential and do not evaporate at high temperatures, allowing for CO2 separation without cooling the syngas in an IGCC system. Solid sorbents are also being explored for pre-combustion CO2 capture, offering advantages for both pre and post-combustion capture processes. Solid sorbent systems have advantages over solvents in pre-combustion applications due to their ability to operate at high temperatures, eliminating the need for additional equipment for syngas cooling and reducing costs. However, handling solids can be more challenging than liquids, which can impact the overall cost and choice between solvent and sorbent-based capture technology. Solid sorbent-based systems are currently used in various applications, such as hydrogen purification processes, and have the potential to be adapted for CO2 capture. Organizations like Lehigh University, RTI International, TDA Research, the University of North Dakota Energy & Environmental Research Center, and the URS Group are actively involved in this field. The Energy & Environmental Research Center and the URS Group are developing solid sorbents for pre-combustion CO2 capture. They focus on identifying promising sorbent materials and conducting experiments. Membrane-based capture processes use micro-porous metallic, polymeric, or ceramic materials for CO2 capture in high-pressure, high-temperature IGCC systems. Figure 20 illustrates a membrane separation process for CO2 capture in an IGCC application. Membrane technology is used for CO2 capture in IGCC applications to separate CO2 from hydrogen in the gas stream. Multiple stages are typically required to increase the purity of the separated components. This technology has been commercially used for gas purification and CO2 removal in hydrogen production but not specifically for pre-combustion CO2 capture in IGCC plants. The advantages and challenges of membrane technology are summarized in Table 16. Membrane separation systems for pre-combustion capture applications face challenges such as limited temperature ranges and low tolerance to impurities. Due to their modular nature and the need for large surface areas, membrane systems lack economies of scale with plant size. Current research aims to overcome these hurdles, particularly in increasing performance and reducing unit costs. In IGCC plants with CCS, the syngas undergoes a water-gas shift reaction to enhance CO2 concentration for efficient capture. The water-gas shift reaction in IGCC plants enhances CO2 concentration for efficient capture by converting CO to CO2 and providing additional hydrogen for power generation. To improve conversion efficiency and reduce costs, researchers are developing sorbents and membranes for simultaneous CO2 capture during the reaction. In sorbent-enhanced water gas shift reactions, CO2 is captured simultaneously with the shift reaction in a single reactor vessel. This allows for increased conversion of CO to CO2, reducing overall capital costs. The development of enhanced WGS reactors also requires practical methods for handling and regenerating solid sorbent materials. Membrane reactors can also be used for simultaneous CO2 capture during the reaction, improving efficiency and speed. Liquid solvents may be used in combination with membranes for this purpose. At the conceptual design stage, work on pre-combustion capture focuses on improving power plant efficiency to lower CO2 capture costs. Improvements in IGCC system components like the ASU, gasifier, and gas turbine are key, along with heat integration for energy savings. Advanced plant designs integrating components and gasifier enhancements are also studied, such as coupling an IGCC system with a solid oxide fuel cell. Several recent studies showcase these advancements. The U.S. Department of Energy projects cost reductions for IGGC systems using advanced technologies, which would also lower CO2 capture costs. Significant R&D efforts are required to commercialize these designs. Research and development activities aim to reduce pre-combustion CO2 capture costs by improving various IGCC plant components. Advanced plant designs are being explored to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. Advanced plant designs, including solid oxide fuel cells, are being actively investigated for future use. Oxy-combustion capture technology is still under development and not yet commercial, unlike post-combustion and pre-combustion CO2 capture technologies. The current status of oxy-combustion CO2 capture technology is summarized in this chapter using data from various organizations. The technology carbon sequestration program (MIT) and the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute (GCCSI) are working on advancing oxy-combustion capture technology. While there are no commercial oxy-combustion carbon capture systems yet, the oxygen production technology is mature and widely used in various industries. New capture methods are being explored to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Most commercial air separation units use a cryogenic process to separate oxygen from air. The high energy requirements of current ASU technology increase with oxygen purity levels. To make oxy-combustion carbon capture more economical, less energy-intensive air separation methods are needed. No full-scale demonstrations of oxy-combustion CO2 capture at a power plant have been done yet. Several full-scale oxy-combustion demonstrations are still being planned outside the United States, with costs to be shared between the public and private sectors. It is expected that one or more large-scale demonstrations of this technology will materialize over the next several years. One demonstration project in Australia could begin operation as soon as next year, while two other projects would not begin operating until 2015. These oxy-combustion designs would use a conventional ASU as the oxygen source. The designs for oxy-combustion demonstrations would utilize a conventional ASU as the oxygen source, with the potential to omit a flue gas desulfurization system to reduce costs. Integration of conventional ASUs to meet oxygen needs for large coal-fired boilers with flue gas recirculation is a key test. Planned demonstration projects are less than 200 MW, requiring only a single ASU train. Larger plants would need multiple ASUs, increasing complexity and cost. Table 18 lists planned and current pilot plants for testing oxy-combustion capture in an integrated system design. Plants in Europe capture over 200 tons of CO2 per day for oxy-combustion testing. Vattenfall's pilot plant in Germany and Total's plant in France are comparable in size. A project in California aims to use CO2 from an oxy-combustion process with rocket engine technology for geological storage. The availability and use of a high-pressure oxy-combustion process for the WESTCARB project is still pending. Other pilot-scale facilities worldwide test oxy-combustion components, like Babcock and Wilcox's Clean Energy Development Facility. Air Products operates a pilot plant in Maryland using an ion transport membrane system for oxygen production. This system promises lower-cost oxygen, a major cost and energy item in oxy-combustion systems. Advanced oxygen production methods are discussed in the next section on laboratory- and bench-scale developments. Laboratory- and bench-scale R&D for oxy-combustion focuses on understanding burner and boiler characteristics, designing innovative burners, developing flue gas purification technologies, creating cost-effective oxygen production units, and exploring novel concepts like chemical looping combustion. Research includes studying fundamental mechanisms affecting oxygen-fired boiler systems, such as flame characteristics, burner design, and fuel injection systems. Advanced boiler materials are also a key research focus due to the high temperatures of oxygen combustion. The research in oxy-combustion focuses on developing advanced boiler materials and flue gas purification systems to remove contaminants like sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides. Innovative methods for CO2 capture during the compression process are being explored. The focus is on lower-cost capture technologies. The ion transport membranes (ITM) system offers a more cost-effective and energy-efficient alternative to current cryogenic oxygen separation methods. Thin nonporous membranes are used to separate oxygen from air at high temperature and pressure. The goal is to produce ITM oxygen at one-third the cost and energy requirement of current methods. ITM technology is most suitable for IGCC systems and gasification-based processes due to their high operating pressures. Oxy-combustion applications would require further development. The oxygen transport membrane (OTM) concept utilizes the chemical potential of oxygen as the driving force for oxygen separation. It can be integrated directly into a boiler for combustion, increasing the chemical potential difference that drives oxygen through the membrane. Other new oxygen production methods use solid sorbents to absorb oxygen from air, which is then released through heating. This approach is still in the early stages of development. The process of oxygen production using solid sorbents like perovskite and manganese oxide is being explored. Perovskite releases heat while adsorbing oxygen from air, potentially reducing energy penalties. Manganese oxide absorbs oxygen from high pressure air, offering a cost-effective solution. Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is another novel oxy-combustion technology being developed. Cost estimates for these technologies remain uncertain until larger-scale processes are tested. Chemical looping combustion (CLC) involves using an O2-carrying sorbent, typically a metal oxide, to facilitate combustion with a fuel. The exhaust stream only contains carbon dioxide and water vapor. CLC has the potential to make carbon capture cheaper but faces challenges in materials handling and oxygen carrier selection. Projects funded by the U.S. Department of Energy include tests by Alstom and Ohio State University using different oxygen carriers. Alstom and Ohio State University are working on oxy-combustion capture projects using different oxygen carriers. Alstom plans to have a 3 MW pilot plant online in late 2010. Current activity on oxy-combustion capture is focused on conceptual design stages to maximize efficiency and minimize costs, with proposed novel designs incorporating advanced technologies for improved process efficiency. Advanced oxy-combustion designs aim for high CO2 capture and plant efficiency, but require costly development of new technologies. Other conceptual designs focus on improving plant efficiency using conventional technology and oxygen production. The chapter reviews R&D activities for oxy-combustion CO2 capture as an alternative to post-combustion capture, focusing on developing efficient and cost-effective processes for oxygen production. The chapter reviews R&D activities for oxy-combustion CO2 capture, focusing on cost reduction and performance improvement of new technologies like chemical looping combustion. The potential for reducing costs by avoiding additional gas cleaning equipment is also discussed. The development of these technologies into viable commercial options is still in the early stages. Chapter 9 discusses recent studies on cost reductions for power plants with advanced capture systems and technology roadmaps for CO2 capture. It also reviews past experiences in R&D programs for advanced capture technologies. The uncertainty in cost estimates for technologies not yet built is emphasized. The uncertainty in cost estimates for technologies not yet built is highlighted, with a focus on potential cost reductions from technology innovations in CO2 capture processes and power plant components. Studies use \"bottom up\" and \"top down\" methods to estimate future costs based on engineering analysis and learning curves from past experiences. The \"top down\" method uses past learning curves to estimate future costs of new technologies based on projected capacity. A 2006 DOE analysis shows potential cost reductions in CO2 capture for pulverized coal and integrated gasification combined cycle plants. Advanced technologies reduce incremental costs significantly, with a 19% decrease for IGCC and 28% for PC plants in total electricity generation costs. The cost of electricity generation decreases by 19% for IGCC cases and 28% for PC cases, with the biggest reductions in the final steps of each plant type. Advanced technologies like solid sorbents for CO2 capture and membrane systems for water-gas shift reactors are still in early development stages. Cost estimates for these cases are less reliable and likely to increase as technology nears commercialization. Additionally, oxy-combustion systems show a 19% decrease in cost for advanced systems, but are still under development and not yet demonstrated at a commercial scale. The cost of oxy-combustion systems for new power plants is uncertain, with some studies showing lower costs than post-combustion capture while others report higher costs. Continued R&D can reduce future costs, as shown in a 2010 DOE analysis where the cost of new supercritical PC plants with CCS decreased by 27% and IGCC plant costs fell by 31%. Future IGCC plants with CCS are projected to cost 7% less than current plants without capture. The cost penalty for CCS in PC plants also decreased by about half in the analysis. Many components assumed in the analysis are still in early development stages, leading to uncertain cost estimates for advanced systems. The DOE analysis shows uncertain cost estimates for advanced technologies in early development stages, indicating potential cost savings. However, the time frame for commercial use of these technologies is often missing from engineering-based cost estimates. Forecasting technology costs based on learning curves provides a temporal dimension along with cost estimates. The \"top down\" approach to cost estimation models future cost of power plants with CCS based on total installed capacity. Future cost reductions are estimated for different types of power plants with CO2 capture after deploying 100,000 MW. Historical learning rates for technologies were applied to estimate component costs and overall plant costs, considering uncertainties in key parameters. The study analyzed the cost reductions for different types of power plants with CO2 capture after deploying 100,000 MW worldwide. The IGCC plant showed the largest potential for cost reductions due to less mature cost components. Combustion-based plants had smaller potential as most components were already mature. The incremental cost of CO2 capture systems decreased faster than the overall plant cost. The cost reduction ranges were similar to DOE's estimates, with the low end being smaller by factors of two. The section discusses estimated timetables for the development and commercialization of CO2 capture systems, with roadmaps developed by governmental and private organizations. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has a Carbon Sequestration Program with a roadmap showing the projected timetable for CO2 capture technology development. The 2007 DOE roadmap and a more recent roadmap outline the development of advanced CO2 capture technologies, with milestones extending beyond 2024. EPRI conducts R&D on behalf of utility companies, supporting projects for advanced carbon capture technologies. The roadmap developed jointly between EPRI and CURC calls for demonstrations of IGCC with CCS and combustion with CCS by 2025. The roadmap expects CO2 capture systems for power plants to be commercial by 2020, relying on improvements to advanced technologies. EPRI researchers have proposed a timeline for carbon capture developments based on Technology Readiness Levels. The timeline for development of carbon capture technologies ranges from TRL 5 to TRL 9, with commercial-scale plants expected by 2018. The Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF) aims to improve cost-effective CO2 capture and storage technologies through collaborative efforts. The roadmap sets development goals for three time periods: 2009-2013, 2014-2020, and 2020 and beyond. The Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF) aims to develop low-cost and scalable carbon capture technologies in three stages: 2009-2013, 2014-2020, and 2020 and beyond. The roadmap includes goals for full-scale demonstrations, commercial deployment, CO2 transport and storage, and integrated CCS projects by 2013. Funding for CO2 capture R&D is provided at the country level, with international organizations setting goals for demonstration and commercialization. The governments of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States have committed to supporting the launching of 20 large-scale CCS demonstration projects globally by 2010, with the goal of broad deployment of CCS by 2020. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has published a roadmap calling for increasing numbers of pilot and demonstration plants worldwide through 2035 to support the commercialization of CCS. Early large-scale projects are expected to take place in OECD countries, with non-OECD countries leading after 2030. The roadmap for CCS in Canada outlines R&D needs and timelines for CO2 capture systems, with various studies predicting the impact of national and international policies on global climate change. Different models project CCS deployment by 2020, with varying results for the U.S. energy mix in 2050 under different policy scenarios. Results from five models for the year 2035 show CCS deployment ranging from zero to 120 GW for a 50% GHG reduction and 30-230 GW for an 80% reduction scenario. Uncertainties exist in future demand for CO2 capture technology and its commercial use timeline. Roadmaps project lower-cost capture systems by 2020, but sustained R&D efforts are needed for new processes. The next chapter examines past experiences with power plant environmental technologies to provide insights on the development, deployment, and cost reductions of new technologies for CO2 capture systems. Case studies of prior DOE-supported efforts to develop novel, lower-cost capture systems are presented to assess the prospects for improved CO2 capture technology. The chapter discusses case studies of past DOE-supported efforts to develop lower-cost systems for capturing power plant emissions of SO2 and NOx, providing historical benchmarks for the time and factors influencing success in bringing new processes to commercialization. It also presents historical data on technology deployment rates, performance improvements, and cost reductions for post-combustion capture systems of SO2 and NOx, serving as benchmarks for assessing current projections for CO2 capture systems. The role of government policies in establishing markets for environmental technologies is highlighted with examples from past experiences. Current efforts to develop new or improved carbon capture systems are similar to past efforts in the late 1970s for power plant SO2 and NOx controls following the Clean Air Act Amendments. SO2 capture technology had been used commercially since the early 20th century but was not commonly used for power plant flue gases. Post-combustion NOx capture technologies also faced similar challenges. By the late 1970s, flue gas desulfurization was the most widely used technology for SO2 control in response to regulatory requirements. In the late 1970s, SO2 control for power plants involved using a flue gas desulfurization system with water and limestone to capture SO2. Post-combustion NOx capture systems were deemed too costly, so low-NOx burners were used instead. By the 1980s, further reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions were targeted to address acid rain issues. The DOE launched initiatives to develop new technologies for reducing power plant SO2 and NOx emissions to address acid rain issues. Five novel processes were supported under the Clean Coal Technology program, including post-combustion capture and injection of solid sorbents for more cost-effective SO2 removal. The development time and commercial success of each process were key factors. Copper oxide was first studied as a sulfur removal sorbent in 1961. Sulfur removal was initially researched by the U.S. Bureau of Mines in 1961, leading to industrial use in Japan by 1973. The process aimed to remove SO2 and NOx from power plant flue gases, producing sulfur or sulfuric acid as a byproduct. Despite development efforts, the copper oxide process was eventually replaced by a wet FGD system for environmental reasons. Research on copper oxide sorbents for combined SO2 and NOx capture continues, although the process never became a commercial technology. The electron beam process for flue gas treatment was introduced by Ebara Corporation in 1970, aiming for high efficiency (~90%) in capturing both pollutants. Testing progressed to pilot plants in the US and Germany by 1985, with DOE funding for the US facility. Commercial plants were established in China in 1998, followed by additional plants in Poland and China between 1999 and 2005. Between 1999 and 2005, three more plants were built in Poland and China for the electron beam process. The overall cost of the system depends on market values of byproducts and ammonia. The NOXSO process, using sodium carbonate sorbent, was another concept for capturing SO2 and NOx from flue gases, with a fluidized bed reactor for sorbent regeneration. Commercial installations of the electron beam process have not been seen in the United States. The process development timeline for sulfur removal methods began in 1979 with funding from DOE. Pilot plant and life cycle testing took place from 1982 to 1993. In 1991, the NOXSO Corporation received a DOE contract to build a commercial-scale demonstration plant, but faced administrative problems and changes in project site locations. A legal dispute led to the bankruptcy and liquidation of the corporation. The furnace limestone injection process was developed in the early 1980s as a cost-effective method for sulfur removal in existing power plants. The LIFAC and LIMB methods were developed in the 1980s and 1990s with DOE support for sulfur removal in power plants. LIFAC combined limestone injection with a humidification system, achieving 70% to 80% removal rates. LIMB, developed by the EPA, achieved approximately 50% removal using limestone. Both methods faced challenges with the electrostatic precipitator due to the volume of solids. The LIFAC and LIMB methods, developed in the 1980s and 1990s with DOE support for sulfur removal in power plants, faced challenges with the electrostatic precipitator due to the larger volume of solids being collected. Duct sorbent injection (DSI) was proposed as a simpler and more cost-effective method for achieving modest SO2 reductions at existing power plants. In the 1980s and 1990s, pilot projects for DSI for SO2 capture had limited success, with capture rates below 40% using calcium-based sorbents. Despite improvements in efficiency, commercial adoption did not occur. In 1996, DSI was repurposed for mercury control, leading to the TOXECON process achieving 90% mercury capture in 2003. However, commercial adoption has been limited due to uncertainty over mercury emissions regulations. The case studies highlight the importance of markets for environmental technologies like carbon capture systems. The lack of market demand for advanced CO2 capture systems and other technologies posed high risks for commercial success. Similar risks exist for advanced carbon capture technologies today, with the time required for development typically spanning two decades or more. The development of novel capture technologies, such as SO2-NOx capture, faced challenges due to the long timeline from concept to large-scale demonstration. Economic benefits decreased as costs rose and competing options became more affordable. Commercial FGD and SCR systems in the US, Japan, and Germany hindered the entry of new technologies into the market. Post-combustion NOx capture was not in demand in the US until the mid-1990s, while sorbent injection processes for SO2 capture gained traction after the 1990 Clean Air Act. The passage discusses how the development of advanced environmental technologies, such as sorbent injection for SO2 capture, faced challenges in commercial success due to the lengthy timeline and competition from more mature technologies like low-sulfur coal. It emphasizes the importance of accelerating the development process to reduce commercial risks and highlights the need to anticipate advancements in current systems to realistically assess prospects and potential payoffs. The deployment trends of post-combustion capture systems for SO2 and NOx from 1970 to 2000 are shown in Figure 42. Historical rates of deployment for other power plant environmental technologies can guide the assessment of current projections for CCS technologies. The maximum deployment rates for FGD and SCR systems suggest that scenarios exceeding these rates for CO2 capture systems may be unrealistic without aggressive new efforts. Studies have shown historical rates of improvement in power plant emission control systems, with SO2 capture efficiencies increasing from 70% to 95% between 1969 and 1995. New systems now capture 98% to 99% of SO2, enabling post-combustion CO2 capture systems. These systems require very low SO2 concentrations for operation. The historical trends show increasing capture efficiencies for power plant emissions like SO2 and NOx, indicating potential for future improvements in commercial CO2 capture systems. Capital costs for FGD and SCR systems initially increased during commercialization but later declined with increasing deployment, with an average cost reduction of 13% for each doubling of installed capacity. This learning rate is also assumed for future CO2 capture systems. In the U.S. economy, a market for a product is crucial for its adoption, including CO2 capture technologies. R&D is essential for innovation, but without a market, technology adoption is limited. Government actions and policies are necessary to create markets for environmental technologies like CO2 capture systems. Without incentives to reduce CO2 emissions, companies may be reluctant to invest in costly technologies like CCS. Government actions are essential to create markets for CO2 emission-reducing technologies. Measures such as loan guarantees, tax credits, and R&D funding incentivize technology development and deployment. Regulatory policies like emissions caps also play a role in reducing emissions. Regulatory policies like emissions caps are mandatory measures that create markets for lower-emission technologies. Government actions influence the development of environmental technologies by imposing requirements that drive innovation. Regulatory policies have been successful in reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from U.S. power plants, as shown in patenting trends for emission reduction technologies. The number of new patents for SO2 reduction and post-combustion NOx capture technologies increased significantly due to new environmental regulations. Government actions have driven innovation in these technologies, leading to cost reductions with increased deployment. Lessons from the development of these technologies can inform current programs for improving CO2 capture technologies. The analysis highlighted the lengthy development timeline and risks involved in creating new environmental technologies. Historical data from FGD and SCR systems informed the challenges in commercializing advanced CO2 capture processes. The report aims to realistically assess the potential for improved, cost-effective CO2 capture systems to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The report discusses three current approaches to CO2 capture: post-combustion capture using amine-based solvents, pre-combustion capture from coal gasification, and oxy-combustion capture. Post-combustion and pre-combustion technologies are commercial, while oxy-combustion is still under development. These technologies aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The report discusses the advantages and limitations of three CO2 capture methods: post-combustion using amine-based solvents, pre-combustion from coal gasification, and oxy-combustion. While all three approaches can achieve high CO2 capture efficiencies, the main challenges are the high cost and energy requirements, especially for combustion-based processes. Research is ongoing to develop improved solvents to lower costs and enhance efficiency. Research is being conducted on breakthrough technologies like novel solvents, sorbents, membranes, and oxyfuel systems for lower-cost carbon capture. Most of these processes are in early stages of development, with credible estimates of performance and cost lacking. Commercial availability of these technologies, if successful, is at least a decade away. Advanced pilot plant scale processes focus on new or improved solvent formulations like ammonia and advanced amines, which could be ready for commercial use within a few years pending full-scale testing. Currently, pilot-scale oxy-combustion processes are being tested for scale-up, with two IGCC plants in Europe installing pilot plants to evaluate pre-combustion capture options. While there are no full-scale applications of CO2 capture at coal-based power plants yet, demonstration projects are planned in the United States and other countries. Research focuses on cost reduction for CO2 capture technologies, with an emphasis on lower-cost retrofit technologies for existing power plants. As coal-fired power plants age, the potential U.S retrofit market for CO2 capture will shrink. The key question is when advanced CO2 capture systems will be available commercially and how much cheaper they will be compared to current technology. Technology roadmaps anticipate commercial deployment by 2020, with a focus on scale-up and demonstration at full-size power plants. The key requirement is for scale-up and demonstration at a full-size power plant before 2020. Roadmaps project that novel, lower-cost technologies like solid sorbent systems for post-combustion capture will be commercial by 2020, but aggressive and sustained efforts are needed. Recent R&D programs for post-combustion SO2 and NOx capture at coal-fired power plants took two decades or more to bring new concepts to commercial availability, with costs increasing during the development process. The development process for environmental technologies like CO2 capture systems follows a learning curve where costs tend to decrease over time. Past experience with SO2 and NOx capture systems showed a 50% cost reduction after about two decades of deployment. Similar cost reduction is expected for future CO2 capture technologies once widely deployed. The cost of CO2 capture depends on power plant design, financing, and operation. Future improvements in plant efficiency can lower CO2 capture costs. Advanced power plant designs with CO2 capture offer optimistic forecasts for cost reductions. Uncertainty exists for non-commercial technologies, with more reliable cost estimates linked to expected commercial deployment. The level of commercial deployment of power plant CO2 capture systems is crucial for cost reductions. Government actions or policies are necessary to create markets for these systems. Future cost reductions are strongly linked to commercial deployment, which serves as a surrogate for factors like R&D expenditures and learning-by-doing. Future cost reductions for CO2 capture technology are projected to decrease by up to 30% after 100,000 MW of capture plant capacity is installed worldwide. This would bring the cost and efficiency of power plants with CO2 capture close to those without. However, uncertainty exists regarding the actual extent of these cost reductions. Future cost reductions for CO2 capture technology are projected to decrease by up to 30% after 100,000 MW of capture plant capacity is installed worldwide. Achieving significant cost reductions will require vigorous R&D, commercial deployment, and government actions to establish a market for CO2 capture technologies. Incentive programs can accelerate development, but significant emissions limitations are needed for substantial and sustained cost reductions in the future."
