    "content": "The \"Reciprocal Market Access Act of 2007\" is the short title of this Act. The purpose of this Act is outlined in Section 2, which includes findings and objectives. The \"Reciprocal Market Access Act of 2007\" aims to expand market opportunities for US exports by reducing trade barriers and promoting fair trade conditions, in line with the principles of the World Trade Organization. The \"Reciprocal Market Access Act of 2007\" focuses on reducing tariffs and trade barriers to promote fair trade conditions. If negotiations with a foreign country do not provide market access for US products, tariffs for similar products from that country should not be reduced. The United States faces nontariff barriers as the most challenging obstacles to exports, with low tariffs and limited nontariff barriers in its own market. Negotiations focus on reducing tariff and nontariff barriers separately, using tariffs as leverage to address foreign barriers. The United States should not negotiate trade deals in a compartmentalized manner, focusing only on tariffs without addressing nontariff barriers. Market access should be ensured before reducing domestic tariffs to prevent new barriers from emerging. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that United States trade negotiations achieve real and meaningful results for United States industry by ensuring meaningful market access for domestic producers' exports. SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON AUTHORITY TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE RATES OF DUTY PURSUANT TO CERTAIN TRADE AGREEMENTS. The President is restricted from agreeing to reduce or eliminate existing duty rates on products in trade agreements with foreign countries until a certification is provided to Congress. This certification must confirm the reduction of barriers and policies hindering US exports. The President must certify to Congress before reducing or eliminating duty rates on products in trade agreements with foreign countries. Any violation of the trade agreement is immediately enforceable. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS. If the United States Trade Representative finds that a foreign country has not reduced or eliminated tariffs or barriers on US exports, the modification of existing duties will be withdrawn until certification of resolution is submitted to Congress. The United States Trade Representative initiates an investigation when an interested party files a petition alleging the need to withdraw or modify existing duties due to foreign tariff or nontariff barriers. Interested parties are defined as US manufacturers, producers, or wholesalers of similar domestic products. Interested parties eligible to file a petition for duty modification include US manufacturers, producers, or wholesalers of domestic products with similar physical characteristics and uses as the product in question. This includes certified unions, recognized worker groups, and trade associations with members engaged in the production of the same type of product. The United States Trade Representative will determine if a petition for duty modification meets the necessary requirements within 45 days of filing. They will notify the petitioner of the decision and provide reasons for it."
