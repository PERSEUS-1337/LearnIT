The Act \"Electronic Health Record Incentives for Multi-Campus Hospitals Act of 2010\" clarifies incentives for multi-campus hospitals to use certified electronic health records, including a special rule for applying Medicare EHR incentive payments to remote inpatient locations of a hospital. This rule allows eligible hospitals with qualified main providers and remote inpatient locations to elect for alternative payment options. The Act \"Electronic Health Record Incentives for Multi-Campus Hospitals Act of 2010\" clarifies incentives for multi-campus hospitals to use certified electronic health records. Eligible hospitals with qualified main providers and remote inpatient locations can elect for alternative payment options, including base amount and discharge related amount alternatives. The election is made once for each hospital and applies to all applicable payment years. The alternative payment options for eligible hospitals with multiple facilities include the base amount alternative and discharge related amount alternative. The election for these options is made once for each hospital and applies to all applicable payment years. The discharge related amount alternative for eligible hospitals is determined based on total discharges for a 12-month period. The discharge related amount alternative for eligible hospitals is determined based on total discharges for a 12-month period, regardless of any source of payment. The amount is then multiplied by the total number of all qualified component facilities of the hospital. Definitions for this subsection include the term 'applicable payment year' referring to the first payment year for which a hospital makes an election and subsequent payment years. The term 'component facility' refers to the main provider or any remote inpatient location of an eligible hospital. A 'qualified component facility' is either a qualified main provider or a qualified remote inpatient location. The term 'main provider' for an eligible hospital is defined in section 413.65(a)(2) of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations. A 'qualified main provider' is a main provider that is a meaningful EHR user. A 'remote inpatient location' is a remote location of a hospital for an eligible hospital. The term 'qualified remote inpatient location' refers to a location certified by an eligible hospital as a remote inpatient location for the reporting period. The text discusses the methodology and standards for determining various types of healthcare facilities and providers in remote inpatient locations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may implement the methodology and standards for determining healthcare facilities and providers in remote inpatient locations. Chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code, does not apply to the collection of information for these amendments. The amendments made by this section will apply retroactively to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION FOR MEDICAID EHR PAYMENT INCENTIVES. For Medicaid EHR payment incentives, Section 1903(t)(5) of the Social Security Act is amended to apply certain provisions to Medicaid providers in the same way as eligible hospitals, with specific conditions. Medicaid providers must certify compliance with specific conditions for remote inpatient locations to receive EHR payment incentives. The amendments made by this section, relating to Medicaid providers and hospital EHR payments, shall apply retroactively as if included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Adjustments may be made to the overall hospital EHR amount to account for Medicaid providers."
