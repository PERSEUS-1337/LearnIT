    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail Act of 1998\". El Camino Real de los Tejas served as a vital route between Mexico City and Tejas, playing a role in colonial rivalries and American Indian nations' futures. The Old San Antonio Road and El Camino Real facilitated cultural interactions, migration, and colonization in the borderland from 1689 to 1850. The routes carried Spanish, Mexican, and American influences, contributing to the formation of the Republic of Texas and its annexation to the United States. The portions of El Camino Real de los Tejas in the United States extended from the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass and Laredo, Texas, totaling almost 2,600 miles in length. The route generally ran northeast through Texas to Natchitoches, Louisiana, covering a distance of 550 miles. SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION. Section 5(a) of the National Trails System Act is amended to designate new paragraphs for the El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail, a 2,580-mile route from Texas to Louisiana. The El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail, a 2,580-mile route from Texas to Louisiana, shall be administered by the Secretary of the Interior. The United States may only acquire land for the trail with the owner's consent. Coordination of activities related to the trail is required. The Secretary of the Interior may coordinate with US and Mexican organizations, academic institutions, and the government of Mexico for exchanging trail information, fostering preservation and educational programs, and establishing an international historic trail. The Senate passed the legislation on October 14, 1998."
