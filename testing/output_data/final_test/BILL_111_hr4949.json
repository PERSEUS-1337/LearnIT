    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a concise summary of the section's title and its purpose. The \"World Class Military Medical Facilities Act\" aims to address the lack of a complete plan, integrated operating structure, budget authorities, and personnel structures at the new Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. The Act also highlights the need for unified construction standards to ensure the facility becomes a world-class military medical facility. The Department of Defense lacks a unified construction standard for military medical facilities, as identified by the National Capital Region Base Realignment and Closure Health Systems Advisory Subcommittee. Numerous deficiencies were found in the current plan for the new Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. The Secretary of Defense will disestablish Joint Task Force National Capital Region Medical and transfer all personnel, property, and functions back to the military department or the Office of the Secretary of Defense within 30 days of the Act's enactment. Additionally, an office will be established to implement recommendations and requirements for National Capital Region military medical facilities. The Secretary of Defense will establish an office within the Office of the Secretary of Defense to implement recommendations for military medical facilities in the National Capital Region. The director of the office will be the Deputy Secretary of Defense. The Deputy Secretary of Defense will oversee the office responsible for defining medical missions and managing budget and operational authority for military medical facilities in the National Capital Region. The Deputy Director of the office will be the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs. The office oversees the development, budgeting, and operation of world-class military medical facilities in the National Capital Region, including specifying personnel authorizations and systems in consultation with the Secretaries of the military departments. The office is responsible for developing and implementing a master plan for military medical facilities in the National Capital Region as required by the National Defense Authorization Act. The Secretary of Defense will establish a unified construction standard for military medical facilities by June 1, 2010, including a standard of care and size requirements for operating rooms and patient recovery rooms. SEC. 6 authorizes $400,000,000 for implementing a unified construction standard at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. SEC. 7 establishes an Independent Review Panel. The Secretary of Defense will establish an advisory committee called the \"Independent Review Panel for Military Medical Care in the National Capital Region\" to assess the design and structure of military medical facilities in the National Capital Region.

Members serve three-year terms and may call in advisers for consultation. They review plans for military medical facilities and organizational structure to ensure world-class facilities. The committee also examines the execution of plans and other matters related to military medical care in the region. Members and advisers are reimbursed for necessary travel expenses. The advisory committee for military medical care in the National Capital Region submits reports to the Secretary of Defense assessing and improving military medical care, addressing deficiencies, and making recommendations. The Secretary of Defense then provides assessments of these recommendations to the congressional defense committees. The Secretary of Defense submits a report to the congressional defense committees, including an assessment of findings and recommendations from an advisory panel, along with plans to address them.
