    "content": "Businesses must maintain accounting records to manage operations and determine tax liabilities. Two methods of accounting are cash and accrual basis. Cash basis records revenue and expenses when cash is paid or received, while accrual basis records revenue when earned and expenses when incurred. Cash basis is simpler but may result in less accurate income measurement and tax deferral. The Joint Committee on Taxation views cash accounting as a departure from normal tax law, making it a tax expenditure. The Joint Committee on Taxation considers cash basis accounting for tax purposes as a tax expenditure, estimating a $10.9 billion revenue loss between FY2014 and FY2018. Proposed legislation aims to change tax accounting requirements for businesses, impacting federal tax revenues and liabilities. Discussions on cash and accrual accounting were held before the Tax Reform Act of 1986. This report explores the effects of expanding cash basis accounting for certain businesses and limiting it for others. Accounting is the process of recording and reporting financial transactions for businesses, nonprofits, and government entities. Entities record financial transactions for accurate predictions of cash flows and better business decisions. Accounting standards help gauge financial health, with differences between financial accounting and tax accounting methods. Businesses use cash basis or accrual method for federal tax liabilities. The cash basis of accounting records income and expenses when payments are received or paid, while the accrual method records them when transactions occur. For example, a nail supply company selling $1,000 worth of nails in August but receiving payment in January would show different revenue recognition under each method. The accrual method of accounting accurately measures a business's income by capturing all revenues and expenses during a given period, regardless of when cash is received or paid. This method is considered the baseline for normal income structure by the JCT, and deviations from it, such as the cash basis method, are seen as tax expenditures. The cash basis method is considered a tax expenditure by the JCT. It simplifies accounting for small businesses and helps them reduce record-keeping costs. Businesses may benefit from the cash method when they are cash constrained and unable to meet tax obligations under the accrual method. For example, a company waiting for payment from a customer can avoid immediate tax liabilities with the cash basis method. The cash basis method allows businesses to account for pending payments in the tax year they are received, maximizing tax deferral and avoidance. By strategically timing income and expenses, a firm can reduce tax liability by requesting payments to be remitted in different tax periods. The cash basis method allows businesses to strategically time income and expenses to reduce tax liability by requesting payments to be remitted in different tax periods. Before TRA86, taxpayers could use any accounting method that clearly reflected income for tax purposes, but the Secretary of the Treasury could require a different method if income was not clearly reflected. Before TRA86, taxpayers could use various accounting methods to reflect income for tax purposes. TRA86 changed the rules, allowing businesses with three-year average gross receipts of $5 million or less to use the cash method of accounting. Certain businesses like Personal Service Corporations were also allowed to continue using the cash method regardless of their gross receipts. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86) allowed certain businesses, such as Personal Service Corporations, to use the cash method of accounting regardless of their gross receipts. However, TRA86 excluded businesses like Subchapter C corporations with average gross receipts over $5 million from using the cash method. Congress later passed the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1987 to further adjust the rules regarding average gross receipts. The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-203) raised the average gross receipts test for family farm corporations to $25 million, requiring those exceeding this limit to use the accrual method of accounting. Proposals to change accounting methods for tax purposes have been a longstanding policy consideration for Congress and the executive branch, with various reports recommending the expansion of cash accounting for small businesses due to its ease of recordkeeping and lower compliance costs. Recent proposals in Congress have focused on expanding the use of cash accounting for small businesses when filing taxes. Bills introduced in the 113th Congress aimed to raise the average gross receipts limit to $10 million from $5 million, allowing more small businesses to use cash basis accounting. Additionally, the Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed changes to the cash method of accounting. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 1) proposed changes to cash accounting for businesses. It aimed to expand the use of the cash method for qualified businesses by raising the gross receipts threshold to $10 million and required certain businesses with over $10 million in average gross receipts to switch to the accrual method. The estimated revenue increase was $23.6 billion over 10 years, with one-time income adjustments and timing changes contributing to the gain. The President's FY2016 budget proposes to increase the three-year average gross receipts limit to $25 million for businesses using cash accounting. This differs from congressional proposals which suggest a limit of $10 million. The expansion to $25 million would allow over 99% of businesses to use the simpler cash method for tax purposes. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates a $24.9 billion revenue loss over 10 years due to this proposal. Policy issues revolve around accurately capturing economic activity for tax liability determination. The President's FY2016 budget proposes increasing the three-year average gross receipts limit to $25 million for businesses using cash accounting, allowing over 99% of businesses to use the simpler method. Policy considerations include accurately capturing economic activity for tax liability determination and the potential administrative burden on businesses. Congress may expand or restrict cash accounting availability, affecting different types of businesses. The small business cash accounting tax preference generally uses a receipt-based test, but also excludes certain businesses based on legal structure and average gross receipts over $1 million for those carrying inventory. This aligns with how small businesses maintain their records. Cash accounting is favored by small businesses for its alignment with their record-keeping practices and focus on cash flows. The House Small Business Subcommittee discussed the benefits of increasing the gross receipts limit to $10 million for businesses using the cash method. This change would simplify tax filing and reduce burdens on small businesses. Cash accounting is preferred by small businesses due to its simplicity and alignment with their payment practices. Unlike larger companies, small businesses often operate on a payment upon delivery or performance basis, eliminating the need for tracking payments. Additionally, small businesses are not required to issue public financial statements under the accrual method, making cash accounting a less burdensome option. However, cash accounting is considered a tax expenditure by the JCT and may result in deferral of tax liability due to the acceleration or deferral of income and expenses. Cash accounting is a tax benefit for small businesses, resulting in foregone revenue of $10.9 billion from FY2014 through FY2018. Small businesses also benefit from other provisions in the tax code, such as single layer taxation for pass-through entities and a graduated corporate rate structure for corporations. The ability to expense certain depreciable assets mainly targets small businesses, providing a tax deferral through immediate depreciation. This tax preference reduces taxable income in the year of expense, despite higher taxable income in later years. Increasing the $5 million average gross receipts threshold for small businesses to use the cash method of accounting would provide tax benefits by allowing more businesses to benefit from immediate depreciation of assets. This proposal has been suggested by some in Congress to be raised to $10 million or even $25 million, which would benefit a higher percentage of firms. Increasing the threshold for small businesses to use cash accounting from $5 million to $10 million would benefit over 95% of C corporations. The data does not reflect the impact of the current $5 million threshold, but increasing it to $10 million would allow 96% of C corporations to use cash accounting. Congress could adjust the threshold in two ways. Congress could adjust the threshold for small businesses to use cash accounting in two ways: by indexing it to inflation or by simply increasing it to a level deemed appropriate. For example, the President's budget proposal for FY2016 suggests increasing the threshold to $25 million, allowing 99% of all businesses to pay taxes based on the simpler cash method. Alternatively, Congress could combine both methods by increasing the threshold and adjusting for inflation. Congress could eliminate cash accounting for all businesses or restrict its use for certain types of businesses to increase tax revenue and reduce tax planning. This change would increase compliance costs and force businesses to hire accountants, potentially leading to short-term financing to meet tax obligations. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 sought to require accrual accounting for certain partnerships, S corporations, PSCs, and other pass through entities with over $10 million in average gross receipts. Economic theory does not justify taxing businesses differently based on legal identity unless one form confers tax advantages. Eliminating cash accounting or limiting its use could allow for tax deferral for affected firms with or without a penalty. Tax deferral for affected firms can be achieved through extended payment plans offered by the IRS, including a 120-day extension with interest and penalties or an installment agreement with specific limitations."
