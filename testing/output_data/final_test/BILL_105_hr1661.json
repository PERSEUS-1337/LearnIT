    "content": "The \"Trademark Law Treaty Implementation Act\" is referenced as the \"Trademark Act of 1946\" for registration and protection of trademarks used in commerce. The Trademark Act of 1946 is amended to allow trademark owners to request registration by filing an application with the Patent and Trademark Office, including details such as domicile, first use date, goods associated with the mark, and a drawing of the mark. The applicant must verify that they believe to be the owner of the mark, the facts in the application are accurate, the mark is in use in commerce, and no one else has the right to use the mark in a way that may cause confusion. In every application for concurrent use, the applicant must state exceptions to exclusive use and provide details on any concurrent use by others, including the goods, areas, periods of use, and desired registration. The applicant must also comply with rules set by the Commissioner for the application process. The Trademark Act of 1946 is amended to allow a person with a bona fide intention to use a trademark in commerce to request registration by filing an application with specified details. This includes the applicant's domicile, goods associated with the mark, and a drawing of the mark. The applicant must also provide a verified statement confirming their intention to use the mark in good faith. The Trademark Act of 1946 is amended to require a verified statement from the applicant confirming their belief in their entitlement to use the mark in commerce, their intention to use the mark, the accuracy of the application facts, and that no one else has the right to use a similar mark that could cause confusion. The Trademark Act of 1946 requires applicants to meet specific requirements before a mark can be registered. Failure to timely file necessary statements may result in abandonment of the application, unless the delay was unintentional and can be satisfactorily explained to the Commissioner. The Trademark Act of 1946 requires applicants to meet specific requirements for filing a statement of use within a specified period. Failure to do so may result in abandonment of the application. The Trademark Act of 1946 has been amended to change the wording from \"unavoidable\" to \"unintentional\" in regards to abandoned applications. Additionally, Section 8 has been amended to address the duration of registration, cancellation, affidavit of continued use, and notice of the Commissioner's action. Section 8 of the Trademark Act specifies that registrations last for 10 years and may be canceled for non-compliance. Owners must pay fees and file paperwork in the year before each 10-year period ends. Owners of trademark registrations must pay the prescribed fee and submit an affidavit with specimens showing current use of the mark in commerce, or an affidavit explaining non-use due to special circumstances. Submissions can be made within a 6-month grace period after the deadline. Owners of trademark registrations must submit a surcharge within a 6-month grace period after the deadline. A special notice of the affidavit requirement will be attached to each certificate of registration. The Commissioner will notify owners of acceptance or refusal of the affidavit, with reasons provided if refused. Registrants not domiciled in the US must designate a representative in writing. Registrants must designate a person in the US for receiving notices or process related to their trademark registration. If the designated person cannot be found, the Commissioner may be served instead. SEC. 6. RENEWAL OF REGISTRATION. Section 9 of the Trademark Act of 1946 is amended to address the renewal of registration. Sec. 9 allows for the renewal of registration for 10-year periods upon payment of fees and submission of a written application. Applications can be made within 1 year before the end of each period or within a 6-month grace period after, with the option to correct deficiencies upon notification. If the Commissioner refuses renewal, further actions can be taken. If the Commissioner refuses to renew the registration, the registrant will be notified of the refusal and reasons. Non-US domiciled registrants must designate a US resident for service of notices or process. If the designated person cannot be found, notices or process may be served upon the Commissioner. SEC. 7. RECORDING ASSIGNMENT OF MARK. Amendment to Section 10 of the Trademark Act of 1946 regarding assignment. Sec. 10 allows for the assignment of a registered mark or a mark with a pending registration application, along with the goodwill of the business associated with the mark. Assignments are subject to certain conditions, such as not being assignable prior to certain filings unless it involves a successor to the business. Assignments of trademarks must be in writing and duly executed. Acknowledgment serves as evidence of execution, and recording the assignment in the Patent and Trademark Office is crucial. Failure to record the assignment may render it void against subsequent purchasers without notice. The Office maintains a record of assignments. Assignees not domiciled in the US must file a written document designating their representative. In the United States, trademarks must be assigned in writing and recorded with the Patent and Trademark Office. Assignees residing outside the US must designate a representative for service of notices or process. If the designated person cannot be found, notices or process may be served upon the Commissioner. SEC. 8 amends Section 44 of the Trademark Act of 1946, requiring applicants to submit a certification or certified copy of the registration from their country of origin. SEC. 9 includes miscellaneous amendments. The Trademark Act of 1946 is amended to include provisions regarding cancellation of functional marks, incontestability defenses, and remedies in cases of dilution of famous marks. The Trademark Act of 1946 is amended to include provisions for damages and destruction of articles in cases of trademark violations. SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act and its amendments will take effect 1 year after enactment or upon the entry into force of the Trademark Law Treaty for the United States, whichever comes first."
