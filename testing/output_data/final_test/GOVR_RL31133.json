    "content": "Congress has the power to declare war and has done so 11 times in American history, most recently during World War II. They have also authorized the use of military force, with the latest being against Iraq in 2002. Various statutes give the President standby authority during times of war or national emergency. This report explores declarations of war and military force authorizations by the United States. The report provides historical background on declarations of war and authorizations for the use of force by the United States, analyzes their implications under international and domestic law, lists standby statutory authorities that can be activated, describes Congressional procedures for considering such declarations, and includes the texts of all declarations and authorizations enacted. The report provides historical background on declarations of war and authorizations for the use of force by the United States. There have been 11 formal declarations of war against foreign nations enacted by Congress and the President, encompassing five different wars. Each declaration of war has been preceded by a presidential request to Congress citing compelling reasons for such action. In the 19th and 20th centuries, declarations of war by the United States were passed by Congress in the form of a bill or joint resolution, citing reasons such as armed attacks or threats to US interests. The last formal declaration of war was in 1942 against Rumania during World War II. President McKinley's request for a declaration of war against Spain in 1898 was approved by Congress after Spain rejected a US ultimatum. The request for a declaration of war against Spain in 1898 was made by President McKinley after Spain rejected a US ultimatum to relinquish its sovereignty over Cuba. The war was aimed at ending the Cuban insurrection, achieving Cuban independence, and restoring stability on the island. This request was based on findings by the President and supported by a joint resolution of Congress. President Wilson requested a declaration of war against Germany in 1917 after they engaged in unrestricted submarine warfare, which he saw as an assault on U.S. sovereign rights. Congress passed the resolution on April 6, 1917. Wilson later requested a declaration of war against Austria-Hungary on December 4, 1917. President Wilson requested a declaration of war against Austria-Hungary on December 4, 1917, as they had become an active instrument of Germany against the United States. Congress quickly passed a joint resolution declaring war, which the President signed on December 7, 1917. President Franklin D. Roosevelt requested a declaration of war against Japan on December 8, 1941, due to direct military attacks on U.S. territory. Congress passed the declaration the same day. After Germany and Italy declared war on the United States on December 11, 1941, President Roosevelt asked Congress to recognize a state of war with both nations. Congress passed separate resolutions declaring war on Germany and Italy, which the President signed on December 11. On December 11, 1941, President Roosevelt signed joint resolutions declaring war on Bulgaria, Hungary, and Rumania. Congress passed separate resolutions for each nation, stating a \"state of war\" existed between them and the United States. The language used in these declarations was similar to previous declarations of war in the 20th century. The 20th century declarations of war authorized the President to use the military forces of the United States against other nations. Legislation has been enacted to authorize the use of military force instead of formally declaring war in some instances. The complete texts of the 11 declarations of war are available in Appendix A. During the Presidencies of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, congressional authorizations for use of force were granted to protect U.S. interests from attacks by foreign powers on commercial vessels and persons. Specific authorizations were given in 1798 against France and in 1802 against Tripoli. In 1815, President James Madison requested Congress to declare war against the Regency of Algiers in response to attacks on U.S. citizens and commerce. Congress authorized the use of U.S. armed vessels but did not declare war. Since World War II, Presidential requests for military force authority have typically been for broad use in specific regions to defend U.S. interests. Recently, Presidents have relied on their constitutional powers to use force without congressional approval but have welcomed legislative support. This overview covers key authorizations from John Adams to present. Appendix B contains the full text of these authorizations. During the 1790s, the United States remained neutral in the conflict between France and Great Britain. President John Adams requested Congress to authorize the use of U.S. naval vessels to defend against French attacks on American shipping. Adams emphasized the need for congressional action to protect American seafaring citizens and commerce. In response to President Adams' request, Congress passed legislation in 1798 to protect American seafaring citizens and commerce. The law authorized the President to instruct U.S. armed vessels to act against any \"armed vessel\" committing depredations on U.S. citizens' vessels and to retake any captured U.S. vessels. Additional legislation in July 1798 allowed the President to order U.S. Navy warships to seize any armed French vessel within U.S. jurisdiction or on the high seas. President Thomas Jefferson was granted authority to commission private armed ships to subdue French vessels and protect U.S. shipping against Tripoli. Congress passed legislation in 1802 authorizing the President to equip and employ armed forces for this purpose. In 1802, President Thomas Jefferson was authorized to commission private armed ships to protect U.S. shipping against Tripoli. Congress passed legislation allowing the President to equip and employ armed forces for this purpose, granting him the authority to subdue, seize, and make prize of Tripolitan vessels and goods. President James Madison was also given the power to grant special commissions to owners of private armed vessels to lawfully subdue Tripolitan vessels. President James Madison sought authority to use the U.S. Navy against Algeria for seizing U.S. vessels. Despite not declaring war, Congress authorized the President to protect U.S. commerce and seamen in the Mediterranean and adjoining seas. President James Madison sought authority to use the U.S. Navy to seize vessels and goods belonging to the Dey of Algiers. Congress granted him discretionary authority to commission private armed vessels to subdue Algerine vessels. Attacks on U.S. commercial shipping vessels increased after the War of 1812, especially in the Caribbean and Latin American coastal waters. On March 3, 1819, legislation was enacted to protect American commerce from piracy in response to attacks on vessels in the region. The President was authorized to use U.S. armed vessels to combat piracy and protect merchant vessels and their crews. The 1819 legislation authorized U.S. vessels to take actions against pirates and established penalties for piracy. It became permanent law in 1823 and remains in Title 33 of the United States Code. President Eisenhower warned of Chinese Communist aggression towards Formosa in 1955, posing a threat to global peace and security. President Eisenhower emphasized the need for the U.S. to be prepared to use its armed forces to ensure the security of Formosa and the Pescadores, stating that he would not hesitate to take emergency action within his Constitutional powers. He called for a Congressional resolution to establish his authority as Commander-in-Chief to employ the military promptly and effectively as needed. In response to President Eisenhower's request, Congress passed legislation in 1955 authorizing the President to use the Armed Forces to protect Formosa and the Pescadores. The resolution allowed for additional measures as deemed necessary until peace and security were reasonably assured. This resolution was repealed in 1974. In 1957, Congress authorized President Eisenhower to provide military assistance to nations in the Middle East to counter Communist aggression, with the condition that it would only be used if requested by the nation under attack. The joint resolution in 1957 authorized President Eisenhower to use armed forces to assist nations in the Middle East against Communist aggression, with conditions on reporting to Congress and expiration criteria. In the early 1960s, the United States provided military assistance to South Vietnam, leading to tensions with North Vietnam. On August 2, 1964, the U.S.S. Maddox was attacked by North Vietnamese torpedo boats in the Gulf of Tonkin. President Lyndon Johnson responded by sending U.S. military aircraft to bomb North Vietnamese vessels on August 4. President Johnson responded to the attack on the U.S.S. Maddox by sending military aircraft to bomb North Vietnamese vessels on August 4, 1964. He then requested a resolution from Congress to support necessary actions to protect U.S. armed forces and assist SEATO nations. Congress passed the \"Gulf of Tonkin resolution\" on August 10, 1964, authorizing the President to take all necessary measures to defend against armed attacks and maintain peace in Southeast Asia. The Gulf of Tonkin resolution authorized the President to take necessary measures to defend against armed attacks in Southeast Asia. It stated that the United States was prepared to use armed force to assist SEATO nations. The resolution would expire when peace and security in the area were assured or if Congress terminated it earlier. Congress repealed the resolution in 1971. President Reagan announced sending a small contingent of U.S. troops in 1982. President Reagan sent a small contingent of U.S. troops to Lebanon for temporary peacekeeping as part of a multinational force. The Marines left Lebanon after overseeing the departure of the PLO force, and a new multinational force was formed to help maintain order until lawful authorities could take over. After the withdrawal of the first group of U.S. Marines from Lebanon, key events included the assassination of Lebanon President-elect Bashir Gemayel, Israeli forces entering West Beirut, and the massacre of Palestinian civilians by Lebanese Christian militiamen. President Reagan later sent 1,200 Marines back to Beirut without citing the War Powers Resolution, leading to controversy in Congress. In response, the Lebanon Emergency Assistance Act of 1983 was passed, requiring statutory authorization for any significant increase in U.S. Armed Forces in Lebanon. President Reagan reported on the Lebanon situation on August 30, 1983, after fighting broke out and two Marines were killed. Calls in Congress for invocation of the War Powers Resolution increased as Marine casualties rose. Legislation was introduced, including S.J.Res. 159 by Senator Charles Mathias authorizing forces to remain in Lebanon for 120 days after the 60-day period expired. After Marine casualties in Lebanon, legislation was introduced in Congress, including H.J.Res. 348 and S.J.Res. 163, regarding the War Powers Resolution. An amendment to the FY1984 continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 367) restricted funds for peacekeeping activities in Lebanon after 60 days without a report from the President. A compromise resolution was reached on September 20, 1983. On October 12, 1983, President Reagan signed the Multinational Force in Lebanon Resolution into law, authorizing the Marines to remain for 18 months. The resolution contained provisions for termination if foreign forces withdrew from Lebanon or if the United Nations or the Government of Lebanon assumed control. President Reagan signed the Multinational Force in Lebanon Resolution into law on October 12, 1983, allowing the Marines to stay for 18 months. The resolution outlined conditions for termination, including the assumption of responsibilities by the United Nations or the Government of Lebanon, implementation of security arrangements, or withdrawal of other countries from the force. Congress also determined that the War Powers Resolution requirements became effective on August 29, 1983. President Reagan expressed appreciation for the support but disagreed with certain Congress findings and expressed concerns about practical issues and constitutionality of certain sections. President Reagan signed the Multinational Force in Lebanon Resolution into law in 1983, allowing Marines to stay for 18 months. He expressed concerns about the constitutionality of certain sections and emphasized that his authority as President and Commander in Chief cannot be ceded. In 1990, Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait under President Saddam Hussein's direction. In 1990, Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait, prompting President George H.W. Bush to deploy U.S. armed forces to the region to deter further aggression. By the end of the year, approximately 350,000 U.S. forces had been deployed to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf region. In November 1990, Representative Ron Dellums and other Democratic Members of Congress sought a judicial order to prevent the President from engaging in hostilities without congressional authorization. In December, Judge Harold Greene denied a judicial order sought by Democratic Members of Congress to stop offensive military operations in Operation Desert Shield. President Bush later secured international support for using force to free Kuwait from Iraqi occupation, authorized by U.N. Resolution 678. President George H.W. Bush requested congressional support for using all necessary means to implement U.N. Resolution 678 to end the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait by January 15, 1991. He emphasized the need to protect America's security and clarified that the request was for support, not authority, for the military operation in the Persian Gulf. President Bush believed he had the authority to implement UN resolutions without needing Congressional approval. Both houses passed the \"Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution,\" allowing the President to use military force to achieve compliance with UN resolutions after exhausting diplomatic efforts. President Bush signed H.J.Res. 77 into law, authorizing the use of military force against Iraq to enforce UN resolutions after diplomatic efforts failed. The resolution required the President to report every 60 days on Iraq's compliance. Bush clarified that this action did not change the executive branch's stance on the President's authority to use military force or the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution. On January 16, 1991, President Bush determined that diplomatic efforts had failed to compel Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. He reported to Congress on January 18 that U.S. forces had begun combat operations. On September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked planes, leading to nearly 3,000 deaths. President George W. Bush called these attacks acts of war. After the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush declared them acts of war and vowed to use all resources to conquer the enemy. Consultations with Congress led to discussions on a joint resolution authorizing military action. Draft language was negotiated between September 13 and 14, 2001. On September 14, 2001, a joint resolution authorizing the President to use force against those responsible for the 9/11 attacks was passed by the Senate and later by the House of Representatives. President Bush signed the measure into law on September 18, 2001. The joint resolution passed after the 9/11 attacks authorizes military force against nations, organizations, or persons involved in terrorism to prevent future attacks. It is a specific statutory authorization under the War Powers Resolution, allowing force against not just nations but also organizations and individuals linked to the attacks. This authorization is unprecedented in American history. The authorization of use of force against unnamed nations is consistent with previous instances where authority was given to act against aggressors. President George W. Bush praised Congress for passing the joint resolution after 9/11, recognizing his authority under the Constitution. The Bush Administration interpreted the authority of the President under the Constitution to take action against terrorism, including using force and the Armed Forces, both within and outside the United States. The Supreme Court affirmed the President's powers to detain \"enemy combatants\" captured in Afghanistan but allowed detainees to challenge their detention in federal court. The Bush Administration used the joint resolution to justify detaining \"enemy combatants\" and conducting surveillance without following FISA procedures. The Supreme Court ruled in 2006 that the resolution does not override the UCMJ for trial purposes. In 2002, the Bush Administration expressed concerns about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs and sought congressional and UN support for action against Saddam Hussein's regime. President Bush addressed the U.N. General Assembly, expressing U.S. concerns about Iraq's violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions since the Gulf War. He emphasized working with the Security Council but also warned of enforcing resolutions if Iraq did not comply. The White House proposed legislation for military force against Iraq to restore peace in the region. The Senate debated the proposed legislation introduced as S.J.Res. 45 on September 26, while the House introduced H.J.Res. 114 with modifications. The House adopted the joint resolution on October 10 by a vote of 296-133, followed by the Senate passing it on October 11 by a vote of 77-23. President Bush signed the Authorization for Use of Military Force against Iraq Resolution of 2002 into law on October 16. President Bush signed the Authorization for Use of Military Force against Iraq Resolution of 2002 into law on October 16, 2002, stating that Congress had shown unity on the threat posed by Iraq. He emphasized that Iraq must comply with U.N. resolutions and eliminate weapons of mass destruction to avoid forceful action. The President clarified that seeking support from Congress and signing the resolution did not change the executive branch's stance on the President's authority to use force. President Bush signed the Authorization for Use of Military Force against Iraq Resolution of 2002 into law, emphasizing the threat posed by Iraq and the need to enforce U.N. resolutions. He stated his intent to consult with Congress regularly and submit reports every 60 days. The resolution authorizes the President to use the armed forces to defend national security against Iraq's threat and enforce relevant U.N. resolutions. The Authorization for Use of Military Force against Iraq Resolution of 2002 requires the President to communicate to Congress his determination for the use of force, consistent with the fight against terrorism and enforcement of UN resolutions. It also mandates periodic reports to Congress and expresses support for prompt action by the Security Council. The Authorization for Use of Military Force against Iraq Resolution of 2002 grants the President broad authority to use force to enforce compliance with relevant Security Council resolutions concerning Iraq. This authority extends beyond compelling disarmament to implementing all concerns expressed in those resolutions, without requiring a direct link to the September 11, 2001 attacks. The Authorization for Use of Military Force against Iraq Resolution of 2002 grants the President authority to use force for defending the national security of the United States against the threat posed by Iraq. It limits the use of force to Iraq, requires peaceful means to be exhausted first, and mandates that the force used be necessary and appropriate. The authorization is not dependent on prior approval from the U.N. Security Council. The Bush and Obama Administrations used P.L. 107-243 to maintain U.S. armed forces in Iraq until 2011. U.S. military operations in Iraq continued under this authority due to perceived threats to national security and enforcement of U.N. resolutions. The Multinational Force in Iraq, led by the U.S., was terminated in 2008, but U.S. forces remained in Iraq from 2009 onwards. The U.S. armed forces remained in Iraq under an agreement with Iraq until December 31, 2011. Despite arguments for congressional approval, funds were still provided for military operations in Iraq. P.L. 107-243, the authorization for the use of force, remains in effect, but its continued effectiveness is uncertain. The authorization for the use of force in P.L. 107-243 is still current U.S. law, but its effectiveness is in question. The President could potentially use this authority to reintroduce U.S. armed forces into Iraq if deemed necessary for national security or to enforce U.N. resolutions. However, any decision to do so would likely face opposition from some Members of Congress and others advocating for the repeal of open-ended use of force authorizations. Peace and war are traditionally seen as distinct forms of state relations under international law, with peace defined as a state where cooperation and the absence of violence prevail. Peace is characterized by cooperation and the absence of violence, with States respecting sovereignty and refraining from force. In contrast, war is defined as armed hostility between States, involving the use of force to overpower others and suspending peacetime laws for the laws of war. War allows for actions like killing enemy combatants, taking prisoners of war, seizing enemy property, and disrupting diplomatic and commercial relations. War traditionally terminates diplomatic and commercial relations and treaty obligations between warring States, creating a state of war even without actual hostilities. A declaration of war changes the relationship between states from peace to war, signaling the shift from the law of peace to the law of war under international law. The shift from peace to war under international law is marked by a declaration of war, which changes diplomatic and commercial relations between states. Authorizations for the use of force do not automatically create a state of war, as seen in the limited use of force against France in 1798. This statute allowed for the seizure of armed vessels that had committed depredations or were planning to do so, illustrating the difference between laws enacted during peace and those during war. The President was given power to apprehend subjects of hostile nations without a public proclamation of war. Authorization was given to seize French armed vessels, not merchant vessels, and to increase the army in case of war or imminent danger. The absence of a declaration of war raised questions about the need for these authorizations, as war itself grants the right to seize vessels and apprehend enemies. The suspension of commercial intercourse during war was also questioned, as war inherently suspends such activities. The absence of a declaration of war raised questions about the need for authorizations to seize vessels and apprehend enemies. The traditional understanding of war and its effects on treaties and contracts is disputed among scholars. The legality of initiating war is debated among scholars, with international agreements like the Kellogg-Briand Peace Pact and the UN Charter outlawing aggressive war. The Nuremberg Tribunal reinforced this by deeming aggressive war a crime. The UN Charter aims to prevent war and prohibits the use of force against any state's territorial integrity or political independence. The UN Charter prohibits the use of force against any state's territorial integrity or political independence, establishing collective security through the Security Council. The concept of war as a legal right of states, except in self-defense, has been challenged, especially with the involvement of non-State actors in armed conflicts. The clarity of the consequences of war in traditional international law has been muddied in the modern era. In the modern era, the concept of war as a legal right of states has become unclear. States engaged in armed conflict often avoid labeling it as a war, leading to complexities in diplomatic relationships and treaty obligations. Despite the lack of a formal declaration of war, international conventions regulating the means of warfare and protecting certain categories of persons still apply. A state of war triggers the right to kill in battle, necessitates adherence to conventions on waging war, and invokes principles of necessity and proportionality. The concept of war as a legal right of states has become unclear in modern times. Declarations of war have fallen out of use, with the last one by the United States in 1942. International laws on waging war and protecting certain persons still apply, but the legal right of states to engage in war has become constrained. The legal right of states to declare war has become unclear in modern times, with declarations of war falling out of use. International laws on waging war and protecting certain persons still apply regardless of war declaration. States may still issue declarations of war for self-defense, but the legal consequences may not differ significantly from armed conflict authorized by force. American jurisprudence once distinguished between general and limited war, with a declaration committing the nation to a general war. In international law, distinctions exist between general and limited war. General war involves a formal declaration and allows for hostilities between entire nations, while limited war is more restricted in scope. In international law, distinctions exist between general and limited war. Limited war is authorized by specific powers and is more restricted in scope, involving external contention by force between some members of two nations. Congress has the power to declare a general war or wage a limited war, with authorizations for the use of force understood to have narrower legal consequences than declarations of war. Declarations of war are reserved for general conflicts against specific countries, empowering the President to utilize the full military force of the United States. In contrast to declarations of war, authorizations for the use of force have more limited legal consequences but can still allow broad military actions. Both declarations of war and authorizations eliminate time limits on the President's use of armed forces under the War Powers Resolution. The Powers Resolution and executive orders can legitimize the killing of foreign officials. Declarations of war activate statutes giving the President special powers, such as controlling trade, manufacturing, transportation, and communications. The Alien Enemy Act also grants the President substantial authority. The Alien Enemy Act grants the President substantial discretionary authority over nationals of an enemy state in the US, activating special powers for electronic surveillance and military enlistments. It also allows for the Coast Guard to be part of the Navy, gives the President control over commanders' appointments, and prioritizes military use of natural resources. An authorization for the use of force does not automatically trigger these powers, but they can come into effect if a state of war is declared. The authorization for the use of force does not automatically trigger special powers granted to the President under the Alien Enemy Act. However, these powers, including detention without trial, can be activated in a national emergency. The legal authority for executive actions in response to the 2001 terrorist attacks remains unresolved. The authorization to use force in response to the 2001 terrorist attacks is seen as broader than a declaration of war, allowing for detention powers without specific rules. This includes the detention of U.S. citizens and the conduct of electronic surveillance outside of existing laws like the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The authorization to use force post-2001 attacks is broader than a declaration of war, allowing detention powers without specific rules, including for U.S. citizens and electronic surveillance. A declaration of war or authorization for force triggers standby statutory authorities and has implications for the War Powers Resolution. The War Powers Resolution (WPR) of 1973 was created to restore congressional authority in authorizing the use of force. It mandates that the President consult with Congress before introducing armed forces into hostilities and report to Congress within 48 hours in certain situations. The War Powers Resolution (WPR) of 1973 requires the President to consult with Congress before deploying U.S. forces and report to Congress within 48 hours. Section 5(b) of the Resolution states that Congress must declare war or authorize the use of force to extend the 60-90 day withdrawal mandate. The last three authorizations for the use of force have tolled this mandate. The War Powers Resolution requires consultation with Congress before deploying U.S. forces and reporting within 48 hours. Recent authorizations for the use of force have extended the 60-90 day withdrawal mandate, granting the President extraordinary powers under the Trading With the Enemy Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The Trading With the Enemy Act (TWEA) and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) are invoked in different circumstances. TWEA can be used in times of war or a state of war, while IEEPA is triggered by a presidential declaration of a national emergency. TWEA grants broad economic authorities, but since 1977, its application is limited to times of declared or undeclared war. IEEPA is commonly used to freeze assets of foreign entities in the U.S. The Trading With the Enemy Act (TWEA) and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) grant broad economic authorities in different circumstances. TWEA is used in times of war, while IEEPA is triggered by a presidential declaration of a national emergency. TWEA can investigate, regulate, and compel transactions involving property with foreign interests, while IEEPA is commonly used to freeze assets of foreign entities in the U.S. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) grants the President broad powers to regulate international transactions and confiscate property of foreign entities in the U.S. It does not include authorities for purely domestic transactions, regulation of bullion, or seizure of records. However, the \"USA PATRIOT Act\" in 2001 amended IEEPA to allow the President to confiscate and take title to any property of foreign entities that have engaged in hostilities or attacks against the United States. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 amended IEEPA and TWEA to allow frozen assets of foreign terrorist states in the U.S. to be used for civil judgments. TWEA can be triggered by a declaration of war, giving the President authority over trade relations with the enemy. The Alien Enemy Act, enacted in 1798, authorizes the President to deport, detain, or condition the stay of alien enemies in the U.S. during declared war or invasion. It grants the President various powers such as seizing resources, controlling transportation systems, and taking control of communications facilities. The Alien Enemy Act, enacted in 1798, grants the President the power to deport, detain, or restrict the stay of alien enemies during times of war. The Supreme Court recognizes the President's authority to apprehend, restrain, secure, and remove enemy aliens without delay or hindrance by litigation for wartime security. The President must publicly announce the event that triggers the act and establish regulations for the treatment of enemy aliens, including internment or removal as necessary for public safety. During times of war, the President has the authority to impose restrictions on alien enemies for public safety. This includes barring them from possessing firearms, residing in certain areas, and publishing certain materials. Procedural rights for alien enemies under the Alien Enemy Act are limited compared to other aliens, with restricted hearing rights and judicial review. President Roosevelt also set up community hearing boards for internment recommendations during World War II. The Alien Enemy Act grants limited rights to alien enemies facing removal, allowing time to wind up affairs and limited judicial review. The President's power to control alien enemies under the act is extensive, not solely triggered by an authorization for the use of force. Civilian federal criminal law provisions apply to specified conduct in times of war, regardless of a formal declaration by Congress. Some statutes related to criminal prohibitions in times of war may be triggered by a declaration of war or a deemed state of war. These statutes include actions such as secreting or destroying records of a war contractor, aiding in the escape of prisoners of war or enemy aliens, and related offenses. 18 U.S.C.A. Section 792 prohibits harboring or concealing persons involved in offenses under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7793 or 794, while Section 793 prohibits gathering or transmitting national defense information for the benefit of a foreign nation. 18 U.S.C.A. Section 794 prohibits gathering or delivering information relating to national defense with intent to harm the United States or benefit a foreign nation, including recording or communicating information about Armed Forces, ships, aircraft, or war materials to the enemy. Section 1038 prohibits making false statements about the death, injury, capture, or disappearance of a member of the Armed Forces. The curr_chunk discusses various offenses under different sections of 18 U.S.C.A., including genocide, aliens engaging in piracy, willful destruction of war material, and producing defective war material during times of war or national emergency. The curr_chunk discusses offenses under different sections of 18 U.S.C.A., including treason, misprision of treason, seditious conspiracy, and engaging in activities to adversely affect the armed forces during wartime. The curr_chunk discusses various federal and state criminal law provisions that apply during wartime, including prohibitions on recruiting soldiers for armed hostilities against the United States, war crimes, and the development or possession of biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons. The curr_chunk discusses different federal criminal law provisions related to specific offenses such as sabotage of nuclear facilities, use of weapons of mass destruction, explosives offenses, hostage-taking, kidnapping, murder of foreign officials, and murder of federal officers. During wartime, the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act extends the statute of limitations for certain crimes against the United States for five years beyond the end of hostilities. This Act was originally enacted during World War II and applies when the United States is at war or Congress has authorized the use of military force. During wartime, the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act extends the statute of limitations for certain crimes against the United States for five years beyond the end of hostilities. Congress amended the provision in 2008 to also apply upon the enactment of an authorization to use military force. Other criminal law provisions in the Uniform Code of Military Justice apply specifically in times of war. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) authorizes electronic surveillance, physical searches, and the use of investigative tools for gathering foreign intelligence information during wartime. FISA allows the President to authorize electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 15 days following a declaration of war by Congress. The President, through the Attorney General, may authorize physical searches without a court order under FISA for up to 15 days following a declaration of war by Congress. Pen registers and trap and trace devices can also be authorized for the same period. These provisions are not triggered by an authorization for the use of force. FISA has been amended to allow the use of investigative tools without a court order in emergency situations determined by the Attorney General. The AG must confirm the emergency, ensure the factual basis for surveillance exists, inform a FISC judge, and apply for a court order within 72 hours for electronic surveillance or physical search, or 48 hours for other methods. FISA allows the use of investigative tools in emergency situations determined by the Attorney General, with a requirement to apply for a court order within 72 hours for electronic surveillance or physical search, or 48 hours for other methods. Emergency powers may be utilized depending on the circumstances, including provisions within FISA for authorization of force or congressional declaration of war. Killing or attempting to kill a foreign official or internationally protected person is a crime under 18 U.S.C.A. Section 1116. The United States courts have jurisdiction over the killing or attempted killing of internationally protected persons in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1116 committed outside the country under certain circumstances. Executive Order 12333 prohibits any person employed by the U.S. Government from engaging in assassination. The executive order prohibits U.S. Government employees from engaging in assassination, but does not define the term or address its applicability in armed conflicts. Targeting enemy command structures in war may be lawful under international law and not prohibited by domestic law, especially in a declared state of war or with authorization for the use of force. The legal effect of an authorization for the use of force on the assassination ban is ambiguous. An executive order can be revoked by the President through another executive order, and Congress can repeal it if it was issued based on statutory authority. The assassination ban was part of an executive order issued by President Reagan in 1981, but the nature of the authority underlying the ban is not specified. If there is a statutory basis for the ban, an authorization for the use of force could potentially modify or repeal it in certain contexts. The Defense Production Act of 1950 (DPA) was enacted to mobilize the nation's productive capacity during the Korean War. It plays a key role in maintaining national defense readiness and has been reauthorized and amended multiple times. Three titles of the DPA are currently in effect and are set to expire in 2014 unless renewed. The Defense Production Act of 1950 (DPA) provides the President with authority to prioritize defense contracts and allocate critical materials for national defense. This authority can also support military requirements of allied nations. The DPA has been used post-Cold War, such as during the 1990-1991 operations in the Persian Gulf. The Defense Production Act of 1950 (DPA) authorizes the President to prioritize defense contracts and allocate critical materials for national defense, including supporting military requirements of allied nations. The DPA has been utilized in various operations, such as in the Persian Gulf during Desert Shield/Storm, Bosnia deployment, and California's energy crisis in 2000-2001. Title I of the DPA prohibits the President from exercising priorities and allocations authority without specific findings, and includes provisions for hoarding designated materials, penalties for violations, and small business preferences. Title III of the Defense Production Act authorizes financial incentives to expand defense-related productive capacity of critical components, technology items, and industrial resources essential to national defense. These incentives include loan guarantees, federal loans, purchases, purchase guarantees, and equipment installation in contractor facilities. The authorities under this title expand during national emergencies declared by the President or Congress, with provisions relevant to defense industrial preparedness. Various provisions related to defense industrial preparedness are outlined in the Defense Production Act. These include authorizing antitrust defenses for firms in voluntary agreements, establishing the National Defense Executive Reserve (NDER), and the \"Exon-Florio Amendment\" allowing the President to block foreign acquisitions threatening national security. Declarations of war and use of force also raise legal issues. The legal issue surrounding declarations of war and authorizations for the use of force is their impact on insurance contracts, specifically regarding clauses excluding coverage for \"acts of war.\" The events of September 11, 2001, being labeled as an \"act of war\" raised concerns about insurance companies denying claims related to the attacks. However, a declaration of war by Congress does not necessarily affect the interpretation of such exclusion clauses in private contracts. The parties' intent, not Congress's description, is crucial in determining whether events like September 11 constitute \"acts of war\" in insurance contracts. In insurance contracts, terrorist attacks are considered \"acts of war,\" but exclusion clauses may be narrowly interpreted to allow recovery for the insured. In the case of Pan American World Airways v. Aetna Casualty, a hijacking was deemed too contained to fall under the war exclusion. The court focused on causation and identity in its decision, stating that the causation inquiry stops at the efficient physical cause of the loss. The court in the Pan Am case ruled that the terrorist organization responsible for hijacking the airplane was not a de facto government, therefore the exclusion clause did not apply. Congress enacted the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act after 9/11 to ensure coverage for acts of terrorism. Various crimes defined under the Uniform Code of Military Justice occur primarily in states of hostilities, with some only occurring or aggravated during wartime. The Manual for Courts Martial sets out Rules for Court Martial, including definitions for expressions related to military justice. The Manual for Courts Martial defines \"time of war\" as a period declared by Congress or determined by the President for the application of certain rules. Prosecutions for certain crimes can be triggered without a congressional declaration, but may require a state of war. Military courts use pragmatic tests to determine the existence of a \"time of war\" for specific offenses, with statutes of limitations possibly being tolled during wartime. During a \"time of war,\" statutes of limitations on certain offenses may be suspended until three years after hostilities end. The military's jurisdiction expands during wartime, allowing for court-martial of individuals in connection with U.S. property or contracts related to the war effort. Congress amended the UCMJ to allow for court-martial of civilians during undeclared wars. During wartime, military jurisdiction expands to cover civilians accused of violating certain offenses, allowing for court-martial proceedings. The Military Commissions Act of 2009 permits the trial by military commission of individuals not subject to the UCMJ. The Military Commissions Act of 2009 allows for the trial of \"alien unprivileged enemy belligerents\" for violations of the law of war or other offenses by military commission, regardless of the authorization for the use of force. The definition of \"unprivileged enemy belligerent\" is limited to those who engaged in hostilities against the US or its partners, with exceptions for Al Qaeda members. This jurisdiction does not require a declaration of war or authorization to use force. Chapter 1209 of title 10 of the United States Code relates to activation of reserve forces, including the Ready Reserve forces like the Army National Guard and Air National Guard. Sections 12302 through 12304 allow reserve forces to be called to active duty for fixed periods without a congressional declaration of war or national emergency. In contrast, Section 12301 can be exercised in times of war or national emergency declared by Congress, allowing reserve forces to be called to active duty for the duration of the war or emergency plus six months. The Standby Reserve can be called to active service under Section 12301 for the duration of a war or national emergency. The Retired Reserve can also be called to service under Section 12301 for the duration. Stop loss authority under Section 12305 allows the President to suspend certain provisions of law for essential personnel called to active service. When individuals are called to active service under Section 12301 for the duration of a war or national emergency, rules regarding promotions, retirements, and separations may not apply. The period of active service can be extended to six months beyond the war's duration under Section 671a, unless terminated earlier by the Secretary. A declaration of war is not necessary, but it can trigger the application of Section 12301. Reemployment rights for reservists and benefits under USERRA and the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act do not require a declaration of war. The Relief Act (50 U.S.C.A. App. \u00a7\u00a7501\u2014596) does not require a declaration of war but depends on the authority for the call to active duty. Section 3 of title 14 of the United States Code states that the Coast Guard can operate as a service in the Navy upon a declaration of war.

Revenue Code Section 112 excludes military pay for active service in a combat zone from gross income, making it tax-free. The exemption also applies to hospitalized service members due to combat injuries, with a two-year limit. The definition of a \"combat zone\" is designated by the President in an Executive Order. This exemption applies to service in Korean and Vietnam conflicts, as well as to POWs and those missing in action. Pay exempt under IRC Section 112 is also free from federal income tax. Qualified military benefits, including bonus payments in a combat zone, are exempt from federal income tax withholding. Due dates for tax filing and payment are deferred for uniformed service members in combat zones. Telephone calls from combat zones are exempt from federal excise tax. The \"additional estate tax\" does not apply to members of the Armed Forces killed in action in a combat zone. An exemption from federal income tax is granted to members of the Armed Forces who die in a combat zone or as a result of injuries sustained in such a zone. Unpaid taxes at the time of death are forgiven. Similar exemptions apply to civilian federal employees involved in military actions. Special rules for spouses of missing persons are also outlined in the Code. Chapter 11 of title 38 of the United States Code relates to wartime disability compensation for veterans. Disability must result from injury or disease contracted in active military service during a period of war, without requiring a congressional declaration of war. Some veterans' benefits depend on service during a period of war, while service-connected deaths are compensated regardless of a declared war by Congress. The eligibility for burial benefits for members of the Armed Forces is not dependent on a congressional declaration of war.

After the President's address, Senator Martin introduced S.J.Res. 1 to declare war, which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations. Representative Flood introduced a companion resolution, H.J.Res 24, which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs. The Senate committee reported S.J.Res. 1 with an amendment the next day. Senator LaFollette objected to an immediate consideration of the resolution, leading to a one-day delay as per Senate Rule XVII.

The measure can be amended or tabled, and a vote on final passage is required. Section 6(b) of the War Powers Resolution requires the House or Senate to vote on final passage of a measure within three days of it becoming pending business. This provision aims to prevent filibusters in the Senate and allows either house to adjust the timing and length of floor consideration through various motions. These motions include postponing consideration to a specific date, tabling or recommittal of the measure, or shortening the debate period. Section 6(c) and 6(d) of the War Powers Resolution outline expedited procedures for the House and Senate to reach agreement on passed measures.
