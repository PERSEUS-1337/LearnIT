    "content": "Policymakers are focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), but there is less emphasis on reducing non-CO2 gases like nitrous oxide (N2O). N2O reduction efforts can help combat climate change and may be regulated under the Clean Air Act without the need for new legislation. Non-CO2 greenhouse gases, including methane, N2O, and others, accounted for 17% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2009. In 2009, nitrous oxide (N2O) accounted for 4% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and is 310 times more potent than CO2. N2O is also the leading ozone-depleting substance emitted currently. Reducing N2O emissions could significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emission reduction efforts. The agriculture sector is the primary source of nitrous oxide emissions, with the bulk coming from fertilizing agricultural soils. Strategies for reducing N2O emissions are limited due to the dispersed sources. Most N2O is released during specific nitrogen cycle processes when synthetic nitrogen fertilizers are used. More efficient fertilizer application methods can help reduce excess nitrogen available for release into the atmosphere. Nitrous oxide (N2O), known as \"laughing gas,\" contributes to climate change and ozone depletion. It lingers in the atmosphere for decades and is 310 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. N2O emissions have remained fairly constant around 325 million metric tons CO2 equivalent. Policy options for emission reduction and federal support are discussed. Nitrous oxide emissions have been fairly constant around 325 million metric tons CO2 equivalent from 2005 to 2007, dropping below 300 million metric tons CO2 equivalent in 2009. Agricultural soil management is the main anthropogenic source of N2O emissions, accounting for over two-thirds of emissions in the US. Other sources include combustion by mobile sources, manure management, and nitric acid production. Agricultural soil management is a significant source of N2O emissions, with corn and soybean crops emitting the largest amounts due to nitrogen fertilizer applications and fixation rates. Understanding the nitrogen cycle is crucial for crafting policies to reduce emissions from anthropogenic sources. Nitrogen moves through the soil and atmosphere in various forms, with processes like nitrogen fixation converting it into a plant-available form. The major processes in the nitrogen cycle include nitrogen fixation, mineralization, nitrification, and denitrification. Excess nitrogen fertilizer can lead to increased nitrification, causing nitrate leaching and eutrophication. Nitrous oxide is a byproduct of nitrification and denitrification, with mitigation options available for agricultural soil management and nitric acid production. Mitigation options for nitric acid production and agricultural soil management aim to reduce nitrogen fertilizer excess and soil disturbance. Reduction efficiencies range from 85% to 95%. Best-management practices focus on providing nutrients for crop production and preventing soil and nutrient loss. Economic incentives and crop yield expectations drive adoption of these practices. The EPA's decision not to include reporting N2O emissions from agricultural soil management in the Final Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule was due to the lack of low-cost or simple direct measurement methods. Enforcement options for monitoring reduced nitrogen fertilization applications include voluntary verification, third-party verifiers, or government intervention. Managing a large-scale program for greenhouse gas emission reduction purposes at a national level may be challenging. EPA also released a proposed rule requiring new or modified facilities triggering PSD permitting requirements to apply for a revision to their operating permits. The USDA provides financial and technical assistance for nutrient management through its conservation programs. The Agricultural Research Service is studying the relationship between agricultural practices and nitrous oxide emissions. Efforts are being made in the transportation sector to reduce N2O emissions, with a proposed per-vehicle emission standard effective in 2012. EPA has allocated financial resources for emission reduction efforts. Congress is investigating the reduction of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions, including N2O, to mitigate climate change. N2O emissions could be a short-term response in the larger scheme of mitigation efforts due to their small contribution to the greenhouse gas inventory compared to CO2 emissions. Congress could consider N2O emissions reduction as part of a comprehensive strategy to address climate change. Congress is exploring ways to reduce N2O emissions to combat climate change, which could also contribute to ozone recovery. N2O is not currently regulated as an ODS, unlike other emissions like chlorofluorocarbon-11 and halon-1211. The potential benefits of limiting N2O emissions for climate change purposes are being considered. The first-ever published ozone depletion potential (ODP) value assigned to N2O is 0.017, lower than CFC-11. Despite its low ODP value, the quantity and potency of N2O emissions as a greenhouse gas can cause harm. N2O is not classified as a class I substance under the Clean Air Act due to its ODP value, but it could be regulated as a class II substance. Congress may consider incorporating N2O's ozone depletion impacts into climate change policy proposals. Congress may consider incorporating N2O into its climate change policy proposals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and further ozone recovery achievements. Options include classifying N2O emission reduction as an eligible offset type, including N2O in a cap-and-trade program, or directing EPA to regulate N2O under the Clean Air Act. Improving N2O estimation, measurement, and reporting methods, along with potential financial incentives, may be necessary. Lessons from the Montreal Protocol could inform Congress on the long-term implications of climate change policy options. The Montreal Protocol phased out certain ozone-depleting substances, but N2O was not included. However, the success of the Protocol in reducing targeted ODSs has led to N2O emerging as the leading ODS."
