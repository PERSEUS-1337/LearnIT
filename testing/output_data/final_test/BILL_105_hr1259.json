    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Dolphin-Safe Fishing Act\" and references the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. The Congress finds that the provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, including the ban on imports from nations fishing for tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and the dolphin-safe labeling requirements, have effectively reduced dolphin mortalities. The American public relies on the integrity of the dolphin-safe labeling regime, which promotes dolphin conservation through education and market mechanisms. In 1993, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission started a dolphin conservation program to reduce dolphin deaths and regulate yellowfin tuna harvest in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. The Act aims to recognize efforts by tuna fishermen to reduce dolphin harm and lift the ban on importing dolphin-safe tuna from compliant vessels in the region. The Act aims to strengthen the dolphin-safe label to prevent its misuse on tuna products harvested with dolphins, and to encourage measures to protect sea turtles and reduce nontarget species harvest in the yellowfin tuna fishery in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. The Act aims to strengthen the dolphin-safe label on tuna products harvested with dolphins and reduce nontarget species mortality in the yellowfin tuna fishery. Amendments to Title I comparability embargo provisions. Authorization of Importation: Amendment to require exporting nations to provide evidence that yellowfin tuna harvested with purse seine nets in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and products derived from them do not involve dolphins being chased during the fishing voyage. The text chunk discusses the conditions under which tuna can be harvested after the Dolphin-Safe Fishing Act, requiring vessels to be registered in nations party to the La Jolla Agreement and comply with its regulations to prevent dolphin mortalities. The text chunk outlines conditions for tuna importation, including limits on dolphin mortalities and requirements for vessels to avoid major fines under the La Jolla Agreement. The text chunk specifies conditions for tuna importation, focusing on limits for dolphin mortality in fishing operations in the Eastern Pacific Ocean by vessels registered in a specific country. The requirements ensure steady progress towards achieving the goals of the La Jolla Agreement. The text chunk amends Section 101 to include acceptance of documentary evidence for compliance with the La Jolla Agreement's goals of reducing dolphin mortality and preventing involvement in illegal drug transport by tuna fishing vessels. The Secretary will not accept documentary evidence for yellowfin tuna harvested by a vessel if the country where the vessel is registered does not provide complete and accurate information necessary for compliance with the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Conservation of Tunas and Dolphins in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. AMENDMENTS TO TITLE III GLOBAL MORATORIUM PROVISIONS. Amendments to Title III Global Moratorium Provisions include changes to reduce dolphin mortality in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean by nations harvesting yellowfin tuna. Efforts to eliminate the practice of chasing and netting dolphins are recognized to ensure a continued reduction in dolphin mortality. Amendments to reduce dolphin mortality in tuna fishing operations include prohibiting the intentional chasing and netting of dolphins. Importation of yellowfin tuna or other fish products in violation of bans is also addressed. The Dolphin Safe Standard is updated to regulate tuna products containing specific types of tuna. The Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act regulates the dolphin safe status of tuna products, ensuring compliance with specific paragraphs to prevent violations. SEC. 5. DOLPHIN SAFE LABELING STANDARDS. Section 901(d) of the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act is amended to prohibit the use of the term 'Dolphin Safe' on tuna products that were harvested using harmful fishing methods, such as driftnet fishing or purse seine nets in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. The Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act prohibits the use of the term 'Dolphin Safe' on tuna products harvested using harmful fishing methods in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, unless specific criteria are met to ensure dolphin safety. The Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act sets criteria for tuna products to be labeled as 'Dolphin Safe', including certification that no dolphins were harmed during the fishing voyage. The Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act requires tuna products to be labeled as 'Dolphin Safe' if no dolphins were harmed during the fishing voyage, with endorsements from exporters, importers, and processors. The Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act mandates that tuna products must be labeled as 'Dolphin Safe' if no dolphins were harmed during the fishing voyage, with endorsements from the captain of the vessel and an observer certifying the absence of harm to marine mammals during the fishing operation. The Secretary is responsible for identifying and publishing a list of tuna fisheries with significant incidental catches. The Secretary is responsible for identifying and publishing a list of tuna fisheries with significant incidental mortality or serious injury of marine mammals. The Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975 is amended to include a bycatch reduction program for vessels fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. The program aims to release sea turtles and other threatened species alive, reduce the harvest of nontarget species, and minimize the mortality of nontarget species. Equitable financial contributions are required for the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission. The United States is urged to contribute fairly to the expenses of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission based on factors like the number of vessels in the yellowfin tuna fishery and tuna consumption. The Act and its amendments will take effect when the Secretary of Commerce implements the provisions."
