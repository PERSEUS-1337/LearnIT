    "content": "Algeria's strategic importance to the U.S. is highlighted by its size, energy resources, and military strength. The bilateral relationship focuses on counterterrorism, oil and gas sector, and promoting political and economic openness. The \"Bilateral Strategic Dialogue\" covers Counterterrorism, Political, Economic, and Education/Civil Society issues. Secretary of State John Kerry emphasized the need for further cooperation during a visit to Algiers in 2014. Algeria has the financial and human resources to support its claims to regional leadership, but internal decision-making processes and regional rivalries have limited its ability to fulfill aspirations. Tensions within the elite establishment could lead to fracture points under new pressures like succession disputes or security threats. U.S. concerns with security threats in the region have increased since 2011, with groups like Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb exploiting regional political situations. AQIM, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, has expanded its influence in Africa by forming splinter factions and ties to extremist groups in Libya, Tunisia, and Nigeria. The United States has worked with regional partners like Algeria to counter violent extremists, but debates intervention. While large-scale terrorist attacks in Algeria have decreased, threats persist, as seen in a 2013 hostage-seizure by an AQIM splinter faction. Algeria faces rising insecurity along its borders due to spillover from crises in Libya and Mali. The country has increased military presence along the Libyan and Tunisian borders and is mediating peace talks in Mali. Despite having significant foreign reserves from oil and gas production, Algeria struggles to provide enough opportunities for its young workforce, leading to high emigration rates. Algeria's challenges include rising insecurity along its borders due to regional crises, high emigration rates driven by limited opportunities, and ongoing economic and political grievances. The country may need economic diversification, reduced business restrictions, education reforms, and political changes to achieve long-term prosperity. Despite sporadic protests and some political reforms, popular enthusiasm for significant political change appears limited. Disillusionment with the government and aging political elite is widespread, but recent public opinion trends suggest that most Algerians are dissatisfied. Public opinion trends in Algeria show that while most Algerians are dissatisfied with the regime, they are more satisfied than after the Arab Spring. Citizens now prefer gradual reform over mass protests. Satisfaction with the economic situation has increased significantly. Recent protests in the south indicate high expectations for socioeconomic benefits from the state-centric economy. President Abdelaziz Bouteflika was reelected for a fourth term in April. President Abdelaziz Bouteflika's reelection to a fourth term in April 2014 highlighted Algeria's political continuity and raised succession concerns due to his health issues. Opposition parties boycotted the election, and post-election, various groups have tried to form a coalition for political system reforms, facing challenges due to differing ideologies. President Abdelaziz Bouteflika won the 2014 election with 82% of the vote, while his closest rival, Ali Benflis, received about 12%. Benflis alleged fraud and irregularities in the election, with some claiming inflated turnout figures. Despite lower turnout compared to previous elections, Bouteflika remains popular with few national opponents. He reappointed Abdelmalek Sellal as Prime Minister, a technocrat known for his competence. Algeria's political system is characterized by a strong presidency and security concerns. Algeria's political system is dominated by a strong presidency and security apparatus. Bouteflika is connected to the National Liberation Front (FLN), the former sole legal political party. The decision-making process is factionalized and opaque, hindering political and economic reforms. Algeria faces an uncertain transition as the \"revolutionary generation\" retires. President Bouteflika seeks to establish the authority of the presidency by diminishing senior influence. The military intelligence service DRS, led by General Mohamed \"Toufik\" Medi\u00e8ne, holds significant power in Algeria. President Bouteflika has reorganized the military command structure to exert more control, reshuffling DRS directors and limiting their authority. This move is seen as an attempt to reduce the influence of senior military commanders in state decision-making. The bicameral, multiparty parliament in Algeria is weak, with the presidency playing a prominent role in drafting legislation and making budget decisions. The president appoints the Prime Minister and one-third of the upper house of parliament. Members of the lower chamber are directly elected to five-year terms. The 2012 legislative elections did not empower Islamist parties as expected. The 2012 legislative elections in Algeria did not empower Islamist parties as expected. Instead, the FLN and the National Rally for Democracy (RND) gained favor, with the Islamists unable to unite and trailing in the polls. President Bouteflika initiated a constitutional revision process, which may provide clues on potential succession. A presidentially-appointed commission proposed changes in 2014, including reintroducing presidential term limits. The released proposals in Algeria aim to reintroduce presidential term limits, delegate executive powers to the Prime Minister, and enhance legislative prerogatives and civil liberties protections. However, the reform process is criticized for being top-down, non-inclusive, and not addressing systemic issues like the military's role. The political opposition is diverse and divided, with some parties facing internal divisions. Political Islam has reportedly lost popularity in Algeria. Some analysts argue that political Islam has waned in Algeria due to past conflicts, with the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) remaining banned. Salafist social movements have gained prominence, while civil society groups and media are critical of the government. Algeria's trade unions hold significant political influence, with some unions resisting state control. Algeria's political landscape is influenced by trade unions, with some resisting state control. The General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA) holds more power than the government. U.S.-funded civil society groups like the National Democratic Institute (NDI) are active. Human rights organizations include the independent Algerian League for the Defense of Human Rights (LADDH) and the state-backed National Consultative Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. Algeria's history includes a brutal independence war against France from 1954 to 1962. After gaining independence through a referendum in 1962, the FLN became the ruling party in Algeria, backed by the military until the 1980s. The country's political identity is rooted in the anti-colonial struggle, with aging elites tying their legitimacy to their past as freedom fighters. Algeria was a leader in the Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War, aligning ideologically with the Soviet Union. Infighting among revolutionary leaders continued post-independence, leading to factional competition within the government and security sector. Islamist ideology began to rise in the 1980s. In the 1980s, Islamist ideology rose as a challenge to the FLN's leadership in Algeria due to economic hardships and a perceived failure to deliver on promises. Mass protests in October 1988 led to political liberalization and the introduction of multiparty competition, placing Algeria ahead in democratic governance. The Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) emerged as a coalition of Islamist groups amid this political upheaval. The Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) emerged as a broad coalition of Islamist groups in Algeria, criticizing the government from a populist and religious standpoint. FIS leaders called for an Islamic state, denounced democracy, and gained significant electoral success in the early 1990s. However, the army intervened in 1992, leading to the banning of FIS, imprisonment of its leaders, and a decade of conflict with Islamist insurgents resulting in thousands of deaths. The conflict in Algeria between security forces and Islamist insurgents resulted in up to 200,000 deaths. Factional competition within the government influenced politics and the conduct of the state's counterinsurgency campaign. Atrocities against civilians were common, with Islamist militants targeting various groups. The Armed Islamic Group (GIA) and the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) were involved in brutal activities, including terrorist attacks and massacres. Questions remain about the government's involvement in violence against civilians during the conflict. The conflict in Algeria between security forces and Islamist insurgents resulted in up to 200,000 deaths. Most analysts believe that serious abuses, including torture and disappearances, were committed by the security forces. The government also restricted freedom of the press, assembly, and association. Some opposition parties sought common ground with exiled FIS leaders for a return to civilian governance and the democratic process, while others supported the military's strategy against Islamists. Algeria was criticized by Western critics for its actions to prevent the country's disintegration. Relative stability was restored by the early 2000s, aided by an amnesty for former militants introduced by President Bouteflika. The Islamic Salvation Army declared a ceasefire in 1997. The GIA has been inactive since 2002 and is considered defunct. The GSPC merged with Al Qaeda in 2006, becoming AQIM. AQIM has targeted military, state institutions, police, and civilians, including Westerners. The security situation has improved since the 1990s civil conflict, but terrorism remains a threat. AQIM, led by Algerian nationals, is seen as the most active terrorist group in Algeria. AQIM, a terrorist group in Algeria, poses a threat in the Sahel region. Their activities include bombings, hostage-taking, and armed clashes with security forces. They aim to replace governments with an Islamic state and counter Western influence. AQIM and its offshoots are involved in organized crime, including kidnap-for-ransom, raising questions about their motivations. The Obama Administration is concerned about their activities in North and West Africa, arms trafficking, and ties to other extremist groups. French military operations in Mali have disrupted their networks, but they remain active. Algerian security forces conduct counterterrorism operations, and the government has implemented de-radicalization programs and controls over religious sermons. Algeria implements de-radicalization programs and controls religious sermons. It welcomes indirect foreign counterterrorism support and urges international efforts to hinder AQIM's ransom activities. The U.S. State Department considers the terrorist threat in Algiers serious, requiring significant security measures for U.S. personnel. AQIM-produced videos criticize Algeria's security cooperation with the U.S. and France. Fractures within AQIM emerged in 2012, leading to the formation of new groups like Al Murabitoun by Mokhtar bel Mokhtar. Bel Mokhtar claimed responsibility for the In Amenas hostage seizure in January 2013. Both AQIM and Al Murabitoun have pledged support to Al Qaeda in its rivalry with the Islamic State. AQIM originated from the GSPC in Algeria's civil conflict in the 1990s, aligning with Al Qaeda in 2003 under Abdelmalik Droukdel's leadership. AQIM, under Abdelmalik Droukdel's leadership, united with Al Qaeda in 2006 and renamed itself the following year. The practical implications of this union are uncertain, with links between the two possibly nominal but mutually beneficial. Algeria has been a source of transnational terrorists, with some Algerians held at Guantanamo Bay. Algeria, as a regional power, has taken a leading role in coordinating responses to terrorist threats in West Africa. Algeria's longstanding policy of refraining from military operations beyond its borders has been questioned in light of security threats in neighboring states. Regional cooperation efforts aim to deter Western military intervention, but France's influence and differing priorities among Algeria and its southern neighbors have limited the success of security arrangements, including the CEMOC joint command center established in Tamanrasset in 2010. In 2010, the CEMOC was established to coordinate security cooperation among Algeria, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger. Algeria created an intelligence sharing center in Algiers. Morocco has not been invited to participate in regional counterterrorism efforts due to strained ties and differing views on Sahel security. Morocco has increased bilateral outreach to West African states, focusing on defense cooperation and counter-radicalization assistance. The U.S. State Department's 2013 human rights report highlights issues such as restrictions on freedom of assembly, lack of judicial independence, and overuse of pretrial detention. Human rights concerns in Algeria include limitations on government change, police use of force, poor prison conditions, corruption, violence against women, and restrictions on workers' rights. Despite the lifting of a 20-year state of emergency in 2011, protests in Algiers are still banned. Critics argue that the 2012 law on non-governmental associations is overly restrictive. The military and intelligence services are involved in law enforcement without proper oversight. Amnesty policies post-1990s conflict have led to the release of terrorists and lack of accountability for security force abuses. The State Department's 2014 International Religious Freedom Report highlights restrictions on non-Muslim groups in Algeria, including criminalizing proselytizing and difficulties in registering with the government. Despite allowing the reopening of synagogues, none are reportedly in use due to the small Jewish community size and fear of terrorism. Algeria is ranked as \"Tier 3\" in the 2014 Trafficking in Persons Report for not fully complying with minimum standards. The 2014 Trafficking in Persons Report ranks Algeria as \"Tier 3\" for not fully complying with minimum standards to eliminate trafficking. The government is criticized for not investigating or prosecuting perpetrators of sex trafficking and forced labor, lacking measures to protect victims. Algerian officials have objected to these findings. Berber groups in the Kabylie region have been advocating for language and cultural rights, amidst perceived unrest fueled by Arabization policies. Periodic unrest in Kabylie due to discrimination and neglect, exacerbated by AQIM activity. Economic isolation in the region hampers business operations. Algeria heavily relies on hydrocarbons for its economy, with oil and gas providing significant revenues and exports. Production has declined, but exploration, including shale gas, is expanding to offset depletion of resources. Algeria's economy heavily relies on hydrocarbons, with the state-owned company SONATRACH holding 51% ownership in any project. Despite high global energy prices boosting reserves and economic growth, chronic socioeconomic issues persist, leading to protests, labor unrest, and illegal immigration to Europe. Labor productivity is stagnant, and many work in the informal sector. Algeria requires 51% local ownership in hydrocarbon projects and 30% local ownership of foreign import companies. Foreign investor interest has been dampened by red tape, corruption concerns, and security threats. The IMF praises Algeria's macroeconomic stability but criticizes its poor business climate, unsustainable fiscal policies, and lack of diversification. Algeria has yet to qualify for WTO membership and lacks a modern financial market and integration into the global economy. Conditions on foreign investment are argued to encourage domestic companies. Algeria's foreign policy under President Bouteflika has seen a resurgence in diplomatic relations with the United States, France, and the European Union. Despite this, there remains a lingering suspicion of Western motives. The country also maintains strong political and military ties with Russia and plays a significant role in the African Union. Algerian politicians are critical of Israel and its policies towards the Palestinians. Algeria's leaders are critical of Israel and its policies towards the Palestinians. They have also criticized NATO's intervention in Libya and advocate for a non-interventionist approach in Syria. Algeria mediates peace talks in Mali and has strained relations with Morocco over the Western Sahara issue. The disputed territory is largely administered by Morocco, while Algeria supports the independence-seeking Polisario and hosts Sahrawi refugees in camps in southwest Algeria. Algeria supports the Polisario in the Western Sahara conflict, which is under U.N. mediation since 2007. The country has strained relations with Morocco, with the border closed since 1994 due to visa restrictions and a terrorist attack. Algeria has complex ties with France, its former colonizer, with economic links and a large Algerian population in France. French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande visited Algeria in 2012 to improve relations. The U.S.-Algeria relationship is focused on combating terrorism, promoting stability, and enhancing trade and economic partnerships. Despite shared interests, foreign policy priorities often diverge, and U.S. leverage is limited by Algeria's opaque decision-making. The Bilateral Strategic Dialogue initiated in 2012 aims to address regional security crises. Algeria's opaque decision-making and ties to non-Western players like Russia limit U.S. leverage. Secretary of State Kerry pledged increased security assistance during his visit in 2014. President Bouteflika requested real-time U.S. intelligence on the Sahel and Sahara. The U.S. and Algeria have a Joint Military Dialogue, participate in NATO activities, and have agreements on counterterrorism and legal assistance. Algeria is seeking U.S. defense materiel for maritime and aerial capabilities. Algeria is looking to diversify its military acquisitions, particularly in enhancing its maritime and aerial surveillance capacity, moving away from its historical reliance on Russia. U.S. arms sales to Algeria have been hindered by end-use monitoring requirements, which Algeria views as an infringement on its sovereignty. Despite referring to the relationship as a partnership, U.S. officials emphasize mutual benefits and respect Algerian sovereignty. The U.S. does not seek to impose its views or establish a military presence in the region, recognizing Algerian sensitivities. Both countries oppose paying ransoms for terrorist-held hostages. The United States opposes paying ransoms for terrorist-held hostages, a policy shared by Algeria. The Obama Administration has urged political and economic reforms in Algeria, emphasizing the importance of citizens' rights and investment opportunities. U.S.-Algerian ties date back to a Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1795. In 1860, President Abraham Lincoln honored Algerian anti-colonial fighter El Emir Abd el Kader with a gift of guns. Relations between the United States and Algeria have fluctuated over the years, with U.S. investment focused on the oil and gas sector. U.S. firms are particularly interested in Algerian shale gas opportunities. The United States and Algeria have a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) since 2001, with economic ties expanding beyond energy to include industries like financial services and pharmaceuticals. General Electric secured a $2.7 billion contract for Algerian power plants in 2013. The two countries also agreed to cooperate in nuclear energy in 2007. U.S. imports from Algeria were $4.8 billion in 2013, with bilateral exports at $1.8 billion, making Algeria the United States' 56th largest trading partner. Despite potential opportunities, U.S. investors face bureaucratic challenges in Algeria. Despite potential opportunities for U.S. investors in Algeria, they face bureaucratic and policy obstacles. The Investment Climate Statement from the State Department indicates that laws and regulations are constantly shifting and applied unevenly, posing commercial risks. The protection of intellectual property rights is a particular concern, with Algeria listed on the \"Priority Watch List\" by the U.S. Trade Representative. Commercial contracts are also subject to interpretation and revision, presenting challenges for U.S. and international firms operating in the country. Algeria receives limited U.S. bilateral aid but is involved in military and counterterrorism cooperation. The State Department's MEPI funds projects for democratic governance, education, and the financial sector. Educational exchanges with young Algerians are being increased. Assistance for counter-extremism and border security is provided through TSCTP. Aid to Algeria may be restricted due to its poor ranking in the Trafficking in Persons report. The Obama Administration has waived restrictions on aid to Algeria's central government, citing national interest. U.S. policy towards Algeria focuses on counterterrorism, especially after the In Amenas attack in 2013. Concerns over U.S. personnel security in North Africa have increased since the Benghazi attacks in 2012. The FY2015 proposal for a Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund could enhance U.S. cooperation with Algeria, potentially including increased intelligence-sharing. Algeria's role in regional security and potential cooperation with the U.S. may face obstacles due to opaque decision-making. Congress may be interested in U.S. policy towards Algeria regarding human rights, democracy, and the influence of Islamist political parties. Bilateral trade and investment opportunities exist in Algeria's energy resources and large domestic market, despite challenges in the business environment."
