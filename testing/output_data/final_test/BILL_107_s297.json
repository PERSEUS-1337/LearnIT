    "content": "Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new part E - Master Teacher Programs, with section 2401 outlining the details of these programs. In this part, definitions for \"board certified,\" \"master teacher,\" and \"novice teacher\" are provided. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to establish master teacher programs at local educational agencies. The Secretary will distribute grants among local educational agencies with high concentrations of uncertified or provisionally certified teachers. The grant amount is based on total appropriations and the extent of teacher certification issues. Grants are awarded for a 5-year period for authorized master teacher programs. The master teacher programs provide funding assistance for teachers seeking board certification over a 5-year period. Local educational agencies must submit applications for grants to the Secretary, who will approve based on peer review recommendations and other criteria. Grant payments are then made accordingly. Payments for grant recipients are made annually, with a limit of 2% for administrative costs. Failure to show progress in increasing board-certified teachers or improving student achievement may result in denial of future grant payments. The Secretary must submit reports to relevant committees by March 31, 2005. The Secretary may not award a grant to a local educational agency under this section unless the agency agrees to provide non-Federal contributions equal to 25% of the grant amount. Assistance may be provided to teachers for National Board for Professional Teaching Standards certification fees, with a requirement for repayment of funds. The teacher must complete the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards certification program and teach in the public school system for at least 2 years after receiving assistance. If the teacher breaches the agreement by withdrawing from the program before taking the examination, they are liable to repay the certification fee to the local educational agency. The teacher must complete the certification program and teach in public schools for 2 years. If they withdraw before the exam, they must repay the fee. $50,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2002-2006."
