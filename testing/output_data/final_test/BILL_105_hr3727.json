    "content": "The \"Quality Child Care Loan Forgiveness Act\" may be cited as the short title. Congress finds that new scientific research shows the importance of stimulating environments for a baby's brain development. There is a growing demand for child care, with many children in need of quality care. However, most child care providers earn low wages, impacting the quality of care they can provide. Child care providers earn $6.70 per hour or $11,725 per year, leading to high turnover and affecting the quality of care. Children in lower-quality facilities with high turnover show less competence in language and social development. Quality of child care is linked to staff-to-child ratios, staff education, and administrators' experience, with teacher wages, education, and training being crucial factors distinguishing poor, mediocre, and good-quality facilities. Low-income and high-income children are more likely to attend high-quality child care compared to middle-income children. The Act aims to attract and retain highly trained individuals in the early child care profession through loan forgiveness for child care providers. In this section, definitions are provided for terms related to child care facilities and services, including the qualifications required for individuals providing care to children aged birth through 5 years. The Act offers loan forgiveness to attract and retain skilled professionals in early childhood education. The Secretary may carry out a demonstration program for loan repayment for new borrowers who complete a degree in early childhood education and work full-time in a child care facility. Loan repayment under this section is based on a first-come, first-served basis, with priority given to student borrowers who received repayment in the previous fiscal year. The Secretary is authorized to create regulations for this program. The Secretary will repay 15 percent of loans made to students after October 1, 1994. The section allows for loan repayment to students based on employment, with no refunding of repayments authorized. Interest on repaid loans is also covered, and a special rule applies to student borrowers returning to higher education for early childhood education degrees. The Secretary can repay loans for students returning to obtain a degree in early childhood education. Borrowers must qualify for loan repayment and follow repayment guidelines. Students cannot receive benefits from both this section and the National and Community Service Act for the same volunteer service. The Secretary will pay eligible lenders for repayment. The Secretary will repay eligible lenders for loans subject to repayment each fiscal year. Eligible individuals must submit an application for loan repayment after each year of qualifying employment. Borrowers will receive forbearance during qualifying employment unless in deferment. The Secretary will conduct an independent national evaluation of the impact of the demonstration program on early childhood education. The evaluation will determine the number of individuals encouraged to pursue early childhood education, those remaining employed in child care facilities, and identify barriers to effectiveness. The Secretary will evaluate the program's impact on early childhood education, assessing cost-effectiveness, participant motivations, degree attainment, and program duration. Interim and final evaluation reports will be submitted to the President and Congress.
