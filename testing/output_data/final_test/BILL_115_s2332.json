    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Kennedy-King Establishment Act of 2018\". It includes findings. Congress finds that on April 4, 1968, Robert F. Kennedy changed his prepared speech in Indianapolis to announce the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., calling for nonviolence. This helped prevent riots in Indianapolis after Dr. King's death, unlike many other cities. After Dr. King's assassination, Mr. Kennedy's speech in Indianapolis called for unity and nonviolence, preventing riots. The park where the speech was held has since been a gathering place for social movements. A memorial sculpture honoring both Mr. Kennedy and Dr. King was erected on the site. A memorial honoring Mr. Kennedy and Dr. King was erected in 1994 to commemorate their message of nonviolence.
