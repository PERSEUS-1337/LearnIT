    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Reclaiming Expatriated Contracts and Profits Act\" and includes restrictions on federal contracts with certain inverted entities. Restrictions on federal contracts with certain inverted entities include a ban on officers or employees of the United States entering into contracts with foreign incorporated entities treated as inverted domestic corporations. Additionally, contracts must include a prohibition on subcontracting to such entities during the restriction period. During the restriction period for an acquired entity, if the entity responds to a contract solicitation with the US government, the evaluation of the offer must be adjusted. For contracts based solely on price, the price offered by the acquired entity will be considered as 110 percent of the actual price offered. During the restriction period for an acquired entity, if the entity responds to a contract solicitation with the US government, the evaluation of the offer must be adjusted. For contracts based on multiple evaluation factors, the offer made by the acquired entity will be reduced by 10 percent. If a non-applicable entity makes an offer that may involve subcontracting to the acquired entity, the same reduction applies to the offer. During the restriction period, related entities are subject to the same rules as the acquiring entity. The President can waive the rules for national security reasons. Foreign entities or acquired entities can request an exception if there is no tax avoidance purpose. The Secretary of the Treasury issues a determination letter regarding an acquisition's tax avoidance purpose. Procedures for filing a request will be prescribed. The restriction period for an entity requesting a determination letter will not start until notified by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury issues a determination letter if no action is taken on a request within a year. This does not apply if the request is not submitted properly or if requested information is not provided. A foreign incorporated entity is defined as an Inverted Domestic Corporation for this section. A foreign incorporated entity is considered an inverted domestic corporation if it acquires a significant portion of a domestic corporation's assets or business and at least 80% of its stock is held by former shareholders of the domestic corporation. The rules for determining an inverted domestic corporation involve former shareholders or partners holding stock or interests in the domestic entity, and the requirement that the expanded affiliated group does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country where the entity is created. In applying the rules for determining an inverted domestic corporation, certain stock is disregarded, including stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group or stock sold in a public offering related to the acquisition. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires most of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership within a 4-year period, a plan is deemed to be in place. In determining an inverted domestic corporation, certain stock is disregarded, including stock held by the expanded affiliated group or sold in a public offering related to the acquisition. If a foreign entity acquires most properties of a domestic corporation or partnership within a 4-year period, actions are treated as pursuant to a plan. Transfers of properties or liabilities are disregarded if part of a plan to avoid the purposes of this section. Regulations state that partnerships under common control are treated as one entity. The Treasury Secretary can classify certain rights as stock and vice versa. This section applies to acquired entities that would be considered inverted domestic corporations. The section applies to acquired entities that would be treated as inverted domestic corporations if certain conditions are met, including a substitution of \"50 percent\" for \"80 percent\" in the calculation. The term 'acquired entity' refers to a domestic corporation or partnership whose properties are acquired in a specific acquisition. Any domestic person related to the acquired entity is also treated as an acquired entity. The term 'expanded affiliated group' is defined as an affiliated group under the Internal Revenue Code. Section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 defines a \"foreign incorporated entity\" as any entity treated as a foreign corporation. A \"related person\" is someone with a relationship described in specific sections of the Code or under the same common control. The term \"restriction period\" is also defined. The term \"restriction period\" refers to the period after acquiring properties until income and gain from those properties are subject to US taxation. Special rules apply to acquired entities with a 10-year limit. The restriction period for acquired entities under subsection (a)(2) ends no later than 10 years from the acquisition date or the date of the enactment of the Act. Subsequent acquisitions by unrelated domestic corporations are subject to conditions set by the Secretary of the Treasury. If a domestic corporation traded on a securities market acquires properties of acquired entities, the restriction period for the acquired entity ends immediately after the acquisition if certain requirements are met. If a domestic corporation acquires properties of acquired entities, the restriction period for the acquired entity ends immediately after the acquisition if certain requirements are met. If a domestic corporation acquires properties of an acquired entity that is a member of the same expanded affiliated group, the restriction period for the acquired entity ends immediately after the acquisition if certain requirements are met. The acquisition of an entity is defined, and the Secretary of the Treasury provides assistance in identifying applicable entities."
