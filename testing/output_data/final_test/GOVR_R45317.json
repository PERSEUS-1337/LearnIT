    "content": "Congress is currently discussing work requirements for need-tested assistance programs for low-income families and individuals. These programs provide benefits based on financial need, unlike social insurance programs. Work requirements for cash assistance have been debated since the 1960s and were implemented in the 1996 welfare reform law. The law created the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant to replace the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Extending work requirements to other need-tested programs has been a topic of policy debates since then. Work requirements for government assistance programs are currently being debated in Congress. Legislation in the 115th Congress aims to expand work requirements in programs like SNAP and TANF. The Trump Administration is also granting waivers for states to implement work requirements in Medicaid and housing assistance programs. These requirements seek to promote a culture of work, reduce caseloads, and save government funds. The research evidence indicates that work requirements in government assistance programs can lead to savings, screen out those who do not value assistance enough to comply with work requirements, and improve the economic status of individuals and families by lifting them out of poverty. Studies conducted before the 1996 welfare reform show that work requirements can be effective in achieving these policy goals. Before the enactment of the PRWORA in 1996, welfare-to-work experiments were conducted to inform welfare reform debates spanning four decades. These experiments evaluated alternative policies using the randomized controlled trial method, starting with the negative income tax experiments in the 1960s and 1970s. The experiments aimed to isolate the effects of different policies from other influencing factors. In the 1980s, experimental research shifted to programs requiring work and providing employment services to move recipients from welfare rolls to work. Evaluations in the early 1990s focused on mandatory welfare-to-work programs combining work requirements with funded employment and educational services. The pre-1996 welfare-to-work experiments involved funded employment and educational services, with recipients assigned to job search or educational activities and sanctioned for non-participation. Sanctions typically involved a reduction, not termination, of benefits. The NEWWS findings illustrated the impact of mandatory welfare-to-work programs, consistent with evaluations from the 1980s. The report discusses evaluations of mandatory welfare-to-work programs from the 1980s through the mid-1990s, including those with earnings supplements. These programs often increased employment and earnings, although the impact was modest and sometimes faded over time. Some evaluations of mandatory welfare-to-work programs found that while employment and earnings impacts faded over time, the main effect was to accelerate entry into the workforce. These programs resulted in lower rates of assistance receipt and payments, with reductions in assistance payments persisting as a long-term impact. Lower assistance payments were due to fewer recipients on the rolls, lower benefit payments as recipients worked, and sanctions on non-compliant families. The NEWWS evaluation was designed to provide insights into these impacts. The NEWWS evaluation compared a \"work-first\" approach with an \"education-focused\" approach to welfare-to-work programs. Both approaches increased employment and reduced assistance payments. The work-first approach involved job search activities, while the education-focused approach focused on basic or vocational education. The work-first approach in welfare-to-work programs led to increased employment and reduced assistance payments. The Riverside program had the largest immediate impact, with a 17 percentage point difference in employment rates between the treatment and control groups. While employment and cash assistance impacts declined over time, many programs had lasting positive effects on employment and cash assistance receipt up to five years after random assignment. Grand Rapids has positive outcomes for a welfare-to-work program, with higher employment rates and lower benefit receipt. Portland's NEWWS program had a mixed strategy, allowing participants to pursue a GED and wait for higher-paying jobs. Portland's program showed significant employment impacts, but it was not directly compared to other strategies. Figure 1 displays employment and cash assistance impacts from NEWWS programs over five years. The welfare-to-work experiments in the late 1980s and early 1990s showed that mandatory programs did not increase total income. Even with large employment impacts in programs like Portland and Riverside, average incomes did not increase over five years. Earnings tended to be low and offset the reduction in assistance, resulting in no significant impact on average incomes. The MFIP program aimed to increase work, reduce dependence, and poverty by providing earnings supplements to families. Evaluations showed increased employment and earnings but did not reduce assistance receipt. Similar programs in other states also had positive employment impacts and increased incomes. The evaluations of various state programs showed positive employment impacts and increased incomes, with some programs maintaining aid for working families and not reducing assistance payments. However, the income increase tended to fade by the end of the evaluation period. Some state programs showed positive employment impacts and increased incomes, with evaluations reporting changes in earnings, cash assistance, and food benefits. Programs providing earnings supplements also improved outcomes for children, while mandatory welfare-to-work programs had negative effects on outcomes like school achievement for adolescents. Post-1996 welfare reform, mandatory welfare-to-work programs were no longer considered experiments. After the 1996 welfare reform law, TANF was never evaluated as mandatory welfare-to-work programs became policy. TANF differed from pre-1996 programs in rules, performance measurement, and exemptions for mothers with young children. States determine exemptions from work requirements, with some exempting mothers of newborns for as little as three months. Under TANF, states have the flexibility to design their programs but must meet a minimum work participation rate, with sanctions including the termination of benefits for non-compliance. Employment while on benefits counts as participation, with detailed rules on what qualifies. The work participation rate under TANF requires states to meet a minimum rate, with sanctions for non-compliance. Participation in welfare-to-work activities is time-limited, with job search and readiness limited to 12 weeks per year, and vocational training limited to 12 months per recipient's lifetime. Participation is also measured based on a minimum number of hours per week. Studies evaluated the impact of mandatory welfare-to-work programs on increasing participation over time, with the 50% and 90% thresholds not based on pre-1996 welfare-to-work experiments. The AFDC program provided matching grants to states for assistance to needy families, while TANF is a block grant with incentives for caseload reduction. States can use savings from reduced caseloads for other purposes. Cash assistance post-1996 focused on caseload reduction and meeting minimum work participation rates. Since 1996, cash assistance for needy families has focused on caseload reduction and meeting minimum work participation rates. The number of families receiving TANF assistance decreased from 4.9 million in FY1995 to 1.4 million in FY2017. Caseload reduction initially led to lower child poverty and increased work among single mothers, but since 2000, caseloads have continued to decline even as child poverty and TANF financial eligibility increased. Most states have met their minimum work participation rate standards through caseload reduction or assisting families with earnings. Less than one-fourth of nonemployed adult recipients were reported in FY2016. In FY2016, less than one-fourth of nonemployed adult recipients were reported as engaged in welfare-to-work activities under TANF. The focus of work requirements is on SNAP, Medicaid, and housing assistance programs, with existing SNAP law having participation requirements and time limits for nondisabled adult recipients without children. H.R. 2 passed by the House would establish mandatory participation requirements for nondisabled adults under 60, including those subject to a 3-month time limit in a 36-month period. The Trump Administration is granting waivers to states for work and \"community engagement\" requirements for Medicaid recipients, aiming to improve health outcomes. These waivers may vary in population coverage and provisions like enhanced dental and vision benefits. The waivers granted by the Trump Administration for work and community engagement requirements in Medicaid aim to improve health outcomes, including enhanced dental and vision benefits. Work requirements apply to nonelderly, nonpregnant individuals in housing assistance programs, with public housing residents required to participate in community service or self-sufficiency activities. Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration project allows public housing authorities to impose work requirements for Section 8 housing voucher recipients. The applicability of pre-1996 experiments to SNAP, Medicaid, and housing assistance programs is limited due to differences in populations and program structures. SNAP, Medicaid, and housing assistance programs aid a broader population than AFDC, which mainly helped single mothers. These programs now serve low-income individuals like married couples, noncustodial parents, and single men and women. Working low-income individuals faced strict rules under AFDC, limiting their earnings and time on assistance. The evaluated pre-1996 experiments aimed to move nonworking AFDC recipients into work, while programs like SNAP, Medicaid, and housing assistance also serve individuals who are working but at low wages and irregular schedules. The goals of work requirements for working recipients differ from those focused on nonworking individuals. The Medicaid waivers aim to improve the health of recipients, while SNAP is the only program with funding for employment and educational services. Housing and Medicaid lack funding for such services. Medicaid funds can be used for enforcing work requirements, but not for employment and training services themselves. The 1996 welfare reform law focused on work requirements and employment services for cash assistance recipients, showing that mandatory welfare-to-work programs could increase employment but not incomes or reduce poverty. Supplementing these programs with aid for working parents could increase incomes, albeit at a cost to the government. The lack of research on the effectiveness of work requirements for SNAP recipients led to Congress requiring pilot work programs in the 2014 Farm Bill. Pilot programs were authorized in 10 states and fully operational by FY2017, with evaluations using the RCT method. The pilot work programs for SNAP recipients were fully operational by FY2017 and evaluated using the RCT method. Congress proceeded with the 2018 Farm Bill without waiting for the research findings. Work requirements combined with employment and education services, along with earnings supplements, were found to improve economic outcomes for single mothers with children. Earnings supplements are mainly provided through the federal income tax code, benefiting families with children. The child tax credit benefits families with children, while individuals and families without children qualify for a small EITC. Wages have increased for those at the top but stagnated or fallen for those at the bottom, affecting the effectiveness of welfare-to-work initiatives in improving economic well-being. Labor market policies need to be considered to address these issues."
