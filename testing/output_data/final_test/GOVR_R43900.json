    "content": "In the United States, honey bee colony losses due to colony collapse disorder (CCD) gained attention in late 2006, leading to increased funding for honey bee research in the 2008 farm bill. The 2014 farm bill expanded upon these provisions, but U.S. beekeepers continue to lose colonies each year, with overwinter losses averaging nearly 30% since 2006. Since 2006, USDA reports that honey bee colony losses have averaged nearly 30% annually. In 2012/2013, more colonies dwindled away rather than suffering from CCD. Beekeepers did not report CCD as a major cause of colony loss in recent surveys. Data is only tracked for managed honey bees, not native or wild species. The exact reasons for honey bee colony losses remain unknown, with no single cause identified. The large-scale number of honey bee deaths has been attributed to various factors such as bee pests, diseases, diet, genetics, habitat loss, pesticides, and beekeeping management issues. USDA and EPA reports, along with scientific studies, have highlighted the complex reasons behind bee population declines. The potential role of pesticides, specifically neonicotinoid pesticides, in bee health is a widely reported issue. A 2013 report by USDA and EPA highlighted the uncertainty surrounding the impact of pesticide exposure on honey bee health declines in the U.S. The report examines the role of pesticides in U.S. honey bee health declines, highlighting the potential harm from exposure to high doses of insecticides. Various research projects are investigating the importance of pesticides in bee health, with some groups expressing concern about the multifaceted causes of pollinator health issues deflecting attention from pesticide exposure. This report discusses the potential impact of pesticides on bee health, including the reluctance of some groups to acknowledge this role due to potential restrictions on pesticide use. It also provides information on pesticide regulation in the United States and specifically addresses neonicotinoids, which have been linked to honey bee colony declines. Various options to address pesticide exposure by bees are also outlined. Pesticide exposure by bees is being addressed through crop- and product-specific best management practices, restrictions on certain pesticides in some countries, and proposed legislation in the U.S. Pesticides are defined broadly in U.S. law as chemicals used to control pests, including insecticides and herbicides. Pesticides have various uses such as controlling mites, mold, and disinfecting agents. There are around 18,000 pesticide products in the US, varying in toxicity and environmental impact. All pesticides are regulated by the EPA under FIFRA, with around 5,800 products used in food production also regulated under FFDCA. FIFRA, regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, requires EPA to regulate pesticides in the US through product registration and labeling to prevent adverse effects on people and the environment. It prohibits the sale of unregistered pesticides and mandates EPA to reregister and review all pesticides periodically. EPA registers each pesticide product for approved uses, ensuring compliance with label instructions. The EPA regulates pesticides in the US through product registration and labeling to prevent adverse effects on people and the environment. The FFDCA authorizes EPA to establish maximum allowable residue levels for pesticide ingredients in food to ensure safety. Foods with pesticide residues exceeding tolerance limits are considered \"unsafe\" and cannot be sold in interstate commerce or imported to the US. When pesticide manufacturers apply to register a pesticide under FIFRA, EPA requires scientific data on toxicity and environmental behavior. EPA evaluates potential human health and environmental effects associated with the pesticide's use, requiring data from over 100 different tests. The registration process involves scientific, legal, and administrative procedures considering the pesticide's ingredients, application site, frequency of use, and storage practices. EPA may not register pesticides for use on food crops without established tolerances under the FFDCA. EPA requires data from over 100 tests to evaluate the toxicity and exposure of pesticides. Registration for pesticide use on food involves determining residue levels and assessing potential risks to human health and the environment. Factors considered include pesticide specificity, toxicity, environmental persistence, and bioaccumulation. EPA evaluates the toxicity of pesticides on bees and other insects, requiring studies on acute toxicity and collecting reports on bee-kill incidents. If a pesticide is deemed very toxic, long-term studies may be required. EPA adjusts label requirements or refuses registration if the risk is unreasonable or unsafe, but grants registration if the risk is determined to be reasonable and safe. The EPA grants registration for pesticides deemed safe, specifying approved uses and conditions on product labels to minimize environmental damage. Registrations are reviewed every 15 years for new scientific information and can be reviewed at any time for adverse effects. Neonicotinoids are a rapidly growing class of insecticides. Neonicotinoids are a relatively new class of insecticides developed in the 1980s. They are systemic pesticides that migrate into all parts of the plant once taken in, including flowers, pollen, and nectar. Neonicotinoids were created as an alternative to highly toxic organophosphate insecticides. Some common active ingredients include imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam. They are generally considered to be reduced-risk compared to other pesticides. Neonicotinoids, a class of insecticides developed in the 1980s as a reduced-risk alternative to highly toxic pesticides, have raised concerns for their potential harm to bees and other wildlife. Incidents of misuse in Germany and widespread beekeeper concerns in France have highlighted the neurotoxic effects of neonicotinoids on bee health. Evidence suggests that neonicotinoids are not the sole cause of declining bee health, with pyrethroid exposures potentially playing a more significant role. The overall pesticide load, along with factors like mite infestation and poor nutrition, can impact honey bee health. Bees are exposed to various pesticides from field crops and other plants they forage on, as well as those used by beekeepers for pest control. Pesticides are used to control bacteria, fungi, mites, and other bee pests near hives. Bees are exposed to pesticides in various ways during foraging, including from planter exhaust, soil, flowers, and applications near hives. Accidental exposure can occur when pesticides are misused or applied in areas frequented by bees. Pesticides are used to control pests in areas frequented by bees, such as roadsides, commercial farm crops, and fields. Bees can be exposed to pesticides through spray applications, soil treatments, or seed coatings, leading to potential sickness or death. Research is needed to determine the true pesticide exposure and the impact of multiple pesticide exposures on honey bee colonies. Pesticides have adverse impacts on honey bee colonies, affecting navigation, communication, foraging behavior, memory, immune function, reproduction, and development. The widespread use of herbicides reduces bee habitats, and many pesticides are lethal to bees at certain exposure levels. Local incidents of bee kill have been documented due to pesticide exposure. Pesticides have been shown to damage bee health, but it is unclear if they are the main cause of honey bee population declines. Best management practices are available to reduce pesticide exposure in bees, and some states have developed guidance to protect pollinators. Some states have developed guidance to protect pollinators, including recommendations for beekeepers to reduce bee exposure to insecticides with high toxicity. This involves selecting apiary sites in low pesticide risk areas and notifying growers and applicators in the area. If insecticides with long residual life are used where bees forage, it may be best to move the bees out of the area. Recommendations for reducing hazards associated with insecticides include avoiding the use of dusts from treated seeds and using chemicals with reduced risk to bees. It is advised to apply insecticides in the late evening, night, or early morning when fewer bees are foraging, and to avoid spraying when winds favor drifting. Agricultural groups like the Almond Board of California recommend growers to avoid applying insecticides when plants are in bloom or when pollen is available for honey bees. Additional grower Best Management Practices (BMPs) are also provided. Pesticide applicator BMPs recommend avoiding pesticide use during crop blooming and applying pesticides to blooming crops only after bees have finished foraging, preferably at night. Cooperation between farmers and beekeepers is essential to optimize spray times and minimize bee exposure. Voluntary adoption of BMPs for pesticide use and pollinator impacts is slow, self-funded, and unlikely to prompt timely behavioral changes. In response to recent bee die-offs in Canada, federal agencies have implemented additional protective requirements for using treated seed in corn and soybean production. These include safer seed planting practices, enhanced warnings on pesticide and seed package labels, and evaluation of the need for neonicotinoid treatment on certain commercial crops. Agro-chemical industry representatives advocate for effective product labeling and stewardship actions to minimize harmful interactions with pesticides. Some argue that the use of systemic insecticides violates IPM principles, which recommend minimizing chemical pesticide use and using biological controls. Guidance from apiculturists and university extension advises avoiding pesticide use during bloom of plants that attract bees. To protect bees, fungicides should be used during bloom of ornamental plants that attract bees, like heather, lavender, linden, rhododendron, and rose. Pesticides should only be applied after flower petals have fallen when plants are less attractive to bees, and specific requirements on the pesticide label must be followed. Less toxic pesticides are recommended if used during bloom, and certain pesticides should only be used after flower petals have fallen to avoid contaminating nectar and pollen. Consumer campaigns have been launched to raise awareness about the issue. Consumer campaigns have been initiated to discourage the sale of pesticides harmful to bees and other pollinators. Concerns have been raised about the adverse effects of insecticides on beneficial insects and nearby species. In 2014, the Obama Administration issued a memorandum to promote environmental health. The Obama Administration issued a Presidential Memorandum directing federal agencies to protect and restore pollinator populations. A Pollinator Health Task Force was established to develop a National Pollinator Health Strategy, including a Pollinator Research Action Plan focusing on understanding, preventing, and recovering from pollinator losses. Task force members will work on reducing pollinator exposure to pesticides and controlling bee pests and diseases. The task force member agencies are developing plans to increase pollinator habitat and control bee pests and diseases. They will make necessary changes to enhance pollinator habitat on federal lands through integrated vegetation and pest management. Concerns about pesticide use were discussed during public listening sessions, with some groups pushing for restrictions on pesticide use. The primary driver behind bee declines is parasitic mites. The EPA's pollinator strategic plan aims to advance scientific knowledge on pesticide risks to pollinators and improve management tools. A joint report by USDA and EPA highlighted the need to address risks to honey bees from parasites and diseases, and increase genetic diversity. The report acknowledges the need for collaboration and information sharing on best management practices for pesticides and bees. Beekeepers require accurate reporting and monitoring of bee kill incidents. Additional research is needed on pesticide exposures and effects on bee health in the field. The National Honey Bee Health Stakeholder Conference Steering Committee, consisting of representatives from various organizations, is focused on bee health and the impact of neonicotinoid pesticide registrations being reviewed by EPA. Much research on bee health is conducted by scientists at USDA and universities nationwide. The EPA is reviewing neonicotinoid pesticides due to uncertainties about their environmental impact on pollinators. Data shows residues can accumulate in pollen and nectar, posing a risk to bees. Adverse effects and bee kill incidents have been reported. The review of neonicotinoid pesticide registrations began in 2011, with a focus on potential effects on honeybees and other pollinators. The Natural Resources Defense Council petitioned the EPA in July 2014. The Natural Resources Defense Council petitioned the EPA in July 2014 to conduct an emergency review of neonicotinoid pesticides' impacts on bees. The EPA official indicated in October 2014 that the review dates would be moved up to 2016-2017 from 2018-2019. Neonicotinoid pesticides are currently under review, with some products having conditional registration and others unconditional. EPA must register a pesticide if it meets the statutory standard of not causing unreasonable adverse effects on human health and the environment. The EPA may grant an \"unconditional\" registration to a pesticide if it meets the statutory standard with no outstanding data requirements. If there are data gaps, a \"conditional\" registration may be granted if the pesticide's use does not pose significant risks to the environment. The EPA's pesticide registration process includes both \"conditional\" and \"unconditional\" registrations on a product-by-product basis. Critics, including the GAO, argue that conditional registrations are a loophole that allows potentially harmful pesticides onto the market without thorough review. EPA's data-gathering system for tracking conditional registrations is also questioned. The EPA's pesticide registration process includes conditional registrations, which critics argue are a loophole for potentially harmful pesticides. GAO's 2013 report highlighted database inaccuracies in tracking conditional registrations. EPA revised its risk assessment process for neonicotinoids to reflect advancements in bee exposure science. The final risk assessment guidance, released in June 2014, integrates an analysis of honey bees and other pollinators within the ecological risk assessment framework. The guidance, developed in collaboration with Health Canada and California's Department of Pesticide Regulation, outlines the risk assessment process for pesticide management decisions. Critics argue that EPA's risk assessments do not consider chronic or synergistic effects with other compounds, posing risks to native bee species, especially ground-nesting bees. EPA's pesticide registration process includes conditional registrations, which critics view as a loophole for potentially harmful pesticides. The EPA conducted a study on neonicotinoid seed treatments for insect control in soybean production, finding little to no overall benefits. They also looked into the potential benefits for corn production but have not published those findings. In 2013, EPA and USDA held a summit on reducing exposure to dust from treated seed and potential acute exposure of honey bees and pollinators to pesticides. In September 2014, EPA received pesticide petitions, including one from Syngenta to increase thiamethoxam residue thresholds for crops like alfalfa, barley, corn, and wheat. The petition seeks significant tolerance level increases, pending EPA review. Thiamethoxam is a neonicotinoid pesticide banned in the EU. The EPA announced new pesticide labels in August 2013, banning certain neonicotinoid pesticides where bees are present. The labels include a \"Pollinator Protection Box\" with information on exposure routes and precautions. Exceptions apply for agricultural crops and ornamental plants. The EPA introduced new pesticide labels in August 2013 to protect bees, with a \"Pollinator Protection Box\" providing information on exposure routes and precautions. Beekeepers have criticized the new labels for being inadequate and having exceptions that may not fully protect bees and other pollinators. Groups like the Pollinator Stewardship Council have raised concerns about the ambiguity of the label terms and the conditions under which pesticides can be applied. Some groups, like the Pollinator Stewardship Council, have concerns about EPA's exceptions to new labeling requirements for neonicotinoid pesticide products. Exceptions include not applying the product while bees are foraging or until flowering is complete, with notification required to beekeepers before spraying near managed bees. The label for some products states not to apply while bees are foraging or until flowering is complete. Exceptions are allowed for applications made after sunset, when temperatures are below 55\u02daF, in a government-initiated public health response, or in accordance with an active state-administered apiary registry program with prior notification to beekeepers. The EPA allows exceptions to pesticide label advisories, but concerns include harm to bees, uncertainty in notifying beekeepers, and potential harm to native bees due to foliar applications in nearby areas. The EPA allows exceptions to pesticide label advisories for foliar treatments, but concerns include harm to bees, uncertainty in notifying beekeepers, and potential harm to native bees. EPA is working with states to draft guidance on pollinator protection plans. The EPA is working with states to draft guidance on pollinator protection plans, including core elements for EPA-approved state plans, the process for EPA review and updating of state plans, referencing state plans through labeling requirements, and accessing recommended best management practices. Several states already have pollinator protection plans in place, with others considering similar initiatives. EPA also announced a voluntary Drift Reduction Technology program to encourage the use of safer pesticide spray products to reduce exposure and pesticide movement. The EPA is working on pollinator protection plans with states, including guidance on core elements and best practices. The DriftWatch Specialty Crop Site Registry is a voluntary communication tool to protect high-value crops from pesticide drift. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will phase out feeding wildlife genetically engineered crops and neonicotinoid pesticides in wildlife refuges by January 2016. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service planned to phase out neonicotinoids in Region 1, including Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Hawaii, and the Pacific Islands. Refuge managers must comply with new requirements for chemically treated seeds on refuge lands. Some cities and counties have restricted neonicotinoid pesticide use to protect pollinators, with Eugene, Oregon being the first U.S. city to do so in March 2014. Since the first reported bee kill in Eugene, other cities like Seattle, Spokane, Shoreline, and Skagway have also banned neonicotinoids. States like Alaska, California, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, and Vermont are considering legislation to restrict neonicotinoid use. Some localities have implemented pesticide restrictions and programs to create pollinator-friendly habitats. Several states in the US, including California, Colorado, Florida, Mississippi, and North Dakota, have pollinator protection plans in place. The EU countries have experienced lower honey bee colony losses, with overwinter losses averaging 9% in 2013/2014, compared to a range of 6% to 37% in 2012/2013. The European Commission and EU member states found honey bee colony mortalities were \"higher than normal in certain countries\" but \"better than previously expected.\" In response, the European Commission adopted Regulation No 485/2013 banning certain neonicotinoid pesticides for two years, restricting their use on bee-attractive plants and cereals. Exceptions are limited to treating bee-attractive crops in greenhouses or open-air fields after flowering, with restrictions to be maintained for two years. The European Commission adopted Regulation No 485/2013 banning certain neonicotinoid pesticides for two years, with exceptions for treating bee-attractive crops in greenhouses or open-air fields after flowering. The EC will review approval conditions for these pesticides based on new information, following EFSA's assessment of high risks for bees from exposure to certain neonicotinoids and fipronil. The EU Commission has proposed restrictions on fipronil, an insecticide harmful to honey bees. Studies from the UK and Europe suggest various factors contributing to pollinator declines, including neonicotinoid use. Some member states question the ban's impact on agricultural production. In Canada, the Canadian Association of Professional Apiculturists (CAPA) reports significant honey bee colony losses in 2013/2014, with some provinces like Ontario experiencing wintering losses of 58%. Health Canada's Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) noted higher bee mortalities linked to pesticide applications in 2012, with reports from multiple provinces including Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia, Quebec, and Ontario. The PMRA received reports of honey bee mortalities in corn growing regions of Ontario and Quebec, possibly linked to insecticides on treated corn seeds. A 2013 field study found no connection between bee health and pesticide applications, but PMRA concluded that neonicotinoid treated corn and soybean seeds are impacting bees and other pollinators. The PMRA implemented measures to reduce honey bee exposure to dust from treated corn and soybean seeds, including labeling, dust standards, and technical solutions. They continued to evaluate neonicotinoids for regulatory action and planned label changes similar to the EPA. In November 2014, Ontario proposed an 80% reduction in neonicotinoid-treated corn and soybean seed usage. Manufacturers dispute the decision's scientific basis. CropLife Canada urges a broader investigation into bee population declines. A class-action lawsuit was filed against chemical manufacturers for damages caused by thiamethoxam and clothianidin. Clothianidin resulted in over C$450 million in damages from 2006 to 2013, including bee deaths, impaired reproduction, hive loss, reduced honey production, and contamination of hive equipment. The lawsuit alleges negligence by Bayer and Syngenta in the design, development, distribution, and sale of neonicotinoid pesticides, causing harm to beekeepers' property. Several environmental and food safety advocacy groups, along with individual beekeepers, have been actively pressing authorities on policies related to neonicotinoid pesticides. These groups have published reports, posted literature reviews, and filed lawsuits to address the harm caused to beekeepers' property. CFS and a coalition of beekeepers and environmental groups sued the EPA to stop the use of pesticides harming bees. The lawsuit challenges EPA's risk assessment framework and approval of certain neonicotinoids. In a separate case, beekeepers in Minnesota sued the state's Department of Natural Resources for losses from pesticide spraying. In response to legal challenges, the state's Department of Natural Resources stopped using the pesticide carbaryl after pesticide users offered to settle for losses incurred. Previous requests have been made to the EPA to restrict certain pesticides, including an \"Emergency Petition\" filed in 2012 by CFS and beekeepers to suspend the use of clothianidin until proven safe for pollinators and the environment. EPA initially denied the request in 2012 but may revisit its decision as it reviews neonicotinoid registrations. In 2014, NRDC petitioned EPA to conduct further actions regarding pesticides. In July 2014, NRDC petitioned EPA for an emergency review of neonicotinoid pesticides' impact on bees, urging completion within a year. Advocacy groups, including CFS, requested a two-year ban on neonicotinoid insecticides in 2013. In January 2015, commercial beekeepers and environmental groups pushed for restrictions on pesticide use, emphasizing the need to consider sublethal effects of repeated exposure. Syngenta AG and Bayer AG are among the agrochemical companies facing pressure for pesticide restrictions. Syngenta AG and Bayer AG are defending the use of neonicotinoid pesticides, claiming no evidence of a systematic correlation with honey bee colony mortality. They argue poor bee health is linked to other factors like Varroa mites and viruses, not insecticides. These companies have published reports supporting their stance and are challenging the EU's neonicotinoid ban, stating the decline in pollinator populations is not due to these pesticides. Syngenta disputes responsibility for pollinator population declines, attributing them to disease, viruses, habitat loss, and poor nutrition. They seek to reverse the EU ban on neonicotinoid pesticides, claiming the decision was based on flawed assessments. Syngenta has also petitioned the EPA to increase residue thresholds for thiamethoxam. Legislative efforts to support research on pollinators have been ongoing since the 2014 farm bill. Legislative efforts have been ongoing to support research on honey bees and other pollinators since the 2008 farm bill. Bills have been introduced in previous Congresses to promote habitat for bees and address pesticide issues. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 2692, the Saving America's Pollinators Act of 2013, was introduced to suspend neonicotinoids registrations. Representative Rodney Davis has highlighted bee health as a top issue for the 114th Congress. The Saving America's Pollinators Act of 2013 aimed to suspend neonicotinoids registrations and ban new pesticide registrations for use on bee attractive plants, trees, and cereals. This bill was a response to the death of 50,000 bees in Oregon due to pesticide exposure. It would require the EPA to suspend registrations of specific neonicotinoid insecticides until further research is conducted. The Saving America's Pollinators Act of 2013 aimed to suspend neonicotinoids registrations and ban new pesticide registrations for use on bee attractive plants, trees, and cereals. The bill required further research to determine the insecticide's impact on pollinators and mandated coordination between the EPA and Department of the Interior for monitoring native bee populations. This bill aligned with similar proposals in the EU and Canada regarding neonicotinoid pesticide use. The EU has restrictions on neonicotinoids for seed treatment, soil application, and foliar treatment on bee attractive plants and cereals, with exceptions for greenhouses and open-air fields after flowering. H.R. 2692 sponsors and other U.S. House members urged EPA to restrict neonicotinoids on bee-attractive crops and ornamental applications, including reviewing pesticide registration policies. EPA also received a similar letter from environmental and sustainable agriculture organizations. Groups opposed to restrictions on pesticide use, such as CFS, Friends of the Earth, and Food and Water Watch, argue that studies challenging claims against pesticides causing colony decline are unsubstantiated. They question the link between neonicotinoids and bee declines, advocating for effective product labeling and stewardship actions to minimize harmful interactions. Some doubt the risk of crop-applied pesticides to bees under current approved uses and beekeeping practices. In the 113th Congress, Representative Austin Scott introduced H.R. 5447 to expedite registration of pesticides improving bee health and managing resistance to pests. The bill also required reports on threats to bee health from various factors. The bill introduced by Representative Austin Scott in the 113th Congress aimed to expedite pesticide registration to improve bee health and manage resistance to pests. It also required reports on threats to bee health from various factors, including parasites and environmental influences. The bill defined \"managed pollinator bee\" as any bee raised in a managed hive for honey production, pollination of crops, or commercial breeding. While supported by some U.S. crop producers, advocacy groups opposed the bill, citing concerns about fast-tracking pesticide approvals and the need to address other factors contributing to bee declines. In February 2015, EPA announced plans to fast track approval of oxalic acid dihydrate as a miticide for beehives, which is considered safer than other chemicals. It has been approved for use in Canada since 2010, with no unacceptable risks to human health or the environment. Researchers found high levels of fungicides and insecticides in pollen and wax collected by bees, impacting honey bee health. Chlorothalonil, fluvalinate, and coumaphos were frequently detected, along with a broad range of other pesticides. Bees were exposed to acaricides, fungicides, insecticides, and herbicides, posing a risk to their health and the environment. Bees can be exposed to neonicotinoids, fungicides, insecticides, and herbicides in multiple ways, with the highest potential exposure during planting season. Clothianidin was found in bee-collected pollen, with levels high enough to kill bees. Bees forage for corn pollen, with about half of hive pollen sampled coming from corn. Clothianidin was detected in all dead and dying bees but not in healthy bees. In this study, high levels of pesticide were found in exhaust material from mechanical planters when pesticides and talc were used to coat seeds. Clothianidin was also detected in soil samples from planted and unplanted fields. Neonicotinoids have been measured in pollen and nectar of canola, corn, and sunflowers grown from seed coated with pesticides, but levels were below acutely toxic levels. Imidacloprid and thiamethoxam concentrations in nectar were greater in squash and pumpkin flowers compared to canola and sunflowers grown from seed treated with neonicotinoids. Metabolites of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam were found in all parts of squash plants. A 2012 study found neonicotinoids in bee-collected corn pollen at levels similar to those known to have sublethal effects on colony health. Imidacloprid levels in pollen from bees in the field were also high enough to cause sublethal effects on honey bees and bumble bees. The European Food Safety Agency identified risks to bees from exposure to neonicotinoid pesticides in pollen, nectar, dust, and guttation fluid from maize. Bees may also be exposed to neonicotinoids in corn syrup fed to them by beekeepers during winter. The researchers found that bees could consume enough imidacloprid in contaminated corn syrup to produce toxic effects. Other studies have shown no pesticides in high-fructose corn syrup. Pesticides, especially insecticides, are known to harm honey bee colonies, but local bee kills may not significantly contribute to the national decline in colony populations. Some fungicides can inhibit enzymes that bees need to detoxify miticides, but more research is needed to understand these chemical interactions. Fungicides may inhibit an enzyme that bees need to detoxify miticides, but further research is needed due to measurement difficulties and the complexity of studying the issue. Generalizations about the relative importance of pesticides for global bee health cannot be made from available data, as research focuses on single pesticides or pathogens with minimal consideration of interactions. The study highlights the need for further research on the interactions of pesticides with other stressors affecting bee health, such as Varroa mites and Nosema, as well as the potential long-term effects of chronic exposure to pesticide mixtures. The authors express concern about possible additive or synergistic effects of pesticide combinations found in bees, despite individual doses not being lethal. Numerous pesticides classified as pyrethroids found in the field have been shown to cause disorientation in honey bees. Research suggests that pesticide exposure may harm bees and other animal species, with little information on the impacts of pesticides applied by homeowners. A 2014 meta-analysis of 800 reports over two decades examined the effects of systemic pesticides on ecosystems and various animal species. The analysis by European entomologists and ornithologists found that neonicotinoid pesticides pose a serious risk to honeybees, butterflies, earthworms, and birds. Recent studies focus on how these pesticides affect insect behaviors like flight, navigation, and foraging. Effects include impaired navigation and foraging abilities in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids. Scientists at Bayer Crop Science dispute findings of studies on neonicotinoids' impact on bees, arguing that the pesticide doses used were not field-relevant. Comments from Purdue University and Pennsylvania State University researchers challenge Bayer's review, with concerns about the lack of transparency in dose estimation. Professor Krupke from Purdue University suggests that neonicotinoids like thiamethoxam and clothianidin may be responsible for bee kills. EPA has found clothianidin to be highly toxic to honey bees, affecting mortality and foraging activity. Health Canada has also raised concerns about the impact of pesticide-contaminated talc on bees. Health Canada has linked corn planting to bee mortalities in Ontario in 2012. Research shows that exposure to neonicotinoids impairs bee behavior, brood development, and immune functioning. Imidacloprid ingestion affects sucrose responsiveness and waggle dancing abilities in honey bees. Hives treated with imidacloprid collapsed after 6 months. Exposure to insecticides like imidacloprid and miticides can impair bee behavior, brain development, and memory formation. Studies have shown that these pesticides can lead to cognitive impairments, decreased survival rates, and increased susceptibility to diseases like Nosema in honey bees. High levels of pesticides like fipronil, amitraz, fluvalinate, chlorothalonil, pyraclostrobin, and imidacloprid have been linked to entombing behavior in poisoned hives. These pesticides, including neonicotinoids like imidacloprid and clothianidin, have toxic effects on honey bee larvae and can lead to Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) by affecting winterization and causing hive abandonment. Control colonies not exposed to these pesticides did not exhibit CCD symptoms. Some exposed colonies with Nosema ceranae symptoms were small, lacked queen bees or brood. Critics point out the study's small sample size and lack of replication. Research continues on the effects of neonicotinoids and other pesticides on bees' energy budget, metabolism, and immunity. Exposure to neonicotinoids and other pesticides can have various effects on bumble bees, including impacting brain functioning, colony growth, nest conditions, foraging behavior, reproductive success, and locomotor behavior. Studies have shown reduced growth rates, decreased queen production, shortened lifespans, and an inability to produce brood in worker bees after exposure to these insecticides. Some pesticides and fungicides tested did not have sublethal effects on bumble bees. Chronic exposure to certain pesticides impairs foraging behavior, increases worker mortality, and reduces bumblebee colony success. Bayer Crop Science disputes some study results, citing artificial conditions. A 2013 study on bumble bee health near neonicotinoid-treated crops was inconclusive due to weather and data limitations, highlighting the need for further field studies. Further field studies are needed to complement laboratory studies on the effects of neonicotinoid pesticides. Some view this study as evidence against imposing restrictions on these pesticides, while others criticize its sources and methodologies."
