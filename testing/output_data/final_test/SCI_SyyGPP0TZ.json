    "content": "In this paper, the authors investigate strategies for regularizing and optimizing LSTM-based models for word-level language modeling. They propose the weight-dropped LSTM, which uses DropConnect on hidden-to-hidden weights for recurrent regularization. Additionally, they introduce NT-ASGD, a non-monotonically triggered variant of the averaged stochastic gradient method. Their ASGD Weight-Dropped LSTM (AWD-LSTM) achieves state-of-the-art word level perplexities on two datasets: 57.3 on Penn Treebank and 65.8 on WikiText-2. By incorporating a neural cache with their model, they achieve even lower perplexities of 52.8 on Penn Treebank and 52.0 on WikiText-2. The regularization and optimization strategies for LSTM-based models in word-level language modeling have been explored. The proposed regularization techniques for deep learning, such as dropout and batch normalization, have been successful in feed-forward and convolutional neural networks. However, applying these approaches to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) has been challenging. Recent works have focused on extending these strategies to RNNs, with the quasi-recurrent neural network (QRNN) showing comparable performance to AWD-LSTM. The code for reproducing the results is available at https://github.com/salesforce/awd-lstm-lm. Recent works have focused on extending regularization strategies to RNNs, including retaining dropout masks across multiple time steps and limiting updates to the hidden state. Another approach involves restricting recurrent matrices to regularize the network. In this work, a set of regularization strategies for LSTM networks is investigated, including weightdropped LSTM, randomized-length backpropagation through time, embedding dropout, activation regularization, and temporal activation regularization. These strategies are effective and can be used without modifying existing LSTM implementations. Other regularization methods mentioned include batch normalization, recurrent batch normalization, and layer normalization, which introduce additional training parameters and can complicate the training process. Regularization strategies for LSTM networks include weight-dropped LSTM, randomized-length backpropagation through time (BPTT), embedding dropout, activation regularization (AR), and temporal activation regularization (TAR). These methods are compatible with black box libraries like NVIDIA cuDNN and aim to find a good minimizer of the loss function rapidly during training. Popular training methods like stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop are commonly used to reduce training loss iteratively. In the context of word-level language modeling, past work has shown that SGD outperforms other methods in both final loss and convergence rate. Averaged SGD (AvSGD) is a variant that returns an average of iterates past a certain threshold T, which impacts performance. In the context of word-level language modeling, past work has shown that AvSGD, a variant of SGD, achieves better training outcomes by dynamically determining the threshold T. The mathematical formulation of LSTM involves weight matrices, input vector x t, hidden state h t, memory cell state c t, and element-wise multiplication. Previous techniques to prevent overfitting in RNNs focused on modifying the hidden state vector h t\u22121 or introducing dropout operations between timesteps. These modifications hinder the use of faster black box RNN implementations. We propose using DropConnect BID37 on the recurrent hidden-to-hidden weight matrices in LSTM to prevent overfitting on the recurrent connections. This regularization technique can be applied to other RNN cells as well. The impact on training speed is minimal, and it allows for the use of highly optimized black box LSTM implementations like NVIDIA's cuDNN LSTM. DropConnect is applied to the recurrent weights in LSTM to prevent overfitting on the recurrent connections. It is similar to variational dropout but focuses on the recurrent weights. SGD is a popular method for training deep learning models in various domains. SGD iteratively takes steps using learning rates \u03b3 k and stochastic gradients on minibatches of data. It performs well in practice and has theoretical benefits like linear convergence and better generalization. Averaged SGD (AvSGD) is investigated to enhance training, showing surprising results including second-order convergence. AvSGD has theoretical appeal with second-order convergence, but limited practical use due to unclear tuning guidelines for learning rate and averaging trigger. A non-monotonically triggered variant, NT-AvSGD, eliminates the need for tuning T and uses a constant learning rate throughout the experiment. The non-monotonically triggered AvSGD (NT-AvSGD) eliminates the need for tuning and uses a constant learning rate throughout the experiment. Averaging is triggered when SGD iterates converge to a steady-state distribution, similar to the convergence of SGD to a solution. Learning rate reduction strategies, like stepwise reduction, are common in language modeling to improve performance metrics. The non-monotonically triggered AvSGD (NT-AvSGD) introduces a conservative criterion for averaging in stochastic gradient descent. It proposes a non-monotonic criterion that triggers averaging when the validation metric fails to improve for multiple cycles. This approach aims to reduce the impact of randomness in training decisions. The algorithm adds two hyperparameters, the logging interval L and nonmonotone interval n, with suggested values of L as the number of iterations in an epoch and n as 5. In NTAvSGD experiments, setting L as the number of iterations in an epoch and n = 5 worked well across models and data sets. This approach achieves better training outcomes compared to SGD. Additional regularization techniques were explored to improve data efficiency and prevent overfitting in RNN models. The fixed sequence length used for batching data may lead to inefficient data utilization, as elements divisible by the backpropagation window size may not receive any elements to backprop into. To improve data efficiency in RNN models, a random sequence length selection process is proposed to prevent inefficient data utilization caused by fixed sequence lengths. This method spreads the starting point for the backpropagation window beyond the base sequence length, enhancing training outcomes compared to traditional methods. During training, the sequence length is adjusted to efficiently utilize the data set, ensuring all elements experience a full BPTT window. Rescaling the learning rate based on sequence length prevents bias towards shorter sequences and is crucial for large scale minibatch SGD training. This method enhances training outcomes compared to traditional fixed sequence lengths. Dropout masks are sampled for each connection in a standard dropout method. Variational dropout locks a single dropout mask for all repeated connections in an RNN. This ensures diversity in training examples within a minibatch. Incorporating embedding dropout and weight tying techniques in the model reduces parameter count and improves training diversity. Embedding dropout involves performing dropout on the embedding matrix at a word level, while weight tying shares weights between the embedding and softmax layer. This approach ensures that all occurrences of a specific word disappear within a pass, enhancing model efficiency. The model improves by reducing parameter count and enhancing training diversity through embedding dropout and weight tying techniques. The dimensionality of word vectors is reduced to prevent overfitting, with L2-regularization used to control the model's norm and reduce overfitting. The model utilizes L2 regularization on weights to control the norm and reduce overfitting. Activation regularization penalizes large activations, while temporal activation regularization penalizes large changes in hidden states in RNNs. These techniques help improve model performance and prevent overfitting. The impact of different approaches on language modeling is evaluated using the Penn Treebank (PTB) and WikiText-2 datasets. PTB is heavily preprocessed with a limited vocabulary, while WikiText-2 is larger and retains capitalization, punctuation, and numbers. The experiments involved using a three-layer LSTM model with specific parameters for training on the PTB and WikiText-2 datasets. Batch sizes of 80 for WT2 and 40 for PTB were found to perform better with the NT-AvSGD algorithm. Fine-tuning was done using AvSGD with specific parameters to further improve the solution. The experiments involved using a three-layer LSTM model with specific parameters for training on the PTB and WikiText-2 datasets. Gradient clipping with maximum norm 0.25 and initial learning rate of 30 were used. Random BPTT lengths were chosen with specific probabilities. Various dropout values were applied to different parts of the model. Hyperparameters were chosen through trial and error. In the results, our approach is abbreviated as AWD-LSTM for AvSGD Weight-Dropped LSTM. We present single-model perplexity results for both our models and other competitive models in Table 1 and 2 for PTB and WT2 datasets. Our vanilla LSTM model outperforms the state of the art by approximately 1 unit on PTB and 0.1 units on WT2. Compared to recent state-of-the-art models, our model uses a vanilla LSTM, while other models introduce more complex architectures like recurrent highway networks and reinforcement learning agents. The study compared RNN language models with different hyperparameters, such as using a modified LSTM, Adam optimizer with \u03b21 = 0, skip connections between layers, and individual hyperparameter tuning for each dataset. They found that well-tuned shallow LSTMs were effective, similar to our AWD-LSTM model. The approaches in both studies may complement each other. In past work, pointer-based attention models have shown significant improvements in language modeling. The neural cache model can be added on top of a pre-trained language model at minimal cost, storing previous hidden states in memory cells for prediction. The cache model has three hyperparameters: memory size, coefficient of combination, and flatness of the cache distribution. The neural cache model improves language model perplexity by 6 points for PTB and 11 points for WT2. This suggests that existing neural language models struggle with capturing long term dependencies and recent words effectively. The pointer had a significant impact on the model's validation set perplexity. The contribution of each word to the cache model's overall perplexity was detailed. Results show improvements in handling <unk> tokens and the word \"Meridian\" in the validation portion of the WikiText-2 dataset. The sum of the total difference in loss function value between LSTM-only and LSTM-with-cache models was computed. The cache model significantly improves handling of rare words like \"Meridian\" and <unk> tokens. It is less beneficial for common word categories. A new cache framework is needed to leverage the strengths of both models. Experiments with AWD-QRNN show regularization techniques similar to AWD-LSTM. The AWD-QRNN model, utilizing regularization techniques similar to AWD-LSTM, achieved comparable results to LSTM models. QRNNs were faster and required fewer epochs to converge, with minimal changes in hyperparameters for competitive performance. The released code provides full details and hyperparameters for reference. The regularization strategies used in the model were crucial for achieving state-of-the-art performance. Removing regularization led to a significant degradation in performance, emphasizing the importance of averaging iterates and fine-tuning steps. The inclusion of all proposed strategies, including hidden-to-hidden LSTM regularization, was pivotal for optimal results. Regularization provided by weight-dropped LSTM is crucial for maintaining low perplexity, as shown by a rise of up to 11 points without it. Experimenting with static sequence lengths and matching embedding vector sizes to hidden states worsens performance. Increasing parameters by matching sizes leads to overfitting and degradation by almost 8 perplexity points. The computational overhead of larger embeddings outweighs potential benefits. In this work, regularization and optimization strategies for neural language models are discussed. The weight-dropped LSTM strategy is proposed to prevent overfitting, achieving state-of-the-art perplexity on data sets. Other strategies such as averaged SGD with non-monotonic trigger and variable BPTT length are investigated, outperforming custom-built RNN cells. Our models surpass custom-built RNN cells and complex regularization strategies, achieving lower state-of-the-art perplexity. The use of a neural cache further enhances performance. Regularization and optimization strategies are also applied to a quasi-recurrent neural network (QRNN) with comparable results to LSTM. These strategies are not limited to language modeling but can be applied to other sequence learning tasks."
