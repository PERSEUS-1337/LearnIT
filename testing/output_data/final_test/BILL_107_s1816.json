The Congress finds that the University of Alaska is the successor to Federal grants for the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines, but did not receive all intended land grants. The University of Alaska has one of the smallest land grants among State land grant colleges in the United States. The University of Alaska has smaller land grants compared to other land grant colleges in the western States. The Federal Government aims to transfer certain lands to the University of Alaska for development while returning other lands within conservation units to Federal ownership. This transfer is seen as beneficial for the long-term development of a stable population and a healthy economy. The University of Alaska holds legal title to lands transferred by the United States for education purposes, consistent with the original grant. The Act aims to establish the university as a land grant institution with sufficient holdings for operation and maintenance. The University of Alaska aims to maintain a university system for Alaska residents and acquire lands from the university within Federal parks to support the original purposes of those areas. The University of Alaska aims to maintain a university system for Alaska residents and acquire lands from the university within Federal parks to support the original purposes of those areas. SEC. 2. LAND GRANT. The University of Alaska is entitled to select up to 250,000 acres of Federal lands in Alaska for a land grant. The Secretary of the Interior must convey the selected lands to the University. Within 48 months, the University can submit a description of lands for conveyance, with the total not exceeding 275,000 acres at any time. The University of Alaska can select lands not conveyed to the State of Alaska or Native Corporations, with their approval. Selections are restricted in conservation units and national forests, except for specific areas with second growth timber. Selections are allowed in the National Petroleum Reserve--Alaska, with certain limitations. No selections can be made in certain areas within the National Petroleum Reserve--Alaska, including village selection areas and the Teshekpuk Lake Special Management Area. Additionally, selections are restricted in parts of NPRA north of latitude 69 degrees North exceeding 92,000 acres for a two-year period. The Secretary aims to negotiate revenue-sharing agreements with the University of Alaska and the State of Alaska within this timeframe. The Secretary aims to negotiate revenue-sharing agreements with the University of Alaska within a two-year period for NPRA leasing revenues. If no agreement is reached within three years, the University of Alaska may make selections within the area. The agreement would allow the University to receive a portion of annual revenues from mineral leases in NPRA, not exceeding ten percent or $9 million annually. Within 45 days of receiving a selection, the Secretary must publish notice in the Federal Register, allowing for a 60-day public comment period. Within six months, the Secretary must accept or reject the selection and notify the University with reasons for rejection. The Secretary can reject a selection if it impacts compliance with land entitlement provisions of relevant acts. The Secretary must promptly publish notice of acceptance or rejection of a selection in the Federal Register. Actions taken under this Act are not considered major Federal actions. The University cannot select Federal lands reserved for military purposes or agency administration without approval. Additional lands can be selected to replace rejected ones. Lands or interests in lands must be segregated and unavailable. The University may assess selected lands for resource potential and make a final decision within one year of approval. Core drilling and geological exploration are permitted, but exploratory drilling of oil and gas wells is not allowed. Lands or interests in lands must be segregated and unavailable for selection by the State of Alaska or a Native Corporation. The University must decide whether to accept selected lands within one year. If accepted, the United States' rights in the selection transfer to the University. Lakes, rivers, and streams in final selections will be surveyed and conveyed according to the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. Upon survey completion, patents will be issued for the lands or interests. The Secretary of Agriculture and other Federal departments/agencies must assist in implementing the Act by taking necessary actions promptly. The University of Alaska must convey certain lands to the Secretary as a condition for receiving a grant. The conveyance will be based on selected lands and a percentage of the total grant. The Secretary will accept quitclaim deeds for these lands. Additionally, the Act provides for judicial review. The University of Alaska can take legal action against the Department of the Interior, specifically the Secretary, for any violations of the Act or to review final agency decisions. The action must be filed in the United States District Court for the District of Alaska within two years of the alleged violation. Additionally, the court will have exclusive jurisdiction over such suits. The University of Alaska has the authority to select up to 250,000 acres of Federal lands in Alaska as a matching grant for lands received from the State. The selected lands must be in parcels of 25,000 acres or more and will be subject to the terms of the grant under section 2 of the Act. Attest: JERI THOMSON, Secretary."
