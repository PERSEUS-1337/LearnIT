    "content": "The Secretary of the Navy traditionally names Navy ships, but the authority is not explicitly defined in current U.S. law. The Naval History and Heritage Command follows established laws and procedures for ship naming. The Navy ship naming process is based on tradition and evolution rather than legislation. The Secretary of the Navy personally decides on new ship names, with recommendations coming from the Navy History and Heritage Command and various sources. Ship name recommendations are influenced by factors such as approved name categories for ship types and geographic names. The Secretary of the Navy approves ship names based on recommendations from various sources, including geographic names, previous distinguished ships, individuals, and naval leaders. After consideration, the Chief of Naval Operations recommends names for the building program to the Secretary of the Navy, who makes the final selection before the ship is christened by a sponsor. The ship's sponsor, selected by the Secretary of the Navy, is typically the eldest living direct female descendant for ships named after individuals. For other ships, wives of senior naval officers or public officials are honored. Secretaries can rely on various sources for ship name selection, including recommendations from the Chief of Naval Operations or the Commandant of the Marine Corps. The Secretary of the Navy can choose a ship's name based on recommendations from various sources, including the Chief of Naval Operations or the Commandant of the Marine Corps, as well as suggestions from concerned citizens, service members, and Congress. The final decision rests with the Secretary, who considers his own thoughts and preferences. The Navy follows rules for naming ships, with names evolving over time. For example, attack submarines were once named for fish, then cities, and now states. State names were given to battleships, then nuclear-powered cruisers and ballistic missile submarines, and now attack submarines. The Navy's ship-naming policies and traditions evolve over time, with names changing to accommodate technological advancements and choices made by Secretaries. The report to Congress in July 2012 highlighted that ship-naming conventions are not fixed and are subject to interpretation by each Secretary. There have been exceptions to the Navy's naming rules. The Navy's ship-naming rules have exceptions, particularly for naming ships after individuals instead of following the original naming convention. A report to Congress in July 2012 highlighted these exceptions, stating that naming ships for Presidents or Members of Congress has become a special cross-type naming convention. This tradition of exceptions dates back to the earliest days of the republic. Some observers criticize the naming of Navy ships, citing examples like the Seawolf class submarines named after a fish, a state, and a President. The Navy's ship-naming policies are deemed consistent with tradition, with exceptions for naming ships after individuals. The Navy named the first of its 12 planned next-generation ballistic missile submarines Columbia (SSBN-826) in honor of the District of Columbia. The naming rule for these ships has not been disclosed, but possibilities include cities, capital cities, or states. The current USS Columbia (SSN-771) will reach the end of its service life in 2028. The USS Columbia (SSN-771) is expected to reach the end of its service life in 2028, coinciding with the completion of SSBN-826. If SSN-771's service life is extended, there would be a naming conflict as only one Navy vessel can have the same name. One solution could be to rename SSBN-826 to something like District of Columbia, similar to the renaming of SSN-705 from Corpus Christi to City of Corpus Christi. The Navy has named Virginia-class boats after states and notable individuals, with plans to procure more in the future. As of May 6, 2019, names have been announced for boats through SSN-801, with a total of 30 boats procured through FY2019. The shipbuilding plan includes three additional boats in FY2020 and two per year in subsequent years. The Navy may run out of state names for Virginia-class boats starting around FY2022, leading to a need to amend naming rules or make exceptions. Aircraft carriers are now generally named after past US Presidents, with recent carriers following this trend. The Navy is currently procuring Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class carriers, with CVN-78 named after President Gerald R. Ford, CVN-79 after President John F. Kennedy, and CVN-80 as Enterprise. CVN-80 was procured in the FY2018 budget and would have been named by the current Secretary of the Navy, Richard Spencer, if named at the time of procurement. The Navy report to Congress in July 2012, under Secretary Ray Mabus, discusses the naming of aircraft carriers. Secretary Mabus values naming carriers on a case-by-case basis, allowing for names other than former Presidents. He suggests naming a future carrier after the decommissioned USS Enterprise to preserve its legacy. The most recent carrier not named after a President or Member of Congress was Nimitz (CVN-68). The Navy traditionally names destroyers after deceased members of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, including Secretaries of the Navy. However, there have been exceptions since 2012, with some destroyers named after living individuals such as Thomas Hudner, Paul Ignatius, and former Senator Carl Levin. The Navy has been naming destroyers after living individuals since 2012, including former Senator Carl Levin, Harvey C. Barnum Jr., Senator John S. McCain III, and former Senator Sam Nunn. The naming tradition extends to DDG-133, with names announced for destroyers up to DDG-131 and DDG-133. In FY2020, three DDG-51s were requested for procurement. The destroyer DDG-56 was renamed to include Senator John S. McCain III, who served in Congress and as a presidential candidate. DDG-133 was named after former Senator Sam Nunn. The Navy initiated the FFG(X) program to build 20 guided-missile frigates. The naming rule for this new class of ships has not been announced yet. Previous classes of Navy frigates were named after naval leaders and heroes, while Littoral Combat Ships were initially named after U.S. cities and towns. The Navy adjusted the naming rule for Littoral Combat Ships to include regionally important U.S. cities and communities. Exceptions were made for naming LCS-10 after former Representative Gabrielle Giffords and LCS-30 after HMAS Canberra, an Australian cruiser. The previous U.S. Navy ship, gun cruiser Canberra (CA-70), was also named in honor of HMAS Canberra. The HMAS Canberra (L02) is an amphibious assault ship that serves as the flagship of the Australian navy. The naming of LCS-30 after HMAS Canberra does not violate U.S. Navy naming rules. The Navy has announced names for all LCSs up to LCS-38, with a total of 35 LCSs procured through FY2019. The Navy has identified the 35th LCS as LCS-31, which currently has no name. The Navy does not plan to procure any more LCSs beyond the 35 already procured. If no additional LCSs are procured, LCS-31 will be the last to be named. There is a possibility that LCS-31 may be named for Cleveland. Amphibious assault ships are named for important battles or earlier Navy ships. The first LHA-6 class ship was named America, and LHA-7 was named Tripoli. The Navy announced the names of the LHA-7 and LHA-8 ships, Tripoli and Bougainville, respectively. The San Antonio class amphibious ships are named after major U.S. cities, communities, and locations attacked on September 11, 2001. Exceptions were made for naming ships after individuals like Representative John P. Murtha and for LPD-29. On May 2, 2018, the Navy named LPD-29 after Navy Captain Richard M. McCool, Jr., a Medal of Honor recipient. LPD-30, the first of the new LPD-17 Flight II design, remains unnamed. The Navy's new oilers will be named after civil rights advocates, with TAO-205 named after Representative John Lewis. The Navy plans to procure a total of 20 John Lewis-class ships. The Navy named several ships in the Lewis-class and Expeditionary Fast Transports after notable figures such as Harvey Milk, Earl Warren, and Medgar Evers. The naming rule for EPFs changed from American traits to small U.S. cities between December 2009 and October 2010. The Navy changed the naming rule for EPFs from American traits to small U.S. cities and counties. Names have been assigned to EPFs up to EPF-12, with funding for a 13th and 14th EPF in FY2018 and FY2019 respectively. Expeditionary Transport Docks and Expeditionary Sea Bases are named after famous names or places significant to U.S. Marines, including living persons like John Glenn and Hershel \"Woody\" Williams. ESB-5 was named after Marine Corps Vietnam veteran and Medal of Honor recipient Lance Corporal Miguel Keith. The Navy announced the naming of a new ship, ESB-6 and ESB-7 were procured in FY2018 and FY2019 respectively. The first ship in a new class, TATS-6, was named Navajo in honor of the Navajo people's contributions to the armed forces. Ships in this class will be named after prominent Native Americans or tribes. There is no rule for selecting state names for ships, but advocates may choose states with the longest time since a ship was last commissioned as a combat asset. The Navy named new ships ESB-6 and ESB-7 in FY2018 and FY2019. The Navy selected state names for ships based on the length of time since a ship was last commissioned as a combat asset. The most recent ship to serve was the battleship Indiana, decommissioned in October 1963. Secretary Mabus requested a list of state names absent the longest from the US Naval Register before deciding on names for submarines. The Navy named new ships ESB-6 and ESB-7 in FY2018 and FY2019 based on the length of time since a ship was last commissioned as a combat asset. Secretary Mabus requested a list of state names absent the longest from the US Naval Register before deciding on names for submarines. The Virginia class attack submarines SSN-791, SSN-792, and SSN-793 were named for Delaware, Vermont, and Oregon respectively, with historical references to previous ships with the same names. The Navy announced that the Virginia-class attack submarine SSN-801 would be named USS Utah, the second naval vessel with that name. The first USS Utah, a battleship, was commissioned in 1911 and was sunk during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. This naming tradition for Virginia-class submarines honors states that have not had a ship in commissioned service with the Navy for several decades. The Navy announced that the Virginia-class attack submarine SSN-801 would be named USS Utah, continuing the tradition of naming submarines after states that have not had a ship in commissioned service with the Navy for several decades. Currently, states like Kansas, Arizona, and Oklahoma have not had a ship named after them in over 97 years. The Navy may need to amend the naming rule for Virginia-class boats as they might run out of state names for submarines starting around FY2022. Historically, the Navy rarely names ships after living persons, with the last known instance being the brig JEFFERSON in 1814. The Navy has a history of rarely naming ships after living persons, with the last known instance being the brig JEFFERSON in 1814. However, the practice of naming ships after deserving Americans or naval leaders while they are still alive dates back to the Revolutionary War. George Washington, John Adams, James Madison, John Hancock, and Benjamin Franklin all had ships named after them before their deaths. The practice of naming ships after living persons was common until 1814, with a brig named after Thomas Jefferson. After the War of 1812, this practice declined, with only one exception in 1900 when a submarine was named after John Philip Holland. In the early 1970s, the Navy considered naming CVN 70 after Carl Vinson, following multiple unsuccessful attempts by Congress to do so. In the early 1970s, the Navy considered naming CVN 70 after Carl Vinson, in honor of his naval contributions. Despite a 160-year tradition against naming ships after living persons, Secretary Warner sought President Nixon's approval, who agreed to break tradition and announce the decision in 1974. This marked a return to the practice of occasionally honoring famous living individuals with ship names. The Navy has occasionally named ships after living individuals, including former Presidents, Navy Admirals, Senators, and entertainers. Congress has acknowledged and even encouraged this practice through Public Laws. While still rare, naming ships after living persons is now an accepted but sparingly used tradition for Secretaries of the Navy from both parties. Since 1974, at least 21 U.S. military ships have been named after living individuals, including Members of Congress. This practice is a way for the Navy to honor deserving individuals and their contributions to America's Navy-Marine Corps Team. The Navy named the destroyer DDG-51 after former Senator Sam Nunn on May 6, 2019. Several U.S. Navy ships have been named after Confederate officers, including the USS Robert E. Lee, USS Stonewall Jackson, USS Hunley, and USS Dixon. The CSS Hunley, commanded by George Dixon, carried out the world's first submarine attack on the USS Housatonic in February 1864. The USS Chancellorsville, commissioned in 1989, is named after Lee's victory and the battle where Gen. Stonewall Jackson was mortally wounded. Monuments and ship names honoring Confederates are seen as glorifying noble warriors rather than acknowledging their role in preserving slavery, a view not shared by many Americans. The USS Chancellorsville is the first U.S. Navy ship named for a Civil War battle fought in Virginia in 1863. Other ships have been named after American Indian leaders who fought against the United States. The naming of ships after Confederates is seen as glorifying noble warriors, despite their role in preserving slavery. The USS Chancellorsville, a Navy cruiser named after a Confederate Civil War victory, is unlikely to have its name changed despite ongoing debates about Confederate monuments in the United States. The ship was commissioned in 1989 and derives its name from the 1863 Battle of Chancellorsville, considered a significant victory for Confederate General Robert E. Lee. A Navy official mentioned that the ship's name comes from a battle, not an individual, and honors soldiers from both sides. The USS Chancellorsville, a Navy cruiser named after a Confederate victory in the Battle of Chancellorsville, features a crest honoring General Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. The Navy official mentioned the possibility of altering the crest, which reflects the rupture of the country during the Civil War. Despite ongoing debates about Confederate monuments, the ship's name is unlikely to be changed. The Navy has announced ship names years before procurement, which could limit future decision-making opportunities. This practice may also prevent Congress from expressing its views on potential ship names and could lead to embarrassment if the ship is not eventually procured. The Secretary typically announces the ship's name after it has been authorized or appropriated by Congress. The Navy has a practice of announcing ship names before Congressional approval, with the Secretary sometimes using discretion to name ships before formal approval. For example, the lead ship of the DDG-51 class of destroyers was named for Admiral Arleigh Burke two years before procurement. The destroyer Zumwalt (DDG-1000) and aircraft carrier Enterprise (CVN-80) were named before they were procured, with announcements made several years in advance. CVN-80, the third Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carrier, was named Enterprise. The ballistic missile submarine SSBN-826 will be named Columbia. The Navy also announced the names of the second through sixth John Lewis class oilers. In 2016, the names for TAO-206 through TAO-210 were announced for procurement in FY2018 to FY2022. The names were for Harvey Milk, Earl Warren, Robert F. Kennedy, Lucy Stone, and Sojourner Truth, respectively. The first six ships in the TAO-205 class are being procured under a block buy contract authorized by Congress in the FY2016 defense budget. The Navy names ships based on various criteria, including public interest in naming ships after states, cities, battles, or admired individuals. For example, a letter-writing campaign by New Hampshire students led to a submarine being named after the state in 2004. Input and recommendations from the President and Congress are also considered in the naming process. Every Secretary of the Navy receives requests to name ships after hometowns, heroes, or famous ships, leading to contested nomination processes. Public opposition to naming decisions is common, as seen in recent examples like ships named after President Lyndon Johnson, former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, and late Representative John P. Murtha. The naming of Navy ships, such as LPD-26, TAKE-13, and TAKE-14, has been influenced by Congress. There have been debates over naming aircraft carriers, with CVN-72 and CVN-73 named to preempt congressional pressure. A decision by President Clinton in 1995 resolved the rivalry over naming CVN-76 for President Truman or Reagan. President Clinton announced in February 1995 the naming of carriers CVN-75 for Truman and CVN-76 for Reagan. The decision to name CVN-77 for President George H. W. Bush may have been influenced by Congress. The FY2007 John Warner National Defense Authorization Act expressed that CVN-78 should be named for President Gerald R. Ford, which was confirmed by the Navy in January 2007. In the 111th Congress, a resolution suggested naming a naval ship after John William Finn, but it was not acted upon. The Navy announced in February 2012 that DDG-113 would be named after John William Finn. The Navy announced in February 2012 that DDG-113, an Arleigh Burke class destroyer, would be named John Finn. The FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act expressed Congress's encouragement to name a naval vessel after Rafael Peralta. The Navy later announced that DDG-113 would be named Rafael Peralta. Secretaries of the Navy consider various influences, including input from the President and Congress, when naming ships. The Navy considers input from Congress and the President when naming ships. Congress can pass legislation regarding ship names, expressing their views and potentially directing the Navy to take action. Examples of such legislation include S.Res. 332 of the 115th Congress. Legislation such as S.Res. 332 of the 115th Congress reflects support or disagreement with Navy ship-naming decisions. Examples include H.Res. 1022 of the 111th Congress supporting the naming of a ship for Medgar Evers. The Navy ship-naming decision for the Los Angeles-class attack submarine Corpus Christi (SSN-705) was met with disagreement, leading to a resolution to rename the vessel to City of Corpus Christi. This resolution was introduced in April 1982 and the name change was officially made in May 1982. Additionally, in April 2013, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced that a San Antonio-class amphibious ship would be named for Portland, OR, making it the third Navy ship to bear the name Portland. The USS Portland has a long history with multiple ships bearing the name. The first cruiser was commissioned in 1933 and decommissioned in 1946, while the second amphibious ship was in service from 1970 to 2003. A letter from Senators Collins and King requested the new San Antonio-class ship, USS Portland LPD-27, to also honor Portland, Maine. The Navy replied affirmatively in April 2013. The Navy replied to Senators Collins and King in April 2013, stating that the USS Portland LPD-27 was named after Portland, Oregon, to acknowledge the support and contributions of the city and state. Oregon was the only state without a ship named after it in the fleet. The Navy named the Virginia-class attack submarine SSN-793 for Oregon and the Navy ship LPD-27 solely for Portland, OR. LPD-27 is the third U.S. Navy ship to bear the name Portland, following the World War II heavy cruiser CA 33 and the amphibious ship LSD 37. It is scheduled to be commissioned in Portland, OR on April 21, 2018. The Congress has shown interest in future Navy ship-naming decisions, with past examples of proposed bills and amendments dating back to the 93rd Congress. While some measures expressed Congress's opinion on ship names, others mandated specific names. S.Con.Res. 10 of the 115th Congress suggested that the Secretary of the Navy should name the next nuclear-powered ship. The sense of Congress is that the next nuclear-powered submarine of the US Navy should be named the \"USS Los Alamos\" due to the longstanding relationship between Los Alamos and the Navy, dating back to the Manhattan Project. Captain \"Deke\" Parsons, a resident of Los Alamos, played a key role in the safe delivery of the nuclear bomb during World War II. The people of Los Alamos have played a crucial role in designing various nuclear weapons and systems for the Navy, including the Regulus missile, atomic depth bombs, Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and nuclear propulsion systems for submarines and aircraft carriers. They also host United States Naval Academy midshipmen for hands-on scientific and engineering experiences. The United States Naval Academy midshipmen work on real-world challenges in national security, contributing to future Navy leadership. Naming a submarine Los Alamos recognizes the relationship between the Navy and Los Alamos, honoring their 75th anniversary and contributions to the Navy. The Congress resolves that the next nuclear-powered submarine of the United States Navy should be named \"USS Los Alamos\" in honor of the 75th anniversary and contributions of Los Alamos to the Navy. This decision is based on the Navy's policies and practices for naming its ships, as outlined in the July 2012 Navy report to Congress. The Navy's current ship naming policies align with historical practices. Feasibility of establishing fixed policies for naming vessels is assessed. The report recommends specific policies for each class of vessels if fixed policies are deemed advisable. The Secretary of Defense may consider other relevant matters regarding ship naming practices. The Navy's ship naming policies align with historical practices and traditions. Fixed policies for naming vessels are deemed inadvisable as they have worked well for over two centuries. The Naval History and Heritage Command will publish a list of current naming rules to improve understanding of ship naming decisions. The Navy's ship naming policies align with historical practices and traditions. The Naval History and Heritage Command will publish a list of current naming rules to improve understanding of ship naming decisions. This list will be updated as required."
