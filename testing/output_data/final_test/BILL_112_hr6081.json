    "content": "The Act titled \"Advancing Innovative Manufacturing Act of 2012\" amends Section 33 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to focus on Advanced Manufacturing Technology Consortia. The Director is authorized to support industry-led consortia for precompetitive industrial research in advanced manufacturing, with objectives including promoting public-private technology development, aligning research with industry needs, and maximizing federal investment. The Director is authorized to support industry-led consortia for precompetitive industrial research in advanced manufacturing to leverage federal investment, increase research and development investment, accelerate technological innovation, and foster broad participation. The consortium, made up of various stakeholders, collaborates on technology roadmaps for advanced manufacturing research, supports precompetitive research, promotes technology transfer to the private sector, and facilitates the development of new technologies. The Director will consider selection criteria for awarding applications under this section, including impact on manufacturing, technical risk, new knowledge production, and sustainability. $120,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2013 through 2017. SEC. 34. SMALL MANUFACTURER INNOVATION PROGRAM. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to include a new section for a program supporting small manufacturers. The Director will conduct a pilot program to boost the innovative capabilities of small- and medium-sized manufacturers by supporting research and development in advanced manufacturing. The program aims to accelerate the development of processes, advance novel products and technologies, and reduce risks associated with developing new products for advanced manufacturing. The Director will award grants to small- or medium-sized manufacturers in the United States for research and development in advanced manufacturing. The program aims to foster collaboration between manufacturers and research institutions, promote collaboration among manufacturers facing similar challenges, and support the development of innovative products and technologies. The program under this section involves two phases for developing proposals and prototypes with demonstrated scientific and technical merit. Small- or medium-sized manufacturers must submit applications to the Director. Stakeholder input will be solicited, and coordination with other government programs will be ensured. The Advancing Innovative Manufacturing Act of 2012 requires the Director to report to Congress after 4 years, assessing the program's activities, goals achievement, recommendations for improvement, and whether the program should continue. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2013. The Advancing Innovative Manufacturing Act of 2012 authorizes funding as follows: $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2013, $25,500,000 for fiscal year 2014, $39,750,000 for fiscal year 2015, $42,250,000 for fiscal year 2016, and $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2017. The Advancing Innovative Manufacturing Act of 2012 authorizes funding for the Innovation Voucher Program. The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 is amended to include an Innovation Voucher Program aimed at accelerating innovative activities and enhancing competitiveness for small- and medium-sized manufacturers in the US. This program fosters collaborations between manufacturers and research institutions to access technical expertise for developing innovative products and manufacturing processes. The Innovation Voucher Program under the amended Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 offers vouchers worth up to $20,000 to small- and medium-sized manufacturers for research and development, product development, and technology transfer activities. The program aims to streamline application and administrative procedures for accessing services at eligible research institutions. The Secretary must establish regulations for awarding vouchers under the Innovation Voucher Program, including criteria for recipient selection, financial reporting procedures, and other necessary policies to streamline the program. The Secretary may transfer funds appropriated to the Department of Commerce to other Federal agencies for authorized services. All amounts appropriated for the Innovation Voucher Program must be used for vouchers, with eligible research institutions allowed to retain a percentage for administrative costs. The Secretary may use centers established under the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act for outreach and information dissemination. A plan must be submitted to Congress within 180 days outlining program objectives and assessment metrics. The Secretary will report to Congress on activities, impact on manufacturers, and recommendations for optimizing the pilot program within 3 years of enactment. Coordination and nonduplication efforts are emphasized. The Secretary will ensure coordination and nonduplication of activities with other federal programs. Eligible research institutions include higher education institutions, Federal laboratories, federally funded research centers, and Hollings Manufacturing Extension Centers. The pilot program under section 25 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act authorizes $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2013 to 2017. SEC. 5. ADVANCED MANUFACTURING EDUCATION. Section 506(b) of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 is amended to award grants to community colleges for advanced manufacturing education reforms to develop a well-trained workforce. Activities may include developing educational materials, courses, curricula, and faculty professional development programs. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 amends Section 506(b) to award grants to community colleges for advanced manufacturing education reforms. This includes faculty professional development programs, establishment of education centers, student recruitment and retention activities, and other determined activities by the Director."
