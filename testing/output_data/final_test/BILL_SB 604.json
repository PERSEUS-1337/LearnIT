    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 1063.1 of the Insurance Code is amended to define \"member insurer\" and \"insolvent insurer\" in relation to the association. A member insurer is required to be part of the association unless participating in a government insolvency program. An insolvent insurer is one that was a member of the association when the policy was issued or when the insured event occurred, and has been declared insolvent by a court or legislative measure. Covered claims are the obligations of an insolvent insurer that meet specific criteria, including being within the coverage of an insurance policy, unpaid by the insurer, presented as a claim before the last filing date, incurred before policy termination, and when the insurer's assets are insufficient to cover them. This also applies to workers' compensation insurance for providing benefits under state law. In the case of other classes of insurance, the claimant or insured must be a resident of the state at the time of the insured occurrence, or the property from which the claim arises must be permanently located in the state. The association covers obligations assumed by an insolvent insurer from a ceding insurer if the ceding insurer is no longer admitted to transact business in the state. Both insurers must have been members at the time of assumption. The association can recover assets from the ceding company to cover claim payments and has subrogation rights against the ceding insurer's policyholders. Covered claims exclude obligations from life, health, disability insurance, mortgage guaranty, financial guaranty, fidelity or surety insurance, credit insurance, title insurance, and ocean marine insurance. Any claims servicing agreement or insurance policy providing retroactive insurance of a known loss or losses are not covered under covered claims. This also excludes obligations of the insolvent insurer arising from reinsurance contracts or obligations incurred after the expiration date of the insurance policy. Insurers, insurance pools, or underwriting associations cannot make claims against the insured of an insolvent insurer for contribution, indemnity, or subrogation, except if the claim exceeds the policy limits of the insolvent insurer. The insured is entitled to a credit or setoff in the amount of the policy limits of the insolvent insurer's policy. \"Covered claims do not include amounts under $100, claims exceeding policy limits, claims over $500,000, punitive damages, or delayed Workers' Compensation benefits.\" (9) \"Covered claims\" exclude claims covered by other insurance available to the claimant, claims by persons other than the original claimant, and claims by assignees or those claiming by subrogation. \n(10) \"Covered claims\" also exclude obligations from insurance policies issued by the State Compensation Insurance Fund's separate division. (11) \"Covered claims\" exclude obligations from policies issued before the insolvent insurer was authorized in California. \n(12) \"Covered claims\" do not include surplus deposits of subscribers under Section 1374.1. (13) \"Covered claims\" include obligations from insurance policies for self-insured employers for excess workers' compensation benefits, subject to per-claim limit and allocation to specific categories as per Section 1063.5. The provisions apply to obligations under a policy issued to a self-insured employer or group under Section 3700 of the Labor Code. If the Self-Insurers\u2019 Security Fund assumes liabilities under Section 3701.5, these provisions govern. Applies to insurance policies indemnifying self-insured employers for workers\u2019 compensation benefits exceeding a retention limit. Excludes special excess workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies not issued under specific authority. The paragraph excludes special excess workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies not issued under specific authority. Each self-insured employer or group, or the Self-Insurers\u2019 Security Fund, is responsible for handling claims under insurance policies as required by the Labor Code, unless benefits exceed the retention limit. If benefits paid on a claim exceed the retention limit, CIGA will handle adjusting, defending, and making payments for the claim. Self-insured employers or the Self-Insurers\u2019 Security Fund are not obligated to pay benefits beyond the retention limit. If benefits paid on a claim exceed the retention limit, CIGA will handle adjusting, defending, and making payments for the claim. Self-insured employers or the Self-Insurers\u2019 Security Fund are not obligated to pay benefits beyond the retention limit, but they must continue defending and adjusting the claim. CIGA has the right to intervene in proceedings and assert statutory limitations and exclusions. CIGA is responsible for paying all benefits on covered claims, regardless of other parties involved. Self-insured employers or the Self-Insurers\u2019 Security Fund are not obligated to pay benefits beyond a specific retention limit. In case benefits exceed per-claim limit, responsibility returns to self-insured employer or Self-Insurers\u2019 Security Fund for pending and future insolvencies involving companies receiving benefits from guarantee association. The definition of \"covered claims\" includes claims filed by an employee of a general employer in a contractual relationship with a self-insured governmental entity. The self-insurance of a special employer governmental entity is not considered other insurance if required by contractual agreement. \"Admitted to transact insurance in this state\" refers to an insurer with a valid certificate of authority. An \"Affiliate\" is a person who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with an insolvent insurer. \"Control\" means the power to direct management and policies, presumed with ownership of 10% or more voting securities unless proven otherwise. Claimant refers to an insured making a first-party claim or a person filing a liability claim, excluding affiliates of the insolvent insurer. Ocean marine insurance covers a wide range of maritime perils and risks related to vessel ownership, operation, and liability for personal injury or property damage. Unearned premium is the portion of a premium not earned due to policy cancellation, remaining for the unexpired term. It excludes amounts for retroactive insurance, return of premium under certain policies, or policies with final premium cost based on actual losses."
