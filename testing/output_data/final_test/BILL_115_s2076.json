The \"BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act\" aims to raise awareness about Alzheimer's disease and related dementias among public health officials, healthcare professionals, and the general public. It focuses on translating research findings into evidence-based interventions for affected populations and caregivers, as well as expanding activities through public-private partnerships. The eligibility requirements for receiving a grant under the \"BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act\" include coordinating with existing programs, promoting evidence-based interventions for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, and prioritizing activities to expand efforts in implementing interventions.
