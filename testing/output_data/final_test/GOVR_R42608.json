    "content": "LIBOR is an index measuring the cost of funds for global banks in London. The British Bankers' Association constructs it, and Thomson Reuters publishes it. Each day, a panel of banks is surveyed to determine the average rate. LIBOR includes rates for 15 different maturities and 10 currencies. The most common reference in the US is the three-month dollar LIBOR. The three-month dollar LIBOR is determined by a panel of 18 banks, including Bank of America, Citibank, and JPMorgan Chase. The highest 4 and lowest 4 responses are discarded, and the middle 10 are averaged. Banks can apply to participate in the survey, with criteria based on market share, reputation, and expertise in currency transactions. The number of reporting banks can change. The LIBOR index is used as a benchmark in private loan contracts and financial derivatives, comparing fixed interest rates to LIBOR. It is also utilized in futures exchanges for traded contracts. LIBOR is used in futures exchanges and as a benchmark in private loan contracts. Lenders may base future loan interest rates on LIBOR values published on the loan date. The largest banks use LIBOR to represent borrowing costs in global financial markets. Other benchmarks like U.S. Treasury yields or the Federal Funds Rate may not always align with bank borrowing costs. Repurchase agreements in New York money markets could be an alternative benchmark. The value of loans, derivatives, and financial instruments referencing LIBOR is significant. Estimates show that a large percentage of adjustable rate mortgages and subprime ARMs use LIBOR as a benchmark. Around 75% of municipalities have contracts tied to the index. While a single bank on a LIBOR reporting panel can influence the index, it may not always move it in the desired direction. A single bank on the LIBOR panel can influence the index but may not always move it as desired. For example, if a bank's response falls within the middle of the responses, it can affect the dollar LIBOR calculation. In a scenario where 4 banks report 3%, the next 10 report 8%, and 4 report 10%, the average would be 8%. If a bank that reported 10% wants to lower the LIBOR, it can impact the final rate. If a bank on the LIBOR panel wants to lower the rate, it can influence the index by adjusting its bid. By reporting a lower rate, it can impact the average rate even if its own response is disregarded. However, there is a limit to how much a single bank can affect the LIBOR. Exaggerating the reported rate may not significantly change the index. Barclays admitted to submitting false survey responses to manipulate the LIBOR index, which is used in U.S. derivatives markets. This manipulation is a violation of U.S. law, and Barclays settled separately with UK officials for violating UK law. The bank's admissions with the CFTC and DOJ are detailed in the settlement documents. The settlement documents signed by Barclays with the CFTC and DOJ include employee emails documenting manipulation of LIBOR through changing survey responses for trade positions and reputation protection, as well as attempts to influence other banks. While individual actions may have limited impact, collusion could have a greater effect. Barclays' derivatives trades are just one part of its balance sheet, and the bank reached out to other panel responders in its attempts. Barclays' internal emails reveal derivatives traders asking employees to submit false survey responses to benefit their trading positions. Unlike other divisions, derivatives traders' preferred LIBOR outcome changes daily, with some days preferring high rates and others low rates. In the settlement, Barclays admits to submitting false survey responses. Barclays admitted to submitting false survey responses for the LIBOR index during the 2005-2007 period to protect its reputation. UK officials raised concerns about Barclays' responses being higher than other responders, which could signal weakness to global investors. Barclays consistently under-reported its cost of funds in 2008, leading to concerns raised by UK officials and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York about the methodology for the LIBOR index. The FRBNY posted documents revealing its concerns with LIBOR calculations in 2008. In 2008, documents were released showing concerns about the credibility of the LIBOR index, including emails between Timothy F. Geithner and Mervyn King discussing recommendations to enhance LIBOR's credibility."
