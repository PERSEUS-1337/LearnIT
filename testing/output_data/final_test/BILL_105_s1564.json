    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Holocaust Victims Redress Act.\" It pertains to heirless assets and includes findings and purposes in Section 101. The Congress finds that among seized German assets in the US during WWII were assets of Jewish Holocaust victims, and frozen Swiss assets included those of Holocaust victims. Legislation was enacted to transfer up to $3,000,000 of heirless assets to organizations for Holocaust victims. In 1962, Congress authorized the transfer of $3,000,000 of heirless assets to Holocaust relief organizations due to administrative difficulties. A $500,000 settlement was provided to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization of New York, representing 1/6th of the authorized maximum level. In 1997, a representative of the Secretary of State urged reconsideration of the limited settlement amount. The $500,000 settlement for Holocaust victims is a fraction of the authorized amount. The victims have a moral claim to the unrestituted assets. The US leadership in meeting obligations to Holocaust victims would strengthen efforts for the distribution of remaining gold held by the Tripartite Commission. The United States appeals to 15 nations claiming a portion of gold to contribute to Holocaust survivors. The Act aims to provide justice to survivors worldwide and appropriate funds for heirless victims of the Holocaust. The United States appeals to nations with claims on gold held by the Tripartite Commission to contribute to Holocaust survivors through charitable organizations. SEC. 102. Distributions by the Tripartite Gold Commission. The President directs the commissioner to seek an agreement for signatories of the Paris Agreement on Reparation to contribute gold to assist Holocaust survivors. The President is authorized to obligate up to $30,000,000 for distribution according to the agreement. Any budget authority in paragraph (1) is effective only to the extent provided in advance in appropriation Acts. SEC. 103. FULFILLMENT OF OBLIGATION OF THE UNITED STATES. Authorization of Appropriations for fiscal years 1998-2000 not to exceed $25,000,000 for distribution to specified organizations. $5,000,000 authorized for archival research and translation services to assist in Holocaust asset restitution and education. TITLE II--WORKS OF ART SEC. 201. FINDINGS. Congress finds that pre-World War II principles of international law prohibited pillage and seizure of works of art. International sanctions against confiscation of art have been strengthened post-World War II, with conventions like the 1970 Convention on the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Cultural Property. The Nazis defied these laws by extorting and looting art during World War II. The Nazis looted art to finance their war of aggression and genocide against individuals of Jewish and other heritage during the Holocaust. International legal principles should apply to stolen art from Holocaust victims, much of which remains unrecovered after being transferred to the Soviet Union post-war. The Congress urges governments to facilitate the return of private and public property, like works of art, confiscated during Nazi rule to rightful owners, in line with the 1907 Hague Convention."
