    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 aims to maintain marine mammal species at their optimum sustainable populations by ensuring that annual removals do not exceed the potential biological removal level. Requiring commercial fishermen to achieve a zero mortality rate goal for marine mammals is unnecessary to reach this objective. The Marine Mammal Protection Act aims to maintain species at sustainable levels and penalizes commercial fishermen. Congress intended the zero mortality rate goal to be met with feasible technology. Species at historic levels hinder endangered species' recovery. Ecosystem management principles are compromised by prioritizing one species. Interaction with marine mammals should aim to reduce injuries and mortalities with the best equipment. The goal of the Marine Mammal Protection Act is to maintain species at sustainable levels and penalize commercial fishermen. Congress intended to achieve a zero mortality rate with feasible technology to reduce injuries and mortalities. Modification of goals for reducing incidental take of marine mammals in commercial fishing. Repeal of Zero Mortality Goal and conforming amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, including redesignating subsections and making various amendments to different sections of the Act. The text chunk involves amendments to section 118 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, including redesignating subsections and making corrections to references within the section. The amendments to section 118 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 involve redesignating subsections and correcting references within the section. Amendment to section 118(e)(2) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act aims to reduce incidental mortality of marine mammals in fishing operations within 5 years, considering fishery economics and technology availability."
