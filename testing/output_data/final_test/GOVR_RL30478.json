    "content": "This report outlines federal programs that support water supply and wastewater projects, with different agencies like Reclamation and USACE requiring individual project authorizations from Congress, while other agencies have standing program authorizations for funding. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Department of Commerce focus on community and economic development, while USACE's responsibilities include inland navigation, flood and storm damage reduction, and aquatic ecosystem restoration. EPA's mission is to protect public health and the environment. The programs discussed in this report differ in important ways, although they all address water supply and wastewater treatment to some extent. Funding for individual project authorizations must be secured annually through congressional appropriations, while programs have set criteria and provide funding through a competitive process. The report focuses on municipal and industrial water and wastewater activities, describing purposes, financing mechanisms, eligibility requirements, recent funding, and statutory/regulatory authority for various projects and programs. It does not cover special projects for Indian Tribes, Alaskan Native Villages, or regional programs like those in the Appalachian region or U.S. Territories. It also excludes projects involving irrigation, flood control, power supply, and recreation. The report focuses on municipal and industrial water and wastewater activities, excluding special projects for Indian Tribes, Alaskan Native Villages, or regional programs. Federal programs like Reclamation may support M&I activities incidentally. Other federal authorities may assist with emergency water and wastewater needs. Congressional funding for these programs varies greatly due to competition for discretionary spending. State and local contributions are the primary source of funds for water infrastructure improvements, with policymakers considering alternative financing approaches to supplement traditional funding tools. Supporters of new ideas like the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act Program see them as complementary options. State and local governments have been increasing spending on drinking water and wastewater treatment improvements, with their share of such projects reaching 96% in 2017 compared to the federal government's 4%. The Bureau of Reclamation manages numerous dams and reservoirs, serving around 31 million people and delivering approximately 28.5 million acre-feet of water. Their assets have a replacement value of nearly $100 billion. The Bureau of Reclamation delivers approximately 28.5 million acre-feet of water annually, with a focus on municipal and industrial water deliveries. Congress has authorized rural water supply projects and reclamation wastewater projects since 1980. These projects are a small part of Reclamation's overall portfolio. Reclamation projects historically required full repayment with interest for municipal and industrial water supply facilities. However, Congress has authorized nonreimbursable federal funding for certain projects, such as rural water projects serving Indian populations. For non-Indian rural water supply projects, federal funding can cover up to 75%-85% of project costs. Title XVI projects receive a lower federal share of costs compared to rural water projects. The share of costs for Title XVI projects is generally lower than for rural water projects, limited to a maximum of 25% of total project costs or $20 million per project authorization. Reclamation undertakes projects at the direction of Congress, with feasibility studies needing congressional authorization before construction. There are no clear eligibility criteria for selecting large projects, as Congress relies on provided information. Projects are selected based on feasibility studies, cost-benefit analysis, and political considerations. M&I projects are typically part of larger multipurpose projects like irrigation, flood control, and hydro power. The federal government finances and constructs projects upfront, with M&I costs repaid 100% with interest. Local governments and organizations may approach Reclamation for project funding. Reclamation and Congress provide project support for organizations like irrigation, water, or conservation districts. Construction project funding must be approved by Congress. Reclamation works on projects in the 17 western states unless specifically authorized. Total regular Reclamation appropriations for FY2019 were $1.571 billion, with a FY2020 budget request of $1.109 billion. Water supply activities are carried out in the western states as authorized by the Reclamation Act of 1902. In 2006, Congress authorized a rural water supply program (P.L. 109-451) for Reclamation to work with rural communities and tribes on water needs through investigations and feasibility studies. Between 2006 and 2016, Reclamation studied approximately 26 projects under this program. Reclamation studied 26 projects under a rural water supply program authorized by Congress, but no projects were recommended for construction. The authority expired in FY2016 and has not been renewed. Reclamation continues to pursue authorized rural water projects, with $1.3 billion still needed for construction. Many projects are linked to irrigation facilities under the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program or provide benefits to Indian tribes. Projects under the rural water supply program are cost-shared between the federal government and local sponsors, with federal cost-share averaging 64%. The federal government covers up to 100% of the cost for Indian rural water supply projects. Assistance is provided based on financial and programmatic criteria, with a nonfederal cost-share required for future construction authorization. Local governments, water and conservation districts, and Indian tribes can seek project support from Reclamation or Congress. Reclamation's rural water supply program receives funding for construction projects, which must be authorized and appropriated by Congress. The program only operates in the 17 western states unless Congress specifically authorizes projects. An interim final rule for new rural supply projects has expired, and ongoing construction is limited to previously authorized projects. In FY2019, $132.7 million was allocated for rural water supply projects, with $98 million above the Administration's budget request. Funding for FY2020 was requested in the Administration's budget proposal. The Rural Water Supply Program, authorized by the Rural Water Supply Act of 2006, received $27.7 million in the Administration's FY2020 budget proposal for ongoing projects. The program expired in FY2016 and has not been renewed. Projects under Title XVI of P.L. 102-575 focus on reclaiming and reusing wastewater and impaired water for various purposes like irrigation and wildlife enhancement. Title XVI of P.L. 102-575 authorizes projects for reclaiming and reusing wastewater for purposes like irrigation, groundwater recharge, and fish and wildlife enhancement. The legislation has been amended multiple times, with the most recent changes in December 2016 under the WIIN Act. These amendments allow for the Secretary of the Interior to accept nonfederal feasibility studies for potential projects. As of February 2019, 47 projects have been authorized under the WIIN Act authority. Title XVI projects, authorized under the WIIN Act, aim to provide supplemental water supplies by recycling various sources of contaminated water. The backlog of federal funding for these projects exceeds $1 billion. Funding is part of the Reclamation WaterSMART program, which also supports water conservation and river basin studies under separate authority. Title XVI projects, authorized under the WIIN Act, aim to provide supplemental water supplies by recycling contaminated water sources. The federal government shares project construction costs with local sponsors, with a maximum federal share of 25% and a limit of $20 million per project. Feasibility studies have a federal share of 50%, except in cases of financial hardship. The program is limited to projects in the 17 western states unless specified otherwise. The WIIN Act authorized Title XVI projects in the 17 western states, providing federal assistance to non-federal entities for water recycling projects. The Act expanded DOI's authority to accept nonfederal feasibility studies for construction funding if they meet program criteria. The WIIN Act authorizes Title XVI projects in 17 western states, providing federal assistance for water recycling projects. Reclamation has issued evaluation criteria for prioritizing projects, with $58.6 million allocated for FY2019 and $3.0 million requested for FY2020. Geographically specific authorizations are no longer required for funding under the WIIN Act. The original statutory authority for the reclamation wastewater and reuse program is the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act, Title XVI of P.L. 102-575, as amended. Projects authorized prior to 1996 ranged in size from $152 million to $690 million, while post-1996 project authorizations have been smaller, ranging from $6.6 million to $319 million. Other statutes that authorized Title XVI projects include the Reclamation Recycling and Water Conservation Act of 1996, the Oregon Public Land Transfer and Protection Act of 1998, the 1999 Water Resources Development Act, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2001. The curr_chunk discusses various bills and acts related to water resources, including the Appropriations Act for FY2001, the Emergency Wartime Supplementals Act of 2003, and the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nations Act. These legislative actions have implications for water management and infrastructure development. Under its civil works program, USACE operates water resource projects focused on navigation, flood damage reduction, and aquatic ecosystem restoration. USACE reservoirs have 9.8 million acre-feet of storage for municipal and industrial water supply, with 0.9 million acre-feet allocated for this purpose. Availability of M&I water from USACE reservoirs is subject to constraints. USACE reservoirs provide M&I water subject to availability and local responsibility. Congress authorized USACE projects for water supply, with expanded authorities in the WIIN Act for water conservation. USACE does not acquire water rights for projects; users must secure them. Limited general authority is given for M&I water supply, with 1958 and 1944 authorities for water storage and temporary contracts from reservoirs. The Water Supply Act of 1958 authorized USACE to recommend M&I water supply storage space in reservoirs. USACE can provide surplus water under short-term contracts but cannot significantly modify projects or sell water. M&I contracts provide space in reservoirs without guaranteeing a fixed quantity of water. USACE provides water storage space in reservoirs for M&I purposes, with no fixed water quantity guarantee. Nonfederal entities pay for the storage services through upfront financing and long-term repayment contracts. New projects involve annual payments for M&I water supply storage. USACE requires equitable allocation of water supply costs for new projects, with repayment agreements before construction. Repayment options include during construction or over 30 years with adjustable interest rates. Users must reimburse USACE annually for operation and maintenance costs. Exceptions to USACE's authority exist, and fees collected from nonfederal entities are deposited into a U.S. Treasury account for federal fund use. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) allocates federal funds for water supply authorities and construction projects. In FY2018, $8 million was used for water supply authorities and $1 million for projects in Arkansas. In FY2019, $7 million was allocated for water supply authorities, $3 million for projects in Arkansas, and $2 million for a reservoir study in Colorado. The FY2020 budget request included $7 million for water supply storage activities. Various legislative acts provide authority for these projects. Since 1992, Congress has authorized over 400 projects for the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to provide assistance to communities for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. These projects range from $0.5 million to $25 million for planning and design, and $0.2 million to $435 million for construction. Federal policy states that water supply is primarily a local and state responsibility, but rural and small communities have increasingly sought federal assistance. Congress has authorized over 400 projects for the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to provide assistance for environmental infrastructure. Funding for these projects comes from congressional appropriations, with a typical 75% federal and 25% nonfederal cost-share requirement. The specifics of how USACE and nonfederal financing are managed vary depending on the authorization. USACE uses appropriated funds to financially assist nonfederal sponsors for environmental infrastructure projects. Eligibility is determined by geographic location and project type specified in the authorities. Planning requirements like benefit-cost analysis are not applicable to this assistance. Since 1992, Congress has allocated roughly $2 billion to USACE for environmental infrastructure assistance. In FY2018 and FY2019, Congress provided $70 million and $77 million, respectively, as part of additional funding. The Administration uses guidance from enacted appropriations bills to allocate these funds for authorized environmental infrastructure activities, identified in the agency's Work Plan within two months of enactment. The Trump Administration did not request funding for USACE environmental infrastructure assistance in its FY2020 budget. Prior to 1992, USACE was not heavily involved in municipal water projects, but now it is authorized for over 400 projects. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is authorized to assist local interests with planning, design, and construction assistance for environmental infrastructure projects through legislative vehicles like the Water Resources Development Act. Recent congressional authorizing activity for environmental infrastructure assistance has been limited due to policies restricting congressionally directed spending. Congress expanded a process in December 2016 for nonfederal entities to propose modifications to existing authorities for environmental infrastructure assistance. The USDA provides water and waste disposal programs for rural communities with populations of 10,000 or less. The Rural Utilities Service administers these programs, allocating funds based on rural population, poverty, and unemployment. Between 2009 and 2016, RUS funded $13.9 billion for nearly 5,825 water supply and wastewater projects. In FY2016, RUS allocated $1.8 billion for water supply and wastewater projects, with 46% for water supply, 49% for wastewater systems, and 5% for combined projects. There is a high demand for funding in small rural communities, with a $2.5 billion backlog of requests for water and wastewater projects. Eligible projects include drinking water facilities, sanitary sewers, and stormwater drainage and disposal facilities. The goal is to provide basic amenities, alleviate health hazards, and promote growth in rural areas. The USDA provides grants, loans, and technical assistance for rural water and waste disposal projects. Grants are given to qualified nonprofits for technical assistance and training. In FY2018, $40 million will be allocated for technical assistance. Direct loans are preferred, with grants given only when necessary to reduce user charges, especially for lower-income communities. The USDA provides funding for rural water and waste disposal projects through a mix of loans and grants. The distribution of funds is based on rural population, poverty levels, and unemployment rates. Loans can be used for water and waste infrastructure in low-income rural areas, with repayment terms of up to 40 years. The USDA provides loans or guarantees up to 90% of loans made by third-party lenders for rural water and waste projects. Interest rates are based on the community's economic and health environment, with poverty, market, or intermediate rates. Poverty rate loans are for areas with low median household income, set at 60% of the market rate. Market rate is adjusted quarterly based on a bond index and applies to areas with higher income. Intermediate rate is set at 80% of the market rate for loans that do not qualify for poverty rate. The 2014 farm bill amended water and waste disposal loan programs to encourage financing by private lenders. Grants for water supply and waste disposal projects in rural areas are available for communities with poverty and intermediate incomes. Eligible projects must serve rural areas not likely to decline in population. The 2014 farm bill authorized $30 million annually for water and waste water grants through FY2018. Grant funds cover up to 75% of project costs to reduce user costs. Priority is given to projects serving populations of less than 5,500. Emergency Community Water Assistance Grants are provided by RUS to help eligible communities with populations of 10,000 or less prepare for or recover from emergencies affecting safe drinking water. Grants range from $10,000 to $500,000 and can cover new systems, waterline extensions, repairs, and renovations. Funding is competitive on a national basis, with priority given to smaller populations. The Emergency and Imminent Water Assistance program reserves 3% to 5% of water and waste disposal grant funds. Funding amounts vary depending on need, with $14.7 million distributed in FY2014 and $2.5 million in FY2015. Eligible entities include municipalities, counties, non-profit organizations, and Indian tribes. No funds were allocated for the program in FY2017 and FY2018. USDA's loan and grant programs are limited to communities with a population of 10,000 or less unable to access credit through normal channels. Assistance is available for projects meeting health and sanitary standards. The 2014 farm bill authorized grants for private nonprofit organizations to provide loans for household water well systems, with loans limited to $11,000 per system. Authorized appropriations for the program were $993,000 in both FY2017 and FY2018. In FY2018, USDA's water and waste disposal programs received funding through two titles of P.L. 115-141. Title III allocated $560.3 million, including $400.0 million in grants and $1.2 billion in loan authority. Title VII provided an additional $500 million, with $495 million designated for grants. USDA also had appropriations for revolving loans and projects in specific communities. The President's FY2019 budget requested $1.20 billion in direct loan authority and no funding for guaranteed loans or grants. The USDA provides assistance for watershed activities through various authorities administered by the NRCS. The Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program (WFPO) includes P.L. 566 and P.L. 534 projects, which offer technical and financial support to prevent erosion, sedimentation, and flood damage. Regulations for these programs are found in 7 C.F.R. Parts 1778-1780. The WFPO program provides assistance for watershed activities to prevent erosion, sedimentation, and flood damage. Projects are built under two authorities - the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act of 1954 and the Flood Control Act of 1944. Projects under P.L. 566 are smaller and authorized by the Chief of the NRCS, while larger projects under P.L. 534 require approval from Congress. Under P.L. 566, over 2,100 projects have been authorized through FY2018, with NRCS funding 23 new projects in FY2018. P.L. 534 projects are larger and more expensive, with 11 projects covering almost 37.9 million acres. The federal costs for these projects range from $40 million to over $275 million. The FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $150 million for these projects. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 permanently authorized an additional $50 million annually for the WFPO program, providing technical and financial assistance for watershed projects. Both P.L. 566 and P.L. 534 fund land treatment, flood prevention, erosion reduction, and other water management projects. Structural measures like dams and levees are included, with local sponsors responsible for project maintenance. The WFPO program provides financing for water projects, with the federal government covering construction costs for flood control. Nonagricultural water supply costs must be repaid by local organizations, but funds can cover up to 50% of land and rights-of-way costs. Sponsors can also apply for RUS Water and Waste Program loans. Projects under P.L. 566 are limited to 250,000 acres and specific floodwater detention capacities. State and local organizations cover operation and maintenance costs. The WFPO program provides financing for water projects, with the federal government covering construction costs for flood control. Projects requiring federal contribution over $25 million or with storage capacity exceeding 2,500 acre feet need approval from Senate and House Agriculture Committees. Approval from additional committees is needed for structures exceeding 4,000 acre feet. There are no population or income limits for project applications, but 20% of benefits must relate to agriculture. $150 million was allocated in FY2019, with $50 million for projects addressing regional priorities like flood prevention and agricultural water management. The WFPO program provides financing for water projects, with the federal government covering construction costs for flood control. Projects requiring federal contribution over $25 million or with storage capacity exceeding 2,500 acre feet need approval from Senate and House Agriculture Committees. Approval from additional committees is needed for structures exceeding 4,000 acre feet. $150 million was allocated in FY2019, with $50 million for projects addressing regional priorities like flood prevention and agricultural water management. The FY2020 Administration's request proposes no funding for the program, but funding has been directed from the Conservation Operations account to support WFPO projects since FY2014. Additionally, the 2018 farm bill permanently authorized $50 million annually from mandatory sources for the program. The mandatory funding for P.L. 566 projects and Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program is authorized by Congress. The Rural Utilities Service at USDA provides loans for local organizations to finance installation, repair, or improvement of facilities for these projects. Loans are limited to $10 million and must be repaid within 50 years. The Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program provides loans up to $10 million for projects that must be repaid within 50 years. Over 495 RUS loans totaling almost $176 million have been made. Many P.L. 566 projects, such as dams constructed starting in 1948, require rehabilitation to ensure public safety and meet changing resource needs. By December 2018, 6,245 watershed dams had reached the end of their designed life spans, with more than half of the 11,847 dams expected to reach this point by the end of 2019. The Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program, established in response to concerns about dam safety, aims to extend the service life of dams and bring them into compliance with safety standards. The program has authorized the rehabilitation of 288 dams in 31 states from 2000 to 2018, with 150 projects completed and others awaiting funding. NRCS provides partial project grants and technical advisory services, covering up to 65% of rehabilitation costs but not operation and maintenance expenses. The Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program aims to extend the service life of dams and bring them into compliance with safety standards. Local watershed project sponsors provide 35% of the cost of a rehabilitation project. Dams constructed under specific authorities are eligible for assistance. Congress has appropriated over $700 million for rehabilitation projects since FY2000. The Trump Administration is not seeking funding for the program in FY2020. The Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program has discretionary funding authority of up to $85 million annually, with an average annual appropriation of $11.2 million over the last five years. The program was previously authorized through omnibus farm bills for mandatory funding, but the FY2018 appropriations act made approximately $55 million available for obligation by not restricting the remaining mandatory carryover. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized discretionary funding authority for the program, but no additional mandatory funding is provided. The Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program has discretionary funding authority of up to $85 million annually, with an average annual appropriation of $11.2 million over the last five years. The program was reauthorized for discretionary funding in the 2018 farm bill, but no additional mandatory funding was provided. The Clean Water Act establishes performance levels for municipal sewage treatment plants to prevent harmful waste discharge into surface waters. Financial assistance is provided for communities to comply with the law's objective of restoring and maintaining water quality. Since 1973, Congress has allocated $98 billion in grants for wastewater projects to support compliance with the Clean Water Act. Funds are distributed to states based on a formula and used for priority projects. In 1987, the CWA was amended to include federal grants for Clean Water State Revolving Funds. The estimated national wastewater infrastructure needs are $271 billion over the next 20 years. Since 1989, federal funds have been used to capitalize state loan programs with states providing matching funds. All 50 states, plus Puerto Rico, participate in the CWSRF program. EPA data show that 67% of assistance goes to communities with 10,000 people or fewer. The program helps in constructing and upgrading wastewater treatment plants and implementing pollution management programs. The CWSRF program provides financial assistance for nonpoint pollution management programs, National Estuary Program management plans, and other eligible activities. EPA grants and state matching funds help fund state CWSRF programs, offering various types of financial assistance including loans, refinancing debt, loan guarantees, and supporting program administration costs. Loans are provided at or below market interest rates, with states having the flexibility to negotiate zero interest loans. The CWSRF program offers financial assistance for various projects, including water and energy efficiency goals and stormwater runoff mitigation. States can provide additional subsidization like principal forgiveness or negative interest loans to municipalities that meet affordability criteria. Recent appropriations acts have mandated minimum percentages of funds for additional subsidization, starting with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The CWSRF program provides financial assistance for projects such as water efficiency, stormwater mitigation, and energy goals. Loans must be repaid within 30 years, with payments credited directly to the SRF. States must ensure projects use American iron and steel products and adhere to Davis-Bacon Act wage requirements. Eligible recipients include municipalities and state agencies, with some exceptions for privately owned projects like decentralized wastewater treatment or stormwater management. Projects eligible for funding under the Clean Water State Revolving Fund include construction or upgrading of municipal wastewater treatment plants, collector sewers, interceptor sewers, and storm sewers. Funds must first be used to ensure compliance with Clean Water Act requirements before being used for other purposes. Operation and maintenance activities are not eligible for funding. The Clean Water State Revolving Fund allows funds to be used for eligible purposes after meeting compliance requirements. This includes addressing overflows from municipal sewer systems, especially during wet weather events, to prevent untreated sewage discharges into waterways. The program authorized $750 million per year in FY2002 and FY2003, but no funds were appropriated. The America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 reauthorized appropriations for a grant program, including stormwater activities, for $225 million for FY2019 and FY2020. The list of eligible projects was amended in 2014 and 2018 to include various activities such as energy-efficiency improvements, wastewater recycling, and security enhancements. Since FY1989, Congress has provided over $46 billion in grants for the clean water SRF program, supporting more than 39,000 SRF loans and debt refinance agreements. In FY2018, Congress allocated $1.694 billion to the CWSRF program, maintaining the same level in FY2019. The President requested $1.120 billion for FY2020. EPA also provides direct grants for wastewater treatment systems. The Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) program has received over $46 billion in grants since FY1989. In FY2018, Congress allocated $1.694 billion to the CWSRF program, with the same amount in FY2019 and a requested $1.120 billion for FY2020. EPA also provides direct grants for the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, Indian tribes, and sets standards for drinking water regulations. EPA's authority for the clean water SRF program is derived from the Clean Water Act. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) was amended in 1996 to establish a Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) loan program to help communities meet federal mandates for drinking water quality. States use their DWSRFs to provide assistance to public water systems for infrastructure projects, with states required to match 20% of the federal capitalization grant. Each year, states must develop an \"intended use plan\" that prioritizes projects addressing serious health risks and ensuring compliance with SDWA. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) was amended in 1996 to establish a Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) loan program to help communities meet federal mandates for drinking water quality. States use their DWSRFs to provide assistance to public water systems for infrastructure projects, with states required to match 20% of the federal capitalization grant. The law directs states to allocate at least 15% of their annual allotment to smaller water systems serving 10,000 or fewer persons. Needs surveys indicate that public water systems need to invest $472.6 billion over 20 years for infrastructure improvements to ensure safe drinking water provision. The Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) provides over $23.63 billion annually for safe drinking water and compliance with federal standards. States prioritize funding for infrastructure projects that ensure compliance, protect public health, and assist systems with economic need. The fund can be used for programs to protect water sources, improve water system capacity, and provide low-interest loans to public water systems. The Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) provides funding for safe drinking water projects, including loans, subsidies, and grants to economically disadvantaged communities. States can use up to 35% of their grants for additional subsidies. DWSRF capitalization grants provide additional subsidy to eligible recipients in the form of forgiveness of principal, negative interest loans, or grants. Eligible recipients include community water systems, not-for-profit noncommunity water systems, but not federally owned systems. Projects eligible for assistance include infrastructure rehabilitation, addressing SDWA violations, project design, planning, preconstruction activities, and construction of new wells. For FY2018, the President requested $863.2 million for state DWSRF capitalization grants. Eligible projects include construction of new wells to replace contaminated ones, source water protection, land acquisition, security measures, and consolidation of water supplies. Ineligible projects include those for future growth, fire protection, construction of dams or reservoirs (except for treated water), monitoring, and operation and maintenance. Systems lacking capacity to maintain SDWA compliance or in significant noncompliance are also ineligible. In FY2018, the President requested $863.2 million for state DWSRF grants, Congress appropriated $1,163.2 million. For FY2019, the President requested $863 million, Congress provided $1,164.0 million. AWIA reauthorized DWSRF appropriations for FY2019-FY2021. Cumulative DWSRF appropriations reached $22.11 billion from FY1997-FY2018. Total DWSRF investment through FY2018 was $39.86 billion, providing over $38.22 billion in assistance for 14,577 projects. The DWSRF program has provided over $38.22 billion in assistance for more than 14,577 projects. The statutory authority for the program is the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996. Localities are primarily responsible for water infrastructure services, with funding needs totaling $655 billion over a 20-year period. The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) pilot program was established in 2014 to provide credit assistance for drinking water and wastewater projects. Unlike SRF programs, WIFIA offers direct loans or loan guarantees for projects costing $20 million or more. The program aims to address water infrastructure needs that are ineligible for SRF assistance. The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program provides credit assistance for large water infrastructure projects, such as flood control or storm damage reduction. Congress has not yet allocated funds for WIFIA loans under the authority in WRRDA. WIFIA offers an additional funding source for projects that may struggle to obtain financing through traditional means. Treasury rates for taxable securities can be lower than rates for tax-exempt municipal debt. WIFIA provides credit assistance for water infrastructure projects, with subsidy rates determined by congressional appropriations. The Trump Administration estimated a 0.98% subsidy rate for WIFIA in FY2019. The WIFIA program in the FY2019 budget proposal has a 0.98% subsidy rate, allowing for a $10 million appropriation to support $1.02 billion in direct loans. Credit assistance is available for various projects and sponsors, including corporations, partnerships, and government entities. Eligible categories for assistance by EPA include wastewater treatment, community drinking water facilities, energy efficiency, and system repairs. The WIFIA program provides credit assistance for various projects such as wastewater and drinking water systems, desalination, water recycling, and drought mitigation. Project costs must be $20 million or larger, or $5 million or more in rural areas. The program received $68 million in funding for FY2019, with applicants submitting a letter of interest to EPA for consideration. The EPA announced a third round of WIFIA funding on March 29, 2019, with an estimated $6 billion in credit assistance from a $63 million budget. The WIFIA program is authorized by WRRDA and regulated by EPA's interim final rule from December 19, 2016. HUD administers assistance for neighborhood revitalization and infrastructure improvements primarily through the CDBG program. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program aims to improve communities by providing housing, economic opportunities, and neighborhood revitalization activities for low and moderate-income individuals. At least 70% of funds must benefit low- and moderate-income persons, with eligible activities focused on benefiting this demographic, preventing slums and blight, or addressing health and safety threats. Local governments have discretion in selecting activities to meet national objectives. The CDBG program has invested $150 billion in communities nationwide since 1974. Congress has used the program for supplemental appropriations in response to natural disasters, economic crises, and terrorist attacks, totaling approximately $50 billion since 1992. Funds have been disbursed for various activities such as real property acquisition, demolition, and planning. During FY2012 to FY2016, CDBG funds were allocated for public improvements, including water and sewer projects, which made up 33% of total expenditures. 70% of CDBG funds are distributed to 1,224 entitlement communities, while the remaining 30% is not available for rural projects. Between FY2012 and FY2016, CDBG funds averaging $370 million per year were disbursed for water and sewer improvements. The program aims to develop viable communities by providing decent housing, a suitable living environment, and expanding economic opportunities for low- and moderate-income individuals. Funds may also be used to prevent or eliminate slums and blight, or address imminent threats to residents. CDBG program funds are allocated by formula, with 70% going to entitlement communities and 30% to states for nonentitlement communities. Entitlement communities receive funds based on population, overcrowded housing, and poverty data. Nonentitlement funds are allocated to states using similar formulas. Entitlement communities must submit a consolidated plan before receiving funds. Entitlement communities must submit a multiyear consolidated plan detailing fund use over five years, including citizen participation, housing needs assessment, and annual development plan. States act as pass-through agents for CDBG funds, distributing to nonentitlement communities and monitoring grant recipient projects. The CDBG program involves distributing funds to governments, monitoring project implementation for compliance, and requiring states to submit ConPlans and CAPERs to HUD. Recipients of direct allocations include entitlement communities, states, and Section 107 special project grants. Entitlement communities must submit a multiyear consolidated plan, while states distribute funds to nonentitlement communities. The CDBG program allocates funds to entitlement communities, states, and territories like Guam and Puerto Rico. Eligible activities include public facilities, housing, economic development, and brownfields redevelopment. State grantees must ensure projects benefit low- and moderate-income persons or aid in slum prevention. The CDBG program allocates funds to entitlement communities, states, and territories for various community development needs. For FY2017, Congress provided $3.0 billion for CDBG funds, with different allocations for entitlement communities, smaller communities, and insular areas. The President's budget for FY2018 requested $0 in funds for this program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, P.L. 115-141 allocated $3.365 billion for the HUD-administered Community Development Fund, including $3.3 billion for the CDBG entitlement/nonentitlement formula funds. The act also appropriated $65 million for Indian tribes. In FY2019, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, P.L. 116-6 maintained the program's funding level at $3.365 billion, with allocations for entitlement communities, states, nonentitlement communities, and insular areas. The Administration's budget request for FY2020 does not include funding for the CDBG program, proposing termination to redefine the federal government's role in community and economic development. The CDBG program is authorized under Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, with regulations codified at 24 C.F.R. Part 570. Section 108 loan guarantees allow communities to leverage CDBG funds for economic development, housing projects, and public facilities. This program supplements CDBG activities, extending resources for neighborhood revitalization efforts. Eligible activities include property acquisition, housing rehabilitation, economic development, and debt service reserves. Section 108 loan guarantees allow states and communities to float bonds, notes, or debentures worth up to five times their annual CDBG allocation for the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, and installation of public facilities.

Section 108 loan funds are available to eligible public entities for redevelopment projects, with loan guarantees accessed by CDBG entitlement communities and states. Eligible activities must meet national objectives of the CDBG program. The application process includes stages such as presubmission, citizen participation, submission, and review. HUD administers Section 108 loan funds for redevelopment projects, with application stages including presubmission, citizen participation, submission, review, award allocation, and reporting. Applicants must provide project details, financing structure, citizen participation plan, anti-displacement strategy, and pledge CDBG allocation as security. HUD aims to review applications within 90 days, with field offices encouraged to complete within 45 days. Recipients must submit annual performance reports detailing progress. HUD issued $314.4 million in loan guarantee commitments between FY2014 and FY2016. Between FY2014 and FY2016, HUD issued loan guarantee commitments totaling $314.4 million to 47 projects. Congress authorized a loan commitment ceiling of $300 million for FY2017 and directed HUD to collect fees from borrowers resulting in a credit subsidy cost of zero for guaranteeing Section 108 loans. The fee amount is determined annually by HUD based on a percentage of the loan principal. For FY2018, the Trump Administration did not request new loan guarantee authority for Section 108 projects. However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 included $300 million in loan guarantee authority. In FY2019, Congress provided another $300 million in loan guarantee authority for Section 108 projects. The Administration has not requested new loan guarantee authority for FY2020. The statutory authority for the Section 108 program is Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. Regulations are codified at 24 C.F.R. Part 570, Subpart M. HUD administers assistance for neighborhood revitalization and economic development through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, aiming to provide decent housing, expand economic opportunities, and benefit low to moderate-income individuals. CDBG funds support activities that prevent slums, eliminate blight, or address health threats in communities. The CDBG program aims to prevent slums, eliminate blight, and address health threats in communities. At least 70% of funds must benefit low- and moderate-income persons. The program provides local government discretion in selecting eligible activities, such as water and waste disposal, historical preservation, and economic development. Since 1974, $150 billion has been invested nationwide, with Congress providing supplemental appropriations for natural disasters, economic crises, and terrorist attacks. Since 1992, Congress has allocated around $50 billion in supplemental CDBG funding to aid states and local governments in recovery efforts post crises like the 2008 economic recession and terrorist attacks. The funds have been used for various purposes including property acquisition, housing, public services, and public improvements like water and sewer facilities. Over a five-year period from FY2012 to FY2016, public improvements accounted for 33% of CDBG expenditures, with water and sewer improvements making up 10%. Around 70% of CDBG funds are distributed by formula to approximately 1,224 entitlement communities. Between FY2012 and FY2016, CDBG funds averaging $370 million per year were disbursed by recipients for water and sewer improvements. 70% of CDBG funds are allocated to entitlement communities, while the remaining 30% goes to states for nonentitlement communities. The primary goal of the program is to develop viable communities by providing decent housing and suitable living conditions. The CDBG program aims to develop viable communities by providing decent housing, a suitable living environment, and expanding economic opportunities for low- and moderate-income individuals. Funds are allocated by formula, with 70% going to entitlement communities and 30% to nonentitlement communities. Allocation to entitlement communities is based on weighted formulas using population, overcrowded housing, poverty data, housing built before 1940, and population growth rate. The CDBG program allocates funds to entitlement communities based on formulas using population, poverty data, housing age, and population growth rate. Entitlement communities must submit a consolidated plan detailing fund usage over five years, including citizen participation, housing needs assessment, and annual community development plans. States act as pass-through agents for CDBG activities and must submit an annual performance report to HUD. States act as pass-through agents for CDBG activities, responsible for distributing funds to nonentitlement communities, selecting grant recipients, and monitoring project implementation. They must submit a ConPlan and CAPER to HUD, detailing housing and homeless needs assessments, strategic plans, and progress reports. Three categories of recipients are eligible for direct CDBG program funds. Eligible recipients for CDBG program funds include entitlement communities, states, and special project grants. Entitlement communities consist of central cities, metropolitan-based cities with populations over 50,000, and urban counties. States and entitlement communities receive funds after a set-aside for US territories. Funding is based on population share. Activities funded include public facilities, housing, and economic projects. State grantees must ensure that projects benefit low- and moderate-income individuals, prevent slums or blight, or address urgent community development needs. States have flexibility in defining eligibility and criteria for smaller community programs. In FY2017, Congress allocated $3.0 billion for CDBG funds, with $2.095 billion for entitlement communities and $898 million for smaller communities. In FY2018, $3.365 billion was appropriated for the HUD-administered Community Development Fund, including $3.3 billion for the CDBG entitlement/nonentitlement formula funds. $2.305 billion was allocated to entitlement communities, $988 million to states for nonentitlement communities, and $7 million for insular areas. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 continued the trend of $0 in funds requested for the CDBG program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, P.L. 116-6, maintained funding for the CDBG program at $3.365 billion, with allocations for entitlement communities, nonentitlement communities, insular areas, and Indian tribes. The Administration's FY2020 budget proposal does not include funding for the CDBG program, aiming to shift responsibility to state and local governments. The statutory authority for the CDBG program is Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The Section 108 loan guarantees, authorized under Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, allow entitlement communities and states to leverage their annual CDBG allocation for large-scale economic development, housing projects, and public facilities. This program supplements CDBG activities by providing additional financial resources for transformative neighborhood projects. The Section 108 loan guarantees allow states and communities to access additional financial resources for neighborhood revitalization efforts, including acquiring and rehabilitating real property, housing rehabilitation, economic development activities, debt service reserves, and public facility improvements. Guarantees are financed through public offerings, allowing for bonds worth up to five times their annual CDBG allocation with a repayment period of up to 20 years. Section 108 funds are available for communities to apply for anytime during the year, with loan funds accessible to eligible public entities that can reloan to private participants in redevelopment projects. Applicants are encouraged to meet with HUD staff before applying. The program has an open application process for CDBG entitlement communities and states on behalf of nonentitlement communities, with eligible activities required to meet one of the three national objectives of the regular CDBG program.

HUD aims to review applications within 90 days, with field offices and headquarters working to complete reviews within 45 days. HUD issues loan guarantee commitments totaling $314.4 million to 47 projects between FY2014 and FY2016. Congress authorized a loan commitment ceiling of $300 million for FY2017, with HUD directed to collect fees resulting in a credit subsidy cost of zero for guaranteeing Section 108 loans. Until FY2015, Congress appropriated funds to cover the credit subsidy of Section 108 loan guarantees. The Department of Housing and Urban Development changed the Section 108 loan guarantee arrangement in FY2014 to allow HUD to collect a fee from borrowers to cover the credit subsidy cost. The fee amount is determined annually by HUD based on a percentage of the loan principal. In FY2018, the Trump Administration did not request new loan guarantee authority, but $300 million was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018. In FY2019, Congress provided $300 million in loan guarantee authority for Section 108 projects. The Administration did not request new loan guarantee authority for FY2020. The Administration has not requested new loan guarantee authority for the Section 108 program, which falls under Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration provides development assistance for areas in economic distress through grants for community water and sewer projects. Grants are awarded competitively to revitalize infrastructure under the Public Works and Economic Development Facilities program. The Economic Development Administration provides grants for community infrastructure projects in distressed regions to attract new industry, expand businesses, diversify economies, and create jobs. Projects funded include industrial parks, port facilities, brownfield redevelopment, and water/wastewater facilities serving industry.

Grants totaling 100% of a project's cost may be awarded to Indian tribes, nonprofit organizations, or states that have exhausted their borrowing capacity. In-kind contributions can be credited towards the nonfederal share. There is no specified minimum or maximum project amount. Public works grants can be made to various entities, including states, cities, counties, and private or public not-for-profit organizations. The term \"state\" includes various territories and commonwealths. The Economic Development Administration (EDA) provides grants for projects in the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau. Projects must address pressing needs, improve business opportunities, create long-term employment, and benefit low-income families.
