    "content": "SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS OF THE WYANDOTTE NATION. The Wyandotte Nation has a valid interest in lands in the Fairfax Business District in Wyandotte County, Kansas, established in 1843. They filed a lawsuit to determine ownership of lands once held in trust by the United States. The Lawsuit filed by the Wyandotte Nation contends that certain major roads in Kansas City encroach upon the Huron Cemetery, reserved for the Nation in the Treaty of January 31, 1855. This has caused economic hardships for residents of the Fairfax Business District in Wyandotte County, Kansas, by clouding title to much of the land. Congress aims to remove these title clouds without additional cost to the involved parties. The Wyandotte Nation and the Unified Government of Kansas City and Wyandotte County have settled a Lawsuit regarding encroachment on the Huron Cemetery. Congress will implement legislation to settle the dispute and direct the Secretary to take the Settlement Lands into trust for the benefit of the Wyandotte Nation. The \"Gifted Lands\" and \"Accreted Lands\" described in the Wyandotte Nation's Lawsuit, along with portions of Seventh Street and Minnesota Avenue in Kansas City, Kansas, are claimed to be part of the Huron Cemetery under the Treaty of January 31, 1855. The Lawsuit refers to Wyandotte Nation v. Unified Government of Kansas City and Wyandotte County, Kansas. The Secretary of the Interior will oversee the Settlement Lands in Edwardsville, Kansas, as outlined in a Quit Claim Deed. The Quit Claim Deed filed in Wyandotte County, Kansas, describes the Unified Government and the Wyandotte Nation. The Secretary will hold title to Settlement Lands for the benefit of the Wyandotte Nation as part of the settlement of land claims. The Wyandotte Nation's claims in the Lawsuit will be extinguished upon the Secretary accepting title to the Settlement Lands and approval of a tribal-State compact for gaming. Congress confirms the trust status of the Shriner's Property for the Wyandotte Nation but prohibits gaming on that property. The Secretary will accept title to the Settlement Lands in trust for the Wyandotte Nation, and a tribal-State compact for gaming between the Wyandotte Nation and the State of Kansas will be approved."
