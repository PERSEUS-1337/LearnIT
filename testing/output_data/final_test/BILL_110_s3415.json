    "content": "The Act titled \"Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority System Act of 2008\" is established for the purpose of creating a regional water authority system. Congress finds that there are insufficient supplies of safe water to meet health and safety standards in specific counties of North Dakota, impacted by the construction of the Fort Peck Dam. The water in the dam reservoir is managed for flood control, hydroelectric power, irrigation, and public water supply maintenance. The purpose of this Act is to ensure a safe and adequate municipal, rural, and industrial water supply for the citizens of specific counties in North Dakota. This includes the maintenance of a public water supply, conservation of fish and wildlife, recreation, and improvement of water quality. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the Western Area Power Administration. The term \"Authority\" includes the Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority and any nonprofit successor entity. \"Firm power rate\" is the rate charged for the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program--Eastern Division. \"Pick-Sloan program\" refers to the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin Program authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1944. The term \"Water System\" in the Flood Control Act of 1944 refers to the Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority System authorized for specific counties in Montana and North Dakota. The Flood Control Act of 1944 authorizes the Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority System for specific counties in Montana and North Dakota. The Flood Control Act of 1944 authorizes the Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority System for specific counties in Montana and North Dakota. The Secretary shall enter into a cooperative agreement with the Authority to provide Federal assistance for the planning, design, and construction of the Water System, specifying responsibilities for engineering, environmental studies, design, construction, and water conservation measures. The Flood Control Act of 1944 authorizes the Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority System for specific counties in Montana and North Dakota. The cooperative agreement with the Authority includes water conservation measures, administration of contracts, procedures for activities, approval of design and construction of the Water System, and delineation of rights, responsibilities, and liabilities. Federal funds cover planning, design, and construction costs. Federal funds for the Water System must not exceed 75% of the total cost and cannot be reimbursed under reclamation laws. Funds must be used in compliance with a cooperative agreement. Components eligible for funding include water intake, pumping, treatment, and storage facilities. The Water System components eligible for funding include water treatment, storage, transmission pipelines, pumping stations, appurtenant buildings, maintenance equipment, access roads, interconnection facilities, distribution, pumping, and storage facilities for public water systems, and electrical power transmission and distribution facilities. The Water System's service area includes Garfield and McCone Counties, the area west of the Yellowstone River in Dawson and Richland Counties, the area north of Township 15N in Prairie County, and a portion of McKenzie County, North Dakota. The Secretary of North Dakota must comply with environmental requirements before obligating construction funds for the Water System. A final engineering report must be approved by Congress, and a water conservation plan with prudent, reasonable, and feasible measures must be developed. Federal funds usage is also limited. The Water System's operation, maintenance, and replacement costs are not a Federal responsibility and must be paid by the Water System. Federal funds cannot be used for these purposes. The Authority holds the title to the Water System. The Authority holds the title to the Water System and is authorized to use power from the Pick-Sloan Program. Congress finds that McCone and Garfield Counties were designated as impact counties during the construction of the Fort Peck Dam and eligible to receive impact mitigation benefits through the Pick-Sloan program. The Administrator is required to provide the Water System with the necessary power for pumping and operation from intake, treatment, and distribution facilities. The Water System is eligible to receive power if it operates on a not-for-profit basis and is constructed under a cooperative agreement. The Administrator will establish the cost of power at the firm power rate and recover expenses associated with the power used by the Authority. The Authority is responsible for payment of these costs. The Authority must develop a water conservation plan with objectives, measures, and a schedule to meet conservation goals. The plan should ensure users use efficient technology and techniques to conserve water. Public participation is required for activities under this Act. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of $115,116,000 for the Water System's planning, design, and construction from 2009 to 2019, with potential adjustments based on development cost fluctuations post-2008."
