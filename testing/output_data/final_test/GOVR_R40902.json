    "content": "The 111th Congress focused on health reform to expand insurance coverage, control costs, and improve quality. H.R. 3962, the Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed in November 2009. It includes Division D, targeting American Indians and Alaska Natives with amendments to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. The goal of the division is to improve the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives, who have lower health status and higher rates of diseases like diabetes. Provisions to reauthorize and amend IHCIA were included in H.R. 3590, the Affordable Care Act. President Obama hosted a health reform summit to find common ground on health care overhaul. The President released a health care reform proposal based on the Senate-passed bill and incorporating policies from the House-passed measure. The House is preparing to vote on H.R. 3590 and an accompanying reconciliation bill. If approved, H.R. 3590 will be sent to the President for signing into law, while the reconciliation measure will be taken up by the Senate. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides healthcare for eligible American Indians/Alaska Natives through programs and facilities on reservations and in urban areas. IHS is organized into 12 Areas administered by an Area Office, further subdivided into service units. Services may be provided directly by IHS, tribes, tribal organizations, or Urban Indian Organizations. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) authorizes specific IHS activities and sets national health service policies for Indians. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) authorizes various healthcare services for American Indians and urban Indians, including direct collections from Medicare, Medicaid, and third-party insurers. It also grants funding to urban Indian organizations for healthcare services, establishes substance abuse treatment programs, health professions recruitment programs, and other initiatives. The IHCIA was last fully reauthorized in 1992 and has received continued funding from Congress since 2001. Reauthorization has been under consideration in Congress since 1999. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) has been under consideration in Congress since 1999. Reauthorization bills were introduced in the House (H.R. 2708) and the Senate (S. 1790). The Snyder Act of 1921 provides a general authorization for Indian health programs, managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The act's broad language allows for various Indian programs, including health care, but gives no specific directions or policies. The Snyder Act of 1921 authorized Indian health care programs under the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In 1954, these programs were transferred to the Public Health Service. The Affordable Health Care for America Act (H.R. 3962) aims to reform the U.S. health insurance system with four major divisions. Division A focuses on reducing the number of uninsured and restructuring the private health insurance market. Division B proposes modifications to Medicare and Medicaid. Division B of H.R. 3962 introduces technical changes to improve healthcare quality, reduce expenditures, and address coverage gaps in Medicare and Medicaid. Division C expands health professions and nursing workforce programs, while Division D reenacts and amends the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. This report does not cover other divisions of the bill. Division D of H.R. 3962 reenacts and amends the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. It contains two titles with provisions for Indian health programs and Medicaid reforms. Title I includes sections on reauthorizing IHCIA and making technical corrections, while Title II amends sections of the Social Security Act. For detailed analysis, refer to pages 22-50. The report covers Title I of Division D, focusing on Section 3101(a) of IHCIA which includes provisions for Indian health workforce, health services, facilities, federal reimbursements, urban Indians, organizational improvements, behavioral health programs, and miscellaneous. Authorizations of appropriations are included in each title, with Division D making them permanent and indefinite. The report covers Title II of Division D, which includes provisions for improving Indian health care through federal health programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. These sections amend the Social Security Act and reference provisions from Section 3101(a) of IHCIA. The report discusses amendments to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) Title IV, specifically related to Social Security Act programs. It also includes background information on current laws and acronyms used in the report. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 renamed SCHIP to CHIP. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of HHS, and \"Indian\" is defined in IHCIA. The report defines \"Indian\" as a member of a federally recognized tribe or group, including Alaska Natives. It mentions potential technical errors in the bill and will be updated with legislative actions. The section aims to improve health status for Indians and urban Indians, aligning with the Healthy People 2010 national health agenda.

The report introduces terms like \"Indian Health Program\" (IHP) and \"Tribal Health Program\" (THP) under IHCIA Title I. It addresses personnel recruitment, scholarships, and educational programs to enhance the Indian health workforce. IHS faces high vacancy rates for health professions, and the goal of IHCIA Title I is to increase and improve skills of health professionals in the IHS through scholarships.
