    "content": "There have been ongoing debates in Congress over the past three decades regarding funding for U.S. foreign policy programs, with fluctuations in resources allocated based on global challenges. Efforts to promote peace, confront Soviet influence, support new democracies, fight poverty and disease, combat terrorism, and stabilize fragile states have all impacted funding decisions. Funding decisions for U.S. foreign policy programs are influenced by the overall budget environment, domestic requirements, and international crises. Spending has fluctuated based on fiscal austerity, domestic priorities, and global challenges, with a significant increase in spending post-9/11. Foreign policy spending supports various government programs including economic and military assistance, contributions to international organizations, diplomatic operations, and counter-terrorism efforts. This report provides a trend analysis of foreign policy spending over the past 30 years, focusing on Budget Function 150. It examines spending trends in areas such as diplomatic operations, counter-terrorism, and export promotion. The report also looks at how foreign aid resources have been allocated, including priorities like global health and aid to Africa. The analysis of foreign policy spending trends focuses on discretionary budget authority figures starting from FY1977. Data before FY1977 is limited, with OMB publishing figures from FY1976 onwards. The analysis excludes FY1976 due to a transition year, ensuring consistency in the time period covered. Additionally, foreign policy resources from fees collected by the State Department are included in the data from FY1996 onwards. The analysis of foreign policy spending trends focuses on discretionary budget authority figures from FY1977 onwards, excluding FY1976 as a transition year. It includes data on Service, Visa Fingerprint, Affidavit of Support, Diversity Lottery, Defense Trade Control, and International and Educational Exchange programs. Excluded are amounts for mandatory Foreign Service retirement programs and resource flows of the Foreign Military Sales Trust Fund. Data also exclude funding for International Monetary Fund quota increases and other IMF facilities approved by Congress in the past 30 years. Each figure highlights major events influencing spending levels and key budget trends over the past three decades, providing context for assessing the current budget request. The current budget request analysis includes data in constant FY2006 dollars from various sources like OMB, State Department, USAID, CBO, and Appropriations Committees. CRS calculates constant dollar values post the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 in FY1992. Congress changed funding procedures for credit programs from FY1992 onwards. Under \"credit reform,\" Congress started appropriating the subsidy value of direct loans and loan guarantees from FY1992 onwards. The subsidy value represents the risk to the government in issuing or backing the loan, along with any concessional interest rate below market value. Comparing trends before and after FY1992 for discretionary spending including credit programs poses challenges. Budget Function 150 encompasses various credit programs like direct loans under Foreign Military Financing (FMF). In FY1997, Congress appropriated $60 million for FMF direct loans, enabling the Defense Department to issue $540 million in military aid loans. Additionally, a $3.5 million subsidy appropriation in FY1997 allowed USAID's Urban and Environmental Credit program to guarantee $29.4 million in loans. The Urban and Environmental Credit program received a $3.5 million subsidy in FY1997 to guarantee $29.4 million in loans, with the US government guaranteeing repayment. Comparisons between funding trends before and after FY1992 show a pattern of spending decisions, although the exact impact of credit reform procedures on spending reductions in Function 150 during the mid-1990s is somewhat overstated. During the mid-1990s, there were substantial cuts in the international affairs budget, with some overstatement in spending. The discretionary budget authority for international affairs has fluctuated over the past three decades, with periods of growth followed by sharp declines. Credit reform changes have no effect on measuring discretionary spending for certain programs like the State Department and public diplomacy. The foreign policy budget experienced fluctuations in the mid-1990s, with a gradual decline followed by a sharp decrease through FY1997. However, there was a slight increase in FY1998 and a significant rise in FY1999 and FY2000. The Function 150 budget saw continued growth after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, reaching the highest level of foreign affairs spending in three decades by FY2004. In the early-to-mid 1980s, there was a steady increase in foreign policy spending due to rising security aid allocated for strategic purposes in various countries. Congress also approved major supplementals during this time, contributing to a peak in foreign affairs discretionary budget authority at $38.96 billion. The foreign affairs discretionary budget authority reached $38.96 billion in FY2006 dollars in FY1985 due to a unique combination of international demands. However, in the following years, Function 150 discretionary spending fell abruptly in FY1986 and declined further, reaching a point more than 25% less than the budget three years earlier. From FY1988 to FY1993, the foreign affairs budget authority remained relatively stable, ranging between $28 and $29 billion annually in FY2006 dollars, attributed to negotiated budget agreements between the Administration and Congress. In FY1990/1991, there was a temporary upsurge in international affairs spending due to various factors including aid to Panama and Nicaragua, costs related to the Persian Gulf War, and expenses for U.S. agencies in the Gulf region. However, there was a significant 3.8% real cut in FY1994, followed by larger reductions in the following years. The downward trend reversed in FY1998, with a 4% increase in international affairs budget authority. In FY1998, international affairs budget authority increased by 4% in real terms over FY1997, followed by a significant 21.4% rise in foreign policy spending for FY1999. Congress approved additional funding for various programs, arrearage payments to international organizations, security upgrades for American embassies, and large supplementals for Hurricane Mitch victims in Central America and Kosovo humanitarian aid relief. FY2000 saw support for the Wye River/Middle East peace accord and a Colombian counternarcotics program, along with rising budgets for other foreign affairs programs. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, U.S. foreign policy spending shifted towards a more strategic focus on global war on terrorism. By FY2003, the international affairs budget had increased to $37.4 billion in real terms through emergency supplemental appropriations. This included assistance to around 30 \"front-line\" states cooperating in the war on terrorism or facing terrorist threats. The Bush Administration announced new initiatives following the 9/11 attacks, including the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) to provide aid to low-income countries. MCA funding was expected to reach $5 billion annually by FY2006 but only reached $1.77 billion. Global health problems have also become a core focus of U.S. aid efforts. In the mid-1990s, funding for international HIV/AIDS and other infectious disease programs increased. President Bush announced a $15 billion effort to combat AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis in 2003. This led to higher international affairs spending, reaching $53.8 billion in FY2004, the highest level in over three decades. Excluding the $18.45 billion for Iraq reconstruction, FY2004 remained one of the largest international affairs budgets during that period. The FY2005 foreign affairs budget dropped to $36.8 billion, with an 11% increase for international activities other than Iraq. A large emergency supplemental for FY2005 addressed various foreign crises, pushing Budget Function 150 to its highest level since FY1985. Despite budget pressures, Congress reduced the President's regular foreign policy request by 6.4%. However, emergency supplemental spending of $4.25 billion was approved for Iraq, Afghanistan, and humanitarian crises, bringing the international affairs budget to $36.96 billion. The international affairs budget for FY2006 is $36.96 billion, the highest in three decades and 21% higher than the annual average over the past 30 years. Spending in FY2006 is nearly two-thirds higher than in FY1997, with the five budgets since 9/11 being the largest sum total since 1977. FY2004 had the largest budget in 30 years at $18.4 billion, and spending surged by 21% in FY1999 due to embassy security and Central American disaster aid supplementals. Foreign policy resources declined after the Cold War, with budget reduction pressures pushing down foreign policy and Federal resources in the late 1980s. Spending surged by 21% in FY1999, the largest increase in a decade, due to Middle East and Africa aid supplementals. Trends in international affairs resources can be analyzed by comparing foreign policy spending to overall funding for federal discretionary programs, relevant for budget priority-setting decisions within the roughly $840 billion non-emergency discretionary budget. The international affairs budget has seen significant growth since September 11, but the share allocated for foreign policy programs has declined, except for FY2004. The estimated level for FY2006 is 3.41%, the lowest in three decades. If the surge in spending for Iraq in FY2004 is included, the annual average since FY1977 decreases. The surge in spending for Iraq in FY2004 is folded into the post-9/11 period, resulting in a historic 3.96% average for international affairs. This trend is due to larger increases in non-international sectors like defense, homeland security, and domestic disaster relief. Defense spending grew to over 54% by FY2004, while homeland security spending increased by about one-third. Emergency supplementals for Hurricane Katrina relief pushed shares for other budget activities down for FY2005 and FY2006. Prior to the 9/11 attacks, foreign policy spending patterns showed similarities in Figures 1 and 2, with a consistent 4% share of total discretionary budget authority for international affairs from FY1988 to FY1995. Despite fluctuations due to events like the Gulf War, the foreign policy budget declined in the early to mid-1990s at a similar pace to other discretionary programs. However, in FY1996, this sustained 4% share ended. In FY1996, Function150's share of discretionary budget authority dropped from 4% to 3.63%, and further decreased to about 3.6% in FY1997 and FY1998. The FY2006 foreign policy budget's share of total Federal discretionary budget authority is 3.41%, lower than the 30-year average of 3.96%. Despite increases post-9/11, Function 150's share of total U.S. discretionary spending has mostly declined, except for FY2004. U.S. discretionary spending has decreased, mainly due to higher defense and homeland security funding, as well as relief for Hurricane Katrina victims in FY2005 and FY2006. The largest cut in foreign policy spending occurred in FY1996, with a reduction of 11.3%, the largest in three decades. Foreign aid typically makes up about two-thirds of Budget Function 150, supporting various development, humanitarian, security, and military assistance programs. Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, foreign aid spending levels increased significantly, with President Bush launching initiatives such as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Millennium Challenge Account. The foreign aid budget grew from $18.4 billion to $25.2 billion in FY2006, a one-third increase in four years, due to responses to international emergencies like the Indian Ocean tsunami and conflict in Darfur. Foreign aid spending increased significantly post-9/11, reaching $43.3 billion in FY2004, with a large supplemental for Iraq. Prior to 9/11, funding had been growing since FY1997, with resources rising modestly and new initiatives pushing levels higher. Initiatives included the Wye River/Middle East peace effort, debt relief for poor nations, clearing arrears owed to the U.N. and World Bank, and a counter-narcotics effort in Colombia that expanded to the entire region. The United States responded to humanitarian emergencies and implemented the Andean Counterdrug Initiative in Colombia. Foreign aid spending hit a low point in FY1997 due to budget cuts following the end of the Cold War. The rationale for foreign assistance changed with geopolitical shifts, leading to a decline in funding. In FY1991, Congress approved additional resources for countries affected by the Persian Gulf War, but foreign aid budget declined through FY1997, standing 54% below levels of a decade earlier. During the Reagan Administration, foreign aid spending increased significantly until FY1985, reaching $33 billion. Policy differences between the executive and legislative branches led to this growth, with attempts to reduce multilateral development contributions blocked by Congress. Foreign aid spending has grown significantly since 9/11, with the FY2006 budget totaling $25.2 billion, a 9% increase from the annual average since FY1977. FY2004 saw the highest foreign aid budget in 30 years, including Iraq reconstruction. Foreign aid spending declined significantly after the Cold War, reaching a 30-year low of $15.2 billion between FY1990 and FY1997. During the Reagan Administration, foreign aid increased, with the third largest budget in 30 years in FY1985. However, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction act led to a sharp decrease in foreign assistance. Security assistance for the Camp David Accord pushed foreign aid to its second-highest point in FY1979. Foreign assistance spending has varied over the past three decades, with no precise definition of major bilateral aid categories. Programs are divided into core development assistance, humanitarian relief, and political/security economic aid to support various U.S. foreign policy objectives. The growth in spending on \"core\" bilateral development assistance programs since FY2000 has been significant, with the total for FY2006 reaching $6.9 billion, the largest in 30 years. This increase is attributed to the launch of two new bilateral development aid initiatives by the Bush Administration, including the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA). The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) and President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) began in FY2004, with annual increases in bilateral development aid spending. Congress started increasing funds for development programs in FY2001, supporting education, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Development, Defense, and Diplomacy were identified as pillars of U.S. national security after 9/11. Prior to the recent surge in bilateral development aid spending, levels remained relatively stable from FY1977 to FY2003. Development assistance resources saw small increases in the late 1970s and early 1980s. After falling in FY1986, budgets grew somewhat to $3 billion by FY1991 as Congress aimed to double U.S. development assistance to Africa. Development aid, including bilateral development assistance funding, experienced a sharp decline in the mid-1990s, dropping to $2.03 billion in FY1997, the lowest point in 30 years. However, since FY2000, core bilateral development assistance funding has increased by more than 3 times, reaching $6.9 billion in FY2006, the largest in 30 years. This surge in funding contrasts with the previous stability in development aid spending from FY1977 to FY2003. The United States has consistently been a large contributor to international disaster and humanitarian relief operations, spending unprecedented amounts on global humanitarian emergencies in recent years. Natural disasters and conflicts around the world have pushed foreign aid spending on humanitarian crises to their highest levels in three decades, with the $3.83 billion humanitarian aid budget for FY2003 being the largest since FY1997. The $3.83 billion humanitarian aid budget for FY2003 was the largest in three decades, slightly higher than FY2005. FY2006 resources are lower but still one of the largest totals in the past 30 years. Previous peak years include FY1980-FY1981 and FY1985, with surges in funding for events like the Gulf War in 1991 and conflicts in Bosnia, Haiti, and Rwanda in 1994. Assistance spending trends show erratic patterns over the past 30 years, with growth in resources for food, disaster, and refugee support. FY2006 appropriations for humanitarian aid programs were $3 billion, lower than previous peak years like FY1999, FY2003, and FY2005. Despite this, FY2006 spending is nearly 30% higher than the 30-year annual average of $2.32 billion. The United States uses various types of economic assistance for strategic objectives, with humanitarian relief being a secondary focus in some cases. The primary channel for transferring political/security economic assistance is through the Economic Support Fund (ESF), which has been used for various strategic purposes such as supporting Middle East peace efforts, gaining access to military bases, backing governments during conflicts, and stabilizing countries after government changes. The Economic Support Fund (ESF) is used for political/security economic assistance, including supporting nations in the Global War on Terror, aiding Eastern European countries transition to democracy, counter-narcotics efforts in Colombia, non-proliferation programs, and reconstruction assistance in Iraq. Budget spikes occur after major international events like peace agreements. Political/security economic aid, including support for countries in conflict areas, has remained steady at around $4-6 billion annually. The current budget of $6.9 billion is the sixth highest in 30 years, with funding levels spiking due to new circumstances like peace agreements or post-conflict aid. The United States has provided political/security economic aid totaling $6.9 billion in FY2006, lower than previous years but higher than the 30-year average. Peak spending coincided with events like Iraq reconstruction, pre-Iraq war aid, and peace agreements. Aid resources have generally remained stable between $4 billion and $6 billion annually. In FY2006, the United States provided $4.9 billion in military assistance programs, which is nearly 30% less than the annual average since FY1977. This decrease is due to a shift in funding $11 billion in programs to train and equip Afghan and Iraqi security forces using Defense Department resources instead of traditional international affairs budget functions. The United States experienced a decline in military assistance levels after the Cold War, with a shift in funding towards training and equipping Afghan and Iraqi security forces using Defense Department resources instead of traditional international affairs budget functions. This change in financing structure is expected to continue in future years. Military assistance was used as a tool to support anti-communist insurgents during the Reagan Doctrine policy, leading to increased support for countries like El Salvador, Honduras, and the Philippines. Since the signing of the Camp David Peace Accord in 1978, promoting Middle East peace has been a cornerstone of U.S. military assistance. Military aid reached its peak in FY1979 at $15.2 billion, with Israel and Egypt receiving a substantial support package. Military aid focuses on countries and initiatives of strategic importance to the United States, with the FY2006 budget at $4.9 billion, the sixth lowest in three decades. Military assistance spending in FY2005 and FY2006 was significantly lower compared to previous years due to funds being shifted to train and equip security forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress appropriated $11 billion for this purpose, managed by the Defense Department. During the Reagan Administration, military aid resources more than doubled, with increases for countries like Israel, Egypt, Greece, Turkey, and Pakistan. In FY1979, military aid funding to strategic partners like the United States, Israel, Egypt, Greece, Turkey, and Pakistan increased significantly. Over the past 30 years, sub-Saharan African countries received $72.2 billion in economic and military assistance from the United States. Despite this, Africa has not been a primary focus compared to the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America. In 2005, there was a push to increase aid for African development at the G-8 Summit. The Bush Administration pledged to double U.S. bilateral assistance to Africa from $4.3 billion in 2004 to $8.6 billion by 2010 at the G-8 Summit in July 2005. U.S. assistance to Africa has more than doubled since FY2001, rising from $2.4 billion to $5.9 billion in FY2006, and more than tripled since a $1.6 billion total in FY1997. This increase was due to new American foreign aid initiatives targeting sub-Saharan Africa. The Bush Administration pledged to double U.S. bilateral assistance to Africa from $4.3 billion in 2004 to $8.6 billion by 2010 at the G-8 Summit in July 2005. U.S. assistance to Africa has more than doubled since FY2001, rising from $2.4 billion to $5.9 billion in FY2006, and more than tripled since a $1.6 billion total in FY1997. This increase was due to new American foreign aid initiatives targeting sub-Saharan Africa, including various programs such as the Congo Basin Forest Partnership, Initiative to End Hunger in Africa, Trade for African Development and Enterprise Initiative, Women's Justice and Empowerment in Africa, Millennium Challenge Account, anti-malaria program, and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The five-year, $15 billion PEPFAR program, initiated in FY2004, focuses on 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, providing over $2.2 billion for AIDS prevention and treatment. U.S. assistance to Africa has also increased due to humanitarian crises, such as food shortages and conflicts in Liberia and Sudan, leading to a rise in food aid from $400 million to $1.1 billion annually. Additionally, contributions to peacekeeping operations have contributed to the growing level of assistance to Africa in recent years. In recent years, Africa has seen a growth in contributions to peacekeeping operations in the region, with significant funding for activities in Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Sudan/Darfur, and Cote d'Ivoire. U.S. costs for these missions have averaged about $835 million annually since FY2002, a fivefold increase from previous years. U.S. assistance to Africa decreased in the mid-1990s but has since increased, with a total aid package of $1.6 billion in FY1996 and FY1997, the lowest amount in real terms since FY1979. During the 1980s, U.S. assistance to sub-Saharan Africa peaked in FY1985 at $2.9 billion, largely due to a sizable food assistance supplemental responding to a major famine in the region. Assistance fell sharply in the next two years as transfers declined or were re-directed to other regions. Congress created a separate appropriation account for Africa in FY1988, the Development Fund for Africa (DFA), to designate aid levels more clearly in spending bills. DFA resources grew from about $500 million to nearly $800 million by FY1993 before declining in the following years. Congress ended the separate DFA appropriation account in FY1996. The Bush Administration announced in July 2005 that the United States would double bilateral aid to Africa, increasing it from $4.3 billion in FY2004 to $8.6 billion by FY2010. U.S. aid to Africa estimated for FY2006 is the largest in three decades, totaling nearly three times the annual average since FY1977. Humanitarian crises and contributions to peacekeeping operations led to significant increases in U.S. assistance to Africa since FY2002. Bank and Fund(AfDB) pushed U.S. assistance to Africa to a near three-decade low in FY1996/97. Congress created the Development Fund for Africa in FY1988 to clarify funding decisions for the region. U.S. aid to Africa increased in the early 1980s due to famine conditions and the use of the Economic Support Fund(ESF). The international affairs budget also supports diplomacy and American engagement in the international community. The State Department's funding for public diplomacy and international organizations has generally increased over the past three decades, reaching $12.2 billion in FY2006. This includes fees collected for visa processing, totaling nearly $1.2 billion in FY2006. The FY2006 State Department budget represents the second-largest spending amount in 30 years, exceeding the annual average by 75%. Colin Powell advocated for increased funding to address technology and staffing challenges. Funding for State Department and public diplomacy has seen significant increases since the Bush Administration, with spikes often related to overseas security issues. Over the past 30 years, American embassies have faced increasing security threats, with terrorist attacks growing in number. The State Department recognized the need for tighter security measures after the bombings in Beirut in the 1980s. New standards were set for security at U.S. facilities worldwide, leading to increased funding for embassy security. Major attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 prompted Congress to pass emergency funding. In 1998, Congress passed emergency funding after major attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The Clinton Administration sought an expansion of U.N. involvement in international peacekeeping, requesting supplemental funding for various peacekeeping efforts. Congress appropriated $670 million for peacekeeping in 1994, doubling the international peacekeeping account that year. This raised the State Department and public diplomacy budget to $7.9 billion in FY2006 dollars. Some Members believed that foreign policy agency funding could be reduced to address budget pressures after the Cold War. Reorganization of international broadcasting entities and consolidation of foreign policy agencies into the Department of State in FY1999 aimed to streamline operations and save money. Funding for broadcasting and cultural exchange programs saw significant cuts in the mid-1990s, leading to a six-year low in the State Department/public diplomacy budget. Funding for State Department personnel, embassy security, public diplomacy, and international organization dues has steadily increased over the years. Funding for State Department personnel, embassy security, public diplomacy, and international organization dues has increased steadily over the past three decades, peaking in FY2006 at $12.2 billion (constant dollars). Emphasis on staffing and technology upgrades during the early Bush Administration pushed spending upward from $7.8 billion in FY2000 to $9.5 billion by FY2003. The bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 and the Inman Report on embassy security standards in 1985 led to sizable supplemental spending. Contributions to UN peacekeeping operations, including Somalia, pushed funding for State Department and public diplomacy to $7.9 billion in FY1994, the highest level in 18 years. The International Affairs Budget includes discretionary budget authority for foreign assistance, bilateral development assistance, and humanitarian assistance. Sources for the budget data include OMB, House and Senate Appropriations Committees, and CRS calculations. FY2006 figures include supplemental appropriations and a 1% rescission of regular appropriations.
