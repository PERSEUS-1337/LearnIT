Determining the prevalence of diagnosable mental illness is challenging, with varying estimates. Few surveys provide national prevalence estimates, but three federally funded surveys offer such data: the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), the National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). These surveys provide prevalence estimates of any mental illness and serious mental illness. Large surveys may not allow for lengthy interviews and use of clinical judgment in diagnosing mental illnesses. Considerations in generating national prevalence estimates of diagnosable mental illness through large surveys include the preference for more recent data sources like the NSDUH, which is conducted annually, over older surveys like the NCS-R and NCS-A. Clinical practice relies on criteria in the DSM for diagnosis, but surveys may not provide specific disorder prevalence estimates. Prevalence estimates of diagnosable mental illness through large surveys depend on the survey instrument used, who administers it, and the generalizability of the findings. Longer survey instruments may accurately identify mental illness by asking necessary questions, while shorter ones may not be as accurate. Survey instruments can be administered in different ways, affecting their accuracy and feasibility in large surveys. Examples of survey instruments assessing mental illness are provided in Table 1. The prevalence estimates in large surveys depend on the survey instrument used and how it is administered. Weighting is used to reflect the general U.S. population, correcting for known differences but not for excluded subpopulations. The National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) replicated the original National Comorbidity Survey, using structured interviews to assess DSM disorders among a national sample of adults in the United States. Conducted between 2001 and 2003, it was funded by various organizations including the National Institute of Mental Health. The NCS-R conducted in-person interviews with over 9,000 adults aged 18 or older between 2001 and 2003. Exclusions like the homeless and non-English speakers limit generalizability. The NCS-R used the WMH-CIDI to assess mental illness, yielding different prevalence estimates ranging from 26.2% to 32.4% for a 12-month period. The NCS-R data estimated the 12-month prevalence of mental illness to be 32.4% among adults, including substance use disorders. Excluding substance use disorders, the prevalence was 24.8%. Serious mental disorders were less common (22.3%) than moderate (37.3%) or mild disorders (40.4%). The 12-month prevalence of serious mental illness among all adults was 5.8%. The NCS-A survey, funded by various organizations, interviewed over 10,000 adolescents aged 13 to 17 in the US between 2001 and 2004. Participants were assessed for DSM disorders through structured interviews, with parents also providing information on their child's mental health and developmental history. The sample excluded homeless individuals, those in institutions, and non-English speakers. The NCS-A survey excluded homeless, institutionalized, and non-English speaking individuals, limiting the generalizability of findings. It used a modified CIDI to assess mental illness prevalence among adolescents, estimated at 40.3%. Some critics argue that the current DSM may misidentify mentally ill individuals. Additional analysis identified serious mental illness as one diagnosis with severe functional impairment. The NCS-A survey used a sophisticated approach to assess mental illness prevalence among adolescents, yielding a 12-month prevalence of any mental illness at 42.6%. Most cases were found to be mild, with 58.2% of adolescents with a disorder experiencing mild impairment. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) found that most cases of mental illness among adolescents were mild or moderate, with a prevalence of serious mental illness at 8.0%. Research suggests that even mild disorders in adolescence can predict serious disorders in adulthood. The NSDUH focuses on illegal drug, alcohol, and tobacco use, as well as mental health issues, and surveys a large number of civilians in the United States annually. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) gathers data on mental illness prevalence among adults and adolescents in the United States. The survey excludes homeless individuals, those in institutions, and military personnel on active duty, limiting the generalizability of its findings. NSDUH-based estimates show the prevalence of any mental illness and serious mental illness among adults aged 18 or older. The survey uses personal interviews and computer-assisted self-interviewing to ensure privacy for sensitive topics like illicit drug use. The NSDUH does not provide prevalence estimates of mental illness for adolescents aged 12 to 17 but determines the presence of any mental illness through short question modules and follow-up interviews with adults. Unlike other surveys, NSDUH does not include specific DSM diagnoses but uses a similar approach to impute the CGAS score. The 2016 NSDUH estimates the 12-month prevalence of mental illness in adults (aged 18 or older) at 18.3%, excluding substance use disorders. Serious mental illness prevalence, excluding substance use disorders, is estimated at 4.2% among adults. The study uses a statistical model to link SCID-based diagnoses to survey responses and impute mental illness presence based on responses. The national prevalence of mental illness, excluding substance use disorders, is 4.2% among adults. Policymakers may face challenges in deciding whether to focus on a broad group including mild cases or narrow down to serious mental illness. The integration of substance use disorders with mental illness in policies is a topic of debate. Policymakers may need to decide if mental illness and substance use disorders should be addressed together or separately. Questions arise about how to address mental illness in populations like the homeless. The relevance of prevalence estimates from older surveys like the NCS-R and NCS-A to current policy discussions is also a concern for policymakers."
