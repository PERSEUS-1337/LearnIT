    "content": "The federal judiciary, state courts, state legislatures, and bar associations have established ethical standards for judges and judicial candidates. These codes may discourage federal judicial nominees from answering certain questions during confirmation hearings. The ethical rules do not require nominees to answer specific questions but rather restrict what they can say. Canons of judicial ethics are generally self-enforcing, leading to minimal case law on the matter. The ethical standards for federal judicial nominees discourage them from answering certain questions during confirmation hearings, as the canons of judicial ethics are generally self-enforcing. There is minimal case law and commentary on how these codes apply in the context of confirmation hearings before the U.S. Senate, leading to a lack of consensus on permissible responses. Some nominees believe ethical considerations restrict judicial candidates from discussing potential legal issues that may arise in the federal judiciary, while others argue that the ethical rules allow nominees flexibility in their responses. The applicable canons only prohibit nominees from showing a bias towards specific outcomes in future cases. The Code of Conduct for United States Judges grants judicial nominees flexibility in responding to questions during the confirmation process, aiming to preserve the integrity of the federal judiciary by providing ethical guidance for proper judicial behavior. The Code of Conduct for United States Judges is relevant for nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court, as it provides aspirational rules for federal judges to abide by. It does not have enforcement mechanisms and violations may only result in disciplinary complaints or disqualification from a case, which is not granted frequently. Not every violation warrants discipline or disqualification. The Code of Conduct may limit responses during a federal judge's confirmation hearing, but transgressions may not lead to practical consequences. Canon 3(A)(6) restricts public comments on pending court matters to ensure fair and impartial duties. Federal judges nominated for higher courts should avoid directly commenting on pending cases, especially those from their own court. It is unclear if Canon 3(A)(6) prohibits nominees from discussing their views on legal issues and precedents. The term \"impending in any court\" is not clearly defined, as most legal issues may eventually come before a judge. Some nominees believe they should not express views on most legal questions to avoid potential conflicts. One scholar argues that Canon 3(A)(6) only applies to specific pending cases with identifiable facts and litigants, allowing judicial nominees to discuss their views on well-known legal issues like Roe v. Wade. This interpretation suggests that general legal issues without a defined controversy do not fall under the prohibition. The Code of Conduct may restrict judicial nominees from commenting on pending or impending cases during confirmation hearings, but there is uncertainty about what constitutes a public comment \"on the merits.\" The ABA Model Code of Ethics also provides ethical standards for judicial nominees. The ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct provides ethical standards for judges and judicial candidates, aiming to maintain high standards of conduct and regulate behavior through disciplinary agencies. However, its constraints on federal judicial nominees are unclear as it is a model template of legal and judicial ethics, not binding unless adopted by the state. The ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct serves as a model for jurisdictions to adopt ethical standards for judges and judicial candidates, but it is not enforced by the ABA. States may have variances in their adoption and enforcement of the Code, making its application to federal judicial nominees uncertain. Despite this, the Model Code offers guidance on proper judicial conduct and is commonly consulted by judges. The Model Code prohibits federal judicial nominees from making pledges or commitments on cases to maintain impartiality and independence. This rule aims to insulate the judiciary from political influence and ensure decisions are based on law and facts, not public opinion. The Model Code prohibits federal judicial nominees from making pledges or commitments on cases to maintain impartiality and independence, ensuring decisions are based on law and facts, not public opinion. Judges and judicial candidates must be free from political influence and pressure, as stated in the commentary to the Model Code. The prohibition against pledges, promises, or commitments applies when communicating with appointing or confirming authorities, including the United States Senate for federal judge nominations. Courts have clarified that a pledge, promise, or commitment involves an affirmative assurance of a particular action, predetermining the resolution of a case or issue. The Model Code prohibits federal judicial nominees from making pledges or commitments on cases to maintain impartiality and independence. The clause prohibits candidates from promising not to apply or uphold the law. There is a lack of clarity on what qualifies as pledges, promises, and commitments in the context of confirmation hearings for federal judgeships. Cases regarding elected judgeships can provide insight into this issue. Advocacy groups often use questionnaires to discern a nominee's views on controversial legal issues, similar to how state judgeships candidates are asked about their stance on topics like Roe v. Wade. Responses to such questions may be seen as pledges or commitments to act impartially in office, although state ethical canons do not outright prohibit candidates from answering. The Model Code allows judicial candidates to answer questions in surveys as long as they do not pledge specific rulings. Candidates should acknowledge the obligation to uphold the law without personal bias. Federal judicial nominees can discuss their philosophies in confirmation hearings but should not commit to specific case outcomes. State courts and disciplinary bodies commonly enforce these guidelines. State courts and disciplinary bodies commonly impose discipline under the \"pledges, promises, and commitments\" clause when judicial candidates make campaign promises to favor or disfavor certain classes of litigants in their rulings. The rule against attempting to garner a larger share of the popular vote by promising to rule in specific ways applies equally to judicial nominees seeking confirmation. Candidates for appointive judicial office are trying to influence a smaller \"electorate\" and making pledges in these small-scale \"campaigns\" is considered improper. In small-scale judicial campaigns, making pledges inconsistent with impartial judicial duties is improper. Candidates can express personal views on legal or political issues as long as they uphold the obligation to apply and uphold the law without bias. The ethical rule for judicial candidates allows them to express personal views on legal or political issues during confirmation hearings, as long as they do not make pledges or promises to rule in a particular way. This rule aims to ensure impartiality and faithful performance of judicial duties. The Model Code prohibits judicial candidates from making public statements that could call their impartiality into question, even if they do not make pledges or promises regarding future rulings. Successful candidates may be disqualified from certain cases based on their prior statements. The Model Code prohibits judges and judicial candidates from making public statements that could affect pending or impending court matters, to maintain impartiality and avoid bias perceptions. This rule applies regardless of the forum and discourages federal judicial nominees from certain public statements during confirmation hearings. The Model Code prohibits judges and judicial candidates from making public statements that could affect pending or impending court matters. The rule clarifies that \"impending matters\" are those that will likely end up in court. Once a case is fully resolved, judges can freely comment on it. Federal judicial nominees may have some leeway to discuss past cases, but comments on issues likely to reoccur could still be prohibited. The Model Code prohibits judges and judicial candidates from making public statements that could affect pending or impending court matters. The annotations suggest judges can express disagreement with the law as long as they don't try to change it. Federal judicial nominees may make statements during the confirmation process that could implicate ethical norms or rules. The Model Code prohibits federal judicial nominees from making commitments on specific issues or cases during courtesy visits with Members. It also prohibits nominees from making nonpublic statements that could interfere with a fair trial or hearing. However, there is limited guidance on how this rule applies in the judicial confirmation process. The Model Code prohibits federal judicial nominees from making commitments on specific issues or cases during courtesy visits with Members. However, there is limited guidance on how this rule applies in the judicial confirmation process, especially regarding nonpublic statements. Nominees may avoid answering certain questions during confirmation hearings to prevent making public statements that could lead to their disqualification from future cases. Federal statutes and canons of judicial conduct require judges to recuse themselves from cases under specified circumstances. The need for judges to disqualify themselves in cases where their impartiality may be questioned is particularly crucial for Supreme Court justices due to the court's role in deciding urgent public matters. It is argued that decisions should ideally be made by a full Court to avoid frequent disqualification. The disqualification of a Supreme Court Justice from a case can lead to an evenly divided Court, preventing the creation of binding precedent for future cases. The standard for disqualification is based on whether a reasonable observer would question the judge's impartiality, regardless of subjective bias. Mandatory disqualification is required when a judge's conduct calls their impartiality into question. Section 455(a) aims to prevent unjustified recusals that delay proceedings and increase workload. Courts assume a judge's impartiality, with parties bearing the burden of proving otherwise. While judges are expected to self-enforce recusal standards, parties can file a motion for disqualification if needed. A federal trial judge's decision not to recuse himself is subject to appellate review, and will only be overturned if it was unreasonable and unsupported by the record. Section 455(a) and the Code of Conduct both aim to promote impartiality in the federal judiciary, but do not perfectly overlap. Courts consider whether a judge's public statement violates the Code when deciding on recusal. The lack of clear guidance on when public comments outside of a hearing or bench ruling create an appearance of partiality for recusal. Judges making statements to the media about cases they are presiding over is a common scenario for disqualification, but the impact of confirmation context statements on recusal is less analyzed. The case In re African-American Slave Descendants Litigation discusses when a federal judge must disqualify themselves based on statements made during the judicial confirmation process. The plaintiffs moved to recuse the judge, claiming bias, but the statements only reflected the nominee's general legal views. The district judge did not recuse himself from the case despite the plaintiffs' claims of bias based on his prior general legal views. The judge's statements were deemed not case-specific enough to predetermine his decision. However, historical practice suggests that public comments on controversial legal issues may warrant recusal in certain circumstances. For example, Justice Scalia's critical speech on the Establishment Clause led to calls for his recusal in a future case. Justice Scalia chose not to participate in a case regarding the 'under God' phrase in the pledge of allegiance, possibly due to his prior public comments on the Establishment Clause. Recusal may be warranted when judges express opinions on specific cases, as opposed to general legal philosophy. Federal judicial nominees may be more inclined to answer general questions about their legal views than case-specific questions they may need to adjudicate if confirmed. The rules governing judicial ethics are self-enforcing and may not always provide clear answers on permissible conduct. Judges and candidates often decide for themselves on ethical standards, looking to historical practice for guidance. Historical practice can guide ethical and constitutional considerations, especially in defining constitutional norms for the three branches of government. During Justice Rehnquist's confirmation hearing for Chief Justice, he initially avoided a question about Congress stripping the Supreme Court's ability to hear constitutional challenges. Senator Specter pressed the issue, highlighting the importance of the question. Justice Rehnquist eventually reversed his stance. During Justice Rehnquist's confirmation hearing, he initially avoided a question about Congress stripping the Supreme Court's ability to hear constitutional challenges. The next day, he reversed course, stating he would try to give an answer in light of Justice O'Connor's opinion. This standard of responding to Senate questioning has become known as the \"Ginsburg Rule,\" based on Ruth Bader Ginsburg's confirmation hearing where she refused to offer hints or previews of her potential rulings. Judges are bound to decide concrete cases based on specific facts and governing law, without offering forecasts or hints. This principle, known as the Ginsburg Rule, precedes Justice Ginsburg's hearing and emphasizes impartiality in the judicial process. The section examines Supreme Court nominees' reluctance to answer questions due to bias concerns, judicial independence, or appropriateness. It reviews the norms of senatorial questioning during confirmation hearings, focusing on the comprehensive examination of nominees for the Supreme Court. The discussion includes the development of modern judicial confirmation hearings, constitutional concerns in exchanges between Senators and nominees, and trends in the types of questions nominees are willing to answer. Since the 1955 confirmation hearing of Justice John Marshall Harlan II, Supreme Court nominees go through a confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The number of questions asked by Senators has increased over time as the Committee has grown in size. Scholars and jurists have noted trends in the types of questions nominees are willing to answer. The failed confirmation of Judge Robert Bork in 1987 is seen as a pivotal moment in confirmation hearings. Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court was defeated due to contentious hearings and perceived wrong answers. This event led to subsequent nominees being less willing to express their views on legal issues. Nominees have historically avoided answering certain questions during confirmation hearings, with concerns about judicial views being a more common topic today. Past nominees have cited constitutional concerns to justify their silence. Nominees have historically avoided answering certain questions during confirmation hearings, citing concerns about judicial views. The Constitution prohibits judges from giving advisory opinions and emphasizes resolving disputes through the adversarial process. This has led nominees to be reluctant in responding to hypothetical questions posed by Senators. Nominees have historically avoided answering certain questions during confirmation hearings, citing concerns about their ability to rule on issues without proper briefing and argument from adversarial parties. This reluctance is grounded in constitutional due process guarantees, ensuring cases are resolved by unbiased judges. Judges must remain impartial to uphold fair trials and avoid prejudging future cases. Additionally, nominees refrain from certain responses to uphold separation-of-powers principles, maintaining an independent judiciary free from political influence. Courts have monitored Congress's attempts to influence judicial decisions, emphasizing the importance of judicial independence. Nominees avoid making pledges on specific cases to maintain impartiality. However, Senate's role in advising and consenting to nominees must be balanced with nominees' constitutional concerns. Some senators have withheld votes due to nominee evasiveness during confirmation hearings. Supreme Court nominees often decline to answer questions on specific issues or cases that may come before the Court in the future, a practice known as the Ginsburg Rule. Senators may feel obligated to ask these questions, but nominees may choose not to answer to maintain impartiality. This can lead to disagreements between nominees and Senators on the likelihood of certain issues coming before the Court. Nominees also avoid answering questions that could suggest they have prejudged a case. Senators often ask Supreme Court nominees about their judicial philosophy, prior statements, views on past cases, and Court procedures instead of direct questions on specific issues. Nominees tend to discuss settled or fundamental issues. For example, in a 1971 hearing, a nominee avoided defining due process. In a 1959 law review article, Rehnquist argued that the Senate should be interested in a nominee's views on judicial philosophy. However, he later expressed sympathy for nominees having to respond to questions without prejudging issues. Rehnquist was willing to discuss settled doctrines of due process without reservation. Rehnquist affirmed settled doctrines of due process without reservation and described his approach to unsettled questions, emphasizing reliance on precedent and ratification debates. Some nominees avoid answering certain questions to prevent a \"slippery slope,\" as seen with Judge Samuel Alito's response to a hypothetical about Senate confirmation votes. Judge Alito declined to answer a question about allowing a majority vote for impeachment, citing a concern about a \"slippery slope\" and avoiding easy questions that could lead to harder ones. This approach is similar to Judge Ginsburg's refusal to discuss a case involving an executive branch policy during her confirmation hearing. Judge Alito, like Judge Ginsburg, declined to answer certain questions during his confirmation hearing, citing concerns about a \"slippery slope\" and avoiding easy questions that could lead to harder ones. Alito compared his approach to then-Judge Antonin Scalia's refusal to state opinions on prior Supreme Court decisions. During his confirmation hearing, Judge Alito declined to answer certain questions, citing concerns about prejudicing future litigants. He believed that discussing his views on issues could lead to bias in future cases. Nominees often discuss their general philosophies of law, including approaches to constitutional and statutory interpretation. For example, Clarence Thomas denied belief in natural law for constitutional interpretation, and Neil Gorsuch explained his commitment to originalism. During confirmation hearings, nominees often discuss their philosophies of law, including approaches to constitutional and statutory interpretation. Elena Kagan explained her view on applying the Constitution's principles to new circumstances but avoided the term \"living Constitution.\" Nominees may also talk about their views on precedent and stare decisis, with senators gauging their willingness to overturn controversial Supreme Court cases. Senator Arlen Specter engaged in a discussion with Judge John Roberts about stare decisis and its application to Supreme Court cases, particularly those involving the right to an abortion. While nominees typically discuss their prior work and positions on certain issues, Roberts declined to reveal his stance on specific cases or how he would apply stare decisis principles. This practice of nominees discussing their prior work may explain variations in their responses during confirmation hearings. During confirmation hearings, nominees may choose to discuss their prior work and positions on certain issues, but they may also decline to reveal their stance on specific cases or how they would apply legal principles. This can lead to variations in their responses, as seen with Chief Justice Roberts' reluctance to comment on certain decisions or express his views on controversial topics. The nominee discussed the constitutionality of bills stripping the Court's jurisdiction, expressing uncertainty about his stance today compared to his past views. Nominees often explain their prior positions, sometimes attributing them to advocacy roles. However, most Supreme Court candidates are hesitant to disclose personal opinions on various issues. During confirmation hearings, nominees often refrain from expressing personal views on controversial issues like marriage equality and gun rights, instead deferring to prior Supreme Court decisions. Senators inquire about the potential influence of nominees' personal or political beliefs on their judicial decisions, with some nominees facing scrutiny over their personal lives, as seen in Justice Thomas's extended confirmation hearings involving sexual harassment allegations. During confirmation hearings, nominees are questioned about their memberships in exclusive clubs and past involvement in legal defense groups. Senators may ask about nominees' views on previously decided cases to gauge their beliefs on contested issues. Nominees' willingness to respond to these questions varies widely, with some, like then-Judge Scalia, refusing to give their opinions on past Supreme Court cases. During confirmation hearings, nominees are questioned about their views on past Supreme Court cases. Some nominees, like then-Judge Scalia, refuse to give their opinions on previous cases, while others, like then-Solicitor General Kagan, may discuss their views on specific cases such as Bush v. Gore. The willingness of nominees to discuss past cases may depend on the likelihood of similar legal issues arising in the future. Kagan discussed the importance of the Court's involvement in election contests, noting that while some cases like Marbury v. Madison are well-established, others like Dred Scott v. Sanford and Korematsu v. United States were wrongly decided. She emphasized the need to consider future cases in an appropriate manner. Almost all modern lawyers agree that certain cases were wrongly decided, with nominees willing to comment on settled cases that are part of the canon or anti-canon. Nominees may vary in their willingness to embrace well-established law over time, as seen in questions about Brown v. Board of Education. In past confirmation hearings, Senators discussed their views on certain cases. During confirmation hearings, nominees were questioned about their views on Brown v. Board of Education. Senators sought to determine nominees' opinions on the case, with Chief Justice Rehnquist eventually acknowledging Brown as established constitutional law. He emphasized that a unanimous decision by the Court interpreting the Constitution is not lawmaking but rather constitutional interpretation. During confirmation hearings, nominees were questioned about their views on Brown v. Board of Education. Chief Justice Rehnquist acknowledged Brown as established constitutional law, emphasizing that a unanimous Court decision is constitutional interpretation, not lawmaking. Justice O'Connor declined to label Brown as judicial activism, stating the Court was interpreting the Constitution. She did not express agreement with the colorblind Constitution concept in Plessy's dissent, citing ongoing affirmative action litigation. Supreme Court nominees now more readily endorse Brown as settled law. During confirmation hearings, nominees may be unwilling to discuss unsettled cases, but may acknowledge them or discuss general frameworks. Nominees may also address judicial procedure questions. For example, Justice Kagan described District of Columbia v. Heller as settled law. During confirmation hearings, Supreme Court nominees often discuss various issues such as support for filming proceedings, views on the workload of the Court, judicial misconduct, and the impeachment process. Nominees like Justice Kennedy and Justice O'Connor have shared their perspectives on these topics, while others like Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg have expressed differing opinions on the impeachment process. During confirmation hearings, Supreme Court nominees have discussed recusal in cases where there may be a conflict of interest or bias. Nominees like Kagan, Sotomayor, and Roberts have committed to recusing themselves under certain circumstances. During confirmation hearings, Supreme Court nominees have discussed recusal in cases where there may be a conflict of interest or bias. The applicable codes of judicial conduct and historical practice provide guidance on what questions nominees can answer. Nominees should refrain from pledging to uphold or overturn specific precedents or decide cases in certain ways to avoid potential recusal in future cases. The boundaries between permissible and impermissible responses during confirmation hearings are still contested. The boundaries between permissible and impermissible responses during confirmation hearings are still contested. Nominees often avoid giving clear commitments or hints about how they may view potential disputes. General questions about the nominee's jurisprudential philosophy are more likely to receive responses than specific questions about how they intend to rule in particular cases. Nominees may speak about specific legal issues if they have previously commented on them, but there are few remedies available if a nominee refuses to answer a question. The Senate rarely considers lack of candor during confirmation hearings as disqualifying, and has never rejected a Supreme Court nominee solely for being evasive."
