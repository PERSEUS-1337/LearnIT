    "title": "SB 1289",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature of California declares its intent to prohibit profiting from the incarceration of individuals in immigration detention and ensure their just and humane treatment. It aims to establish uniform standards for detention facilities in the state. Section 1670.9 of the Civil Code prohibits cities, counties, and law enforcement agencies from contracting with private entities to detain immigrants for profit in civil immigration proceedings, effective January 1, 2018. If a city, county, or local law enforcement agency contracts to detain immigrants in civil immigration proceedings, they must adhere to ICE standards and be subject to the California Public Records Act. An immigration detention facility must provide immigrant detainees access to legal representation, translators, medical care, freedom from harm, and privacy. Immigrant detainees cannot be segregated based on gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation. Transgender and gender nonconforming detainees have the right to choose housing consistent with their gender identity. An immigration detention facility operator can exceed certain detention standards outlined in the 2011 Operations Manual ICE Performance-Based National Detention Standards or ICE Directive 11065.1. If an immigration detention facility operator violates specified standards, the Attorney General or other authorities in California can take legal action for injunctive relief and seek a civil penalty of $25,000 per violation. The definitions for \"immigration detention facility\" and \"immigration detention facility operator\" are provided in this section. The act defines \"segregated housing\" as isolation from the general population for extended periods. The provisions of the act are severable, meaning that if one part is invalid, it does not affect the rest."
