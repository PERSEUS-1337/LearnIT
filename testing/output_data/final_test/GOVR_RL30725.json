    "content": "The House of Representatives follows a routine on the opening day of a new Congress, including electing the Speaker, swearing in Members, electing House officers, adopting rules, and assigning Members to committees. This is necessary because the House is not a continuing body, with each new Congress starting afresh every two years as mandated by the Constitution. The Twentieth Amendment specifies that a new Congress convenes on January 3 of odd-numbered years. The 113th Congress set the convening date for the 114th Congress as January 6, 2015, through a joint resolution signed into law by President Obama. Congressional leaders planned for the 115th and 116th Congresses to convene on January 3, 2017, and January 3, 2019, respectively, without the need for a law to set the date. In recent years, it has been uncommon for a new Congress to begin on January 3, with nine of the past 12 Congresses starting on different dates. The 107th, 113th, and 115th Congresses began on January 3, while the 111th, 112th, and 114th Congresses started on January 4, 6, and 6, respectively. The Clerk of the House or Sergeant at Arms presides until the Speaker is elected. The Chaplain offers a prayer, the Pledge of Allegiance is recited, and a roll call establishes a quorum. The Clerk of the House presides over the roll call to establish a quorum. Members-elect insert their voting cards into electronic machines to register their presence. Once a majority is reached, a quorum is indicated, fulfilling constitutional requirements. The Clerk then announces the election of the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico and Delegates from various territories. Any deaths or resignations are also reported. The first order of business after establishing a quorum is the election of the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Candidates are nominated by party leaders, with a viva voce roll-call vote following the nominations. Members-elect call out the last name of their choice for Speaker during the vote. The Clerk appoints Members-elect as tellers to ascertain the vote for the Speaker of the House. Majority party's members usually vote along party lines, ensuring their candidate's election. Candidates often vote \"present\" or abstain. In the 115th Congress, nominations for Speaker were made by the Republican Conference. In the 115th Congress, nominations for Speaker of the House were made for Paul D. Ryan and Nancy Pelosi. The Clerk appointed tellers to ascertain the vote. In the 115th Congress, nominations for Speaker of the House were made for Paul D. Ryan and Nancy Pelosi. The tellers confirmed that Paul D. Ryan received 239 votes, Nancy Pelosi received 189 votes, and other nominees received fewer votes. The Honorable PAUL D. RYAN of Wisconsin is elected Speaker of the House for the 115th Congress. A bipartisan committee escorts the Speaker-elect to the chair, where they take the oath of office administered by the dean of the House. The Speaker then delivers a letter to the Clerk listing Members. The Speaker administers the oath to all Members of the House, including nonvoting Delegates and Resident Commissioner, who affirm their support and defense of the Constitution. An oath is mandated by Article VI of the Constitution and its text is set by statute (5 U.S.C. 3331). Members-elect raise their right hands during the swearing-in ceremony, and while some choose to hold a family Bible or other sacred text in their left hands, it is not required. Representatives may re-enact the event with their families in the Speaker's office, and many choose to hold something meaningful in their left hands, such as a family heirloom. Photography is not permitted during the swearing-in on the House floor. During the swearing-in ceremony, photography is not allowed on the House floor. Members who miss the initial swearing-in can take the oath later in the House chamber or elsewhere. The oath may be administered by another Member, a judge, or at various locations in Washington, DC or other parts of the country. If a Member's swearing-in is challenged, the Speaker addresses it according to House precedents. After the swearing-in ceremony, the Speaker receives reports from party chairs announcing their choices for majority and minority leaders. The elected majority and minority whips are then announced. The House proceeds to elect its administrative officers. The House elects its administrative officers, including Clerk, Sergeant at Arms, Chief Administrative Officer, and Chaplain. The majority party nominates a slate of candidates, while the minority party proposes its own roster as an amendment. The Speaker administers the oath to the newly elected officers, and the House notifies the Senate and President of its leadership election. The House is assembled and ready to begin work, with leaders informing the President. The Clerk of the House notifies the President of the Speaker and Clerk selection. The next step is adopting the House rules, typically based on the previous Congress with amendments. The majority party's rules package usually prevails. The majority party's proposed rules, presented as a House simple resolution, prevail due to their numerical advantage. Debate is limited to one hour, with the majority floor manager yielding half the time to the minority. The previous question is moved at the end of debate, leading to an immediate vote. The adoption of the previous question motion forces an immediate vote on final approval of the majority's rules package, ending debate and preventing the minority from offering their own rules package. The minority can still offer a motion to commit with instructions for one more chance to offer an amendment. The majority party, with its numerical advantage, can defeat the motion to commit and adopt its rules resolution. The rules resolution may include provisions governing additional House actions or activities. In the House, the rules resolution may include provisions for additional House actions or activities, such as separate orders related to House rules and rulemaking statutes, committees, commissions, and House offices for the 115th Congress. The House rules resolution for the 115th Congress continued the existence of key offices and commissions from prior Congresses, including the House Democracy Partnership and the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. Additionally, a special order in Section 5 mandated the reading of the Constitution in the House and clarified the use of special rules for House consideration of measures. In the 115th Congress, special orders in the rules resolution allowed for consideration of specific measures, such as amending the Congressional Review Act to disapprove multiple regulations at once. The special orders were closed rules, meaning no amendments could be offered. In the 113th Congress, a special order allowed for a motion to suspend the rules on a specific date to consider a flood insurance measure. In the 115th Congress, special orders in the rules resolution allowed for consideration of specific measures without amendments. In the 112th Congress, a provision expanded debate time from 40 minutes to 2 hours. In the 111th Congress, special orders allowed for the consideration of bills like the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. In the 115th Congress, special orders in the rules resolution allowed for consideration of specific measures without amendments. The 10 policies in effect for the 115th Congress address privileges of the floor, introduction of bills and resolutions, unanimous consent requests for the consideration of legislation, recognition for one-minute speeches. In recent Congresses, the majority leader has established written protocols for scheduling legislation, covering authorization bills, suspension of rules procedure, and other matters. Both parties' rules also provide guidance on legislation scheduling, including consideration under the suspension of the rules procedure. These protocols and party rules are not printed in the Congressional Record. In the Congressional Record, protocols and party rules are not printed. Memoranda of understanding may be submitted by the Speaker or relevant committee chairs to provide guidance on legislation referral. In the 114th Congress, memoranda were inserted regarding the Judiciary Committee's jurisdiction change. This change added \"and criminalization\" to cover new criminal conduct. The Speaker may include a policy statement in announcements for Congress and appoint Members to sign bills. The House sets its daily meeting time with a resolution and allows Morning Hour for Members to speak on various topics. Members can publish remarks without daily consent requests at the start of each Congress. The House allows Members to publish remarks in the Congressional Record. Committee assignments are largely determined by the party groups, with simple resolutions implementing nominations without debate. The House routinely adopts resolutions for committee assignments without debate or amendment, with the understanding that each party has the right to determine its own assignments. These resolutions may be considered on opening day and throughout January. In March, a funding resolution for committees is typically adopted. Other organizational business, such as appointments to commissions or committees, may also be addressed on the first day. After adopting resolutions for committee assignments and funding in March, the House may address appointments to commissions or committees on the first day of the new Congress. Resolutions on specific circumstances, like electoral vote counting after a presidential election, may also be considered. Routine business includes introducing bills, receiving messages from the President, and completing legislative day.
