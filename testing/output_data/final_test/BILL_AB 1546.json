Noncomprehensive birth, death, and nonconfidential marriage record indices must be updated annually and made available for a fee under the California Public Records Act. Local registrars or county recorders must follow release conditions. Records obtained cannot be sold or transferred to third parties. Section 103526.5 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to include specific requirements for certified copies of birth, death, and marriage records, such as printing on security paper with certain features like intaglio print and latent image. These requirements are to be implemented based on available funds appropriated by the Legislature. The State Registrar may suspend the use of any security feature described if necessary to supply an applicant with a certified copy of a birth, death, or marriage record. The department can implement changes without regulatory action, ensuring consistent security measures for safeguarding security paper. Measures include secure storage, visitor logs, and proper disposal of spoilage. Additionally, a new section is added to the Health and Safety Code regarding security paper standards. The State Registrar, in consultation with stakeholders, will study security features for vital record paper and submit a report to the Legislature by January 1, 2018. The act is an urgency statute for immediate preservation of public peace, health, or safety. It allows access to vital records and mandates a study on security features for vital record paper. The findings of the study must be reported to the Legislature promptly."
