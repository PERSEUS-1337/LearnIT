    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Women Vietnam Veterans' Children's Birth Defects Benefits Act.\" It provides benefits for children of women Vietnam veterans who suffer from birth defects, specifically spina bifida. The \"Women Vietnam Veterans' Children's Birth Defects Benefits Act\" provides benefits for children of women Vietnam veterans who suffer from birth defects, including spina bifida. It inserts a new subchapter for these benefits after section 1805. The \"Women Vietnam Veterans' Children's Birth Defects Benefits Act\" defines terms like 'child' and 'woman Vietnam veteran' for eligibility. It covers birth defects leading to permanent disabilities, excluding those from familial disorders or birth-related injuries. The \"Women Vietnam Veterans' Children's Birth Defects Benefits Act\" covers birth defects known as 'covered birth defects' resulting from causes other than familial disorders or birth-related injuries. Health care is provided to children of woman Vietnam veterans with covered birth defects as needed. The Secretary may provide health care directly or through contracts with providers, including various types of care such as home care, hospital care, and training for family members. This includes pharmaceuticals, supplies, equipment, and assistive technology. The term 'health care provider' includes entities authorized to furnish health care services. 'Home care' refers to outpatient, preventive, and health-related services provided in a person's residence. 'Hospital care' involves care for a disability given to a patient admitted to a hospital. The term 'nursing home care' refers to care for a disability provided to a resident of a nursing home. 'Outpatient care' includes treatment for a disability and preventive health services for individuals not in a hospital or nursing home. 'Preventive care' involves services to prevent disability or illness. 'Habilitative and rehabilitative care' includes professional services and treatment programs for individuals needing rehabilitation. The term 'respite care' refers to intermittent care provided to an individual in a private residence to help them continue living there. Vocational training and rehabilitation programs can be provided to children of women Vietnam veterans with covered birth defects if achieving a vocational goal is feasible. The program of vocational training for children of women Vietnam veterans with covered birth defects is provided similarly to children of Vietnam veterans suffering from spina bifida. A monthly monetary allowance is paid based on the degree of disability suffered by the child. The Secretary establishes four levels of disability for children of women Vietnam veterans with covered birth defects, taking into account functional limitations. Monthly allowances range from $100 for the lowest level of disability to $743 for the second intermediate level. The monthly allowances for children of women Vietnam veterans with covered birth defects are based on four levels of disability, ranging from $100 to $1,272, subject to adjustment. \"SUBCHAPTER III--GENERAL\" \"Section 1822 states that receiving an allowance under this chapter will not affect an individual's right to receive any other benefits they are entitled to under laws administered by the Secretary. It also ensures that the allowance will not impact the benefits of other individuals related to the recipient of the allowance.\" The allowance paid under this chapter is not considered income or resources for determining eligibility for federal benefits. Individuals cannot receive allowances concurrently under both subchapters and may only receive one program of vocational training. Chapter 18 is amended to \"Benefits for Certain Children of Vietnam Veterans.\" The item in the tables of chapters is also updated to reflect this change. Amendments are made to Chapter 18, changing references from \"chapter\" to \"subchapter\" and updating sections 1803, 1804, and 1805. Section 5312 is also amended to include references to sections 1805 and 1815. The table of sections in Chapter 18 is updated accordingly. Amendments to Chapter 18 include the addition of \"SUBCHAPTER II--BENEFITS FOR CHILDREN OF WOMEN VIETNAM VETERANS WHO SUFFER FROM BIRTH DEFECTS\" and \"SUBCHAPTER III--GENERAL.\" The effective date for these changes is October 1, 2000, or the first day of the first month after the enactment of this Act."
