    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Improvement Act of 2001\". Congress finds that elementary and secondary school children are facing social stresses such as family fragmentation, substance abuse, violence, and poverty. There is an increasing number of students showing distress symptoms like emotional disorders, violent behavior, and juvenile delinquency. The homicide rate for adolescents has doubled between 1984 and 1994, and up to one in five children have severe psychological problems. The Institute of Medicine has identified psychological counseling as a critical school health need for children and youth. School counselors, psychologists, and social workers can help with personal growth and academic success. However, only 20 percent of youth with mental disorders receive help, and the student-to-counselor ratio in schools is high. The student-to-psychologist ratio in elementary and secondary schools is 2300 to 1. It is recommended to have 1 full-time counselor for every 250 students, 1 psychologist for every 1,000 students, and 1 school social worker for every 800 students. The Federal Government can help reduce academic, social, and emotional problems among students by developing model school counseling programs. The Federal Government aims to enhance counseling services in schools by providing grants to establish model counseling programs for students' academic, social, and emotional well-being. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to allocate $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and additional funds for the next 4 years for grants under section 4124 for school counseling programs. Additionally, a new section 4124 is added for an Elementary School and Secondary School Counseling Demonstration. The Secretary may award grants to local educational agencies to establish or expand school counseling programs, prioritizing those with the greatest need for services, innovative approaches, and potential for replication. The Secretary may award grants to local educational agencies for school counseling programs, ensuring equitable distribution and a maximum grant of $400,000 per year. Agencies must submit applications describing the targeted school population. The school counseling program must describe the targeted school population, their specific needs, available resources, activities, services, training, evaluation methods, and collaborative efforts with other organizations. The applicant must collaborate with various organizations to enhance the program, work with higher education institutions to improve graduate programs for school counselors, psychologists, and social workers, have qualified personnel, serve diverse cultural populations, and ensure proper use of funds. The program must ensure funds supplement non-Federal sources, appoint an advisory board, and use funds appropriately. The Secretary will award grants to local education agencies to implement or expand school counseling programs that address students' needs comprehensively, use a preventive approach, and improve the quality of counseling services in schools. The local educational agency must expand counseling services through qualified school counselors, psychologists, and social workers. They should use innovative approaches to enhance children's understanding of relationships, decision-making, and social functioning. Counseling services should include classroom group, small group, and individual counseling, as well as consultation with parents and teachers. Inservice training for school counselors and social workers should also be provided. The counseling program should involve various school personnel, parents, and collaborative efforts with external entities to enhance services. Annual evaluation of counseling services is required. The Secretary will issue a report on the effectiveness and outcomes of the program. The Secretary will evaluate programs assisted by grants, disseminate them through appropriate means, and limit administrative costs to 5%. Definitions include \"school counselor\" as an individual competent in counseling children and adolescents in a school setting. The term 'school counselor' refers to an individual with state licensure, national certification, or a master's degree in school counseling. The term 'school psychologist' refers to an individual with a minimum of 60 graduate semester credits. A school social worker holds a master's degree in social work from an accredited program by the Council on Social Work Education. A school social worker must have a master's degree in social work from an accredited program and be licensed or certified by the State or possess a national certification as a school social work specialist. A supervisor in this field must have equivalent professional experience."
