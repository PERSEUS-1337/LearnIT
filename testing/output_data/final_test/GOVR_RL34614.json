    "content": "Nanotechnology focuses on understanding and exploiting unique properties of matter at nanoscale. Congress is concerned about protecting human health and the environment as nanoscale materials are used. Research has raised concerns about potential environmental and health implications. The Federal government may use research, regulation, and international engagement to address these issues. Nanoscale materials have potential beneficial applications but also raise concerns for the environment and human health. There are over 1,000 nanotechnology products available, prompting interest in protecting the health of scientists, workers, consumers, and the public. Understanding the environmental impact of nanomanufacturing processes and disposal is crucial. Nanoscale particles can occur naturally or through various processes. Issues surrounding the potential environmental and human health implications of nanotechnology emerged with the launch of the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) in 2000. The NNI is a federal effort to coordinate and expand nanotechnology research and development (R&D) with significant investments made by the federal government and private sector. Private investment in nanotechnology exceeded U.S. government funding in 2008, with global R&D investments totaling over $17 billion. Concerns have been raised about the potential effects of nanotechnology on human health and the environment due to uncertainties about the transport and reactions of nanoscale particles. Some express concerns about how nanoscale particles may interact with the environment and accumulate in plants or animals, while others argue that worries about nanotechnology's environmental and health implications are often exaggerated. They point out that nanoscale materials are often embedded in other substances during manufacturing, some nanotechnology products do not contain nanoscale particles, and natural exposure to nanoscale particles is common. The NNI reviews by the NRC and PCAST suggest more research is needed for a rigorous risk assessment of nanoscale materials. Precautionary measures should be taken to protect health and safety until more information is available. Stakeholders agree that concerns about the effects of nanoscale materials must be addressed, including toxicity characterization, risk assessment methods, and understanding material movement. This report discusses the environmental, health, and safety opportunities and challenges of nanotechnology, emphasizing the importance of addressing EHS concerns. It identifies and discusses nanotechnology EHS issues and provides options for congressional action. The Appendix outlines federal agencies' roles in regulating nanotechnology. For more information on nanotechnology and the NNI, refer to CRS Report RL34401, RL34493, and RL34614 by John F. Sargent. Nanotechnology presents environmental, health, and safety challenges, similar to past technologies like automobiles and genetically-modified plants. These challenges include potential benefits but also risks such as emissions and food allergies. Regulatory challenges for nanotechnology are discussed in CRS Report RL34332. Nanotechnology offers economic and societal benefits, along with potential EHS challenges. Advocates believe it can reduce risks by engineering around them and provide benefits like reducing energy consumption, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Nanoscale materials show promise in preventing, detecting, and removing pollutants. Nanoscale materials, such as cerium oxide and iron nanoparticles, have been developed to reduce pollutants in diesel engine emissions, soil, and groundwater. Nanotechnology shows potential in improving disease diagnostics, monitoring, and treatment, with the National Cancer Institute investing in nanotechnology for cancer prevention and treatment. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has reissued a program focused on nanotechnology for cancer prevention and treatment. Nanoscale particles have unique properties that can be both beneficial and harmful, such as nanoscale silver being effective as an antibacterial agent but also raising concerns about potential toxicological and environmental effects. Some concerns exist regarding the widespread use of nanoscale silver in wound dressings and washing machines, as it may harm beneficial bacteria essential for waste water treatment and ecosystems. Nanoscale particles could potentially cross the blood-brain barrier, allowing for targeted drug delivery to treat conditions like brain tumors, but there are worries about unintended effects on the brain. Nanoscale particles have potential benefits in catalysis, groundwater treatment, and protective gear against chemical agents. However, concerns arise about their ability to pass through the blood-brain barrier and cause harm. Carbon nanotubes show promise in various applications but raise worries due to their potential similarity to asbestos fibers and risk of organ damage. Nanotechnology encompasses various scientific fields and engineering disciplines, with ongoing research on nanoscale phenomena. While nanomaterials have useful properties and commercial applications, there is a lack of information on their potential adverse effects on health and the environment. More research is needed to understand these implications. The 2006 National Research Council and the 2008 President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology reports highlighted the lack of information and tools for assessing potential nanotechnology EHS risks. Both reports concluded that it is not yet possible to rigorously assess the level of risk posed by engineered nanomaterials. Further research and development of risk assessment protocols are needed to enable assessment of potential EHS risks from nanomaterials. Research suggests that nanotechnology products may pose new risks to health and the environment, as nanoscale particles can reach inaccessible areas in the body and behave differently than larger particles. Leaders of the NNI emphasize the importance of addressing potential adverse effects to fully benefit from nanotechnology. Addressing societal and ethical issues is seen as essential to ensure technology advances human well-being. The NRC's third assessment of the NNI highlights the uncertainty surrounding EHS risks in nanotechnology, which could hinder innovation and commercialization. Concerns have been raised about the use of engineered nanomaterials in various products, posing a threat to investor, business, and consumer confidence. The nanotechnology industry faces regulatory uncertainty and concerns about potential health and environmental effects of engineered nanomaterials. A 2006 survey showed that many business leaders believe the risks of exposure to nano particles are unknown and stress the importance of government evaluation. The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies (PEN) has warned about the importance of addressing potential health effects and environmental risks associated with nanotechnology. EHS issues are crucial for those exposed to nanoscale materials, businesses, and investors for protecting human health, enabling risk assessments, and ensuring public confidence in safety. The U.S. regulatory environment for nanotechnology plays a crucial role in managing risks, ensuring safety, and fostering innovation for widespread economic and societal benefits. It aims to prevent negative consequences in different application areas, maintain public confidence, and enable the swift introduction of safe products into the market. This environment can attract investments and promote innovative activities in the United States compared to other nations. The U.S. regulatory environment for nanotechnology is crucial for managing risks, ensuring safety, and fostering innovation. If not handled effectively, it could hinder economic growth, job creation, and pose threats to health and the environment. This could drive investment capital away from nanotechnology, prevent the development of beneficial products, and lead to unsafe products entering the market. Alternatively, investments and production may shift to nations with more favorable regulatory environments. The U.S. regulatory environment for nanotechnology is crucial for managing risks, ensuring safety, and fostering innovation. If not handled effectively, it could hinder economic growth, job creation, and pose threats to health and the environment. This could drive investment capital away from nanotechnology, prevent the development of beneficial products, and lead to unsafe products entering the market. Alternatively, investments and production may shift to nations with more favorable regulatory environments. Regulatory systems can impact investors and companies, potentially causing the U.S. to miss out on economic benefits or increase EHS risks globally. Discussions on addressing nanotechnology EHS concerns focus on federal investment in research, regulation, and international engagement. Reliable EHS research is essential for regulatory bodies to determine how to regulate nanotechnology products. International coordination on EHS research for nanotechnology products is crucial to develop a common body of knowledge and inform regulatory decision-making. Regulations, standards, and enforcement may need to be coordinated worldwide to protect workers and consumers across global supply chains. The implications of one nation's policies on nanotechnology production, use, and disposal may affect nearby and all nations. There is no centralized source of EHS research funds allocated to individual agencies. In FY2010, NNI funding for EHS implications research was approximately $91.6 million, representing 5.1% of the total NNI budget. The decision process for funding nanotechnology EHS research is highly decentralized, with agency budgets developed internally and approved by the Office of Management and Budget. Coordination of EHS-research budget requests occurs through the NEHI working group and in OMB's budget development process. In FY2010, NNI funding for EHS implications research was $91.6 million, representing 5.1% of the total NNI budget. President Obama requested $116.9 million (6.6%) for EHS research in FY2011. NNI officials state that EHS research is also conducted as part of other research activities, not easily quantified in the reported figure for EHS funding. The division between nanotechnology research and EHS research is unproductive and neglects the benefits of research. Detailed reporting on the relevance to EHS of such research may hinder overall prioritization and coordination. Evidence of undercounting was seen in a one-time OMB request in 2007 for funding data related to EHS implications research. Research Needs for Engineered Nanoscale Materials. NNI agencies spent nearly twice as much on EHS research in FY2006 than previously reported. Critics argue that the current level of federal nanotechnology EHS research is too low. Executive branch officials stress that the United States leads the world in EHS funding. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and NNCO directors assert that the United States leads in nanotechnology EHS research funding, investing nearly $180 million from 2005 to 2008. Reviews by the NRC and PCAST recommend expanding federal EHS research funding for responsible nanotechnology development. The NRC and PCAST recommend expanding federal funding for nanotechnology EHS research to ensure responsible development. PCAST acknowledges the importance of adequate funding and appropriate accounting, emphasizing the need for expanded research and standardization in EHS protocols. Funding levels should grow in line with the needs identified in the NNI research strategy. PCAST emphasizes the importance of targeted funding for strategic nanotechnology EHS research over absolute dollar amounts. They recommend establishing a core of exploratory research into biological and environmental interactions with nanomaterials to address emerging EHS issues effectively. PCAST credits the NNI for substantial funding increases for agencies like NIOSH, EPA, FDA, and CPSC to ensure sufficient funds are available for mission-driven agencies. The FDA and CPSC will receive specific funds for nanotechnology for the first time, a move welcomed by the NNAP. Recommendations include allocating 10% of NNI funding for EHS research, which would have amounted to $178.1 million in FY2010, nearly double the reported level. Sean Murdock from the NanoBusiness Alliance supported this funding level in testimony before the House Committee on Science and Technology. Sean Murdock, executive director of the NanoBusiness Alliance, supports allocating 10% of NNI funding for EHS research, emphasizing the need for a clear research strategy and cross-agency flexibility. The Environmental Defense Fund has called for $100 million or more in federal nanotechnology EHS research funding, while PCAST has disagreed with fixed dollar amounts or minimum levels. In 2008, PCAST recommended strategic growth in nanotechnology EHS research funding based on scientifically determined priorities, cautioning against rapid increases. EHS research relies on advancements in non-EHS areas like instrumentation and nanomaterials. Some NGOs advocate for a more restrained approach to nanotechnology research and development. Some groups caution against the rapid development and commercialization of nanotechnology due to potential risks to human health and the environment. They advocate for the application of the precautionary principle and suggest a moratorium on certain products containing nanomaterials. The ETC Group has called for a moratorium on the commercial release of sunscreens, cosmetics, and personal care products containing engineered nanomaterials until safety studies are completed and regulations are in place. They also recommend a halt on nanotechnology R&D and commercial production of new nanomaterials due to concerns about nanoparticle contamination in living organisms. The ETC Group has proposed a moratorium on products containing synthetic nanoparticles until safety studies are completed. In contrast, the NSET Subcommittee believes that conducting EHS research alongside nanomaterial development will ensure safe nanotechnology advancement. Former Under Secretary of Commerce Phillip J. Bond argued against a halt in nanotechnology R&D, stating it would be unethical. The NRC recommended establishing research priorities for assessing the effects of engineered nanomaterials on public health and the environment. Effective methods need to be developed to estimate exposure and manage risks associated with exposure. In 2005, PCAST concluded that EHS research is essential for safe nanotechnology advancement. In 2005, PCAST emphasized the importance of prioritizing research on workplace exposure to nanomaterials due to the highest likelihood of exposure during manufacture. The 2008 assessment reiterated this point, highlighting the risks to workers but also acknowledging broader environmental, health, and safety risks that need to be addressed through research. The NSET published the Federal Strategy for EHS Research Needs for Engineered Nanoscale Materials in February 2008, outlining the NNI's EHS research strategy and identifying lead agencies for research areas. The NNI's EHS research strategy was outlined in the Federal Strategy for EHS Research Needs for Engineered Nanoscale Materials in 2008. The NRC independently reviewed this strategy document in 2009, commending the collaboration but noting research needs in risk management and exposure assessment were lacking. The NRC review criticized the NSET's approach to nanotechnology-related EHS research, stating that research needs were poorly defined, objectives were not measurable, and federal funding may be inadequate. The NRC suggested that agencies like NIH and NSF may need to modify their approaches to ensure effective EHS risk research. The NRC recommended a national strategic plan for EHS research involving various stakeholders to address research gaps effectively. This plan would focus on interdisciplinary solutions, set measurable objectives, and provide a timeline for implementation. Stakeholders have expressed the need for a multi-year roadmap to guide federal EHS research efforts. Stakeholders are advocating for a multi-year roadmap with specific milestones, metrics, and funding levels to enhance coordination in federal EHS research. NNI officials have developed an EHS research strategy but acknowledge the lack of a roadmap. Some Members of Congress are concerned about delays in producing a detailed implementation plan for NNI EHS research. Developing consensus among NNI agencies for a top-down approach to EHS research faces opposition due to doubts about practicality and efficacy. Some argue that committing to a multi-year, multi-agency roadmap with specific funding levels could impede flexibility in budget development and hinder response to new requirements or priorities. Funding redirection may affect roadmap milestones and metrics. Some experts suggest the National Academies create a roadmap to overcome obstacles in agency development. In contrast to the narrow focus of the particulate matter roadmap, nanotechnology requires EHS research efforts from multiple agencies. In 2007, various organizations requested $1 million for the development of a federal roadmap and research. The National Academies recommended $1 million for the development of a federal roadmap and research strategy on nanotechnology, to be carried out by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The Senate Appropriations Committee report urged the EPA to work with the National Academy of Sciences to develop a comprehensive research roadmap for all Federal agencies on environmental, health, and safety issues related to nanotechnology. In 2009, the National Academies' Board on Environmental Science and Toxicology initiated a project titled \"A Research Strategy for Environmental, Health, and Safety Aspects of Engineered Nanomaterials\" sponsored by the EPA. The project \"A Research Strategy for Environmental, Health, and Safety Aspects of Engineered Nanomaterials\" by the National Academies aims to produce two reports over four years. The first report, due 18 months from project inception, will present a conceptual framework, research priorities, monitoring strategy, and resource estimates. The second report, due at the end of the study period, will evaluate research progress and update priorities and resource estimates. Management concerns have been raised about the process used to develop research priorities and the federal EHS budget. The federal nanotechnology EHS research portfolio is influenced by research funding requests from individual agencies and decisions in the congressional appropriations process. Informal coordination among EHS funding agencies occurs through the NEHI working group and more formally through the OMB budget development process. PCAST recommended organizational changes to support cross-agency action on nanotechnology EHS issues, including creating a senior-level position at NNCO for interagency coordination. In 2010, NNCO established a Deputy Director and EHS Coordinator position to coordinate EHS research among NNI agencies. Some proponents advocate for a top-down approach in federal EHS research, with the Woodrow Wilson Center's Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies (PEN) leading the call. PEN's chief science advisor, Andrew Maynard, emphasized the need for a master plan to identify and reduce potential risks in nanotechnology. Recommendations include a top-down risk research strategy, increased funding for EHS, and empowering the NEHI working group to develop and implement the research plan. E. Clayton Teague, director of the NNCO, supported the idea of a centralized office for coordinated efforts. Dr. Teague argued before Congress against creating a centralized office with budgetary authority to oversee the NNI's EHS research program. He stated that such an office would have detrimental effects, as no single agency or organization could match the breadth of expertise and regulatory knowledge currently represented by the 20 agencies in the NEHI working group. Centralizing EHS research management would likely disconnect it from related efforts within NNI agencies and hinder interagency coordination. Additionally, creating a separate office could disincentivize mission agencies from conducting nanotechnology-related EHS research. Creating a separate centralized office for nanotechnology-related EHS research has been debated. Some argue that it could lead to a decrease in research levels or wasteful duplication of work. Andrew Maynard suggests a functional structure that allows agencies to work together effectively without the need for a centralized office. Leadership with authority to ensure resources are allocated appropriately is seen as essential for coordination and partnership among agencies. Several concerns have been raised about the adequacy of current laws and regulations to protect human health, safety, and the environment from potential adverse effects of nanotechnology. Market forces have accelerated global innovation, making it challenging for regulatory systems to keep up with technological advancements. Speed-to-market has become a key factor in competition due to new competitors, increased R&D investments, and greater scientific knowledge worldwide. The rapid growth in global markets and investments in technology has accelerated the pace of innovation, posing challenges to regulatory systems. Nanotechnology, in particular, faces unique regulatory challenges due to its potential use in various products and the different properties exhibited at the nanoscale. Regulatory agencies may need to adapt to consider these factors when defining materials. Nanotechnology presents unique regulatory challenges due to the different properties exhibited at the nanoscale. Questions arise about incorporating particle size into regulatory regimes and structuring an EHS research portfolio to address these concerns. Experts debate whether existing laws are sufficient for regulating nanotechnology products. Regulatory authorities and experts emphasize the need for appropriate mechanisms to address harmful effects of nanotechnology. Funding, coordination between agencies, establishment of metrics, and ongoing research are crucial for effective nanotechnology regulation. New laws or modifications may be necessary to ensure comprehensive regulation of nanotechnology products. J. Clarence Davies, senior advisor to the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies, argues that existing laws like the Toxic Substances Control Act and others are inadequate for regulating nanotechnology due to legal authority and resource limitations. This poses challenges in identifying and protecting the public from potential risks as nanotechnologies advance in complexity. A new law may be needed to manage potential risks of nanotechnology, requiring manufacturers to submit a sustainability plan to ensure products are safe. Nanotechnology, along with other advanced technologies, challenges traditional risk assessment methods, hampering regulatory effectiveness. Federal agencies responsible for environmental health and safety have eroded since 1980, unable to cope with new challenges in the 21st century. Davies proposed a Department of Environmental and Consumer Protection to address challenges in the 21st century. The agency would combine existing regulatory and science agencies and introduce new units for risk assessment, forecasting, technology assessment, health monitoring, and environmental statistics collection. He emphasized the need for new mechanisms and institutional capabilities to promote beneficial nanotechnology applications. Stability and predictability were highlighted as crucial for attracting investment and commercial applications. According to Matthew Nordan of Lux Research, uncertainty around regulations for nanoparticles is hindering commercialization. Companies seek clarity on how federal agencies like the EPA and OSHA will approach nanoparticles. Balancing the promotion of nanotechnology development, maintaining US competitiveness, addressing EHS concerns, and adapting to nanotechnology's regulatory challenges is crucial. Some suggest that health and safety research and regulation are needed to prevent obstacles to innovation. Some argue that health and safety research and regulation should keep pace with nanotechnology development to prevent potential hazards. Concerns have been raised about the lack of mandatory workplace measures to assess exposures and protect workers. Ian Illuminato and Bill Kojola emphasize the need for proper safeguards before rushing nanotechnology to market. The National Research Council and PCAST emphasize the need for additional EHS data before rushing nanotechnology products to market. Precautionary measures should be taken to protect workers, the public, and the environment. Regulatory decisions should balance the risks and benefits of nanotechnology products. PCAST emphasized that nanotechnology products should not face higher standards than non-nanotechnology products. They highlighted the responsibilities of manufacturers and sellers in ensuring workplace and product safety. The NNI plays a crucial role in supporting federal regulatory agencies with EHS research results. International engagement on EHS issues is seen as vital for responsible development and successful commercialization of nanotechnology. PCAST encouraged coordination with other nations to avoid duplication and leverage investments, emphasizing non-competitive collaboration. The NNI and its member agencies engage internationally in various nanotechnology-related areas, including standards, nomenclature, and EHS research. The Global Issues in Nanotechnology working group was established to monitor foreign programs, promote U.S. interests, and enhance international collaboration in R&D. Advocates believe international engagement can lead to benefits such as transparency in standards, assurance of global supply chains, and market confidence in nanotechnology products. Increased globalization of production and markets means companies rely on inputs from multiple suppliers in global supply chains. Transparent standards and regulations are crucial for ensuring the integrity of supply chains and final products, especially in nanotechnology where nanoscale particles can be incorporated undetected. This poses a unique challenge for producers and consumers in ensuring product reliability. Producers and consumers in the global supply chain of nanoscale materials rely on standards and regulatory systems to ensure product integrity. Without these, there may be additional costs for testing, substandard inputs, and potential loss of market confidence. International standards can improve research comparability, promote regulations for human health and environmental protection, and enhance global R&D collaboration. Global engagement in nanotechnology can lead to more effective R&D collaboration and accelerate economic and societal potential. It can establish a common environment for product development, promote access to global markets, and prevent nations from lowering standards to attract investments. Efforts to promote best practices in research, production, and disposal can protect human health and the environment worldwide. International engagement on EHS research may face challenges related to time and coordination. International engagement in EHS research may encounter obstacles such as time, cost, and perceived ineffectiveness. Some argue that swift action is necessary, but collaborations often progress slowly. Concerns exist about the U.S.'s dominant position in nanotechnology, leading to doubts about the value of international efforts and potential strain on resources. Opponents question the need for specific nanotechnology-focused engagement, citing existing mechanisms for sharing research and safety information globally. Some lack trust in the goodwill of international partners. Some may oppose international engagement efforts due to doubts about the goodwill of participating parties and concerns about national interests. In 2003, Phillip J. Bond questioned if calls to slow down nanotechnology R&D were to allow other nations to catch up. Companies and countries may be hesitant to share EHS concerns and research due to competitive reasons. Advocates and critics agree that addressing the environmental, health, and safety implications of nanotechnology is crucial for realizing its full benefits. There is a consensus that current knowledge on the effects of nanoscale materials is insufficient to manage potential risks. Despite the need for more EHS research, there are differing views on funding and management. Legislation in the 111th Congress aimed to address EHS-related issues. Legislation in the 111th Congress aimed to address EHS-related issues regarding nanotechnology, including bills such as H.R. 5116, H.R. 554, S. 1482, S. 2942, and H.R. 820. However, none of these bills were enacted. The 112th Congress may revisit the need for a national EHS research strategy to address knowledge gaps and determine which institutions should be involved in its development. The federal government is considering how to develop a national EHS research strategy for nanotechnology. Key questions include which institution(s) should lead, how much funding should be allocated, and how research should be prioritized and shared. Additionally, there is a discussion on the adequacy of existing laws and regulations in addressing EHS concerns related to nanotechnology. The federal government is evaluating the need for a national EHS research strategy for nanotechnology, including funding allocation and research prioritization. Questions arise about the adequacy of current regulations and coordination among regulatory agencies. International engagement and common standards are also being considered to promote responsible development. Congressional decisions on these issues could impact U.S. leadership in nanotechnology R&D and commercialization, societal benefits, public health, and environmental safety. The 111th Congress addressed nanotechnology EHS concerns through provisions in bills such as H.R. 5116 and H.R. 554. H.R. 5116, the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2010, made changes to the previous act, while H.R. 554, the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2009, was introduced earlier. The bill was passed in the House and referred to the Senate for further review. It aims to revise the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act, focusing on nanotechnology EHS concerns. Key provisions include the development of a public database of NNI EHS projects, establishment of the National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel, and assessment of societal and environmental impacts by a subpanel. The bill aims to address workforce concerns through the NNI, requiring evaluation of ethical, legal, environmental, and human health issues. It designates an associate director to oversee federal nanotechnology EHS activities and encourages public-private partnerships for EHS research. Interdisciplinary research centers under the NNI must include EHS research to develop environmentally friendly nanoscale products and processes. The National Nanotechnology Amendments Act of 2009 aims to transfer research results to industry, support standards setting bodies, and include environmental, health, and safety education in nanotechnology education efforts. Introduced in the 111th Congress, the bill expands the scope of the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act. The National Nanotechnology Amendments Act of 2009 aims to expand the National Nanotechnology Program (NNP) by involving the industrial community in developing nanoscale technologies. It requires coordination of research on the environmental and safety risks of nanoparticles, guidance on transitioning research to commercial products, and funding support from participating agencies. The National Nanotechnology Amendments Act of 2009 expands the NNP by involving the industrial community in developing nanoscale technologies. It authorizes appropriations for NIST and NSF to develop nanotechnology standards and maintain a public information database of NNP projects. It establishes the NNAP as a distinct entity to address societal, ethical, legal, and environmental concerns related to nanotechnology. It also requires the designation of a coordinator for societal dimensions of nanotechnology within OSTP. The Nanotechnology Safety Act of 2010 directs the NSTC to establish an Education Working Group for EHS researchers, supports nanotechnology R&D in various national areas, and addresses ethical, legal, and societal issues related to nanotechnology. The Nanotechnology Advancement and New Opportunities Act, H.R. 820 (111th Congress), requires the establishment of a program for investigating nanoscale materials in FDA-regulated products. It authorizes $25 million per year for fiscal years 2011 to 2015 and mandates the NNCO to produce an annual research strategy for nanotechnology development and stewardship. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plays a key role in regulating nanotechnology, conducting research and asserting the need for more information to assess potential EHS impacts of engineered nanoscale materials. Critics raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest among regulatory agencies involved in both promoting nanotechnology research and regulating its applications. The EPA conducts research to assess risks of nanoscale materials in the environment, coordinating federal efforts and collaborating with international organizations on regulatory issues. The EPA is involved in nanotechnology regulatory issues, governed by statutes like the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, FIFRA, and TSCA. Key issues revolve around TSCA, requiring producers of new materials to provide premanufacture notifications to EPA for approval or restrictions. Several NGOs have urged EPA to consider all nanoscale materials \"new\" regardless of whether the material is on the EPA inventory list in its bulk form. Nanotechnology materials with the same chemical composition as those already in commerce raise questions about whether they are \"new\" and subject to PMN requirements. FIFRA may offer EPA more authority to regulate nanotechnology than TSCA, especially when nanomaterials are intended to control pests. The EPA has the authority to assess pesticide risks regardless of use under FIFRA. A washing machine with nanoscale silver ions was regulated as a pesticide under FIFRA, but claims of its effectiveness have been removed from advertisements. EPA's role in regulating nanotechnology was reviewed in May 2010. The EPA has the authority to regulate nanotechnology products as pesticides under FIFRA. The FDA is responsible for regulating various products incorporating nanotechnology, such as cosmetics, medical devices, foods, drugs, and combination products. The FDA focuses on the statutory classification of products rather than the technology they use. The FDA may not regulate nanotechnology products until after initial development, with critics questioning its limited authority. FDA believes existing requirements may suffice for most nanotechnology products, as they are similar in size to cells and molecules. The agency has no reports of adverse reactions related to the \"nano\" size of medical products. The FDA may need new tests or requirements for resorbable drug or medical device products due to potential risks from new materials or manufacturing techniques. Consumer groups argue that FDA's resources are insufficient to address safety concerns of emerging technologies, especially for products like cosmetics and dietary supplements. FDA conducts research on nanomaterials and collaborates with NIEHS on studies, but there is currently no international regulation of nanoproducts. The FDA collaborates with NIEHS on nanotechnology research, as there is no international regulation of nanoproducts. NIEHS conducts EHS research to support regulatory agencies like the National Toxicology Program. The NTP established the Nanotechnology Safety Initiative (NSI) in 2006 to research potential health hazards of nanoscale materials, focusing on non-medical, commercially relevant nanoscale materials like cosmetics and sunscreens. The Nanotechnology Safety Initiative (NSI) researches potential health hazards of nanoscale materials like cosmetics, sunscreens, metal oxides, quantum dots, fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, nanoscale silver, and nanoscale gold. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) ensures worker safety by setting and enforcing standards, providing training, and establishing partnerships. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducts research and provides guidance on the occupational safety and health implications of nanotechnology. NIOSH collaborates with OSHA and other regulatory agencies to develop new risk management approaches for worker safety. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducts research on ultrafine particles like welding fumes and diesel particulates. NIOSH has developed guidelines for working with nanomaterials and maintains a Nanoparticle Information Library. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is responsible for protecting the public from risks of injury or death from consumer products, including nanomaterials. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) does not require pre-market registration or approval of products, assessing potential safety risks of nanomaterials under existing statutes. CPSC approved a nanotechnology statement in 2005 highlighting challenges in exposure and risk assessment strategies for nanomaterials in consumer products. Regulatory challenges include identifying specific nanomaterials, characterizing materials during product use, and applying toxicological data. The CPSC does not require pre-market registration or approval of products containing nanomaterials. They face challenges in assessing potential safety risks due to the wide variation in health effects and lack of exposure data for specific nanomaterials."
