Congress acknowledges the significant role of nuclear energy in the United States, generating 20% of total electricity and 60% of carbon-free electricity. Nuclear power plants operate efficiently, providing reliable and affordable electricity while contributing billions to the economy and creating high-paying jobs. The commercial nuclear industry is crucial for national security and must maintain its leadership in the global market. The development of advanced nuclear reactor designs is crucial for maintaining the nation's nuclear fleet and expanding the use of new technologies. Nuclear fusion technology shows promise in generating electricity with increased safety and no radioactive waste. A performance-based regulatory framework is needed to support the progress of advanced reactor designs through Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"advanced nuclear reactor\" refers to a nuclear fission reactor with significant improvements or a nuclear fusion reactor. The term \"Department\" means the Department of Energy. \"Licensing\" refers to NRC activities related to reviewing applications for licenses, permits, and design certifications for nuclear reactors. The NRC, defined as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, operates under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The term \"National Laboratory\" is defined in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. SEC. 4. AGENCY COORDINATION. The NRC and the Department will establish a memorandum of understanding on technical expertise, modeling and simulation, and facilities for advanced reactor technology. The Department will maintain facilities for civilian nuclear industry research and development of safe reactor technology, ensuring access for the NRC as needed. The Department will report to Congress on its activities related to civilian nuclear industry research and safe reactor technology. The Department will submit a report to Congress within 180 days of the enactment of the Act, assessing its capabilities to oversee privately funded experimental reactors. The report will address safety review, oversight capabilities, and regulatory options for these reactors. The report to Congress will assess the Department's ability to oversee privately funded experimental reactors, including safety review, oversight capabilities, regulatory options, potential sites, contractual mechanisms, government liability for waste disposal, impact on waste inventory, and cost structures. The Secretary will update relevant provisions of the report every 2 years and submit it to specific committees in Congress. SEC. 6. ADVANCED REACTOR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. The NRC must provide a plan for developing an efficient, risk-informed framework for advanced reactor licensing within 1 year of this Act. The plan will address unique aspects, legal issues, and options for licensing advanced reactors under existing regulations. The NRC regulations in title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations propose a new regulatory framework for advanced reactor licensing. Options include expediting and streamlining the licensing process, incorporating consensus-based codes and standards, and making the licensing framework more predictable. The NRC is evaluating milestones, phased review processes, policy modifications, licensing of advanced reactors, and cost-sharing financial structures for advanced reactor licensing. The NRC is seeking input from stakeholders to develop a plan for advanced reactor regulatory framework implementation by September 30, 2019. The plan will include cost estimates, budgets, and milestones. Additionally, the NRC will provide updates on design certification status and performance metrics in budget requests. The budget request must address any schedule delays, including those caused by NRC resource constraints for design certification reviews. SEC. 7. USER FEES AND ANNUAL CHARGES. Amendment to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 regarding appropriations for activities related to advanced nuclear reactor technologies."
