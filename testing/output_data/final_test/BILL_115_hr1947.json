    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund Act of 2017\". It includes findings related to religious freedom. Congress acknowledges the inalienable right to free exercise of religion, protected by the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Many immigrants, including Quakers, Mennonites, and Church of the Brethren members, came to America to escape persecution for their pacifist beliefs. However, during World War I, hundreds of conscientious objectors were imprisoned and mistreated for their refusal to participate in warfare. During the Second World War, \"alternative civilian service\" was established as an option for conscientious objectors in lieu of military service. This policy has a long-standing tradition in the United States, dating back to colonial times, and has been expanded through subsequent case law. Thousands of conscientious objectors have utilized this option since the Second World War. During the Second World War, conscientious objectors provided essential staff for mental hospitals, volunteered for medical experiments, and served the national health and safety interests. They sought legal relief from government seizure of their property and objected to war participation based on moral, ethical, or religious beliefs, with no provision for alternative service for taxpayers. The Joint Committee on Taxation has certified that a tax trust fund for conscientious objector taxpayers would increase Federal revenues. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Designated Conscientious Objector refers to a taxpayer opposed to war based on moral, ethical, or religious beliefs, certified in writing to the Secretary of the Treasury.
