    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rights for Transportation Security Officers Act of 2016\". Congress passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) after the 9/11 terrorist attacks to enhance security screening in the aviation system and establish the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) as a new Federal agency responsible for screening. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act allowed the TSA Administrator to set employment standards, pay, and benefits for screening workforce. TSA has applied this to most Transportation Security Officers performing screening functions. In November 2006, the International Labor Organization ruled that the Bush Administration violated international labor law by prohibiting Transportation Security Officers from collective bargaining. After the Federal Labor Relations Board approved a petition for an exclusive representative election, TSA Administrator John Pistole emphasized the importance of every TSA employee having a voice and feeling safe to raise concerns. The February 4, 2011 determination regarding collective bargaining for Transportation Security Officers was superseded by a second Determination on December 29, 2014, which resulted in limitations on bargaining subjects and barriers to union representation. TSA cited authority under section 44935 note of title 59, United States Code, to create a personnel system that denies the same rights as title 5. The Transportation Security Officer workforce has the same title 5 rights as other Federal workers, including the right to appeal adverse personnel decisions, fair pay, access to earned leave, and protections against employment discrimination. Congress believes that the personnel system used by the Transportation Security Administration lacks sufficient workplace protections. The Transportation Security Officer workforce, responsible for securing the aviation system, lacks sufficient workplace protections under title 5, United States Code.
