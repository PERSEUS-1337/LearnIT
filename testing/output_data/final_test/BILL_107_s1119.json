The Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve of the Armed Forces is crucial for quickly augmenting active duty forces in times of crisis. They have taken on increasingly critical responsibilities since the Cold War, serving proudly in various theaters worldwide. The active duty forces rely on the Selected Reserve for successful national security missions. The Selected Reserve plays a vital role in augmenting the Armed Forces during crises. The high tempo of Selected Reserve activities causes disruptions in members' relationships with their families, employers, and reserve units. Family turbulence arises from lengthy absences for military duties, leading to challenges in healthcare coverage for families. Up to 200,000 Selected Reserve members, including self-employed individuals, lack adequate healthcare options. Up to 200,000 Selected Reserve members, including self-employed individuals, lack adequate healthcare options. Congress believes steps should be taken to ensure health care benefits for members of the Selected Reserve of the Armed Forces and their families to ease transition to military life, minimize adverse effects of mobilization, and improve readiness and retention. Additionally, a study on health care benefits coverage for Selected Reserve members is proposed. The Secretary of Defense is required to contract a study on the health care needs of Selected Reserve members and their families. A report with details on current health care coverage and reasons for lack of insurance must be submitted to Congress by March 1, 2002. The study on the health care needs of Selected Reserve members and their families must include descriptions of disruptions in health benefits coverage, recommended options for cost-effective solutions, a health status profile of beneficiaries, and estimated costs for extending health care benefits. The study will analyze the effects of providing enhanced health benefits coverage to the Selected Reserve and their families on recruitment, retention, and readiness. Options may include expanding the TRICARE or Federal Employees Health Benefits program to cover this population."
