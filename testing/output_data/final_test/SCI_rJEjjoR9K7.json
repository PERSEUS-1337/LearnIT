    "content": "Despite strong performance on holdout data, deep neural networks are vulnerable to distribution shifts. Changes in image background or texture can disrupt classifiers. To address this, a classifier is being developed to generalize across unseen domains without domain identifiers during training. The model must distinguish between distribution-specific and distribution-agnostic signals. The gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is used to extract superficial patterns sensitive to texture but not image gestalt. Two techniques are introduced to enhance out-of-sample performance. Two techniques are introduced to improve networks' out-of-sample performance. The first method utilizes the reverse gradient method to learn unpredictable representations. The second method involves projecting the model's representation onto a subspace orthogonal to the GLCM representation. In testing our method on standard domain generalization datasets, we achieve comparable or better performance without requiring samples from the target distribution for training. The goal is to train image classifiers that are robust to distribution shift, such as covariate and label shift. Under restrictive assumptions, principled methods exist for estimating shifts and retraining under the importance-weighted ERM framework. Some papers bound worst-case performance under bounded shifts as measured by divergence measures on train vs. test distributions. Despite many impossibility results for domain adaptation, humans show remarkable ability to function out-of-sample. An example illustrates distribution shift with correlated sentiment labels in training and validation sets, but independent in testing set. The paper focuses on reducing the model's dependence on superficial aspects in visual applications, specifically high-frequency textural information. The goal is to make the model rely more on essential differences in data, rather than irrelevant details like background or coloring changes. The contribution of the paper lies in this shift towards prioritizing meaningful differences in data for better generalization. The paper introduces a new neural network block to capture textural information from images without relying on lower-frequency semantic details. It also presents a method to discard superficial information and introduces challenging synthetic datasets for domain adaptation/generalization studies. In video sentiment analysis, data sources vary within the same dataset due to heterogeneous sources and collection practices. Domain adaptation and transfer learning have been studied extensively, with techniques ranging from kernel methods to deep learning approaches. The curr_chunk discusses techniques for adapting representations across different domains using adversarial methods, ensembles of deep models, and metalearning. It introduces a new neural building block, NGLCM, designed to capture textural information from images without semantic details. The goal is to exclude semantic information while extracting textural features. Classic computer vision techniques were consulted for this work. The curr_chunk discusses the design of a new neural network building block inspired by gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) for extracting textural features from images. The block's parameters are differentiable and tunable through backpropagation, resembling GLCM but with a focus on textural information rather than semantic details. The text discusses a neural network building block inspired by GLCM for extracting textural features from images. Parameters are tunable through backpropagation, with a focus on textural information. The design involves generating vectors and matrices to count pixel pairs efficiently. The design involves generating matrices to count pixel pairs efficiently in a neural network inspired by GLCM for extracting textural features from images. Parameters are tunable through backpropagation, focusing on textural information. The neural network architecture incorporates different components to learn raw data and textural representations for classification. By introducing a new architecture with g(\u00b7; \u03c6), the final classification layer combines both representations to improve prediction accuracy. The goal is to make predictions independent of superficial representations captured by g(\u00b7; \u03c6). The neural network architecture combines raw data and textural representations for classification, aiming to improve prediction accuracy by making predictions independent of superficial representations. Different heuristics, such as adversarial training and information-theoretic regularization, have been proposed to enhance the network's ability to \"forget\" certain parts of a representation. One proposed solution involves training F P to predict semantic labels while ensuring invariance to F G, referred to as ADV. Another approach involves using a multilayer perceptron to predict g(X; \u03c6) from h(X; \u03b8) and updating the primary model to deceive the MLP via reverse gradient, known as ADVE. Additionally, a simple alternative method is introduced based on the idea of affine transformations. The ADVE method introduces a simple alternative approach based on affine transformations in an affine space. It involves projecting representation A with a projection matrix constructed by representation B to find the least explainable transformation. Parameters can be trained simultaneously, and in testing, F P is used. The method, referred to as HEX, has alternative forms and additional topics are discussed in the Appendix. During training, an extra hyperparameter (\u03bb) can be tuned through DISPLAYFORM3 to ensure the NGLCM component learns relevant representations. During testing, F L can be used, but it slows down the process. Experimentation with different forms showed no significant performance differences, so the fastest method was adopted. It is important to normalize textural and raw data representations in every minibatch for HEX to work effectively. Experiments were conducted to evaluate HEX's resilience against dataset shift. In a series of experiments, the resilience of HEX against dataset shift was evaluated. Different testings were conducted on NGLCM and HEX separately, followed by evaluation on synthetic datasets with dataset shift at semantic and raw feature levels. Ablation tests were performed on synthetic datasets, comparing different configurations of HEX. Additionally, comparisons were made with other domain generalization methods. The NGLCM method was compared with other domain generalization methods, including DANN and information-dropout. Training was done on multiple digit recognition datasets, and the NGLCM was found to be less effective in recognizing semantic labels compared to MLP. The accuracy of predicting digits and domains was tested using Na\u00efve Bayes classifier over 100 epochs, showing comparable performance between MLP and NGLCM in extracting textural information. The effectiveness of HEX was tested using SURF BID2 and GLCM BID24 features from the office dataset. A two-layer MLP baseline was used with SURF features, then the GLCM part was added with an extra network layer. The model was trained and validated on two subsets and tested on the third subset of the Office dataset (Webcam, Amazon, DSLR). Five experiments were conducted, and the averaged accuracy was reported. The effectiveness of HEX was tested on the Office dataset using SURF BID2 and GLCM BID24 features. Five experiments were conducted, and the results showed that HEX outperformed the baseline in the {W , D} \u2192 A setting due to the distribution of features in the datasets. The study involved generating a synthetic dataset with animated individuals expressing different sentiments and attaching various backgrounds to the images to introduce data shift. The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets, with backgrounds correlated with sentiment labels in training and validation sets but independent in the testing set. The images were formatted to 28x28 grayscale, and experiments were initially run with a baseline CNN to tune hyperparameters. The study involved training a baseline CNN with hyperparameters tuned over 100 epochs. Results compared different methods' testing accuracy on synthetic datasets with varying correlations. Adv and HEX showed stable performance as correlations increased, while M deteriorated faster. The study demonstrated that HEX and ADV improved convergence speed and overcame tendencies of CNNs to learn surface statistical regularities. By attaching different regularities into images, HEX showed the ability to preserve high-level semantics while training on MNIST datasets. The study compared the performance of different methods in attaching surface patterns to images for training and testing. Results showed that when patterns were attached independently, method M performed the best, but when attached dependently, methods N and HEX performed better. In the most challenging case, HEX showed a clear advantage and behaved more stable overall. HEX showed a clear advantage and behaved more stable overall compared to other state-of-the-art DG methods on popular DG datasets like MNIST-rotation. The study compared HEX with methods like CAE, MTAE, CCSA, DANN, Fusion, LabelGrad, and CrossGrad, showing HEX's performance was only inferior in one case. Results in Table 3 show that HEX outperforms previous methods overall on the PACS dataset BID26, which includes images of seven objects across four domains. To address optimization challenges, a heuristic training approach was used with AlexNet, resulting in improved performance with minimal training time. HEX/ADV was compared with other methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in domain generalization tasks. HEX/ADV was compared with other methods on the PACS dataset, showing impressive performance close to Fusion. Fusion, a larger model than HEX, combines representations from three AlexNets for prediction. Despite its smaller size, HEX achieves high performance, especially in the Art painting domain. HEX achieves high performance in Art painting and Cartoon domains, while Fusion excels in Photo and Sketch prediction. Novel components NGLCM and HEX are introduced to extract textural and semantic information from images. Limitations include NGLCM not being completely free of semantic information, leading to garbage information learning on standard MNIST dataset. Training heuristics were invented to address these limitations, but results were not reported to simplify methods. Fluctuations in HEX training performance were also observed. Despite fluctuations in training performance, the model with the highest validation accuracy outperforms other methods. Impressive results were achieved on synthetic and popular DG datasets. Experimentation with classical computer vision techniques (SURF, LBP, GLCM) was conducted on various datasets to extract textural information. The text discusses transforming the representation of F A to minimize correlation with F G using linear regression. The goal is to solve a standard linear regression problem to regress the information of F G out of F A. The text discusses solving a regression problem to minimize correlation between F A and F G using linear regression. The closed form solution is derived when the minibatch size is greater than the number of classes. To ensure a solution with HEX, a minibatch size greater than the number of classes is recommended. To ensure invertibility of F T G F G, a method is introduced by adding a smaller number to the diagonal, resulting in F T G F G + \u03bbI. The algorithm aims to be hyperparameter-free, with \u03bb being a tunable parameter. The Kailath Variant BID5 offers a solution where \u03bb can be estimated through maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), even when F T G F G is not invertible. However, MLE procedure is slow in practice. The MLE procedure for estimating F T G F G + \u03bbI is slow in practice. To address this, users can choose a larger minibatch size. The main method, \"HEX,\" is named after heteroscedastic regression. Testing accuracy in facial expression classification shows HEX converges faster than baseline methods. MNIST images with different kernel patterns are also provided. MNIST images with various kernel patterns are shown following BID21, as depicted in FIG5."
