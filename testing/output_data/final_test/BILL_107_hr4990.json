The Congress finds that legitimate Internet sellers of prescription drugs offer benefits such as convenience, privacy, competitive prices, and personalized services. Unlawful Internet sellers may dispense inappropriate or counterfeit drugs, posing health risks to consumers. Consumers struggle to differentiate between legitimate and unlawful online sellers. Unlawful Internet sellers, both foreign and domestic, offer prescription drugs. SEC. 503B. INTERNET PRESCRIPTION DRUG SALES. Definitions for this section include the meaning of 'consumer' as a person buying prescription drugs online, 'home page' as the main page of a website, and 'Internet' as the global network of interconnected computers and telecommunications. An interstate Internet seller is defined as a person, whether in the US or abroad, who sells prescription drugs online and delivers them directly to consumers in a different state via the Postal Service or a carrier. This definition excludes carriers who only deliver the drugs. The term 'interstate Internet seller' excludes individuals within 75 miles of the consumer. 'Link' refers to a marker on a web page that redirects to another part of the Internet. 'Pharmacy' is any licensed place, and 'prescriber' is an authorized individual. Interstate Internet sellers must comply with requirements for selling prescription drugs online, including the definition of prescription drugs and valid prescriptions. The terms \"web site\" and \"site\" refer to specific locations on the Internet. Interstate Internet sellers must display specific information on their website, including their business address, telephone number, and state licenses or authorizations as a pharmacy. Interstate Internet sellers must provide detailed information on their website, including the names and addresses of prescribers, their state licenses, and a statement that prescription drugs will only be dispensed with a valid prescription. Interstate Internet sellers must post required information on their website within 90 days of the effective date or on the first day of operation. They cannot imply that the government has endorsed them. Additionally, they must disclose information to state licensing boards. Interstate Internet sellers must disclose their business information to state licensing boards, and the Secretary is authorized to issue necessary regulations for compliance. Interstate Internet sellers must disclose business information to state licensing boards, including defining a 'place of business' as a single location where employees work, not a post office box. Prohibited acts include failing to post required information or making false statements. SEC. 913. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will educate the public on the risks of buying prescription drugs from illegal online sources. SEC. 914. A report with recommendations for coordinating regulatory activities on interstate Internet sellers operating from foreign countries will be submitted to Congress within 180 days of this Act's enactment. SEC. 915. The amendments made by this subtitle will take effect 1 year after the date of enactment, with the Secretary of Health and Human Services authorized to begin rulemaking immediately."
