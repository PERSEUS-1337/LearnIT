The U.S. had been working to strengthen ties with Cambodia, but Hun Sen's actions led to the banning of the main opposition party in 2017. The ruling party won all seats in the 2018 election, which the Trump Administration criticized for not reflecting the will of the Cambodian people. The 2018 election in Cambodia was criticized for not representing the will of the people and being a setback to democracy. Cambodia has a history of political turmoil, including the Khmer Rouge regime and civil war. The Paris Peace Agreement in 1991 aimed to establish a liberal democracy with genuine elections. Hun Sen, aged 65, has been the country's leader. Hun Sen, aged 65, has been Cambodia's leader for over 30 years, employing undemocratic means to maintain power despite some democratic progress since the Peace Accords. He has strengthened his political control through various tactics including electoral victories, manipulation of institutions, and intimidation. Before the 2018 national elections in Cambodia, the Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP) led by Sam Rainsy and Kem Sokha made significant gains in previous elections, leading to increased competitiveness with the ruling party. Observers noted fewer irregularities in the 2017 elections compared to 2013, partly due to assistance from Japan and the European Union. The 2018 national elections in Cambodia saw the ruling party maintaining support in rural areas, while the opposition CNRP gained strength among a younger, more globalized electorate concerned about corruption and inequality. The CNRP was dissolved by the Supreme Court in 2017 for allegedly conspiring with the United States. The CNRP was dissolved by the Supreme Court in 2017 for allegedly conspiring with the United States to overthrow the government. The government banned 118 CNRP members from politics for five years and replaced opposition seats with third parties, mostly FUNCINPEC. Laws were amended to remove CNRP commune councilors and village chiefs, replacing them with CPP members. Former CNRP president Sam Rainsy faced defamation charges and spent most of his time in self-imposed exile. In December 2017, Sam Rainsy was charged with treason for a social media video urging security personnel not to obey orders to shoot innocent people. Kem Sokha was detained for treason from September 2017 to September 2018, accused of collaborating with the United States. He was released on bail and placed under house arrest in September 2018. The U.S. Embassy called for dropping charges against Sokha and engaging in national reconciliation. The Cambodian government imposed restrictions on NGOs and political activism leading up to the 2018 elections. Opposition members and critics were arrested or fled the country from 2015-2017. The government expelled the National Democratic Institute in 2017, alleging involvement in a conspiracy. Multiple Cambodian radio stations were closed by the government. In 2017, Cambodian government closed radio stations selling airtime to VOA and RFA, shut down opposition newspaper Cambodia Daily, and arrested individuals under l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law. Congress has imposed conditions on U.S. assistance to promote democracy and human rights in Cambodia. In 2017, the Cambodian government closed radio stations selling airtime to VOA and RFA, shut down the opposition newspaper Cambodia Daily, and arrested individuals under l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law. Congress imposed conditions on U.S. assistance to promote democracy and human rights in Cambodia. The Trump Administration withdrew $1.8 million in assistance to the National Election Committee (NEC) in response to recent suppression of the opposition by Hun Sen. The House Committee on Foreign Affairs held a hearing on U.S. policy options to promote democracy and human rights in Cambodia. The Senate passed S.Res. 279 urging the Department of the Treasury to consider blocking the assets of senior Cambodian government officials. The Department of the Treasury is considering blocking assets of senior Cambodian government officials involved in suppressing democracy and human rights abuses. The Trump Administration announced restrictions on entry into the U.S. for individuals undermining democracy in Cambodia. Sanctions were imposed on Cambodian General Hing Bun Hieng for serious human rights abuses. Sanctioned individuals are denied entry into the U.S. and their assets in the country are frozen. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 imposed conditions on U.S. assistance to Cambodia related to democracy and regional security. In the 116th Congress, bills were introduced to address Cambodia's participation in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences program and to impose visa restrictions on Cambodian government officials undermining democracy. Some policy experts argue that continued U.S. engagement is crucial for promoting democratization in Cambodia and countering Chinese influence. Prime Minister Hun Sen criticized powerful nations for using human rights as a pretext for interference during a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2018. U.S.-Cambodian relations improved after 2007, leading to expanded cooperation. After 2007, U.S. engagement in Cambodia included foreign assistance programs, demining activities, limited military assistance, MIA recovery efforts, and naval port visits. In 2017, Cambodia suspended the Angkor Sentinel military exercise and postponed a U.S. humanitarian mission without explanation, leading to speculation of distancing from the United States. In January 2019, U.S. Department of Defense Deputy Assistant Secretary for South and Southeast Asia Joseph H. Felter met with Cambodian military officials in Phnom Penh to discuss regional security issues and bilateral cooperation. Felter also urged the Cambodian government to drop treason charges against Kem Sokha. Postwar Cambodia has heavily relied on foreign assistance, with Official Development Assistance (ODA) totaling $797 million in 2016. Foreign assistance to Cambodia, particularly Official Development Assistance (ODA), has decreased significantly over the past decade-and-a-half. ODA fell from 120% of central government expenditures in 2002 to less than a third in 2015. The effectiveness of ODA in curbing authoritarian tendencies in Cambodia has been questioned, with some analysts suggesting that assistance from China, which comes without conditions for good governance and human rights, has matched or exceeded assistance from major ODA providers. The United States provided $79.3 million in foreign assistance to Cambodia in FY2018, a 10% decrease from FY2017. The Trump Administration's FY2019 foreign operations budget request would reduce annual assistance to Cambodia by nearly 75% compared to FY2017. The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC), an international tribunal, began proceedings in 2006 to try Khmer Rouge leaders for violations of national and international law. The ECCC, funded by the Cambodian government and foreign donations, convicted Khmer Rouge leaders. The U.S. initially withheld assistance due to concerns about court independence but later contributed to an international trust fund. Additionally, the U.S. supported the Documentation Center of Cambodia with $9.8 million since 2005. The ECCC, funded by the Cambodian government and foreign donations, convicted Khmer Rouge leaders. Some U.S. foreign operations appropriations measures have placed conditions on assistance to the tribunal to discourage corruption and political interference. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 states that no assistance may be made available for the ECCC. ECCC prosecutors charged five former Khmer Rouge leaders with crimes against humanity and war crimes, resulting in life sentences for some. In November 2018, Khmer Rouge leaders were convicted of crimes, including genocide. Hun Sen opposed further indictments, citing national stability concerns. Cambodia is heavily contaminated by unexploded ordnance from past conflicts. Cambodia has been heavily contaminated by 2.7 million tons of ordnance, mostly cluster munitions, causing over 64,000 UXO casualties since 1979. The economic costs include land unusable for agriculture and disruptions to water supplies. Despite international assistance, 761 square miles of the country remain contaminated. The UXO casualty rate has decreased from 250 to about 100 annually, with 50% of contaminated land cleared. The Cambodian Mine Action Authority is finalizing plans for further clearance efforts. The Cambodian Mine Action Authority is working to clear all contaminated land by 2025, with a recent spike in casualties due to poor Cambodians migrating to high UXO areas. The U.S. government has contributed over $124 million for UXO removal and survivor assistance programs in Cambodia. USAID's Leahy War Victims Fund supports medical services for UXO victims. Congress allocated funds for demining efforts in Cambodia. Over 1,900 U.S. residents of Cambodian descent, including those with felony convictions, are at risk of deportation. Between 2002 and 2017, around 600 Cambodian nationals who were permanent U.S. residents and convicted of felony crimes were deported to Cambodia. Many of them arrived in the U.S. as refugee children in the 1980s and have jobs and families in the U.S. The number of deportations of Cambodian, Laotian, and Vietnamese nationals has increased under the Trump Administration, with 110 U.S. residents of Cambodian descent deported in 2018. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency placed Cambodia on a list of \"recalcitrant countries\" due to hindering deportation efforts. Limited visa restrictions were imposed on Cambodian Foreign Ministry employees and their families. Cambodia has shown economic growth driven by foreign investment in various sectors. Cambodia's economy is driven by foreign investment, particularly from China, Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asian countries. The garment industry, mainly operated by companies from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, employs 800,000 workers and contributes 40% to the GDP. Cambodia has seen significant growth in textile exports, with garment and footwear products making up 80% of merchandise exports. However, economic development has led to social and environmental issues, including land displacement of hundreds of thousands of Cambodians for agricultural, mining, and logging purposes. Cambodia has high deforestation rates due to illegal logging driven by demand from China and Vietnam. Labor relations have strained, especially in the garment industry, leading to large-scale demonstrations for higher wages in 2013-2014. The government imposed restrictions on labor rights with a new Law on Trade Unions in 2016. In 2017, a national minimum wage law was announced. In 2017, Cambodia announced a national minimum wage law to boost labor support for the CPP. U.S.-Cambodia bilateral trade was valued at $3.46 billion, with the U.S. being the largest single overseas market for Cambodian exports. Over half of U.S. imports from Cambodia in 2017 were knitted or crocheted clothing. Some Cambodian products receive preferential tariff treatment under the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences program. Policymakers have considered suspending GSP treatment on certain Cambodian exports worth $400 million annually to pressure Hun Sen on democracy issues. Cambodia's economy is closely tied to trade agreements, including its membership in the World Trade Organization and ASEAN Free Trade Area. The country is also involved in negotiations for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. China has become Cambodia's main economic supporter, especially as other donors criticize Hun Sen's authoritarian rule. China's economic support has reduced the influence of Western aid donors on Cambodia, allowing Hun Sen more political flexibility. Cambodia is seen as China's closest ally in Southeast Asia, with China providing significant financial assistance and holding a large portion of Cambodia's external debt. China's foreign assistance to Cambodia, including development financing, infrastructure projects, and investments in various sectors, has become a dominant influence on the Kingdom's development. China is the largest foreign investor in Cambodia, with investments ranging from $14 billion to $16 billion. Chinese investments have brought economic benefits, but Cambodians have mixed views on China's economic influence. Chinese investments in Cambodia have led to economic benefits but raised concerns about project quality, environmental impact, and lack of transparency. Many Cambodians have been displaced for Chinese-backed projects, causing social unrest. Hydropower projects driven by Chinese demand have raised fears of environmental degradation, loss of fish stocks, and displacement of communities. Chinese firms have invested $2 billion in seven dams in Cambodia, sparking warnings from experts about adverse effects on livelihoods. The proposed Chinese-backed 2,600-megawatt Sambor Dam on the Mekong River would have devastating impacts on food security in Cambodia and Vietnam. It would block fish migrations, destroy habitats, and prevent sediment flow downstream. China has provided military assistance to Cambodia, including loans, equipment, education, and training for the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces. China has provided military education, training, and sponsored exchanges with Cambodia, including joint military exercises like Golden Dragon involving PLA and RCAF soldiers. This cooperation is seen as a response to growing security ties between the US and Vietnam."
