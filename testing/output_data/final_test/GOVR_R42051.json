    "content": "President Obama ordered the sequestration of $85.33 billion in FY2013 budgetary resources from nonexempt budget accounts across the federal government on March 1, 2013. This sequestration was pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, as amended by the Budget Control Act of 2011. It was initially scheduled for January 2, 2013, but was delayed by two months due to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. This was the first of a series of automatic spending reductions required each year through FY2021, triggered by the failure to enact legislation to reduce the deficit by $1.2 trillion over FY2012-FY2021. The FY2013 sequestration requires significant reductions in defense and nondefense spending, impacting various programs including Medicare. Policymakers are concerned about the effects on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which mandates health insurance coverage for most U.S. residents starting in 2014. The Affordable Care Act mandates health insurance coverage for residents or pay a penalty. It establishes private health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers to shop for qualified plans with federal subsidies. Medicaid programs must expand coverage to eligible individuals under 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level, with the federal government covering most of the costs. The Affordable Care Act mandates health insurance coverage for residents or pay a penalty and establishes private health insurance exchanges with federal subsidies. The law also amends Medicare, imposes an excise tax on high premium insurance plans, and makes changes to the tax code and federal programs. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Medicaid expansion violated the Constitution by threatening states with the loss of federal funds. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes subsidies for health insurance purchases, Medicaid expansion, mandatory appropriations for temporary programs, and funding for research and demonstration programs. Revenues from new taxes and fees offset the costs of expanding coverage, with savings from payment and healthcare delivery reforms. ACA also impacts discretionary spending through new grant programs and reauthorized appropriations. The report examines how automatic spending reductions triggered by the Budget Control Act (BCA) might affect health reform implementation under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). It provides an overview of ACA's health insurance reforms, analyzes the impact on federal spending and revenues, discusses the automatic spending reductions under the BCA, and identifies which health reform spending may be subject to or exempt from those reductions. The primary goal of ACA is to increase access to affordable health insurance for uninsured Americans and make insurance more affordable for those already covered. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) aims to increase access to affordable health insurance for uninsured Americans and make insurance more affordable for those already covered. It includes provisions to slow the growth in healthcare costs, improve quality of care, and establish benchmarks for better health outcomes. Some provisions are already in place, while others are being phased in over the next few years, including temporary programs to increase access and funding for targeted groups. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes a reinsurance program for 55- to 64-year-old retirees, small business tax credits, and private insurance market reforms. Key reforms include no lifetime limits on essential benefits, coverage for young adults up to age 26 on parents' plans, and preventive services without cost-sharing. Major provisions take effect in January 2014. The ACA includes major expansion and reform provisions that take effect in January 2014. Each state will have a health insurance exchange for individuals and small employers to purchase coverage. States may allow larger employers to buy insurance through the exchanges in 2017. Refundable tax credits will help offset insurance premiums for those with income between 100% and 400% of the FPL. The ACA's market reforms in 2014 include no annual limits on essential benefits, no exclusions for preexisting conditions, and essential benefit standards for plans offered in exchanges. Premiums may vary based on age, family size, geographic area, and tobacco use. Plans must sell and renew policies to all individuals without discrimination based on health status. Starting in 2014, U.S. citizens and legal residents must have insurance or pay a penalty. Most U.S. citizens and legal residents must have insurance or face a penalty, as ruled by the Supreme Court in 2012. The individual mandate aims to ensure healthy individuals participate in the insurance market to spread the risk. Employers with more than 200 full-time employees offering health insurance must automatically enroll new employees, with the option to opt out. Employers with 50 or more full-time employees may be affected if at least one employee is enrolled in an exchange plan receiving a premium tax credit. The ACA requires states to expand Medicaid coverage, but states can now choose to opt out without penalty. Some states have announced their decision to forgo the expansion, missing out on federal funding that covers 100% of costs initially and 90% thereafter. Low-income adults below the poverty line may not be covered if a state chooses not to expand Medicaid. The ACA requires states to expand Medicaid coverage, but some states can opt out without penalty. Low-income individuals below the poverty line seeking insurance through an exchange may be ineligible for subsidies below 100% FPL. ACA also extends CHIP appropriations through FY2015, with estimated gross costs of $938 billion over FY2010-FY2019, partially offset by $150 billion. JCT estimated that costs of ACA's insurance coverage provisions would be offset by penalties from uninsured individuals and employers, excise tax on high-premium plans, and savings from coverage expansion effects on tax revenues. CBO projected net costs of $788 billion over FY2010-FY2019. New revenues from taxes and fees, along with direct spending savings from Medicare reforms, further offset the costs. In March 2010, CBO and JCT projected that ACA would reduce federal deficits by $124 billion over 10 years. Estimates have been updated multiple times, with the most recent in May 2013 showing growing costs of expanding insurance coverage. The recent estimates only include gross and net costs of coverage expansion, not other offsetting revenues and savings. The costs of expanding insurance coverage have increased over time, with gross costs rising from $938 billion in March 2010 to $1,798 billion in May 2013. Net costs also increased from $788 billion to $1,363 billion during the same period. The increase in costs is mainly due to changes in the budget window for estimates, capturing additional years of spending on exchange subsidies and Medicaid expansion. The most recent estimates cover the periods FY2013-FY2022 and FY2014-FY2023, requiring each state to expand its Medicaid program by 2014. The ACA requires states to expand Medicaid by 2014 or risk losing federal funds. After the Supreme Court's decision, some states are opting out of expansion, leading to reduced Medicaid enrollment and spending. However, subsidies for exchanges are projected to increase due to higher enrollment. The lower marginal tax rates in ATRA also reduce the tax benefit for employment-based health insurance. The ACA budgetary estimates are influenced by various factors, including changes in economic outlook, modifications to insurance coverage provisions, HHS decisions on implementation, reduced growth in health expenditures, and technical estimating procedure changes. While costs for ACA's coverage expansion provisions remain stable annually, total costs have increased over a longer budget window. The ACA budget window now includes more years of coverage expansion. CBO and JCT estimated that ACA would increase nonelderly Americans with health insurance by 33 million in 2022. Medicaid and CHIP programs were expected to enroll 17 million additional individuals, with the rest gaining coverage through private insurance. About 22 million people were projected to purchase coverage through insurance exchanges in 2022. The Supreme Court decision resulted in a net increase of 16 million people with private insurance coverage. CBO and JCT project that fewer individuals will be covered by Medicaid, more will obtain insurance through exchanges, and more will remain uninsured. In 2022, an additional 13 million people will be covered by Medicaid and CHIP, while 24 million will be enrolled in exchanges. Additionally, 7 million fewer people are expected to have employment-based coverage due to ATRA's reduction in tax rates. The tax benefit associated with employment-based health insurance is expected to decrease under the new tax law, leading to a shift in coverage for employees. The ACA is projected to increase the number of nonelderly Americans with health insurance by 25 million in 2022, with revenues generated through taxes on high-income households and fees on insurers, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices. Medicare payment provisions in the ACA aim to reduce spending growth by implementing payment reductions for Medicare Advantage plans and hospitals. The ACA includes provisions for payment reductions for hospitals and providers, establishes the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to recommend Medicare spending reductions, and creates tools to combat fraud and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid. It also introduces pilot programs for integrated care models like ACOs and medical homes, and establishes the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMI) to pilot new payment and service delivery models. The ACA establishes new payment and service delivery models for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, including pay-for-reporting and pay-for-performance programs. It also incentivizes primary care and prevention by increasing payment rates, covering preventive services without cost-sharing, funding community-based prevention programs, and expanding access to primary care services in underserved areas. Additionally, the law requires the development of a national strategy for health care quality improvement. The ACA aims to improve health care quality, delivery, and outcomes. The FY2013 sequestration was triggered by the failure to enact deficit-reduction legislation. The BCA allowed the President to raise the debt limit by $2.1 trillion. The BCA granted the President authority to increase the debt limit by $2.1 trillion in three installments. The President raised the debt limit to $16.394 trillion. The No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013 suspended enforcement of the debt limit and raised it to the level of debt accumulated. The BCA also established a process for reducing the federal deficit by at least $2.1 trillion over a 10-year period. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set separate caps for security and nonsecurity spending in FY2013. For the following eight fiscal years, a single cap for total discretionary spending was established, with annual growth of approximately 2%. The law also created a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to develop legislation to reduce the federal deficit by at least $1.5 trillion through FY2021. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established caps for discretionary spending and created a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to cut the deficit by $1.5 trillion through FY2021. If Congress and the President failed to enact a bill by January 15, 2012, automatic spending reductions would be triggered starting in FY2013. The Joint Committee did not reach an agreement, leading to the President ordering spending reductions on January 2, 2013, delayed to March 1, 2013, by ATRA. The automatic cuts were required to reduce spending by $109.33 billion. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandated automatic spending reductions of $109.33 billion annually from FY2013-FY2021, split equally between defense and nondefense spending. ATRA reduced the cuts for FY2013 by $24 billion, resulting in $42.67 billion cuts for both categories. The reductions are further divided between discretionary and nonexempt direct spending, with sequestration being used for nonexempt accounts. The sequestration process, established in 1985 by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, triggers automatic spending cuts if budget deficit exceeds target levels. Amendments like the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 and the BCA have modified the process. Sequestration rules include capped reductions in Medicare payments at 2% and exemptions specified in Sections 255 and 256 of the BBEDCA. The sequestration process, established in 1985, triggers automatic spending cuts if the budget deficit exceeds target levels. Medicare payments are capped at 2%, and exemptions are specified in Sections 255 and 256 of the BBEDCA. Discretionary spending reductions in FY2013 are achieved through sequestration of nonexempt discretionary appropriations. Some discretionary spending, like veterans' health care and Pell grants, are exempt from sequestration. Policymakers decide how to apportion cuts within lowered spending caps for FY2014-FY2021. ATRA reduced the FY2013 discretionary spending cap by $4 billion. The Budget Control Act (BCA) required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to calculate and the President to order sequestration of FY2013 budgetary resources from nonexempt accounts on January 1, 2013, which was delayed by the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) until March 1, 2013. ATRA also reduced the FY2013 discretionary spending cap by $4 billion and the FY2014 discretionary spending cap by $8 billion, equally divided between defense and nondefense spending. Each year's spending cap is enforced by a separate sequestration process. The BCA mandates spending reductions for FY2014-FY2021 to occur at the time of the President's annual budget submission in early February. The BCA mandates spending reductions for FY2014-FY2021, with OMB determining cuts to discretionary and direct spending in defense and nondefense categories. OMB has exclusive authority over exemptions and rules related to sequestration. A report released by OMB on September 14, 2012, detailed the potential impact of FY2013 sequestration, including estimates of funding reductions in nonexempt accounts based on FY2012 levels. The estimates were preliminary and did not consider ATRA's enactment. The President ordered a sequestration of FY2013 budgetary resources on March 1, 2013, based on OMB's calculations that included a $24 billion reduction in required spending cuts under ATRA. OMB calculated a 5.0% reduction in nonexempt discretionary spending and a 5.1% reduction in nonexempt mandatory program spending for FY2013. President Obama signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 on March 26, 2013, which funded most HHS discretionary programs at their FY2012 levels minus a 0.2% rescission. Final discretionary funding levels in the FY2013 full-year CR ended up slightly lower than those provided in the six-month CR due to this adjustment. Sequestration imposes cuts of 2% on Medicare payments and mandatory spending on health centers and Indian health. The BBEDCA requires annual spending cuts of $109.3 billion split between defense and nondefense spending from FY2014 through FY2021. Nonexempt nondefense mandatory programs will continue to be subject to sequestration each year. In FY2014 and subsequent years, mandatory programs will face higher sequestration cuts compared to FY2013 due to a larger total nondefense spending reduction. OMB estimates a 7.3% cut in nonexempt nondefense direct spending, while Medicare payments and spending on health centers and Indian health will be capped at 2%. Reductions in nonexempt nondefense discretionary spending will be achieved through a reduction in discretionary spending caps, with overall cuts higher than in FY2013. In FY2014 and subsequent years, discretionary programs may face cuts as congressional appropriators decide which programs to reduce to stay within nondefense discretionary spending caps. This includes veterans' health care and other previously exempt programs. The impact of BCA-triggered automatic spending reductions on ACA-related spending is discussed, including mandatory spending on insurance coverage expansion, other mandatory spending, discretionary spending, and federal programs. The Affordable Care Act's projected spending on expanding insurance coverage is mostly not subject to sequestration. Medicaid, CHIP, and refundable tax credits for purchasing insurance through exchanges are exempt from sequestration. Premium tax credits help limit costs. The Affordable Care Act's premium tax credits limit the cost of coverage to a percentage of income. These credits, along with cost-sharing subsidies, account for a significant portion of the ACA's total exchange subsidies and related spending. The cost-sharing subsidies under the Affordable Care Act are subject to sequestration, along with small employer tax credits. These subsidies amount to $149 billion over a ten-year period, while the small employer tax credits are projected to cost $14 billion. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) included mandatory appropriations of billions of dollars to support grant programs and activities. Some provisions are annual appropriations, while others are multiple-year appropriations. ACA also allocated funds for temporary programs, such as $5 billion for the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP). The Affordable Care Act (ACA) allocated funds for temporary insurance programs like the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP), reinsurance for early retirees, and the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program. It also provided money for states to establish health insurance exchanges and funded innovative payment models through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMI). The Affordable Care Act (ACA) allocated substantial amounts to four special funds. The Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) received $11 billion annually over five years for health center operations. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) supports comparative effectiveness research through FY2019. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) has a permanent annual appropriation for prevention and public health programs. Additionally, $1 billion was provided for the Health Insurance. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provided over $100 billion in direct appropriations over a 10-year period, including funding for maternal and child health programs, Health Insurance Reform Implementation Fund (HIRIF), and Community Health Centers. Some appropriations were included in estimates of insurance coverage expansion costs, while others were part of the impact of payment and delivery system reform provisions. The ACA's annual appropriations are subject to sequestration, with some exceptions. Only new budget authority for a fiscal year is reduced during sequestration, while unobligated balances from previous years are exempt. This means that unobligated ACA funds from prior fiscal years are not affected by sequestration orders. The ACA's annual appropriations are subject to sequestration, with some exceptions. Unobligated balances from prior fiscal years are exempt from sequestration. Examples include the PCIP program and CMI, which received multiple-year appropriations. The ACA implementation impacts direct and discretionary spending through FY2019. It reauthorized appropriations for existing grant programs, created new grant programs, and provided permanent reauthorization for Indian Health Service programs. Various provisions authorized specific annual appropriations for fiscal years, while others allowed for multi-year appropriations. The ACA reauthorized appropriations for existing grant programs and created new grant programs, but securing funding for these discretionary programs may be challenging due to enforceable spending caps. Few new discretionary grant programs authorized by ACA have received funding, and maintaining current funding levels for existing programs is also difficult amidst pressure to reduce federal discretionary spending. The ACA reauthorized appropriations for existing grant programs and created new grant programs, but securing funding for these discretionary programs may be challenging due to enforceable spending caps. CBO estimated that ACA's discretionary spending provisions would result in appropriations of almost $100 billion over FY2012-FY2021, with most funding going towards programs like the National Health Service Corps, health centers program, and the IHS. OMB has determined that sequestration rules apply only to mandatory spending reductions, not discretionary spending cuts. Discretionary spending cuts in health centers are fully sequestrable for FY2013, with a 2% cap on mandatory funding cuts for community and migrant health centers. Reductions in discretionary spending for FY2014-FY2021 will be achieved by adjusting statutory spending caps. Lowering annual discretionary spending caps allows Congress and the President to determine which accounts to reduce through the appropriations process. Federal administrative expenses are subject to sequestration under BBEDCA Section 256. Federal administrative expenses are subject to sequestration under BBEDCA Section 256, regardless of program exemptions. Payments to state and local governments for administrative costs are exempt if the relevant federal program is exempt. For example, Medicaid administrative costs are exempt from sequestration because the Medicaid program as a whole is exempt. OMB has determined that sequestration rules in BBEDCA Section 256 apply to mandatory spending reductions by the Joint Committee, not discretionary spending. Mandatory administrative expenses for exempt programs are subject to sequestration, while discretionary expenses are not. CBO projects substantial administrative costs for implementing ACA by CMS and IRS, estimating IRS costs for eligibility processes at $5-10 billion over 10 years. The estimated subsidies for implementing changes in healthcare programs will range from $5 billion to $10 billion over 10 years. The Affordable Care Act allocated $1 billion in mandatory funds for initial administrative costs, but additional discretionary funding was requested for ongoing implementation costs. However, Congress did not provide the requested funds for FY2013, leading CMS to spend approximately $1.5 billion on implementation efforts, particularly for establishing insurance exchanges in states without their own systems. HHS officials announced plans to use various funding sources for ACA implementation, including unobligated HIRIF funds, PPHF funds, non-recurring expenses fund, and funds from other HHS accounts. $54 million from PPHF will be used for navigator programs in states with Federally-Facilitated or State Partnership Exchanges to help consumers enroll in qualified health plans. HHS announced $150 million in funding for Health Center Outreach and Enrollment Assistance grants to help health centers hire and train staff for outreach and enrollment in exchanges, Medicaid, and CHIP. This funding complements navigator programs nationwide."
