The \"Biotechnology Future Investment Expansion Act of 2005\" restores tax incentives for biomedical research and clinical trials. Subsection (l) of section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include certain financing transactions for biomedical research corporations involving a 5% shareholder. The \"Biotechnology Future Investment Expansion Act of 2005\" amends tax incentives for biomedical research and clinical trials. It includes provisions for qualified investments in domestic corporations conducting drug or biologic research under investigational exemptions. The \"Biotechnology Future Investment Expansion Act of 2005\" defines qualified investments and transactions for biomedical research corporations, specifying conditions for stock acquisitions. The \"Biotechnology Future Investment Expansion Act of 2005\" outlines conditions for stock acquisitions by biomedical research corporations, including the treatment of stock issued in exchange for convertible debt. The requirements for convertible debt investments in biomedical research corporations include expenditure and continuity of business tests to qualify for stock conversion. The continuity of business test for biomedical research corporations involves a measuring period of the taxable year of the investment and the two preceding years. Additionally, the expenditure test requires at least 35% of expenditures to qualify. The continuity of business test for biomedical research corporations involves a 2-year period following a qualified investment or transaction to ensure the business enterprise continues. Rules similar to section 1202(c)(3) apply to qualified investments, with 'stock acquired in a qualified investment' substituted. The continuity of business test for biomedical research corporations involves a 2-year period following a qualified investment. 'Qualified investment' is substituted for 'qualified small business stock' in relevant instances. If a biomedical research corporation engages in a transaction with a member of its qualified investment group and receives non-cash consideration within 2 years of a qualified investment, there is a presumption regarding the stock received. The stock received in a qualified investment transaction was not solely in exchange for cash. A qualified investment group includes persons who receive stock issued for the investment and related individuals. The Secretary will create regulations exempting customary transactions from this rule. The Secretary may issue regulations to prevent abuse and provide treatment for biomedical research corporations under sections 383 and 384. The effective date for this amendment is for taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
