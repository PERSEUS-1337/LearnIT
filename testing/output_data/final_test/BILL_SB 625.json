    "title": "SB 625",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature adds Chapter 5.9 to address plastic microbeads pollution, stating that conventional plastic does not biodegrade and causes environmental and health hazards. Plastic pollution from synthetic microbeads in personal care products poses environmental and health risks as they are not recoverable through wastewater treatment facilities and have been found in surface waters and marine life. Economically feasible alternatives like biodegradable materials are available for use in personal care products. On January 1, 2020, the sale of personal care products containing synthetic plastic microbeads in California is prohibited. These microbeads are non-biodegradable plastic particles used for exfoliation or cleansing. The sale of personal care products with synthetic plastic microbeads in California is banned starting January 1, 2020. Section 42362 exempts products with microbeads less than 1 ppm. Violators may face injunctions and civil penalties up to $2,500 per day per violation. Penalties consider the nature, severity, and economic impact of the violation. The Attorney General may take actions against violators of the ban on synthetic plastic microbeads in California, with civil penalties up to $2,500 per day per violation. Penalties consider economic impact, good faith measures taken, deterrent effect, and other relevant factors. Penalties collected are paid to the office of the Attorney General for enforcing the ban. Starting January 1, 2016, local public agencies are prohibited from creating ordinances related to the sale of personal care products containing synthetic plastic microbeads. The Legislature aims to prevent water pollution caused by these microbeads. This chapter does not change existing legal obligations and any penalties imposed are in addition to those already prescribed by law."
