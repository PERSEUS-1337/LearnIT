    "content": "The \"Accountability in Foreign Aid Act of 2014\" may be cited as the short title. The Act includes provisions for reimbursement for states and political subdivisions. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish a program to reimburse States and political subdivisions for expenses related to aliens with no lawful immigration status. Expenses include education, incarceration, and public benefits. Exceptions apply if the State fails to submit. The program will reimburse States and political subdivisions for expenses related to aliens with no lawful immigration status, including education, incarceration, and public benefits. Compensation for local educational agencies will be based on the number of such children in attendance receiving free public education. The program will reimburse States and political subdivisions for expenses related to aliens with no lawful immigration status, including education, incarceration, and public benefits. Compensation for local educational agencies will be based on the number of such children in attendance receiving free public education, multiplied by the average per-pupil expenditure of the State. Definitions for terms like \"average daily attendance\" and \"average per-pupil expenditure\" are provided in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Compensation for incarceration costs will be based on the average cost of incarceration of a prisoner in the relevant State, as determined by the Attorney General. States desiring reimbursement for expenses must submit applications. Reimbursement for expenses related to aliens with no lawful immigration status in the United States must be applied for by States and political subdivisions. Applications must be submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury or the State by September 30 each year. Verification of local expenses may be required by the State before reimbursement is granted. The State includes local expenses in the application submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Governor sets deadlines for local applications and distributes funds to political subdivisions. If funds are insufficient, payments to States are reduced proportionally by the Secretary of the Treasury. States or political subdivisions can resubmit for reimbursement if expenses are not covered. If the State does not receive reimbursement for expenses due to a reduction, they can resubmit documentation for the next fiscal year. The Secretary of the Treasury must maintain confidentiality of information provided by aliens, only allowing sworn officers and employees to access identifiable information. The Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and other officials are prohibited from using collected information for reimbursement purposes. The Secretary of the Treasury must disclose information for criminal investigations related to fraud. When establishing eligibility for reimbursement, State or local agencies can use the immigration status verification system to determine the status of aliens receiving benefits or services. 15 percent of discretionary funds for foreign assistance from 2016 to 2021 will be transferred to the Secretary of the Treasury for a 90-day period after each appropriation act."
