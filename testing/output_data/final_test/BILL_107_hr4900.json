The Secretary of Commerce will establish a National Climate Change Vulnerability and Resilience Program to evaluate impacts of climatic changes and variations. The Program will consult with relevant federal agencies and establish an Office of Climate Change Vulnerability and Resilience Research within the Department of Commerce. The National Climate Change Vulnerability and Resilience Program, under the Department of Commerce, will coordinate research on climatic change and vulnerability assessments, including severe weather events and climate variations like El Nino and North Atlantic Oscillation. The National Climate Change Vulnerability and Resilience Program, under the Department of Commerce, will coordinate research on climatic change and vulnerability assessments, including severe weather events and climate variations like El Nino and North Atlantic Oscillation. The program aims to address changes in sea level, shifts in the hydrological cycle, natural hazards such as tsunamis, droughts, floods, and wildfires, as well as ecological community alterations due to climatic change. Additionally, a Vulnerability Scorecard will be produced in collaboration with State and local institutions to assess each State's vulnerability and capacity to respond to climatic hazards. Preparedness recommendations will be transmitted to Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment, including the Vulnerability Scorecards. The Office is responsible for identifying and recommending strategies to minimize climatic threats, negative economic impacts, and improve resilience. Additionally, it applies vulnerability research to develop criteria for measuring resilience at various levels. The Office is responsible for coordinating research programs, measuring progress in increasing states' capacity to respond to climatic hazards, and updating Vulnerability Scorecards annually. The Secretary of Commerce disseminates information and technologies to assist in reducing loss of life and property due to climatic events. The Secretary of Commerce is responsible for coordinating national efforts to reduce loss of life and property due to climatic change and variation. $10,000,000 is authorized for carrying out this section."
