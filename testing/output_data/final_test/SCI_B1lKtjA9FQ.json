    "content": "Overfitting in neural network training is commonly addressed by using a holdout data set. However, this study challenges that approach by examining criteria for overfitting without a holdout set. The research involves training a model multiple times with varying fractions of randomized labels and regularization strengths to detect overfitting. Two criteria for detecting overfitting and one for underfitting are introduced, analyzing factors like early stopping, regularization, and network depth. Deep neural networks have shown superior performance in various machine learning tasks, but they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to overfitting. It is crucial to evaluate their performance on new data, especially in safety critical applications like autonomous driving. The methods in this paper aim to characterize and identify models that perform well without overfitting. In this paper, the focus is on preventing neural networks from overfitting during training. Previous methods involve evaluating the network on a holdout set or penalizing the model complexity. However, these methods have limitations. The proposed method in this paper relies on training data only and uses l1-regularization of kernel weights to control network complexity. This approach eliminates the need for a holdout set and provides an alternative notion of overfitting. The paper discusses preventing overfitting in neural networks by using l1-regularization of kernel weights to control model complexity. This approach eliminates the need for a holdout set and introduces a new way to address overfitting. The paper introduces l1-regularization of kernel weights to prevent overfitting in neural networks. It discusses feed forward networks mapping input space to target space, with layers consisting of linear blocks and non-linearities. The margin measures the gap between correct and incorrect classifications. The paper focuses on the standard relu nonlinearity in neural networks, defining input data, output of network layers, and network width. Data points and signals are arranged in matrices, with l1-regularization discussed for convolutional kernels. The matrix A is arranged as a vertically stacked block matrix with subblocks representing outgoing features. Each weight occurs once in each row and column of A. The spectral norm of A is bounded by the l1-norm of its kernel weights. Generalization bounds are dominated by the margin \u03b3, training data X, and spectral complexity RA. The spectral complexity of the model can be bounded by the l1-norm of the kernel weights. By penalizing the kernel weights with \u03bb||W||1, better generalization bounds can be achieved. Assumptions are made to simplify the analysis, assuming independent data. To simplify the analysis, three assumptions are made: data is independent and identically distributed, model complexity is controlled by a regularization parameter leading to decreased complexity, and the regularization parameter and randomness are on a similar scale. This ensures that the accuracy is a function of both parameters. In this paper, a classification problem is considered where training data is split into two parts based on a level of randomness. The randomized data is created by joining these two parts, with accuracy plots being central to the analysis. The paper discusses accuracy plots based on training data randomness and regularization parameters. The accuracy curve is expected to decrease with increasing randomness, indicating a more complex training data set. The accuracy of the model is expected to decrease with increasing randomness and regularization parameter. Real accuracy curves from different data sets were compared to idealized curves, showing the qualitative behavior of accuracy over randomness. The accuracy curves of the model were analyzed for different data sets and regularization levels. Convexity of the accuracy curve indicates overfitting or underfitting of the model. Increasing regularization pushes the curve below the straight line, confirming the expected behavior. The accuracy curves of the model were analyzed for overfitting and underfitting. The criterion for overfitting is a strictly concave accuracy curve, while underfitting is indicated by a strictly convex curve. The criterion is computed by measuring the squared distance of the accuracy curve to a straight line. Additionally, a steep decrease in accuracy indicates overfitting. The accuracy curves of the model were analyzed for overfitting and underfitting based on convexity and concavity. Overfitting is indicated by a steep drop in accuracy as randomness increases, while underfitting is shown by a constant accuracy curve. Another criterion involves measuring the derivative of accuracy with respect to regularization parameter \u03bb. Additionally, a criterion based on margin histograms of fully randomized training data is derived. The accuracy curves were analyzed for overfitting and underfitting based on convexity and concavity. Underfitting is indicated by a constant accuracy curve, where the model outputs random noise initially and then converges as two modes collapse into one. The model overfits if margin histograms of fully randomized and true data are both positive. The model underfits if the margin histogram computed with fully randomized training data D1 has two modes. The criterion is evaluated by computing the quotient of positive margins to negative margins. The accuracy curves of the network trained on cifar10 over different degrees of randomness with increasing l1-regularization are shown. The regularization factor \u03bb*1 = 0.00011 was chosen based on a convexity criterion. The criteria were tested on cifar-10, a dataset with 50000 images divided into ten classes. The cifar-10 dataset consists of 50000 images divided into ten classes. Random samples were generated with varying degrees of label permutation. The architecture and training parameters are detailed in the appendix. A similar dataset, Mnist, was created. Another dataset, Noise, consists of randomly generated RGB noise images. The paper discusses how the techniques can be used to tune the regularization parameter in neural networks to prevent overfitting while maintaining good performance. The convexity criterion is used to analyze accuracy curves on randomized data, aiming for zero training error on true data and gradually increasing error on randomized data. The goal is to keep the training error below an optimal line by selecting the smallest regularization parameter (\u03bb) that achieves this. In experiments with l1 regularization on an Alexnet-type network, varying regularization factors were tested on cifar10 with five random samples. Results showed a consistent optimal regularization parameter of 0.0023. Similarly, training on mnist with varying dropout rates showed an optimal rate of 0.1. In experiments with l2 regularization on a different Alexnet-type network on mnist, the optimal regularization parameter was found to be 0.00011. The experiments involved varying the regularization factor and running tests on five random samples to compute mean and standard deviation. Additionally, dropout was highlighted as another method for neural network regularization. The experiments involved testing dropout as a regularization method on an Alexnet-type network trained on mnist. Different dropout probabilities were used, ranging from 0.1 to 1.0, with the optimal value found to be 0.1. Early stopping was also explored, showing that less training time leads to better generalization. The accuracy curves comparing training and test data for different regularization factors are presented in Figure 4. The model overfits without regularization, learning randomized data well. The network finds it easier to learn more random data, but accuracy decreases with increasing randomness before increasing again due to correlations in the data set. Higher noise levels reduce data complexity. Variance is high for entirely random data. Increasing the regularization parameter decreases the network's ability to learn. The regularization parameter affects the network's ability to learn random data. A \u03bb 1 = 0.00011 value shows optimal regularization, while higher values lead to underfitting. L1-regularization helps adjust model complexity. Analyzing early stopping and overfitting can be done using plots similar to Figure 5. Training without regularization leads to overfitting, while adding regularization prevents it. Further training results in more models overfitting. In the appendix, models with different filter sizes in the first convolutional layer were examined. Networks with filter sizes from 2 \u00d7 2 to 9 \u00d7 9 and a regularization parameter of \u03bb 1 = 0.00011 showed underfitting. The importance of l1 regularization in preventing overfitting was highlighted, as well as the impact of network depth on model behavior. The paper introduced criteria for measuring a neural network's capacity by injecting noise levels in the training data. This approach advances previous methods by setting a limit on training accuracy based on injected noise levels. In experiments, hyper parameters were classified into two groups: those with no impact on overfitting (e.g., kernel size) and those controlling overfitting (e.g., regularization factor, number of iterations). L1 regularization was found to be dominant in preventing overfitting in mnist and cifar10 experiments, while network width and depth had minimal effect. The convexity criterion was reliable for detecting outliers and high variance but required more training runs. The steep decrease criterion helped narrow parameter ranges but struggled to detect class correlations easily. The mode criterion is the easiest to use as it only uses totally randomized training data. However, interpreting margin plots can be challenging. If the entire margin is positive, the model overfits; if two modes are observed, the model underfits. Most of the time, the margin falls in between, making it difficult to judge based on margin histograms alone. Criterion (C2) involves training a network on true and randomly shuffled labels to analyze accuracies. Margin histograms have been used to compare networks trained on true and random labels before. The regularization parameter can be set to train a network on true labels but not on random labels. Criteria for evaluating this effect can be numerically assessed and used in an automated parameter search. The number of parameters does not seem to contribute to overfitting. To apply these criteria, one would first find an architecture with zero training error and then regularize it to prevent overfitting. The analysis of neural networks with randomized training data has been explored previously. In a study on neural networks with randomized training data, the authors found that l1-normalization of kernel weights can help control network capacity and prevent overfitting. They also highlighted the effectiveness of l1 regularization in enforcing sparsity of network weights. Tuning hyperparameters based on overfitting tests led to higher test accuracy in models. The study focused on neural networks with randomized training data and highlighted the effectiveness of l1 regularization in controlling network capacity and preventing overfitting. The test accuracy of the model was higher than the training accuracy, showing the criteria can learn from noisy data. The methods can be applied to other machine learning algorithms, such as systematic architecture search. The study also suggested investigating if the criteria make adversarial attacks more difficult. The study focused on neural networks with randomized training data and highlighted the effectiveness of l1 regularization in controlling network capacity and preventing overfitting. The model does not overfit for \u03bb = 0.00011 and can learn from noise data. Matrix norms are discussed, including spectral norm and other special cases. The paper references books for definitions of these norms. The generalized mean is defined for non-zero real number p and positive reals x1,...,xn. An inequality is used for all real p < q and positive xy1,...,xn drawn iid from a probability distribution. A steep descent criterion is proposed to detect the first change point where accuracy falls linearly. The accuracy curves for random data are provided to measure how much the network learned about the data. In this section, accuracy curves for random data are provided to show the network's learning process. The experiments demonstrate that different criteria lead to similar conclusions about the regularization factor. A steep decrease criterion is used to detect the point where accuracy starts to drop as regularization increases. The experiments show that as regularization increases, accuracy drops. The point of interest, \u03bb * occurs around \u03bb 1 = 0.0001. The mode criterion reveals the distribution splitting into two modes as regularization increases, with the point of interest at \u03bb 1 = 0.00011. The architecture includes 5 \u00d7 5 and 3 \u00d7 3 convolutional filters, fully connected layers with relu nonlinearity, and max-pooling. TensorFlow with SGD was used for coding. The experiments showed that as regularization increased, accuracy decreased. The architecture included 5x5 and 3x3 convolutional filters, fully connected layers with relu nonlinearity, and max-pooling. Everything was coded in Tensorflow with SGD, a fixed learning rate of 0.01, and a batch size of 32. The networks were trained for 199999 steps with l1 normalization of all weights. Input images were normalized to zero mean and standard deviation using Tensorflow's built-in function, with standard data augmentation. Additional plots of l1 regularization experiments were provided, showing the detection of overfitting and underfitting based on margin criteria. The experiments showed that as regularization increased, accuracy decreased. The model neither able to learn random data nor true data. Based on this observation, \u03bb = 0.0001 was selected as the regularization parameter. The plots show the accuracy of the network trained on cifar10 over different degrees of randomness with increasing l1 regularization. The network was trained for 159999 and 179999 iterations, with evaluations on both the training and test sets. The network was evaluated on the training set and test set after being trained on cifar10 with increasing l1 regularization. The network trained for 199999 iterations, with accuracy decreasing as regularization increased."
