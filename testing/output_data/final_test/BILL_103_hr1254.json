    "content": "The Department of Agriculture program encourages and assists in the donation of unmarketable agricultural commodities. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a donation program to encourage producers, processors, and handlers to donate unmarketable agricultural commodities to food banks and shelters to help the homeless and needy. Eligible commodities are those still fit for consumption but unmarketable due to grade, size, or quality restrictions. The Secretary of Agriculture may enter agreements with producers, processors, and handlers of agricultural commodities to cover costs for harvesting, handling, packaging, or processing commodities for donation. This is part of a program to donate unmarketable but still consumable commodities to food banks and shelters for the homeless and needy. Local governments can nominate food banks, soup kitchens, and homeless shelters for agricultural commodity donations. The State official prepares a donation plan based on nominations and submits it to the Secretary of Agriculture for review and selection. The Secretary of Agriculture reviews and selects food banks, soup kitchens, and homeless shelters in each State to receive agricultural commodities. If a State official is not appointed, an alternative selection method may be established. Consultation with nonprofit organizations and interested persons is required for the nomination and selection process. The Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, will contract with individuals to collect, store, and distribute agricultural commodities for donation. Contracts will be awarded competitively and funded through section 32 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act. At least 25% of unobligated funds will be allocated to this program annually. Definitions for \"food bank\" and \"soup kitchen\" are provided in this section. A food bank is an institution that provides food to food pantries, soup kitchens, and other centers serving homeless or needy individuals. A soup kitchen is an establishment that offers meals to those in need, such as the homeless, elderly, and impoverished. A homeless shelter is a public or charitable institution that provides meals, shelter, health care services, counseling, and training to homeless or needy individuals."
