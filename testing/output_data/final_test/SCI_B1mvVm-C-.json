    "content": "Recent state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms aim to excel in specific tasks by combining environment and task knowledge. A new framework inspired by hierarchical reinforcement learning separates task and environment knowledge into two units. The environment unit focuses on moving between states, while the task unit plans for the next target state. Results show that this method efficiently learns and adapts to new tasks better than current methods. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of utilizing prior knowledge when learning new tasks, using the example of learning to play tennis. It highlights the disentanglement of environment-specific information and task-specific knowledge for training efficiency. The focus is on how agents can obtain and utilize such disentangled prior knowledge about the environment. The curr_chunk introduces a new scheme to disentangle task-independent transition dynamics and task-specific rewards for more efficient adaptation to new tasks and increased interpretability. The model introduced consists of two major units: a PATH function for environment-specific knowledge and a goal generator for task-specific knowledge. The PATH function learns how to move between states, while the goal function determines the next state for a target task. This disentanglement allows for more efficient adaptation to new tasks and increased interpretability. Our model consists of a PATH function for environment-specific knowledge and a goal generator for task-specific knowledge. The PATH function determines how to move between states, while the goal function decides the next state for a target task. This disentanglement enables efficient adaptation to new tasks and increased interpretability. The model shows faster convergence compared to the state-of-the-art method BID15, especially in transfer learning tasks. In this paper, a reinforcement learning model is introduced that separates environment-specific knowledge from task-specific knowledge. This disentangling model allows for efficient adaptation to new tasks or environments by learning only the necessary knowledge. The model utilizes modularized neural networks with a goal function (\u03c4) for task-specific knowledge and a path function (PATH) for environment-specific knowledge. The goal function determines the next target state for a task, while the path function provides the way to reach the target state. The model introduced in this paper separates task-specific knowledge from environment-specific knowledge using modularized neural networks. The goal function (\u03c4) determines the target state for a task, while the path function (PATH) provides the way to reach the target state. Changes in tasks require updating the goal function, while changes in environments require updating the path function. The PATH function outputs a probability distribution over action space to reach a target state from a starting state. It can generate a trajectory by iteratively applying the function and creating a Markov chain. The function is trained by sampling starting and final states and teaching it to generate paths using reward signals. Game instances are defined based on transition dynamics for state-action pairs. The PATH function in game instances is learned using RL algorithms, agnostic of the environment's task. It can be jointly optimized with other tasks and reused in new tasks. State pairs can be sampled directly or through exploration strategies in complex environments. The goal function (\u03c4) is designed to determine the goal state for a task, using task-specific knowledge. It is trained through back-propagation in the PATH module, where the actor works with a task-specific critic network. The parameters for PATH are fixed, and the gradient for the goal function is computed to reduce to a continuous state. The advantage computed by DISPLAYFORM1 and \u03b3 is the discount factor BID15. To reduce to a continuous control problem, the \u03c4 function can be trained as the agent's response optimized using the reward signal. The output lies on the manifold of \u03c6(S), modeled as a Gaussian distribution in continuous control RL. Various RL algorithms for continuous action space can optimize the \u03c4 function. Choices for the \u03c6(S) space include auto-encoder, beta-VAE, forward dynamics, inverse dynamics, and feature space jointly learned with PATH function. The \u03c4 function can be trained as the agent's response optimized using the reward signal. The output distribution of \u03c4 function becomes a binomial distribution by binarizing the output coding of \u03c6. The major difference between two methods lies in the position where the sampling and the supervision of reward signals take place: at the output of PATH or the output of \u03c4. The second approach optimizes state planning in the latent state space using reward signals directly. The first approach is preferred for its ease of implementation and stability, especially when the state space is changing. Batched A3C is used as the base model with a CNN structure for feature extraction and a 3-layer MLP for the PATH function. Historical information is preserved by inputting four consecutive frames as state s. The critic network shares features with \u03c4. The critic network shares features with \u03c4 and has two extra fully-connected layers for value estimation. Curriculum learning is employed to accelerate the training process by increasing the max distance between starting and final states after every K iterations. The proposed universal agents have advantages such as obtaining the PATH function without task specification and utilizing different methods for determining the max distance. The PATH function can be trained without task specification, showing better generalization when learned on multiple tasks. Experiments in Lava World and Atari 2600 games demonstrate the effectiveness of different feature spaces and optimization strategies. The agent navigates a maze with lava obstacles, finding doors to move between rooms. Additional experiments in continuous control and imitation learning are planned. The agent in Lava World must find doors to move between rooms, which is more challenging than a random 2D maze. The PATH function is trained to understand movement and room transitions. Generalization ability is tested by training on simple instances and testing on harder ones, showing limited ability at first but improving with increased training distance. In experiments, increasing training distance to 7 leads to generalization. The PATH function helps agents move to target positions with dense rewards. A universal agent learns faster than A3C models, with an interpretable \u03c4 function optimized through the PATH module. The function can resolve paths between all states. The PATH function resolves paths between all states, focusing on goal state composition. Different feature spaces for state encoding include AutoEncoder, \u03b2-VAE, forward dynamics, and inverse dynamics. These choices impact the training strategy for \u03c4. Inverse dynamics, used by BID18, is a one-step PATH function without pre-training. The feature space is learned jointly with the PATH function. Auto-encoder and \u03b2-VAE perform poorly compared to other feature spaces due to their lack of understanding of the environment's dynamics. Different distribution models are explored for the output distribution of the \u03c4 function. Proximal policy optimization (PPO) BID27 is used for training. The distributional \u03c4 learning uses proximal policy optimization (PPO) BID27. Gaussian and Gaussian-A show similar behavior, while Binomial is preferred over Binomial-B. Gaussian models perform well with pixel-level information but struggle with high-level, discrete information. Distributional models have challenging hyper-parameters but may be beneficial in robotics settings. Knowledge transfer via PATH function is studied with two types of knowledge. Knowledge transfer via PATH function is studied with two types of knowledge: knowledge from exploration and knowledge from tasks. BID18 is implemented as a no-reward RL explorer in unknown environments, with the PATH function trained from scratch without pre-trained feature space. The PATH function can reach comparable accuracy as the original curriculum learning correspondent with the same number of frames experienced. Performance comparison is made between two models: (a) PATH function learned using curiosity-driven RL without any reward, and (b) the probability of successfully finishing tasks. The performance of a universal agent in the Taxi game is compared with A3C baseline and A3C model pre-trained for reachability. The agent acts as a taxi driver, picking up passengers and reaching target positions using one-hot vectors. Transfer across tasks is studied, showing similar performance with the reachability task. The universal agent excels in task interpretation and outperforms baselines in Atari 2600 games. State restoration is used for PATH learning, sampling starting and targeting states from agent experience. Techniques for PATH training without state restoration can be separately addressed. The universal agent excels in task interpretation and outperforms baselines in Atari 2600 games. Techniques for PATH training without state restoration can be separately addressed. State space is optimized jointly with the PATH function. New tasks for four Atari games are defined with large differences from the original tasks. In FIG8, the universal agent benefits from the pre-trained PATH function in the original task. A3C-L loads weights from the model trained on the original task, while A3C is trained from scratch. UA outperforms A3C in Alien-new and Riverraid-new games. In UpNDown-new, A3C finds a bug and escapes from cars, while UA jumps over cars to avoid being hit. In JourneyEscape-new, UA and A3C-L perform better than A3C trained from scratch. Task transfer from multiple sources is discussed. In the PATH function training phase, knowledge transfer from multiple tasks in Atari games is demonstrated. Pre-trained A3C agents for different tasks are used to collect experiences for the agent. This method distills PATH from multiple agents, allowing agents to be trained on new tasks with fixed PATH functions. The universal agent's advantage lies in filtering out meaningless actions with PATH functions, focusing only on reaching meaningful states. The PATH function learns how to reach meaningful states from pre-trained models, aiding exploration and exploitation in new tasks. The universal agent outperforms A3C with pre-trained models in convergence and performance. Future work includes learning the PATH function from multiple tasks for continual and life-long learning. Model-based RL frameworks aim to model environment dynamics using search-based algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search. In this paper, the problem of representing environment knowledge by learning skills is addressed. Humans store movement knowledge by end-states, easily utilized by a goal generator for novel tasks. Multi-task and transfer learning approaches transfer knowledge among agents. Universal agents acquire environment-specific knowledge without task supervision. Universal agent, unlike typical HRL methods, plans future states at every time step using a general PATH function. Instruction-based reinforcement learning provides task descriptions to agents for zero-shot generalization on new tasks, but is limited by the tasks agents are trained with. The PATH function is a universal value function approximator that addresses generalization among multiple tasks. The PATH function is a universal value function approximator that can be shared among different agents working on different tasks in the same environment. It is an inverse and high-level abstract version of transition dynamics, measuring reachability between states without specific task knowledge. This contrasts with imitation learning, which derives policies from examples provided by a teacher. Contrary to Reinforcement Learning (RL) where policy is derived from experience, a new reinforcement learning scheme is introduced that disentangles the learning procedure of task-independent transition dynamics and task-specific rewards. This approach incorporates prior knowledge of the environment into an imitation learning framework to improve generalization and robustness. The model introduces a PATH function and a goal generator for efficient task adaptation and interpretability. The study introduces a PATH unit that outperforms the state-of-the-art method BID15, especially in transfer learning tasks. The framework aims to enhance knowledge representation learning for deep reinforcement learning. Future research directions include learning the PATH function in a continual manner, improving cooperation with the goal generator, and exploring applications in tasks like learning from demonstration. Visualization of the goal state generated by the \u03c4 function is also discussed. The universal agent model enhances interpretability in games by linking the agent's position to its goal position. In imitation learning, task supervision is provided by demonstrations from experts or pre-trained agents. By minimizing log \u03c0(a|s; \u03b8) over a set of demonstration plays, extra supervision signals can improve the Universal Agent's understanding of the goal. Empirical analysis in the game Reachability shows the agent's performance with different numbers of demonstration plays. The universal agent model shows better generalization with a limited number of demonstration plays in continuous control settings like Lunar Lander. The agent controls a spacecraft with three engines to land on the moon, with rewards based on successful landing and fuel consumption. Randomness in the environment comes from land configuration, initial position, and velocity of the lander. The Lunar Lander task involves using a pre-trained A3C model and heuristic agents for imitation learning. A large noise is added to actions for generalization, and new tasks like hover, fly away, and swing are designed. Demonstrations are provided for each task to train the agent. The universal agent with a pre-trained PATH function outperforms pure imitation learning in generalization and robustness. The agents show faster learning speed initially but struggle to avoid colliding with objects, impacting their performance. The PATH function fails to effectively avoid colliding with objects, impacting the score. The Jacobian visualization shows how the PATH function makes decisions in path training. It learns the dynamics of the environment and considers the agent's current and target position. Neurons are activated for objects in the scene, especially in the game Riverraid where agents lack position indicators. The PATH function utilizes this information for navigation. The PATH function in the game Riverraid utilizes information from other objects' positions to locate the agent."
