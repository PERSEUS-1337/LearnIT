    "content": "The Financial Fraud Detection and Disclosure Act of 1995, also known as the \"Financial Fraud Detection and Disclosure Act,\" introduces amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to enhance fraud detection and disclosure measures. This includes the addition of a new section, SEC. 13A, focusing on fraud detection and disclosure. The Financial Fraud Detection and Disclosure Act of 1995 requires audits of issuer's financial statements to include procedures for detecting illegal acts, identifying related party transactions, and evaluating the issuer's ability to continue as a going concern. The Financial Fraud Detection and Disclosure Act of 1995 mandates audits to detect illegal acts in issuer's financial statements, requiring accountants to investigate and report potential illegal activities that may impact financial statements. The Financial Fraud Detection and Disclosure Act of 1995 requires accountants to investigate and report illegal acts that may affect an issuer's financial statements, including fines, penalties, and damages. Accountants must promptly inform the issuer's management and ensure the audit committee or board of directors is aware of any detected illegal acts, unless they are deemed inconsequential. The independent public accountant must inform the audit committee of any detected illegal acts that have a material effect on the issuer's financial statements. If senior management fails to take timely and appropriate remedial actions, it may lead to a departure from the standard auditor's report or resignation from the audit engagement. The independent public accountant must report its conclusions to the board of directors promptly. An issuer must notify the Commission within one business day of receiving the report and provide a copy to the accountant. Failure to receive the notice within the required timeframe may result in the accountant resigning from the engagement or submitting the report directly to the Commission. The independent public accountant must report findings to the board of directors promptly. If an issuer fails to notify the Commission within one business day, the accountant must submit a copy of the report directly to the Commission. Auditor liability is limited in private actions related to the report. The Commission may impose civil penalties on an independent public accountant for willful violations of specific subsections. The determination and amount of penalties are governed by set standards. The section does not limit the Commission's authority under this title, except for one subsection. Definitions include 'illegal act' as any action violating laws or regulations. Effective Dates: The amendments apply to registrants filing quarterly financial data under Regulation S-K starting from January 1, 1996, and for other registrants starting from January 1, 1997."
