    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Education, Achievement, and Opportunity Act\". Congress acknowledges the importance of private schools as a complement to the public school system. Parents should have the right to choose the best educational option for their children. In 1999, a total of 5,939,000 children were enrolled in private schools, while 33,437,000 students were enrolled in public schools. In 1999, 52,750,000 children were enrolled in public schools, with 78% of parents in private schools and 48% in public schools being very satisfied with discipline, academic standards, and teacher quality. The average class size in public schools was twice that of private schools in the 1993-94 school year, impacting the educational experience. The educational experience of students, teachers, and staff, as well as parents' satisfaction with their child's school, is important. SEC. 3. CREDIT FOR ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION EXPENSES. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section for elementary and secondary education expenses. The new section allows for a tax credit for qualified education expenses paid by an individual for each qualifying child, with a maximum credit of $2,500 for elementary school and $3,500 for secondary school per child. In any taxable year, if a child meets specific requirements, the allowable credit amount should not exceed the sum of those amounts. The credit is reduced based on adjusted gross income, with a $50 reduction for each $1,000 over the threshold amount of $150,000 for joint filers and $75,000 for others. The tax credit amount is limited based on specific requirements met by a child in a taxable year. The credit decreases with higher adjusted gross income, with a reduction of $50 for each $1,000 over $150,000 for joint filers and $75,000 for others. Definitions for terms like \"modified adjusted gross income\" and \"qualifying child\" are provided in the section. The tax credit covers expenses such as enrollment at a qualified educational institution, computers, educational software, tutoring, special needs services for children with disabilities, and transportation fees to a private school.
