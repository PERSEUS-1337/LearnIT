Richard Barlow, a counter-proliferation intelligence officer, was involved in investigating Pakistan's nuclear weapons network from 1980-1989, leading to the arrest and conviction of agents involved in the country's clandestine nuclear purchasing networks. Richard Barlow played a key role in investigating Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, leading to the conviction of 2 agents. He received awards and commendations for his exceptional accomplishments, including triggering the Solarz Amendment. As the CIA's top expert, he testified truthfully in a classified hearing following the arrests of the Pakistani agents. Richard Barlow, the CIA's top expert, testified to Congress that arrested Pakistanis were agents of the Pakistani government and revealed Pakistan's violations of US nuclear export laws. He later joined the Office of the Secretary of Defense to investigate Pakistani proliferation networks and received an outstanding performance review in April 1989. In June 1989, Richard Barlow was promoted after expressing concerns to his supervisors about Executive Branch officials concealing intelligence on Pakistan's nuclear program from Congress. He also raised concerns about false testimony on Pakistan's nuclear capabilities to Congress in August 1989. On August 4, 1989, Richard Barlow received a notice of pending termination after being promoted. His security clearances were suspended on August 8, 1989, for undisclosed reasons. Under threat of firing, he was offered temporary assignments due to concerns of retaliation as a whistleblower. This led to a 9-month security investigation with allegations from his superiors. Mr. Barlow had his security clearance suspended in 1989, leading to temporary assignments and a 9-month investigation with false allegations. His clearance was restored in 1990, but he resigned in 1992. Despite 8 years of government service, the ordeal damaged his reputation and hindered his employment opportunities. He then worked as a consultant for 15 years without government benefits. In 1998, a Private Relief Bill was introduced to compensate Mr. Barlow for his ordeal. The Senate passed a resolution recognizing the importance of protecting Federal employees who expose wrongdoing. The Government filed a protective order under the state secrets privilege for documents requested by Mr. Barlow relating to the Pakistan nuclear program. The documents denied were ones that Mr. Barlow had official access to before losing clearance. These documents were subpoenaed by Mr. Barlow to support his claims of false testimony by Government officials to Congress on the Pakistan nuclear program. Sworn statements from senior intelligence officials were withheld from the Court due to the state secrets privilege. Several senior officials from intelligence, State Department, and Department of Defense supported Mr. Barlow's claims of Executive Branch wrongdoing. Despite the state secrets privilege, key evidence was inaccessible to evaluate Mr. Barlow's case accurately. Multiple Senate and House committees intervened in a bipartisan manner, and investigations by various agencies confirmed Mr. Barlow's findings. Richard Barlow, a patriot recognized for his service, will receive $1.9 million in compensation for losses incurred due to personnel and security actions by the Department of Defense in 1989. This payment does not imply liability on the part of the United States. The payment authorized for Richard Barlow is $1.9 million in partial reimbursement for losses incurred due to Department of Defense actions in 1989. This payment is not taxable and cannot be paid to agents or attorneys."
