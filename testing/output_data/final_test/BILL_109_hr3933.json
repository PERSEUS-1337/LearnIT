    "content": "The Act titled \"Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space Program Act of 2005\" adds a new section to the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978, establishing the Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space Program. The Act establishes definitions for \"Committee\" and \"Eligible entity\" as entities eligible to receive grants for acquiring and managing real property. The curr_chunk defines terms related to eligible projects, including \"eligible project,\" \"Indian tribe,\" \"nonprofit organization,\" and \"private forest land.\" Private forest land is defined as land with at least 50% forest cover, capable of producing commercial forest products, and owned by a private entity or Indian tribe. The Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space Program, established by the Secretary of Agriculture, aims to assist eligible entities in conserving private forest land threatened by suburban sprawl or nonforest uses, and to address significant suburban sprawl in communities. The program aims to support forest industries and employment in areas threatened by suburban sprawl or conversion to nonforest uses. National and state criteria are established for identifying eligible private forest land for conservation. The State criteria for identifying eligible private forest land for conservation must be established in consultation with the Committee and approved by the Secretary. Private forest land must be located in a state where less than 25% of the land is owned by the United States and be in an area affected or threatened by development. The program aims to address suburban sprawl and nonforest use threats in eligible areas by awarding competitive grants to entities for conservation projects. Entities are encouraged to provide public access to the land. Eligible entities must submit an application to the State forester to receive a grant. Entities seeking a grant under the program must submit an application to the State forester, including a description of the private forest land to be conserved and a stewardship plan outlining how the land will be managed and the public benefits it will provide. The State forester assesses the need for preserving suburban forest land and open space, considering housing needs, and submits the application to the Secretary for review. The Secretary reviews applications for grants under the program, either awarding a grant or providing reasons for disapproval with a deadline for resubmission. Priority is given based on the assessment of need and established criteria. The Secretary gives priority to applicants proposing projects that promote suburban forest preservation, containment of sprawl, sustainable forest management, community involvement, value-added forest products, and protection of resources. The program gives priority to projects promoting suburban forest preservation, sustainable management, community involvement, and protection of resources. Grants awarded cover up to 50% of total project costs, with recipients required to secure the remaining funding. The program provides grants for eligible projects, with funding options including cash or in-kind donations. Grant funds can be used to purchase private forest land or interests at fair market value from willing sellers. The program allows the purchase of forest land below fair market value with certification of willingness from the landowner. Title to purchased land can be held by a State, local government, or nonprofit organization. Conservation easement rights may transfer to the State if determined necessary. The program allows the purchase of forest land below fair market value with certification of willingness from the landowner. Title to purchased land can be held by a State, local government, or nonprofit organization. Conservation easement rights may transfer to the State if determined necessary. If the State finds that the local government or nonprofit organization is unable or unwilling to enforce the terms of the easement, or if the easement has been modified in a way inconsistent with the program's purposes, it may convey the easement to another entity. Administrative costs are subject to approval by the Secretary and any relevant regulations. The Secretary can use funds under subsection (k) to cover State administrative costs for the program. A report on eligible projects must be submitted to Congress. Authorization of appropriations includes $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 and necessary sums for subsequent years."
