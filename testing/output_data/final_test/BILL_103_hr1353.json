    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which allows for a partial exclusion of dividends and interest received by individuals. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 excludes dividends and interest received by individuals up to a maximum of $5,000 ($10,000 for joint returns). Certain dividends from tax-exempt corporations are also excluded. The special rules under this section apply to distributions from regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts. Distributions by a trust are deemed to have been received by the beneficiary on the same date. Nonresident alien individuals may be ineligible for exclusion. Nonresident alien individuals are subject to exclusion only in specific cases related to dividends and interest connected to US trade or business. Clerical and conforming amendments are made to the tax code. Sec. 116 allows for partial exclusion of dividends and interest received by individuals. Amendments are made to sections 265(a), 584(c), and 643(a) of the tax code to reflect this exclusion. Amendments are made to section 643(a) of the tax code to include dividends or interest excluded from gross income under section 116. Section 854 is also amended to address the treatment of dividends received from regulated investment companies under section 116. The tax code is amended to include dividends or interest excluded from gross income under section 116. Dividends received from regulated investment companies are also addressed in the amendments. Dividends and interest received by a company during the taxable year determine how they are treated, with deductions allowable for interest received. Shareholders are notified of the amount of any dividends. The tax code amendments address dividends excluded from gross income under section 116. Shareholders are notified of the amount of dividends that can be considered for exclusion. Definitions for terms like gross income and aggregate dividends received are provided. The tax code amendments specify that dividends received from real estate investment trusts meeting certain requirements are not considered as dividends for exclusion under section 116. Dividends from qualifying real estate investment trusts are treated as interest if the trust's aggregate interest income equals or exceeds 75% of its gross income. If not, a portion of the dividend is treated as interest based on the ratio of interest income to gross income. Gross income excludes net capital gain for these purposes. For real estate investment trusts, gross income excludes net capital gain. Aggregate interest received is reduced by allowable deductions under section 163. Gross income is also reduced by certain taxes imposed by section 857(b). Distributions by a real estate investment trust designated as interest for exclusion under section 116 are limited. The amendments made by this section regarding the limitation on distributions under section 116 apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1992."
