    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Information Dissemination and Research Accountability Act\". The Congress finds that the Federal Government must ensure the accessibility of biomedical research results for the research community and Federal agencies to prevent duplicative research and reduce the use of laboratory animals. The Federal Government must ensure accessibility of biomedical research results to prevent duplicative research and reduce the use of laboratory animals. Inadequate funding for the National Library of Medicine has hindered its ability to support the creation of new information for teaching and demonstrations, including audiovisual aids and computer graphics. This lack of support has also impacted the storage and dissemination of full-text biomedical information. The advancement of modern technology, such as optical videodiscs, allows for efficient storage and dissemination of vast amounts of biomedical information. This technology can be easily reproduced and distributed to medical libraries, benefiting the scientific community. The purposes of this Act are to establish a National Center for Research Accountability, provide for comprehensive literature search before approving Federal funding for research involving live animals, prevent duplicative experimentation on live animals, and promote modern technologies for biomedical information storage and dissemination. The Act aims to establish a National Center for Research Accountability and promote modern technologies for biomedical information storage and dissemination, including training specialists, providing full-text research results to medical libraries, and using modern technologies for teaching and demonstrations. The National Center for Research Accountability is established to promote modern technologies for biomedical information storage and dissemination. The National Center for Research Accountability is established at the National Library of Medicine to assist in eliminating duplication of effort in Federal research proposals involving live animals. The President appoints twenty members to carry out the Center's responsibilities without political affiliation based on demonstrated ability. The National Center for Research Accountability is established at the National Library of Medicine to prevent duplication in Federal research proposals involving live animals. The President appoints experts in biomedical information sciences from various Federal agencies to serve at the Center full-time and can only be removed by the President. The President appoints a qualified biomedical information science expert as the Director of the Center on a full-time basis, without political affiliation, solely based on demonstrated ability. The Director can only be removed by the President and may appoint a clerical staff with approval. The President, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, approves the use of clerical staff from the National Library of Medicine by the Director of the Center. Adequate office space, equipment, and supplies are provided for the Center's operation. Federal agencies must submit research proposals involving live animals to the Center for approval before carrying out or funding them. The Center determines if research proposals are duplicative and may award contracts for literature searches. The President appoints individuals to serve without conflicts of interest. The President may appoint advisors to serve without compensation. The Center must submit an annual report to the President and Congress summarizing its actions. The National Library of Medicine is modernizing biomedical information storage and dissemination. The National Library of Medicine is acquiring and storing biomedical information from Federal agencies, making it available to medical libraries upon request. They also support the creation of new information for teaching and demonstrations. The National Library of Medicine provides new teaching and demonstration information to research institutions and supports training in biomedical information technologies through stipends, awards, and grants. The term \"cost\" is defined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Additionally, the Library may award contracts to the private-sector data recording industry to improve services. The National Library of Medicine supports the development of information technologies for storing and disseminating biomedical information. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may appoint advisers to assist the Library. The Library must provide an annual report to Congress on its progress and future actions. Definitions for the Act include terms like \"animal,\" \"agency,\" \"Center,\" \"Library,\" and \"research proposal.\" Authorization of appropriations is granted for fiscal years starting after September 30, 1993."
