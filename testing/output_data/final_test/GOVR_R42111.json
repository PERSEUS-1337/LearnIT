    "content": "In the short run, policies like spending increases and tax cuts can stimulate an underemployed economy, leading to increased employment and output. The largest effects come from direct spending and transfers to lower-income individuals. Long-run growth, on the other hand, is driven by factors like labor participation, capital increases, education, and technological advances. The report addresses the long-term growth issue by summarizing historical insights on the effect of tax rates on economic growth, labor force participation, savings, and investment. Past changes in tax rates have shown no clear effect on economic growth and associated factors. Discussions focus on individuals in top tax brackets who contribute significantly to savings and entrepreneurship. The relationship between labor supply, savings, and growth rates for the top marginal rates, as well as capital gains tax rates, is discussed. Over the past 50 years, labor force participation rates for men and women have shown opposite trends. The top marginal income tax rate on labor income has decreased over the past six decades. Figure 1 illustrates these relationships. The downward trend in top marginal tax rates on labor income and the stable effective tax rate are unlikely to be driving factors for the divergent trends in male and female labor force participation rates. While tax changes have been abrupt, hours worked have steadily declined globally. U.S. savings have been decreasing over the past 60 years, as shown in Figure 3. Savings as a percentage of national income has declined by 14 percentage points over the past 60 years, with fluctuations in top marginal tax rates on capital gains income. The maximum tax rate on capital gains income reached 40% in the 1970s before dropping to around 15% today. Despite changes in tax rates, the decline in savings is unlikely to be solely caused by tax rate fluctuations. Changes in tax rates led to a steady decrease in savings as a percentage of national income over the past six decades. Maximum income tax rates applied to various investments, with corporate tax rates also declining over time. Higher top tax rates seemed to correlate with lower GDP growth and net fixed investment. The full 60-year time period can be divided into three shorter periods with varying tax rates on labor income and capital gains. Real GDP growth and net fixed investment declined over time, indicating that lower taxes did not lead to higher economic growth or investment. Using a shorter time period may provide a clearer analysis due to changes in the economy over time. Table 2 breaks down the recent time period into three shorter periods with different income tax rates. The data does not show a clear link between lower taxes and higher economic growth. Theoretical insights and empirical evidence on output and growth are discussed in more detail in cited CRS reports. The increase in wages or decrease in taxes can impact labor supply, with after-tax income potentially leading to more leisure consumption and reduced labor supply. However, the substitution effect may promote an increase in labor supply. Empirical evidence suggests small and uncertain effects on labor supply from higher wages. Historical evidence shows a decrease in work hours over time, with men's participation declining and women's increasing possibly due to societal changes. Econometric studies have found minimal, and sometimes negative, labor supply responses. Recent research has shown that tax cuts have similar effects on labor supply as wages, with small responses for both men and women. Marginal tax rate reductions are more effective in inducing a positive supply response, especially for women. High-income men are found to be relatively unresponsive to tax changes. The impact of taxes on savings remains ambiguous in theory. The effect of taxes on savings is ambiguous, with substitution effects increasing savings but income effects reducing the need for larger savings. Empirical evidence shows a negligible or negative savings response, with studies suggesting no significant impact on output even with the highest elasticity estimates. The savings rate remained constant until the 1980s when it declined due to reductions in capital income taxes and the introduction of tax-preferred savings vehicles like individual retirement accounts. Eliminating capital income taxes has a modest effect on output, increasing it by 4/10 of 1% after 10 years and 9/10 of 1% after 25 years. Inter-temporal models predict large savings responses to tax changes but are complex and stylized. In a closed economy, capital accumulation depends on domestic saving, while in an open economy, capital can be increased by foreign investment. Corporate rate cuts could affect this inflow, but estimates are small due to imperfect capital mobility. The effect of a 10-percentage point cut in the corporate income tax is estimated to increase output by about 15/100 of 1%, with U.S. citizens benefiting less than 2/100 of 1%. Moving from a 15% to a 20% tax on capital gains would raise the tax rate on corporate equity capital by about 6/10 of a percentage point, resulting in an overall tax rate increase in the economy by about 2/10 of 1%. Investment in research and development is favorably treated by the tax code, with most research costs deducted when incurred. Education and infrastructure are supported by public spending. Technological advances and organizational innovations can lead to larger output with enhancements in productivity. Economists struggle to determine the causes of these advancements. Investment in research and development is supported by the tax code, with most research costs deducted when incurred. Education and infrastructure are also favorably treated. Arguments have been made about the impact of raising top tax rates on small businesses, but evidence suggests that changes would affect only a small fraction of businesses. Higher tax rates may encourage self-employment, but overall, changing tax rates is likely to have small effects on labor supply and output. Claims have been made about the limited effects of tax reductions on labor supply, capital, and output. Feedback effects from tax cuts are said to be minimal, with a revenue feedback effect of about 1% for the 2001-2004 Bush-era tax cuts. Studies have shown that changes in tax rates have small effects on tax revenues. Studies have shown that feedback effects from tax cuts are minimal, with estimates ranging from 3% to 10%. Recent research suggests that the feedback effect from capital gains taxes is around 20%, lower than previously thought. Claims have been made that a corporate rate cut could pay for itself through capital flows. A corporate rate cut may not fully pay for itself through capital flows from abroad. Using estimates from a model, a 10 percentage point cut in the corporate tax rate only offset revenue losses by about 5%. Positive feedback effects were outweighed by interest and crowding out effects of debt, increasing the deficit by 25% and reducing output by 20%."
