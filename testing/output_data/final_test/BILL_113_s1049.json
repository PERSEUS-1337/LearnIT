    "content": "SECTION 1. EXPEDITED ACCESS TO CERTAIN FEDERAL LANDS. The Secretary will develop a process for expedited access to Federal lands for eligible organizations and individuals to conduct search-and-recovery missions. Access granted is for private purposes, not as Federal volunteers, and the Federal Torts Claim Act does not apply. The Federal Torts Claim Act and Federal Employee Compensation Act do not apply to eligible organizations or individuals conducting good Samaritan search-and-recovery missions on Federal lands. Liability insurance is not required if they acknowledge and consent to specific provisions in writing. The Secretary must notify eligible organizations and individuals of the approval or denial of a request for a good Samaritan search-and-recovery mission within 48 hours. If a request is denied, the Secretary must inform the organization or individual of the reasons for the denial. The Secretary notifies eligible organizations or individuals of denial reasons for a good Samaritan search-and-recovery mission request and provides guidance on meeting requirements for approval. Partnerships are developed for search-and-recovery missions on Federal lands, and a report is due within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress detailing plans to develop partnerships and efforts to expedite good Samaritan search-and-recovery missions for missing individuals on Federal lands. Definitions for \"eligible organization\" and \"eligible individual\" are provided for not-for-profit entities with certified training meeting specific standards. The curr_chunk defines \"good Samaritan search-and-recovery mission\" as a search for missing individuals believed to be deceased. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture."
