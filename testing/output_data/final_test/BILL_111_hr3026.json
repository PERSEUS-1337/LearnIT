    "content": "The \"Hazard Mitigation For All Act of 2009\" is added as an amendment to the United States Housing Act of 1937, introducing the Hazard Mitigation for All Grant Program. The section aims to provide grant assistance to public housing agencies for pre-disaster mitigation and improving the resilience of residential structures. Grants are awarded to eligible agencies that have submitted applications selected by the Secretary. Grants are provided to public housing agencies that administer public housing projects or rental assistance programs for various groups. The funds are specifically for pre-disaster mitigation activities that benefit residents of the assisted housing. The grantee is required to improve roof deck attachments, create a secondary water barrier, install coverings for wind protection, reinforce roof covering, brace gable-ends, strengthen roof-to-wall connections, upgrade exterior wall openings, replace storm shutters and doors, and add anchor bolts or steel plates for foundation support. Additionally, they must brace short wood-stud walls inside the property. The curr_chunk discusses activities determined by the Secretary to improve storm resilience in assisted housing through various methods. It also outlines the matching requirement for public housing agencies receiving grants under this section. The government source, private contributions, and in-kind contributions are considered funds from sources other than a grant under this section. The Secretary may adjust the required contribution percentage based on the severity and frequency of storms in the area. Grants under this section must be used for eligible activities for assisted housing residents with incomes below 80% of the median income for the area, and for activities that improve storm resilience. The grant under this section may be used for eligible activities resulting in displacement of assisted residents, with accommodations required to be similar to existing housing, in a comparable community, and a reasonable distance away. Public housing agencies cannot provide grant amounts to owners of assisted housing unless units are made available for occupancy for a 5-year period. The grant award allows for occupancy preference to eligible families for rental assistance under section 8. Applications for the grant must be submitted by June 30 of the preceding fiscal year through the Office of Multifamily Housing Programs. The Office of Multifamily Housing Programs will establish selection criteria for public housing agencies applying for grants under this section. Criteria will consider factors such as the severity of natural disasters in the area, resident population demographics, agency capability, and effectiveness of proposed activities. The selection criteria for public housing agencies applying for grants under this section will include factors like the long-term viability of hazard mitigation improvements, use of energy-efficient methods, efforts to publicize hazard mitigation importance, commitment to ongoing non-Federal hazard mitigation measures, and ability to maintain funded activities. Grants under this section are awarded competitively, with a maximum of 15% allocated to any single public housing agency. Definitions for \"assisted housing\" are provided for clarity. The term 'assisted resident' refers to residents of public housing, residents of housing with project-based rental assistance, and families using tenant-based rental assistance. Eligible activities are defined as activities allowed under subsection (d). The funding authorized for activities under this section is $50,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2013, with regulations to be issued by the Secretary as needed."
