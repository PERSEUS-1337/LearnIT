Section 23399.45 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to define \"certified farmers' market\" and \"community event\" for this section. A licensed beer manufacturer can apply for a certified farmers' market beer sales permit to sell packaged beer at a certified farmers' market or community event. The permit allows the licensee, a family member over 21, or an employee to sell the beer within the county or adjacent county of the manufacturer's location. An instructional tasting event can be held at a certified farmers' market with a beer sales permit. The event must be authorized by the market operator and separated from the rest of the market by a barrier. Conductors of the event can include the licensee, a family member over 21, or an employee. Only one licensed beer manufacturer can hold an instructional tasting event at a farmers' market or community event, pouring a maximum of eight ounces of beer per person per day. Consumers are not allowed to leave the tasting area with an open beer container. Sales under the certified farmers\u2019 market beer sales permit are limited to the market or permitted community event area adjacent to it. The permit is valid for up to 12 months but only for one day a week at a specific location.
