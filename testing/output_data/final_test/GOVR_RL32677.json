The sector has reduced overall energy consumption but still uses energy directly for farm activities and indirectly through off-farm inputs like fertilizers. Direct energy costs are a significant but small part of total production expenses, varying by activity and location. Total energy costs, including indirect expenses, can have a larger impact on production expenses. Energy costs play a significant role in farm net revenues, especially for major field crop production. Changes in energy prices impact agricultural decisions on crop selection, cultivation methods, irrigation, and post-harvest strategies. This report explores the relationship between energy and agriculture in the United States, detailing current and historical energy use in the agricultural sector and how it varies across activities and regions. Energy use in agriculture is classified as direct (petroleum-based fuels) or indirect, with total energy costs affecting production expenses. Direct energy use in agriculture involves primarily petroleum-based fuels for operating vehicles, machinery, crop dryers, and irrigation equipment. Electricity is also utilized for lighting, heating, and cooling in homes and barns, as well as for dairy operations. Indirect energy is consumed for manufacturing fertilizers and pesticides. Oils and lubricants are necessary for farm machinery, while energy used to produce other inputs like machinery and equipment is not included in USDA's calculations. In 2002, the U.S. agricultural sector used 1.1 quadrillion Btu of direct energy, representing slightly over 1% of total U.S. energy consumption. This is a small share compared to other sectors like industry and transportation. Changes in energy supply and demand within agriculture can impact profitability and output mix. In 2002, U.S. agriculture used a significant amount of direct energy, impacting profitability and output mix. Agriculture's share of indirect energy use in fertilizer and pesticide is notably higher, with nitrogen fertilizer being the principal fertilizer used. Agriculture also accounted for a large portion of nitrogen use and pesticide expenditures in the U.S. in 2001. Natural gas plays a crucial role in agriculture as the main feedstock for nitrogenous fertilizers, representing a significant portion of production costs. It accounts for over 26% of total energy consumption in the agricultural sector, with 65% of total energy used in 2002 attributed to natural gas consumption. In 2002, 65% of the total energy used by the U.S. agricultural sector was direct energy, while 35% was indirect energy. Energy use peaked in 1978 at 2.4 quadrillion Btu, but has since declined due to increased energy efficiency measures. Switching to more fuel-efficient engines, conservation tillage practices, and new crop drying methods have all contributed to this decrease in energy consumption. The shift in energy sources in the U.S. agricultural sector has seen a decline in gasoline usage, from 41% in 1965 to 9% in 2002. Diesel fuel and electricity have increased in usage, with diesel fuel being more cost-effective and efficient. This shift is attributed to the transition from gasoline-powered to diesel-powered machinery. Since 1979, there has been a decline in farm machinery inventories due to capital depreciation exceeding expenditure. Factors contributing to this include increased machine efficiency, shifts towards reduced tillage practices, and conservation tillage methods. Fertilizer and pesticide use in U.S. agriculture showed a rise from 1965 to 1986, then declined by 2002. The use of fertilizers and pesticides in U.S. agriculture increased from 1965 to 1986, then declined by 2002. Efficiency gains in energy use, precision farming, genetically engineered crops, and improved pesticide products have all contributed to lower input volumes without sacrificing yield gains. Since 1980, U.S. agriculture has shown significant efficiency gains in energy use, with direct energy use per unit of output continuously decreasing. Indirect energy use per unit of output has also decreased, although with more variability. Despite gaining more options to respond to energy price changes, most energy price increases still lead to lower farm income. In the 2000-2003 period, U.S. farmers spent an average of nearly $194 billion on total production expenses, with energy expenses accounting for nearly 15% of this total. In the 2000-2003 period, U.S. farmers spent nearly $28.8 billion on energy expenses, accounting for nearly 15% of total production expenses. Energy costs in agricultural production are influenced by factors such as planted acres, crop and livestock mix, weather conditions, and energy prices. The majority of energy used in the U.S. is derived from petroleum-based sources or natural gas, leading to limited success in reducing energy costs by switching fuel sources. Energy costs in agricultural production have varied over the years, with direct energy's share of total farm costs averaging about 5% since the mid-1990s. Electricity's share of production costs has remained steady at around 1.9%, while fuel costs have decreased to an average of 3.3% since 1994 due to efficiency improvements in farm machinery. Indirect energy costs, such as fertilizers and pesticides, have fluctuated between 8% and 12% of total farm production expenses over the past 40 years, with a notable spike in 1974 due to increased fertilizer prices. In 1971, USDA's Economic Stabilization Program froze U.S. fertilizer prices, but controls were removed in 1973, leading to a sharp increase in fertilizer prices. Indirect energy costs have trended downward to about a 9% share in 2003. Pesticides, including herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides, make up the majority of agricultural chemical expenditures. Pesticide costs have grown significantly from less than 1% before 1960 to nearly 5% in 1998. The total pounds of farm chemicals applied to crops increased until 1980, with rising per-unit costs. From 1980 to 1998, higher per-unit prices were the main reason for the cost share increase. Quality improvements in pesticide ingredients and application methods have limited usage growth since 1980 but led to higher per-unit prices. In 2002, fertilizer expenses accounted for 5% of agricultural production costs and were the largest farm energy expenditure at 34% of total energy costs. In 2002, fertilizer accounted for the largest share of farm energy expenditures at 34% of total energy costs. Nitrogen-based fertilizers make up the majority of total fertilizer use in the U.S., with 56% share compared to potash and phosphate. The demand for fertilizer depends on various factors like soil type, climate, and crop rotations. Fertilizers provide nutrients that enhance plant growth and crop yield, with U.S. farms using nearly 12 million metric tons of nitrogen fertilizers annually. The United States imports nitrogen fertilizers from various sources, including Canada, Middle Eastern countries, and other nations like Bulgaria, China, and Russia. Natural gas is crucial for U.S. fertilizer production, particularly in the production of anhydrous ammonia, which is used as a nitrogen fertilizer and in the production of other nitrogen fertilizers. Natural gas is a key component in the production of nitrogen fertilizers, accounting for 75% to 90% of production costs. It is also important in the production of phosphates and potash, influencing prices in the fertilizer market. Higher fertilizer prices can lead to lower application rates or a shift towards crops less dependent on fertilizer. Field crops like corn and wheat have the highest fertilizer usage due to their large planting areas. Fuel and fertilizer prices are more variable than pesticide prices, impacting agriculture significantly, especially for field crop production. The agricultural sector is heavily dependent on petroleum products for farming operations, with limited options for fuel switching. Natural gas price increases can impact the sector due to its role in fertilizer manufacturing. Production expenses and energy costs vary by activity and region. Machinery, trucks, and cars used in field work, marketing, and management rely on petroleum fuels. Grain dryers and irrigation equipment can be powered by petroleum fuels, natural gas, or electricity. Electricity is the primary source for lighting, heating, and cooling in farm buildings. Energy costs in agricultural production in the United States totaled $24 billion in 2002, with $18.4 billion spent on crops and $5.7 billion on livestock. Energy expenses accounted for nearly 14% of total production costs, with crop production attributing 23% of expenses to energy compared to 6% for livestock. Production activities with higher energy costs are more sensitive to price fluctuations. Field crop production involves multiple passes over the field with various equipment for preparation, planting, cultivation, and harvesting. Fuel consumption depends on machine efficiency, number of passes, and field size. Indirect energy use for pesticides and fertilizers varies by crop and region. Irrigation further increases energy usage. In 2002, 55.3 million acres of cropland were irrigated, requiring additional energy for pumping equipment. In 2002, approximately 55.3 million acres of cropland were irrigated, varying based on weather and soil conditions. Irrigation usage can differ depending on the crop grown, with rice being fully irrigated compared to only 6% of wheat production. Harvested crops often require additional energy for on-farm processing, such as drying for storage and processing, ginning cotton, and curing tobacco. Tobacco needs to be cured to develop its quality, flavor, and aroma before processing. Energy costs account for a significant portion of production expenses for crops like rice, barley, and peanuts. Energy costs make up a significant portion of production expenses for rice, barley, and peanuts, representing about 29% to 30% of total production costs. In contrast, soybeans have lower energy costs, accounting for only 14% of total production expenses. For major U.S. program crops like corn, wheat, and cotton, energy costs represent 22% to 27% of total production expenses, making crop selection and profitability more sensitive to energy price fluctuations. Fruit and vegetable production activities vary in mechanization and labor input, with irrigation and chemicals playing important roles in the production process. Energy costs are a significant part of production expenses for various crops and livestock. In 2002, vegetable and melon energy costs accounted for 22% of total production expenses, while fruit and tree nut energy costs represented 17%. Energy usage in activities like temperature regulation, disease control, and watering made up less than 10% of total production costs in greenhouse and nursery production. Pasture management and marketing activities are key energy users in cattle grazing operations, with energy costs making up about 12% of total expenses in beef cattle ranching in 2002. In 2002, energy costs accounted for about 12% of total beef cattle ranching expenses. Cattle ranching also accounted for a significant share of national agriculture-related energy consumption, including over 15% of fuel expenses and 10% of fertilizer costs used by U.S. agriculture. The energy share is due to the vast acreage and large number of animals involved in beef cattle ranching. Aquaculture production includes fish farming of major species like catfish, salmon, shrimp, and mussels, with varying energy needs for production processes and species. Aquaculture operations, dairy farms, and feedlot operations all have significant energy costs. In 2002, aquaculture had energy costs of $445 million, dairy operations had energy costs of $1.2 billion, and feedlot operations had energy expenses of $2.3 billion. These costs accounted for a significant portion of total production expenses for each sector. In 2002, energy expenses for hog and pork production totaled $526 million, accounting for less than 5% of total production costs. Poultry and egg production had energy costs of $534 million, representing 3% of their total production expenses. Specialized facilities with heating, cooling, feeding, and watering systems dominate both sectors. In 2002, energy expenses for poultry and egg production totaled $534 million, accounting for 3% of total production costs. The Corn Belt region had the highest agricultural energy costs of $6.5 billion, with 75% in indirect energy expenditures. The Corn Belt region has the highest agricultural energy costs at $6.5 billion, with 75% in indirect energy expenditures. The region also leads in LP gas expenditures for crop drying. The Pacific region relies heavily on direct fuels, particularly electricity, with $1 billion in outlays in 2002. Diesel and total fuel costs are highest in regions with large planted crop areas like the Corn Belt and Northern Plains. Irrigation of field crops is a significant source of energy demand. The United States has seen a steady increase in petroleum import dependency over the past four decades, with imports accounting for over 55% of domestic consumption in 2003 and projected to reach 70% by 2025. This heavy import reliance is not unique to the US, as other Western industrial countries like Japan and OECD Europe are also heavily dependent on imported oil. This dependence on international sources for energy needs results in US energy prices being influenced by international market conditions, particularly crude oil supplies. The United States is heavily dependent on imported oil, making it vulnerable to price movements and supply disruptions in international energy markets. Agriculture is particularly at risk from energy price increases. The US has experienced four major oil price shocks in the last three decades. Reducing energy dependence on foreign sources could help alleviate price volatility but may lead to higher prices. Global markets have seen a surge in crude oil and natural gas prices in the past two years, reaching record high levels. Crude oil prices hit $43.60 per barrel in October 2004, while natural gas prices have been increasing steadily since 1999. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) play important roles in promoting competitive natural gas markets. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) analyzes trends in the natural gas market. Increased use of natural gas for electricity generation has led to rising demand in the United States, while production has grown slowly. Infrastructure constraints limit access to international supplies of natural gas. Certain infrastructure constraints limit access to international supplies of natural gas, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico. Pipeline transport is the primary method, restricting access to offshore production. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) offers an alternative but faces costly infrastructure requirements and safety concerns. The tightening U.S. supply situation has led to higher natural gas prices, impacting farm fuel, fertilizer costs, and U.S. fertilizer production. According to the GAO, total U.S. nitrogen consumption in 2002 was about 21.4 million short tons, with agriculture using 56% of it. The manufacturing sector used over 9 million tons for industrial purposes like promoting bacterial growth and making plastics. Fertilizer production, especially nitrogenous fertilizers, is energy intensive, with natural gas accounting for a significant portion of production costs. U.S. fertilizer manufacturers face a competitive disadvantage when domestic natural gas prices rise, as prices in foreign countries with major nitrogen production capabilities tend to be lower. In early 2001, natural gas prices in the Middle East, North Africa, Russia, and Venezuela were significantly lower than U.S. prices. The federal government does not control nitrogen fertilizer prices, and imported products are not restricted by U.S. trade policies. High domestic natural gas prices have led to the closure of U.S. nitrogen production plants, resulting in a loss of domestic production capacity. In 1998, U.S. ammonia plant production capacity was 21.4 million tons. By 2003/04, 3.5 million tons of capacity was closed and 1.5 million tons idled, leaving 16.3 million tons (76.5%) active. Advocates for the U.S. fertilizer industry push for changes in laws to increase natural gas supply or reduce demand for power generation. They suggest accessing federal lands for drilling and offering tax incentives to boost domestic natural gas production. Alternatively, they propose relaxing environmental restrictions on coal plants and promoting nuclear and hydro licenses. Restrictions on coal plants, promoting clean coal technology, and taxing natural gas use in power generation permits could reduce domestic demand for natural gas. Environmentalist organizations oppose these suggestions. The National Petroleum Council's report in September 2003 recognized high natural gas prices and suggested energy conservation and efficiency to lower prices. The rise in gas prices led to a significant increase in nitrogen fertilizer prices. By April 2001, natural gas prices had risen by 138% to $4.52 per mcf, while anhydrous ammonia prices had increased by 89% to $399 per short ton. This resulted in a 25% decline in nitrogen production in the U.S. fertilizer industry in 2001. The U.S. fertilizer industry experienced a 25% decline in nitrogen production in 2001. Despite this, the domestic supply of nitrogen fertilizer was sufficient to meet farmers' demand, with increased imports and decreased farm use offsetting the production decrease. However, these market adjustments led to higher fertilizer prices. The return to high natural gas and fertilizer prices in 2003 posed a threat to the industry, with projections showing a potential negative impact on U.S. net cash farm income. The rise in energy and fertilizer prices has increased production expenses for farmers, with natural gas prices up 177%, gasoline prices up 21%, and diesel prices up 23% compared to the previous year. The USDA's prices paid index for fuels and fertilizer also saw increases. These price changes are expected to reduce net farm income in the short term as farmers are unable to quickly pass on higher costs. Higher energy prices in 2004 are impacting the agricultural sector, with fertilizer prices up 10% and pesticide prices unchanged. This is projected to increase total energy costs by $3.6 billion, leading to lower net cash income for farmers. The rise in fuel costs is expected to affect various production expenditure categories, potentially resulting in substantial crop and activity mix changes if energy price trends continue into 2005. Prices increase farm energy costs directly through higher fuel costs and indirectly through higher fertilizer and pesticide costs. Agricultural producers respond to energy price changes based on the time frame and their expectations of the change's duration. If perceived as temporary, producers may economize on fuel use, adjust fertilizer and pesticide application, or switch between fuels. In the short run, producers may have limited response to energy and fertilizer cost increases. Economic studies show that a 10% rise in fuel prices leads to a 6% decline in fuel use, a 6.6% decrease in fertilizer use, and a 5.3% decline in pesticide use. Producers may adjust their farm's activity mix and production practices in response to permanent energy price changes. Pesticide use can be reduced by switching to less intensive production methods or crops with fewer inputs. Producers adjust their crop and activity mix in response to input price changes, impacting farm income. Demand for petroleum products in agriculture is influenced by acres planted, production practices, weather, and energy prices. Switching among fuel sources is limited due to the majority of energy being derived from petroleum-based sources. Energy prices impact food production costs and consumer prices. Food manufacturing, transportation, and storage all contribute to energy expenses. Retailers use more energy to maintain perishable food products. Energy expenses make up 3.5% of food costs and transportation expenses make up 4%. The energy bill covers costs of electricity, natural gas, and fuels in food industry. Farmers get 19\u00a2 for every $1 spent on food, with marketers responsible for 81\u00a2. Higher energy costs can be passed on to consumers through the production-marketing system. Agriculture relies on energy inputs, and unstable prices can affect profitability. The 2002 farm bill includes provisions to promote energy independence in agriculture. The 2002 farm bill includes provisions to promote renewable energy sources like biofuels, wind, and solar energy, but agricultural energy production remains small. Current energy legislation struggles to address challenges in the nitrogen fertilizer production sector due to rising natural gas prices. The energy legislation (H.R. 6, H.Rept. 108-375) faced challenges in Congress over cost and a dispute on liability protection for MTBE. Senator Domenici introduced a revised bill (S. 2095) with lower costs and without the MTBE provision, but it also stalled. Key provisions include a Renewable Fuels Standard and the Alaska Gas Pipeline project. Alaska's North Slope holds 30 trillion cubic feet of undeveloped proven natural gas reserves, about 18% of total U.S. reserves. Two bills propose $18 billion in loan guarantees for a gas pipeline from Alaska to Alberta. New energy efficiency standards would be established for various products and appliances. Royalty reductions on federal lands aim to encourage energy production. Federal Lands\u2014 Royalty reductions proposed for marginal oil and gas wells on public lands and the outer continental shelf to encourage production. Provisions to increase access for energy projects like drilling activities, electric transmission lines, and gas pipelines. No provision for a Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) in either bill. Btu (British thermal unit) used as a common benchmark to measure energy content of different fuel types."
