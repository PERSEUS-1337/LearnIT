    "content": "The \"Cryptocurrency Protocol Protection and Moratorium Act\" (CryptPMA) is also known as the CryptPMA. It includes a moratorium. The Cryptocurrency Protocol Protection and Moratorium Act prohibits the imposition of restrictions on cryptocurrency creation, use, and transfer for five years after enactment, except for existing statutes. The Cryptocurrency Protocol Protection and Moratorium Act allows government agencies to enforce existing criminal, civil, and taxation laws without hindrance. The Cryptocurrency Protocol Protection and Moratorium Act defines key terms and provisions. The Cryptocurrency Protocol Protection and Moratorium Act defines key terms such as algorithm, algorithmic chain (blockchain), cryptographic proof, protocol, and service (Internal Revenue Service). The definition of \"Service\" refers to the Internal Revenue Service. The term \"Cryptocurrency\" encompasses code-based protocols for exchanging value through electronic, non-physical media. This term is used to avoid confusion and is similar to terms like \"digital currency\" or \"virtual currency\". SEC. 4. DECLARATION OF MORATORIUM. It is the sense of Congress to refrain from passing new laws or regulations regarding cryptocurrencies until the moratorium expires. Congress believes that the use of cryptographic proof for cryptocurrency transactions without third-party intermediaries can lead to economic efficiencies and growth. The use of cryptographic proof for cryptocurrency transactions, without third-party intermediaries, can lead to economic growth and enhance the economic well-being of the American people. SEC. 5. DECLARATION OF NEUTRAL TAX TREATMENT. Congress believes that cryptocurrency production, possession, and use should not be discouraged by tax codes or regulations. They urge the IRS to issue regulations treating virtual currencies as currency for fair tax treatment. The tax treatment of cryptocurrency as property discourages its use in commerce due to its illiquidity and limited acceptance. This hinders economic activity, innovation, and growth as taxpayers accepting cryptocurrency are taxed based on its volatile fair market value. The tax treatment of cryptocurrency as property can lead to overtaxation or overpayment, acting as a deterrent to accepting cryptocurrency in payment. Congress suggests that taxpayers should only realize income when cryptocurrency is converted into official currency. The tax treatment of cryptocurrency as property aims to accurately measure actual income received, similar to statutory stock options. Congress suggests income should be taxed when it is actual, not theoretical, to avoid risks of loss through liquidity or conversion issues. The sense of Congress is that income from cryptocurrency in trade or business should be defined as net proceeds from conversion to dollars. Congress also believes that taxing mined cryptocurrency as income when produced is inequitable and penalizes income-producing efforts unfairly. The IRS should tax mined cryptocurrency as income only when proceeds are converted into dollars, directing the Service to issue regulations consistent with this approach. SEC. 6. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this title, or any amendment made by this title, is found to violate the Constitution, other provisions of the title will not be affected."
