    "content": "Iraq's government declared victory against ISIS in December 2017, but insurgent attacks by remaining fighters continue to threaten the country. Security has improved since ISIS lost territory, but fighters are still active in some areas. Resettlement, reconstruction, and political reform are ongoing challenges. Ethnic, religious, and tribal identities play a significant role in Iraqi politics, along with partisanship and economic disparities. Legislative elections in May 2018 were delayed in certifying results, impacting the formation of the next government. Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al Abadi sought reelection but his electoral list's third-place showing undermined his chances for a second term. In September 2018, a statement from Shia religious leader Grand Ayatollah Ali al Sistani called for a new prime minister from outside current or former officials. Barham Salih was chosen as Iraq's President, who then appointed Adel Abd al Mahdi as Prime Minister. Paramilitary forces in Iraq have grown stronger since 2014, with ties to Iran. The Shia Arab majority, along with Sunni Arab and Kurdish minorities, exercise power. Despite diversity, Iraqis demand improved security, government effectiveness, and economic opportunity. Large protests occurred in southern Iraq in August and September. Iraqi politicians are using cross-sectarian narratives to address citizen discontent with poor service delivery and corruption. Identity-driven politics still play a significant role in the country. The Kurdistan Region of northern Iraq has considerable autonomy and held legislative elections in September 2018. Neighboring countries and the United States are involved in Iraq, sometimes in competition. In October 2017, the national government imposed a ban on international flights to and from the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), leading to tensions with the Trump Administration and the United Nations Security Council. Iraqi security forces reasserted control over disputed areas previously held by Kurdish forces, including the oil-rich governorate of Kirkuk. Kurdish politics have been divided by these controversies, with Iraqi and Kurdish security forces facing off along contested lines. Stabilization and reconstruction efforts are needed in areas liberated from the Islamic State, with 1.9 million Iraqis still internally displaced. The United States has provided extensive economic assistance to Iraq, aiming to bolster the government's effectiveness and public financial management. U.S. engagement with Iraq since 2011 has focused on reinforcing unifying tendencies and avoiding divisive outcomes, while minimizing direct military involvement. Additionally, the U.S. is the leading provider of humanitarian assistance to Iraq and supports post-IS stabilization activities through grants. The Trump Administration has maintained a cooperative relationship with the Iraqi government and requested funding for stabilization and security training. The U.S. military presence in Iraq has adapted to changing conditions since 2017. The 115th Congress has allocated funds for military operations against ISIS and provided security assistance, humanitarian relief, and foreign aid for Iraq. Legislation for FY2019 is expected to continue current policies and programs. In December 2017, Iraqi officials declared victory against the Islamic State, ending their exclusive control over territories in Iraq. However, the U.S. intelligence community warned of the Islamic State maintaining a robust insurgency in Iraq and Syria. Iraqi security operations are ongoing in Anbar, Ninewa, Diyala, and Salah al Din against IS fighters to disrupt their efforts to reestablish themselves. IS attacks continue in rural areas, with fighters threatening and intimidating citizens. New displacement is occurring as civilians flee IS attacks. Iraqi voters went to the polls on May 12, 2018, to elect national legislators for the 329-seat Council of Representatives. The election saw lower turnout and reported irregularities, leading to a recount that delayed certification until August. The results have influenced negotiations to form the largest bloc in the COR, with the Sa'irun coalition led by Muqtada al Sadr's Istiqama list winning 54 seats. Iran and the United States are closely monitoring the talks and consulting with Iraqi leaders. The Iraqi election results saw the Sa'irun coalition led by Muqtada al Sadr winning 54 seats, followed by the Fatah coalition led by Hadi al Ameri with 48 seats. Prime Minister Haider al Abadi's Nasr coalition placed third with 42 seats. Other significant blocs of seats were won by Nouri al Maliki's State of Law coalition, Ammar al Hakim's Hikma list, and Iyad Allawi's Wataniya list. Kurdish parties KDP and PUK also won seats, with smaller opposition lists alleging irregularities. The PUK won the most seats in the Iraqi election, leading to protests over alleged irregularities. Popular unrest in southern Iraq due to issues like unemployment and corruption escalated, with mass demonstrations in Basra resulting in the burning of the Iranian consulate and political offices. Some protestors have been intimidated or killed, with accusations of outside instigation by pro-Iran groups. The Trump Administration announced the temporary removal of U.S. personnel from the Consulate in Basra due to threats from Iran and Iranian-backed groups. The government-formation process in Iraq continues, with leaders filling key positions. Previous governments in Iraq have had a Shia Arab Prime Minister, a Kurdish President, and a Sunni Arab Council of Representatives Speaker. The newly elected Council of Representatives in Iraq appointed Mohammed al Halbousi as Speaker, Hassan al Kaabi as First Deputy Speaker, and Bashir Hajji Haddad as Second Deputy Speaker. Barham Salih was elected as President, who then nominated Adel Abd al Mahdi as Prime Minister-designate to form a government for approval by the Council by November 1. The contest to form the largest bloc and designate a prime minister candidate in Iraq was influenced by protests and attacks, with candidates from former officialdom facing challenges due to public anti-incumbent sentiment. Grand Ayatollah Ali al Sistani called for a new government based on efficiency, integrity, courage, firmness, and loyalty to the country and people, emphasizing the need for senior officials to meet these standards. Sistani's office clarified that he did not intervene in selecting or rejecting specific prime ministerial candidates. Grand Ayatollah Ali al Sistani's office clarified that he did not intervene in selecting or rejecting specific prime ministerial candidates. Sistani emphasized the need for Iraq's elected leaders to fulfill their duties and not cling to power. Prime Minister Abadi and Badr Organization leader Hadi al Ameri announced they would not pursue the position of prime minister. Adel Abd al Mahdi is seen as a compromise candidate acceptable to different coalitions in Iraq. Some concerns have been raised about reported Iranian involvement in the nomination process. Abd al Mahdi's nomination as Prime Minister is viewed as acceptable by the Administration due to his past work with U.S. officials. He has a history of involvement in Iraqi politics, including serving as Minister of Finance and leading debt relief initiatives. While he advocates for inclusivity in political and religious matters, his connections to powerful Iraqi Shia forces and Iran raise concerns about his independence as a leader. The new government's success and the Prime Minister's ability to address controversial issues will depend on his freedom of action. The future of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Committee (PMC) and its militias, the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), is uncertain due to concerns about ties to Iran and their willingness to follow Iraq's government. U.S. intelligence sees Iranian support to PMC and Shia militants as the primary threat to U.S. personnel in Iraq. The primary threat to U.S. personnel in Iraq is assessed to increase as the threat from ISIS recedes, with tensions between Iran and the United States. Many PMF-associated groups participated in the 2018 national elections under the Fatah coalition. Despite some leaders nominally disassociating from the PMF, their supporters and units remain involved in ongoing operations. The unresolved issue with the PMC/PMF was a key concern during the election and its aftermath. The key unresolved issue with the PMC/PMF after the 2018 national elections is the incomplete implementation of a 2016 law to integrate the PMF into Iraq's national security establishment. Some PMF units are not fully under the authority of the Prime Minister and lack military discipline. Units associated with Shia groups receiving Iranian support are particularly affected. The popularity of the PMF and the challenges in integrating it into Iraq's national security establishment create complex political dynamics. Iraqi leaders have differing views on how to assert control over PMF units, with some favoring independence for units aligned with Iran. Embracing the PMF politically benefits Iraqi leaders, but the incomplete implementation of the 2016 law remains a key issue after the 2018 national elections. There are political costs to supporting the PMF and Iran-linked units. Fully dismantling the PMF structure is not feasible currently. Confrontation between Iraqi security forces and Iran-backed groups in the PMF could lead to civil conflict. Investigations into illicit activities by some PMF units have resulted in violence. The Fatah coalition has reacted angrily to these investigations. The Fatah coalition reacted angrily to Abadi's decision to dismiss Falih al Fayyadh in 2018. Grand Ayatollah Al Sistani emphasized the importance of institutional control over security forces in Iraq. Prime Minister Abadi has attempted to assert authority over the PMC/PMF and expressed support for U.S. military assistance. Muqtada al Sadr remains critical of U.S. policy. Sa'irun leader Muqtada al Sadr criticizes U.S. policy towards Iraq and the Middle East but has not called for immediate withdrawal of foreign forces. Defense Department sources suggest Iran-aligned groups are willing to accept continued U.S. military presence for training Iraqi forces. Iraq's emerging government shows no clear signs of changing U.S.-Iraq cooperation or integrating PMF into Iraqi Security Forces. Tensions between Kurdistan region and Baghdad government escalated after 2017 independence referendum. Tensions between the Kurdistan region and Baghdad government escalated after the 2017 independence referendum. Kurdish parties were divided over the referendum and faced changes in territorial control affecting their financial prospects. Elections for the Kurdistan National Assembly were delayed and held in September 2018, with the KDP winning a plurality of seats. U.S. officials urged Kurds and Iraqis to engage on disputes and avoid unilateral military actions. Iraqi and Kurdish officials continue to engage with U.S. counterparts on related issues. The public finances of the national government and the KRG in Iraq are strained due to lower oil prices, military campaign costs, and budget deficits. Oil exports account for 90% of public revenue, while non-oil sector growth is hindered by insecurity and corruption. Despite increased oil production and exports since 2016, revenue gains were undermined by oil price fluctuations until late 2017. Iraq's overall oil production is managed in line with Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreements. Iraq has agreed to manage its oil production in line with OPEC limits. In August 2018, Iraq exported 4 million barrels per day, exceeding the budget's export assumption. The IMF projects modest GDP growth, especially in the non-oil sector. Fiscal pressures are more acute in the Kurdistan region due to the fallout from the national government's response to the 2017 referendum. The national government's changes in oil shipments from Kirkuk to Turkey have led to a revenue decline for the KRG. Kurdish representatives criticized the 2018 budget proposal for allocating less funds to the KRG. The budget adopted in March 2018 requires the KRG to place all oil exports under federal control in exchange for financial allocations. U.N. officials report ongoing humanitarian concerns in the region. Humanitarian conditions in conflict-affected areas of Iraq remain difficult, with concerns of harassment by armed actors and threats of forced return. As of September 15, over 4 million Iraqis have returned to their districts since 2014, while more than 1.9 million individuals remain displaced. Ninewa governorate has the largest number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) due to intense military operations against the Islamic State in Mosul. Thousands of civilians were killed or wounded during the Mosul battle, displacing over 1 million people. The Kurdistan Region of Iraq hosts nearly 38% of the remaining IDP population in Iraq, with conditions for IDPs in Dohuk governorate being the most challenging. The U.N.'s 2018 Iraq humanitarian appeal sought $569 million to assist 3.4 million Iraqis, with $342 million in funds provided as of October 2018. Iraqi authorities described over $88 billion in reconstruction needs at a conference in Kuwait in February 2018. At a conference in Kuwait, Iraqi authorities outlined $88 billion in reconstruction needs across various sectors. Participating countries offered around $30 billion in loans, investments, and grants. The Trump Administration supported U.S. companies' participation and proposed $3 billion in Export-Import Bank support for Iraq. U.S. stabilization assistance in liberated areas is channeled through the UNDP-managed Funding Facility for Stabilization, with over $690 million in resources received since 2015. UNDP has identified a funding gap of $505 million for stabilization projects in strategic red box zones in Iraq. Challenges include unexploded ordnance, customs delays, and the growth of FFS projects. Iraqi leaders aim to attract private sector investment for reconstruction, but face obstacles like security concerns and corruption. Iraq's market size and energy resources make it appealing to investors. The new Iraqi government's reform plans signal investment opportunities amid concerns about security, service reliability, and corruption. Recent U.S. legislation provided additional funding for defense programs and post-IS stabilization efforts in Iraq. Congressional authorization for U.S. training and advisory programs for Iraq was extended in FY2019. The FY2018 NDAA extends congressional authorization for U.S. training, equipping, and advisory programs for Iraqi security forces until December 2020 and provides $850 million in additional defense funding for security assistance programs through FY2020. The Office of Security Cooperation at the U.S. Embassy in Iraq has expanded its authority to engage with all military and security forces with a national security mission. The Administration's FY2019 defense funding request includes plans for U.S. training of Iraqi border security. The FY2019 defense funding request includes plans for U.S. training of Iraqi border security forces, energy security forces, emergency response police units, Counterterrorism Service forces, and ranger units. The FY2019 Continuing Appropriations Act makes funds available for foreign operations programs in Iraq through December 7, 2018. The House version of the FY2019 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill would allocate funds for governance, security, and stabilization programs in Iraq, including in the Kurdistan Region. The Senate version of the FY2019 funding bill includes $429.4 million for various accounts, with $250 million for Foreign Military Financing assistance. Additional assistance monies would be allocated for a Relief and Recovery Fund for areas affected by terrorist organizations, with $100 million specifically for programs in Iraq. The Trump Administration's future assistance efforts will be influenced by the outcomes of these decisions. The Trump Administration's future U.S. assistance efforts in Iraq will be influenced by the outcome of government formation talks. There are concerns about individuals close to or controlled by Iran assuming positions of authority in Iraq's new government, which could lead to a reconsideration of U.S. support. Legislation in Congress would require reporting on Iraqi entities receiving Iranian support and authorize sanctions on individuals threatening Iraq's security. Military and counterterrorism operations against Islamic State supporters in Iraq are ongoing. The United States military and its coalition partners are conducting ongoing operations against Islamic State supporters in Iraq and Syria under the command of Combined Joint Task Force \u2013 Operation Inherent Resolve. The Trump Administration cites the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force as the legal basis for these operations, and the U.S. military presence in Iraq is governed by a bilateral Strategic Framework Agreement. The U.S. military and coalition partners are conducting operations against Islamic State supporters in Iraq and Syria under Operation Inherent Resolve. The U.S. military presence in Iraq is governed by a bilateral Strategic Framework Agreement, with ongoing training efforts for Iraqi security forces. Over $5.8 billion has been authorized for train and equip assistance in Iraq from FY2015 to FY2019. The Trump Administration has not reported the number of U.S. personnel in Iraq since September 2017. General Joseph Votel stated a reduction in U.S. military personnel in Iraq from 2017 levels. The coalition presence in Iraq is conditions-based and in coordination with the government. 67 U.S. military personnel and DOD civilians have been killed in OIR, with $23.5 billion spent on operations since August 2014. U.S. assistance to Iraq supports security and economic objectives. The United States has provided significant financial support to Iraq for security and economic objectives. This includes funding for defense equipment purchases, defense institution building, and humanitarian relief efforts. The Administration's FY2019 request includes over $199 million for non-military assistance programs in Iraq. The Senate version of the appropriations act would allocate $150 million in ESF and $250 million in Foreign Military Financing and security assistance funds for Iraq. The Senate version of the appropriations act would allocate $50 million in FY2019 ESF funds for stabilization in Iraq, in addition to $100 million in previously appropriated Relief and Recovery Fund-designated monies. The House version directs $50 million in FY2019 funds for assistance to support the safe return of displaced religious and ethnic minorities to their communities in Iraq. US support for stabilization programs in Iraq has been ongoing since FY2017. The Trump Administration seeks continued funding for post-IS stabilization programs in Iraq, including support for stabilizing the Mosul Dam. There have been no new contributions to U.N.-managed stabilization programs in 2018. The U.S. aims to counter Iran's influence in the region while strengthening its partnership with Iraq. The U.S. aims to solidify a long-term partnership with the government of Iraq and ensure economic stability. Policy questions include the makeup of the Iraqi government, compliance with U.S. sanctions on Iran, future U.S. military presence, security assistance to Iraqi forces, relations with Iraqi constituent groups, and responses to Iran-aligned entities in the region. The 115th Congress has considered imposing U.S. sanctions on some Iran-aligned Iraqi groups. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on Iran-aligned Iraqi groups and enacted legislation requiring reporting on Iranian support to non-state actors. The FY2018 NDAA expanded reporting requirements to include the use of the Iranian commercial aviation sector to support designated terrorist organizations. An amendment in the FY2019 NDAA aimed to impose sanctions on specific groups but was not included in the final bill. The conference report urges continuous review of Iran-affiliated groups for potential foreign designation. S. 3431 and H.R. 4238 aim to designate Iran-affiliated groups as foreign terrorist organizations and impose sanctions. The FY2019 National Intelligence Authorization Act requires reporting on Iranian support to non-state groups globally. H.R. 4591 was approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee for national security considerations. H.R. 4591, subject to national security waiver, directs the President to impose sanctions on foreign persons committing acts of violence threatening Iraq's peace, stability, democratic process, economic reconstruction, or humanitarian assistance. The bill requires the Secretary of State to assess designated groups for terrorist or sanctions criteria and maintain a list of armed groups in Iraq. Iran-linked actors in Iraq have targeted U.S. forces in the past and continue to pose a threat. Recent attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Basra and Baghdad were attributed to these groups, with reports of Iran supplying missiles to militias like Kata'ib Hezbollah. Sanctions or other measures to counter these groups could diminish Iran's influence in Iraq, aligning with U.S. national security interests. U.S. efforts to counter Iranian activities in Iraq could complicate other U.S. interests by disrupting relations among Iraqi parties and potentially leading to further civil conflict. Treating diverse Iraqi groups with ties to Iran uniformly risks alienating potential U.S. partners or missing opportunities to create divisions between these groups and Iran. The timing and sequencing of imposing U.S. sanctions on Iran are crucial to maximize desired effects and minimize Tehran's ability to exploit Iraqi blowback. The new Iraqi government's stance on U.S. sanctions on Iran and its relations with Arab Gulf states could impact the balance of Iranian and U.S. interests. Saudi Arabia has made efforts to reengage with Iraq since 2015, reopening diplomatic offices and border crossings. However, there has been limited economic or security assistance from GCC states to stabilize Iraq. The U.S. and GCC states have supported Iraq's reconstruction efforts but are wary of Iran's influence. Political negotiations in Iraq post-election have not fully resolved U.S.-Iraqi relations. Prime Minister Abadi's successor, Adel Abd al Mahdi, is seen positively by U.S. officials. The political coalition supporting the Iraqi Prime Minister lacks a strong electoral mandate. Iraqi President Barham Salih's election comes amid political differences among Kurds and strained relations with the national government. There is no indication of Iraq requesting a change in US assistance or military presence. However, countervailing requests could arise from anti-US political forces in the future. The new government in Iraq may assert its sovereignty over foreign military forces and assistance. Some Iraqi groups criticize the US military presence and accuse the US of undermining Iraqi forces. Mainstream Iraqi political movements have not made the US military presence a major issue. In the aftermath of the May 2018 election, debates over U.S. military support to Iraqi forces and sub-state actors have highlighted challenges in securing U.S. interests without provoking opposition from Iraqi constituencies. Some Iraqi groups are wary of U.S. aid, fearing it could empower their rivals. U.S. assistance to the Kurds has been approved by Baghdad, but there are calls for direct aid to the KRG. The strained relationship between the national government and Kurdish forces, along with concerns about the use of U.S. defense equipment by unintended actors, may impact debates over U.S. assistance in Iraq. Future political agendas in Iraq are expected to focus on cabinet negotiations, budget discussions, sector reforms, employment initiatives, and national security issues. Iraq's political agenda is expected to be defined by domestic rivalries and national security issues. Iraqis will likely assess and respond to U.S. initiatives based on their own agendas. Reconciling U.S. interests with Iraq's evolving politics and security conditions will require creativity, flexibility, and patience."
