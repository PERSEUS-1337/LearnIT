    "content": "The \"Quality Teacher Recruitment and Retention Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. The \"Quality Teacher Recruitment and Retention Act\" addresses the impending teacher shortage in American classrooms, especially in urban and rural areas. The nation will require 2,000,000 new teachers over the next decade, with a chronic shortage of fully certified special education teachers. Factors such as paperwork and legal requirements contribute to special education teachers leaving the profession. High-quality prospective teachers need to be identified and recruited by presenting to them a career that is respected by their peers, financially and intellectually rewarding, and offers opportunities for advancement. Teacher loan forgiveness can incentivize high-poverty schools to recruit and retain much-needed high-quality teachers, including special education teachers. The Act aims to encourage individuals to enter and stay in the teaching profession to ensure high-quality teachers are recruited and retained in areas where they are most needed for students to receive a quality education. The Act includes an expanded loan forgiveness program for teachers. The Secretary of Education will implement a program to repay loans for new teachers who work full-time for 3 consecutive school years in qualifying schools. The program offers loan repayment for teachers who work full-time for 3 consecutive school years in qualifying schools, subject to certain requirements and availability of funds. The Secretary prioritizes loan repayment for student borrowers who received it in the previous fiscal year. Regulations may be prescribed to implement this section. Loan repayment amount is capped at the outstanding principal sum of qualifying loans, not exceeding $5,000, after 3 consecutive school years of service. The Secretary prioritizes loan repayment for student borrowers who received it in the previous fiscal year, with a cap of $5,000 after 3 consecutive school years of service. An additional portion of up to $7,500 is given at the end of each of the next 2 school years, totaling not more than $20,000. The Secretary will repay the proportionate amount of interest on the loan. The Secretary will pay eligible lenders the aggregate amount of loans subject to repayment each fiscal year. Application for repayment is required. Each eligible individual must submit a complete application to the Secretary for loan repayment after completing the required years of qualifying employment in public schools. The application must demonstrate the applicant's qualifications as a teacher in a public elementary, middle, or secondary school. To qualify for loan repayment, an individual must be certified as a teacher and hold a license to teach in a public school. For elementary school, a bachelor's degree and subject knowledge are required, while for middle or secondary school, a high level of competency in all subjects is needed. Teachers must demonstrate a high level of competency in all subject areas they teach through performance on a state test or completion of an academic major. For those in nonprofit private or charter schools, they must provide necessary information to show their knowledge. To demonstrate competency in teaching, teachers must show knowledge and skills in each subject area they instruct, certified by the school's chief administrative officer. Consolidation loans can be used to repay specific types of loans under certain conditions. Additional eligibility provisions apply. Additional eligibility provisions apply for loan forgiveness for teachers. Continued eligibility allows teachers to teach in a school that meets certain requirements, even if the school fails to meet them in subsequent years. No borrower can receive benefits under both this section and another act for the same service. A \"new teacher\" is defined as someone who has not previously taught in an elementary or secondary school before August 1. A \"new teacher\" is defined as someone who has not previously taught in an elementary or secondary school before August 1, 2001, excluding student teaching or preservice education program.
