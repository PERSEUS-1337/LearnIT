The term \"adult inmate\" now refers to an individual over the age of criminal responsibility who is in custody for a criminal charge or awaiting trial. The term \"adult inmate\" now refers to an individual over the age of criminal responsibility who is in custody for a criminal charge or awaiting trial, excluding those younger than the maximum age for juvenile facility placement. The definition of \"restraint\" is also clarified as a chemical or medical intervention. The term 'restraint' refers to methods that restrict the movement of juveniles in custody, including chemical agents like pepper spray, tear gas, or CS gas. 'Isolation' is defined as confining a youth alone for more than 15 minutes in a locked or unlocked room. The term 'room time' refers to any instance where a youth is confined alone for more than 15 minutes, including protective isolation and program separation, but not when a youth requests to go to their room or for medical reasons. 'Evidence based' programs are those that are supported by relative evidence and validated. The term 'promising' refers to a program that demonstrates effectiveness with limited findings, either exemplary or effective in implementation and evaluation design. The term 'dangerous practice' refers to acts or programs that pose a risk of physical injury, pain, or psychological harm to juveniles, including the use of chemical agents, choking, blows to the head, and other harmful techniques. It also includes restraints that create a risk of asphyxiation or the use of restraint devices on pregnant girls. The use of restraints, psychotropic medication, physical force, chemical agents, or mechanical restraints for coercion, punishment, or convenience of staff is prohibited, except for medical or mental health purposes related to youth safety. The State Plan is outlined in Section 3. Section 223(a) of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 is amended to include new requirements for youth under 18 awaiting trial in criminal court. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 is amended to include new requirements for youth under 18 awaiting trial in criminal court.

Data collection and reporting on the use of restraints, isolation, and room time are also mandated. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 is amended to include new requirements for youth under 18 awaiting trial in criminal court.

The amendment to the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 includes new requirements for youth in secure detention and correctional facilities. These requirements aim to establish safe staffing levels, independent monitoring, and address issues such as dangerous practices, isolation, and deficiencies in education and healthcare provision. The amendment to the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 prohibits the use of federal funds for dangerous practices with juveniles in secure detention and correctional facilities. SEC. 4. PROMOTING ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION. Section 222 of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 is amended to include incentive grants totaling at least 5 percent of funds for each fiscal year to States. These grants are conditioned upon the State's support for evidence-based programs, reforms to reduce dangerous practices, and reforms to ensure juvenile mental health treatment needs are addressed. The State must support reforms to limit seclusion in secure facilities to situations where it is the least restrictive measure necessary for a youth's safety, and demonstrate improved public safety and rehabilitation for delinquent youths using accurate data. The State must annually demonstrate a reduction in recidivism or offenses by youths under 18, along with an increase in least restrictive placement for juveniles or improved safety in the delinquency system, and a decrease in racial and ethnic disparities. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 is amended to remove the valid court order exception for status offenders, ensuring that juveniles charged with non-criminal offenses are not placed in secure detention facilities."
