    "content": "The United States and Europe have a long history of intertwined political, security, and economic relations dating back to post-World War II efforts to deter the Soviet threat. NATO and the European Union are the main pillars of the transatlantic relationship, founded on shared values of democracy and collective defense. The European integration project aims to promote peace, stability, and prosperity through democratic systems and free markets. The United States strongly supports NATO, the EU, and the OSCE for promoting democracy, reliable military allies, and strong trading partners in Europe and beyond. NATO and the EU have evolved since the Cold War, with a focus on collective defense and redefining their roles in Europe's strategic landscape. The defense guarantee remains central to NATO, while EU members are moving towards political integration with a common foreign policy and defense arm. Both organizations have expanded to include Central and East European states, with the US supporting NATO and EU enlargement. The US-EU economic relationship continues to strengthen as the largest trade and investment partnership in the world. The US-EU economic relationship is the largest trade and investment partnership in the world, with annual two-way flows exceeding $1.1 trillion. Despite some disputes, the relationship is mostly harmonious. However, recent years have seen challenges to the partnership due to various trade and foreign policy disagreements, notably over Iraq. The US-EU economic relationship is the largest in the world, with annual two-way flows exceeding $1.1 trillion. Despite some disputes, most European states object to elements of US policy on various issues. The Bush Administration aims to mend transatlantic relations, but debate on the value of the US-European relationship is reemerging. Some US critics question the extent of European allies' support. The US-EU relationship is strained as critics question European allies' support for US threat perceptions. Differences in tactics and military capabilities hinder security cooperation. Some doubt shared values and interests, raising concerns about the transatlantic partnership. The report assesses the current state of the US-European relationship, highlighting historical tensions and challenges. It offers options for policymakers to shape the future of the transatlantic partnership, emphasizing the importance of shared values and interests. The transatlantic relationship is seen as solid due to common values and shared interests. Frictions are viewed as normal disagreements among close allies. Despite recent criticism of U.S. policies, Europeans feel free to express their views because of the strong bond with the U.S. Both sides face common challenges like countering terrorism and ensuring global financial stability. Strong transatlantic ties are essential for addressing diverse concerns. The transatlantic relationship emphasizes the importance of U.S. and European cooperation in addressing global challenges. This collaboration has been instrumental in promoting peace, stability, and security in regions like the Balkans and Afghanistan. Additionally, joint efforts in law enforcement have been crucial in combating terrorism. Proponents highlight the unique trust and cooperation developed within NATO, which continues to serve U.S. interests by providing a platform for discussing and resolving differences among allies. The transatlantic alliance fosters cooperation among allies and promotes peace and security. The economic relationship between the United States and the EU is mutually beneficial, with significant investments and profits flowing between the two. The economic interdependency between European companies and the U.S. has strengthened, with U.S. affiliate income of European companies rising significantly. Despite some political tensions, U.S. and European officials emphasize their close working relations, attributing any disagreements to the evolution of the transatlantic alliance into a more mature and open relationship. Officials acknowledge that the current difficulties in the transatlantic partnership are seen as \"growing pains\" as the U.S. and European allies navigate new challenges outside of Europe. The relationship has been affected by events like September 11 and the Iraq crisis, leading to significant changes in their political and strategic ties. Some attribute the frictions to personality differences among leaders, while others believe the underlying causes are deeper and structural. Many analysts believe that the transatlantic tensions post-September 11 are due to structural changes and differing policy preferences, defense capabilities gap, and Europe's integration. Some question if U.S. and European interests have diverged too much for a beneficial partnership. European perceptions of U.S. unilateralism under the Bush Administration are also a factor. Many Europeans in the 1990s complained about U.S. unilateral actions under Congress and the Clinton Administration, such as rejecting the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and imposing sanctions on Cuba, Iran, and Libya. European governments criticized the Bush Administration for rejecting international treaties like the U.N. Kyoto Protocol and proceeding with missile defense, raising concerns about its commitment to Europe. The September 2001 terrorist attacks temporarily eased tensions as European governments, NATO, and the EU showed solidarity. European concerns about NATO's relevance to the Bush Administration and U.S. security interests were stirred as the U.S. decided not to involve NATO in the war in Afghanistan. Tensions between the U.S. and Europe resurfaced in 2002-2003 over trade and foreign policy issues, such as rejecting the International Criminal Court and imposing steel tariffs. The confrontational U.S. policy towards Iraq in early 2002, leading to the decision to go to war against Saddam Hussein in March 2003, further strained relations with many Europeans. The U.S.-led decision to go to war against Saddam Hussein in March 2003 caused tensions with European allies who valued multilateral institutions. By 2004, critics believed the intervention in Iraq damaged U.S. credibility, especially after the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. Critics viewed the actions of U.S. soldiers at Abu Ghraib as a result of U.S. policies in the war on terrorism, leading to violations of human rights and a decline in trust in U.S. leadership in Europe. This loss of trust has made European allies less willing to contribute financially or in security roles in Iraq. The Bush Administration's pursuit of goals in Iraq also damaged the credibility of the United Nations and NATO. The Bush Administration's pursuit of goals in Iraq led to concerns among European allies about U.S. intentions and support for European integration. Many Europeans feared a shift in U.S. policy away from backing further European unity, especially after Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld's comments dividing Europe into \"old\" and \"new\" categories. European leaders, including those in the \"new\" category like Poland, objected to any division of the continent and supported a unified Europe. French President Jacques Chirac and then-German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder contributed to the breakdown in transatlantic relations by opposing the war in Iraq in an undiplomatic manner. Their actions were seen as attempts to constrain U.S. power and influence, leading to strained relations with President Bush. The failure of France and Germany to support their fellow NATO allies quickly and clearly was also noted. The lack of support from France, Germany, and Belgium for NATO ally Turkey during the conflict with Iraq damaged the perception of allied unity. Despite efforts by the Bush Administration to improve US-European relations, transatlantic tensions persist, requiring sustained political commitment from both sides. President Bush's visit to EU institutions and support for EU integration helped alleviate European anxieties. Many Europeans are still skeptical about the Bush Administration's view of its European allies as full partners, citing structural reasons for U.S.-European frictions post-Cold War and post-9/11. Diverging threat perceptions have been a long-standing issue, with recent tensions seen as somewhat inevitable. Some observers note that U.S.-European threat perceptions have been diverging since the end of the Cold War. The September 11 attacks had a profound effect on America's national psyche, widening the gap in threat perceptions and policy preferences. Many in Europe have been slow to understand U.S. actions in the \"war\" on terrorism driven by the fear of terrorists acquiring WMD. The Bush Administration's promotion of \"pre-emptive action\" has raised concerns among European allies. European allies and partners are concerned about U.S. \"action\" in response to security threats, especially without U.N. authorization. Europeans view combating terrorism primarily as a law enforcement issue, while the U.S. is more activist in confronting threats and less reliant on multilateral efforts. The September 11 attacks widened the gap in threat perceptions between the U.S. and Europe. U.S. analyst Robert Kagan believes Europe relies on multilateral institutions and lacks military power, leading to a preference for international law. Europeans disagree, pointing to their involvement in Kosovo and Afghanistan as evidence of their willingness to use force when necessary. Europe acknowledges the need to improve military capabilities for security and to work effectively with the US. However, European defense spending remains insufficient, and promises to spend resources more wisely have not materialized. The US-European capabilities gap will continue to be a point of contention, as US focus shifts to threats beyond Europe. Europe's \"value added\" will be measured by their willingness and ability to help manage security burdens inside and outside of Europe. The European Union's ongoing evolution, including further integration through widening and deepening, has significant implications for the U.S.-European strategic partnership. Efforts to build a Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and an EU defense arm are progressing, but remain works in progress. The EU's ability to manage security burdens both within and outside of Europe will be crucial for the future of the partnership. The EU has made progress in establishing new political and defense decision-making bodies, forging consensus on common policies, and releasing a security strategy. However, critics argue that the EU still lacks a unified voice on foreign policy issues like Iraq due to competing national interests and insufficient military capabilities. Despite these challenges, efforts to develop the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) are impacting U.S.-European relations. The emergence of an EU \"strategic personality\" diverges from the U.S. strategic position, emphasizing diplomacy over the use of force. EU member states consult more with each other on foreign policy, reducing Washington's influence over them. EU aims to establish a larger role for Europe on the world stage. The EU's progress in CFSP and its crisis management missions have boosted its self-confidence, leading to a more assertive Europe seeking an equal decision-making role in the alliance. This shift challenges U.S. policies and frustrates policymakers who see Europe's aspirations outpacing its capabilities. Europe's emerging power on the world stage demands a more legitimate voice, although it lacks the military capabilities for decisive action. The EU's growing assertiveness in foreign policy and defense challenges US policies and could weaken NATO. The Bush Administration was wary of the EU potentially replacing NATO as the primary forum for international security discussions. The EU's growing assertiveness in foreign policy and defense challenges US policies and could weaken NATO. Dialogue with the EU may erode NATO, as most EU members still rely on NATO for security. EU momentum may stagnate after the rejection of the constitutional treaty in 2005, leading to a focus on internal reforms. Some argue that a united Europe in foreign policy could be a more reliable partner for the US. President Bush expressed support for the success of the European project during his 2005 trip to Brussels. President Bush expressed support for the success of the European project during his 2005 trip to Brussels, stating that a strong Europe is in U.S. interests. However, a more unified EU may reduce U.S. leverage on individual member states, complicating U.S. efforts to rally support for its initiatives in NATO or at the United Nations. The EU's ability to become a stronger security partner for the U.S. depends on improving defense capabilities and maintaining smooth operational links with NATO. The EU's assumption of NATO's mission in Bosnia in 2004 was seen as a test of Europe's ability to shoulder a greater security burden. The EU's future evolution as a foreign policy actor will also be influenced by domestic politics in member states and the political parties in power. The EU's future evolution as a foreign policy actor will be influenced by domestic politics in member states and the political parties in power. The question of whether the United States and a more integrated Europe share the same interests and values remains a topic of debate. Both sides are committed to democracy, individual liberty, and free market economies, but disagreements in recent years have raised concerns about the transatlantic partnership. On policy level, the United States and European allies share common interests on countering terrorism, promoting Middle East stability, and open global markets. However, differences exist on international legal regimes, environmental standards, social welfare, and genetically-modified food. Many European countries prioritize social spending, leading to flat defense budgets. Europeans are wary of transatlantic justice divides and US capital punishment practices. Differences in multilateral institutions and use of force create a divide between the US and Europe. Europe increasingly values multilateralism as a key interest and pursuit for peace, security, and prosperity, while the US leans towards the use of force to protect its interests. The divergence in views on international institutions and the role of force raises questions on the ability of allies to cooperate effectively in addressing global challenges. Henry Kissinger notes the erosion of the nation-state in Europe as diplomats navigate these differences. The erosion of the nation-state in Europe is noted by Henry Kissinger, as European diplomats prioritize multilateralism and resist the use of force without UN authorization. This stance challenges the traditional sovereignty of the US, leading to questions about the ability of allies to cooperate effectively. Concerns about human rights violations in Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib have also strained transatlantic relations. The Washington Post reported alleged CIA prisons in Eastern Europe and the use of European airports for transporting terrorist suspects. Concerns arise about the impact on the transatlantic relationship and shared values between the US and Europe, potentially leading to a reevaluation of the alliance's benefits. There are fears that younger policymakers may not prioritize the close political ties established after World War II and the Cold War. Some analysts argue that Europe is more focused on its own neighborhood, such as the Middle East, North Africa, Russia, and the Caucasus, rather than sharing the same global concerns as the US. They suggest that Europe is preoccupied with its internal transformation and may not perceive threats like Islamist terrorism or WMD as severely as the US does. Europe's lack of military commitments in Asia means that developments in that region are of lesser concern to them compared to the US. Europe's focus on its neighborhood, such as the Middle East and North Africa, may lead to a different perception of threats like Islamist terrorism or WMD compared to the US. Some EU members have strategic concerns about Turkey's EU aspirations. The US plans to reposition troops from European bases to increase military flexibility. This has led to debates on the future of the transatlantic partnership. The future of the transatlantic partnership is being influenced by various factors, including structural changes since the end of the Cold War and the events of September 11. The perspective and vision of leaders on both sides of the Atlantic, as well as the support they receive from their legislatures and publics, will play a crucial role in reorganizing or reinvigorating the relationship. Future events, such as another catastrophic terrorist attack, could also impact the need for a new course in the partnership. A potential attack in Europe similar in scale to the 2001 attacks on the United States could prompt a shift in European thinking about the use of force and help bridge transatlantic gaps. Some analysts suggest that the decline in U.S. influence globally and the realization that the U.S. cannot handle all conflicts alone are driving factors. Five possible scenarios for the future transatlantic partnership are outlined, focusing on political and strategic dimensions. Despite trade and economic tensions, pursuing less robust trade and investment relations would not be in either side's interest. The economic aspects of the partnership are considered only in relation to transatlantic trade and investment implications. The options presented for the future of U.S.-European relations are meant as guideposts, not definitive predictions. The relationship will likely evolve over time and depend on various factors, including outside circumstances, European assessments, and the EU's evolution. The options do not solely reflect U.S. decisions, and the future shape of the alliance could vary based on different scenarios. The potential shift in the U.S.-European alliance towards new strategic partnerships with emerging powers like Russia, China, and India to address global challenges such as terrorism and weapons proliferation. This approach aims to focus U.S. efforts on developing relationships with countries better suited to confront these issues, while still allowing collaboration with European partners like the British. The United States may shift towards working closely with European partners like the British, viewing them as sharing U.S. goals and making serious military contributions. NATO could be downgraded to a forum for discussion rather than decision-making, freeing Washington from transatlantic constraints. Some U.S. officials are frustrated with NATO's decision-making procedures, which they see as hindering quick action. Some argue that de-emphasizing European allies could give the US more flexibility in global responses, potentially partnering with countries like Russia or China. However, skeptics believe European allies remain the most practical partners due to shared values and institutional cooperation within NATO. The U.S. alignment with states lacking commitment to freedom, democracy, and human rights could harm its credibility, especially in the Middle East. Partnering with countries like Russia or China may come with conflicting interests and concessions. Critics warn that distancing from Europe could impact the U.S.-European economic relationship in the long term. In the longer term, distancing from Europe could negatively affect the U.S.-European economic relationship and lead to a more distant political relationship. This could complicate efforts to resolve trade disputes and sustain cooperation in multilateral trade negotiations. Additionally, it may erode close U.S.-European cooperation against terrorism and encourage the EU to develop as a political counterweight to the United States. Maintaining an uneasy partnership with European allies would likely persist with disagreements and differences. By preserving the essential structures of the Atlantic alliance, disagreements and differences may persist. Supporters argue that despite current difficulties, NATO continues to function and produce tangible benefits, such as taking over the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan and enabling U.S.-European law enforcement efforts against terrorism. NATO-EU cooperation also allows the EU to play a larger role. Maintaining the status quo in NATO-EU cooperation allows the EU to play a bigger role in ensuring peace in the Balkans. However, some analysts argue that preserving the status quo could waste policymakers' time and energy due to constant bickering among allies, potentially detracting from addressing other immediate challenges. New disputes could arise, destabilizing the relationship and constraining U.S. policies. The concept of \"coalitions of the willing\" within the transatlantic alliance has been debated since the mid-1990s, particularly in relation to NATO operations that are not collective defense in nature. Some argue that consensus decision-making within the alliance does not require every member state to contribute militarily, leading to the existence of such coalitions in practice. The Bush Administration has advocated for NATO military actions to be primarily conducted by these coalitions. The concept of \"coalitions of the willing\" in NATO military actions has been proposed to allow the United States and its European partners to cooperate where possible and agree to disagree on contentious issues. This approach aims to minimize transatlantic quarrels and free the US from European constraints on certain international problems. Cooperation would focus on challenges where agreement is possible, while acknowledging irreconcilable differences. On the NATO decision-making level, cooperation between the United States and Europe would focus on agreed-upon threats and solutions, allowing the US to benefit from European assistance. This option is seen as more realistic due to the military capabilities gap and lack of deployable European forces. Supporters believe it could give European partners more freedom to join the US, potentially weakening the development of a unified EU stance within NATO. Skeptics argue that this approach may not lead to a coordinated strategy for managing transatlantic challenges. Some observers argue that pursuing a partnership level approach with Europe may lead to allies working at cross-purposes and increase transatlantic tensions. Critics believe this option could be seen as an attempt by the US to keep Europe weak and divided. On the NATO level, critics fear it would signal the end of the alliance's consensus decision-making approach. The \"coalitions of the willing\" approach may weaken alliance solidarity and transatlantic link, as it could be viewed as the US using European allies as a \"toolbox\" for military force. Critics fear it could undermine alliance consensus and lead to a division in security capabilities. Some analysts propose a division of labor in the transatlantic relationship, with European allies focusing on security within Europe and the US handling international crises in other regions. Europe and the US would share responsibility for managing crises involving Russia and the Caucasus within NATO. Some suggest a functional division of labor in the transatlantic relationship, with European allies focusing on humanitarian assistance and civilian reconstruction, while the US and other capable allies handle combat activities and peace enforcement operations. This approach aims to address the challenges in managing crises involving Russia and the Caucasus within NATO. Supporters argue for a functional division of labor in the transatlantic relationship, with the US handling higher-end war-fighting tasks and Europe focusing on peacekeeping and reconstruction efforts. This approach aims to utilize the strengths of each region more effectively and increase European burden-sharing. Reducing U.S. expectations of EU capabilities could ease tensions and maintain the transatlantic partnership. NATO would likely remain intact, serving as a symbol of alliance solidarity. Critics argue that a functional division of labor could institutionalize inequality and undermine alliance solidarity. Critics argue against a U.S.-European military division of labor, whether geographical or functional, as it would not provide a coordinated strategy to manage global problems or bridge political and policy gaps between the two sides of the Atlantic on various issues. It could reinforce European inwardness and lead to an abdication of European responsibility for global security. Proposals to address U.S.-European differences over the use of force include devising a new strategic bargain for the transatlantic relationship, focusing on the NATO-EU relationship, advocating for more equal sharing of responsibilities, and committing to a strong and coherent Europe. The proposal aims to give European allies more decision-making power in exchange for their help in ensuring global peace and security. It also emphasizes the importance of multilateral solutions backed by the credible threat of force. Advocates believe that new deals need to be made on contentious issues like Iraq, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and efforts to curb radical Islam. Additionally, a new bargain must include a fuller sharing of military tasks and responsibilities. A new transatlantic security deal is proposed to include enhanced European defense capabilities and greater U.S. recognition of crisis management and post-conflict reconstruction skills. This deal could also involve creating a Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement to contain trade disputes and strengthen political cooperation between the U.S. and Europe. Proponents suggest a new transatlantic security deal to enhance European defense capabilities and promote equitable burden-sharing. Critics doubt the feasibility of reaching a U.S.-European political agreement on this proposal. The option of a new transatlantic security deal to enhance European defense capabilities and promote burden-sharing would require the United States to make compromises on issues important to Europe. Some doubt the feasibility of reaching an agreement due to concerns about constraints on U.S. policies and skepticism about U.S. commitment. The chances of reaching an accommodation with Europe on issues like Iraq are complicated due to existing differences within the EU and among European allies. Various options for the future of the transatlantic relationship have both benefits and challenges for the United States. Maintaining a political and strategic relationship with Europe would offer tangible benefits and support U.S. foreign and economic policies. However, all options would require serious and ongoing dialogue and consultation between the U.S. and Europe. The future of the transatlantic relationship may involve a combination of different elements to address security challenges. There could be a division of labor due to differences in military strengths, but political ambitions on both sides hinder a stark division. A new bargain at the political level may entail a statement of U.S.-European solidarity in confronting global challenges and joint policies. The transatlantic relationship may involve a division of labor to address security challenges, with a focus on joint policies and solidarity in confronting global issues. Congressional interest lies in U.S.-European security and economic relations, with a goal of a \"Europe whole and free.\" Members of Congress support NATO enlargement to promote European stability and democracy. NATO enlargement in 1998 and 2003 aimed to promote European stability and democracy in Central and Eastern Europe. Congress supports EU's enlargement in 2004 and is engaged in the evolving NATO-EU relationship. Members of Congress encourage EU efforts to enhance counterterrorism capabilities and improve cooperation with the United States. U.S.-EU trade and investment issues, such as aircraft subsidies and regulatory policies, are also key concerns for lawmakers. In 2003, 2004, and February 2005, lawmakers held hearings on the future transatlantic relationship. The House passed resolutions in 2003 and 2004 recognizing the importance of U.S.-EU relations and encouraging enhanced strategic discussions and cooperation. Close U.S.-European economic relations and counterterrorism cooperation are key areas of concern in any reorganization of the transatlantic relationship. Members of Congress would likely focus on economic relations and counterterrorism cooperation in discussions to enhance the transatlantic partnership. They may seek assurances for stronger European military capabilities and a commitment to collaborate with the U.S. on global challenges. Congress could shape the debate by emphasizing the importance of a transatlantic \"consensus\" over a U.N. mandate and resisting U.S. soldiers' involvement in the International Criminal Court. On February 9, 2005, Representative Jo Ann Davis introduced H.Res. 77 recognizing the 10th anniversary of the New Transatlantic Agenda and promoting new initiatives to strengthen the partnership between the U.S. Congress and the European Parliament through the TLD. In May 2005, Members of Congress established a Congressional Caucus on the EU to increase dialogue and exchanges with EU officials. Senator Robert Bennett introduced S.Res. 178 on June 20, 2005, highlighting the importance of U.S.-EU cooperation and calling for expanded political and security dialogue between Congress and the European Parliament. Several congressional caucuses focus on bilateral U.S.-European relations and different aspects of the broader transatlantic relationship. Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives are active on the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors and encourages compliance with OSCE political and human rights commitments. These forums provide opportunities for enhancing transatlantic dialogue on U.S.-European interests and promoting security. The curr_chunk discusses the future direction to promote security and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic, including options for U.S. policy towards Europe. It includes appendices on NATO and EU membership, as well as a spectrum of possible policy options."
