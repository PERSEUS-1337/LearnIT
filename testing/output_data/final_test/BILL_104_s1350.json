A voluntary self-audit is an assessment initiated by a small entity's officer, employee, or agent, not required by law. SEC. 102. COMPLIANCE GUIDES. Compliance guides must be published by covered agencies when preparing a regulatory flexibility analysis for a rule or group of related rules. These guides must include a summary description, citation to the complete rule, and explain the actions small entities need to take to comply. Compliance guides required under this section must be written in a manner understandable by small entity owners or managers, updated to reflect rule changes, and disseminated by covered agencies to small entities and business development centers for distribution. Enforcement by covered agencies is limited. No covered agency can enforce a rule against a small entity without a compliance guide being published. The effective dates for this subsection vary depending on the regulation in question. SEC. 103. NO ACTION LETTER. This section applies to all covered agencies, excluding the Federal Trade Commission, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and Consumer Product Safety Commission. Covered agencies must make a determination on a no action request within 90 days and issue a no action letter if granted. Small entities can rely on the no action letter or compliance guide in any enforcement action by a covered agency in Federal court. In any enforcement action against a small entity by a covered agency, the small entity can defend itself by proving that the alleged noncompliance was done in good faith and in reliance on a no action letter or compliance guide issued by the agency. SEC. 104. VOLUNTARY SELF-AUDITS. Each agency must establish voluntary self-audit procedures for small entities they regulate. Evidence from a self-audit cannot be used in enforcement actions if addressed within 180 days. Voluntary self-audit made in good faith and related communications are protected, except in cases of criminal violations or when prepared to avoid disclosure in imminent legal proceedings. SEC. 201 prohibits covered agencies from rewarding employees based on contacts with small entities or fines levied for enforcement. SEC. 202 provides a grace period for correcting violations of EPA regulations. SEC. 203. WAIVER OF PUNITIVE FINES FOR SMALL ENTITIES. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall give small entities 180 days to correct violations, except in cases of imminent risk to public health, worker safety, or criminal liability. SEC. 203. WAIVER OF PUNITIVE FINES FOR SMALL ENTITIES. A covered agency can waive punitive fines for small entities for first-time violations if the entity acts quickly and in good faith to correct the violation."
