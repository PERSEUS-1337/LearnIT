    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1214.1 of the Penal Code is amended to allow the court to impose a civil assessment of up to $300 on defendants who fail to appear in court or pay fines as ordered. The assessment will be deposited in the Trial Court Trust Fund. The court can impose a civil assessment of up to $300 on defendants who fail to appear or pay fines. The assessment becomes effective after a warning notice is sent, and if the defendant shows good cause for the failure to appear or pay, the court will vacate the assessment without requiring payment. If a civil assessment is imposed for failure to appear or pay fines, no warrant shall be issued. Any existing warrant must be recalled before a new assessment is imposed, subject to due process requirements. The court and county must maintain the collection program in effect on July 1, 2005, unless agreed otherwise. If there is a disagreement, arbitration can be requested. A one-time infraction amnesty program aims to provide relief for individuals with unpaid traffic bail or fines. The curr_chunk discusses providing relief to individuals in violation of court-ordered obligations or with suspended driving privileges, increasing revenue by encouraging payment of old fines, and allowing courts to focus on more recent cases. A one-time amnesty program for fines and bail will be established in each county, with government entities responsible for implementation. The term \"fine\" or \"bail\" includes the total amounts due for a specific violation, such as base fine or bail set by court order or statute. The text discusses various assessments and surcharges imposed by court orders and statutes, including penalty assessments, state surcharges, court operations assessments, and criminal conviction assessments. Additionally, it mentions a civil assessment that shall not be collected during the established amnesty program between October 1, 2015, to March 31, 2017. The court issues a certificate to the Department of Motor Vehicles for participants of the one-time amnesty program who have satisfied court requirements for driving privilege suspension related to specific violations. The court issues a certificate to the Department of Motor Vehicles for individuals in a comprehensive collection program who have met court requirements for driving privilege suspension related to specific violations. Any person eligible for a driver's license under specific sections is eligible for the amnesty program for certain violations. The Department of Motor Vehicles must issue a license to eligible participants in the amnesty program, regardless of fines or bail owed. Driving privileges will be reinstated for participants in the amnesty program, regardless of outstanding fines or bail related to the specific violation. The court and county may extend the one-time amnesty program to fines and bail for misdemeanor violations. The amnesty program does not apply to parking violations or specific sections of the Penal Code. Eligibility for amnesty requires meeting certain criteria for infractions or specific violations. The amnesty program for misdemeanor violations allows for a 50% reduction in fines or bail amounts if certain criteria are met. This includes no outstanding warrants, no victim restitution owed, and no payments made after September 30, 2015. The amnesty program for misdemeanor violations offers a 20% reduction in fines or bail amounts for participants receiving specific public benefits or meeting certain conditions. Guidelines for the program must be adopted by the Judicial Council by October 1, 2015. Each court or county implementing the amnesty program must recover costs and may charge a $50 fee. A payment plan option is available based on the participant's ability to pay monthly, with information collected for debt collection by the Franchise Tax Board. If a participant in the amnesty program fails to comply with the payment plan terms, the agency will send a notice giving them 30 days to resume payments or request a change. Failure to respond may result in referral to the Franchise Tax Board for collection, including administrative costs. The Board will collect delinquent amounts using existing protocols and additional collection efforts as needed. The agency may use additional collection efforts under Penal Code Section 1463.007 if a participant in the amnesty program fails to comply with payment plan terms. The Judicial Council will reimburse costs up to $250,000 for outreach related to the amnesty program, including providing information on the program through motor vehicle registration renewal notices and the department's website. Personnel costs for the program will also be covered. The Judicial Council may develop mechanisms for reinstating driving privileges for those eligible for amnesty. No criminal action can be taken for delinquent fines paid under the program. The funds collected under the amnesty program are deposited in the county treasury. After a specified amount is accepted, the remaining revenues are distributed pro rata. Funds collected are transferred to the Judicial Council. Once a month, 82.20% of funds collected go to Peace Officers\u2019 Training Fund and 17.80% go to Corrections Training Fund. Each court or county implementing an amnesty program must submit a report to the Judicial Council by May 31, 2017, detailing the cases resolved, money collected, and operating costs. The Judicial Council will then report to the Legislature by August 31, 2017. This act is deemed urgent for the immediate implementation of the amnesty program for Vehicle Code violations."
