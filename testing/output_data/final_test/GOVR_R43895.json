Members of Congress propose codifying existing sanctions. Some Members of Congress propose codifying existing sanctions on Russia, which were mainly implemented by President Obama through Executive Orders. U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley condemns Russian actions in Ukraine and calls for the return of Crimea to Ukraine before lifting sanctions. Debate surrounds the impact of these sanctions on Russia's economy and U.S. economic interests. The Obama Administration imposed sanctions on Russia in response to events in Ukraine, working with the EU. Congress also passed laws on U.S. sanctions related to the conflict in Ukraine.

US and EU sanctions on Russia in 2014 coincided with its struggling economy post-2008 financial crisis. Russia's economy suffered from falling exports to Europe, contracting sharply in 2009 but rebounding in 2010 before slowing down again. The Russian economy faced challenges due to its dependence on oil and gas exports, along with the need for reforms in governance, regulation, and other sectors. The impact of U.S. and EU sanctions, along with low oil prices, contributed to economic difficulties in 2014 and 2015. Russia's economic challenges in 2014 and 2015 were driven by low oil prices, leading to economic contraction, capital flight, rapid ruble depreciation, higher inflation, budget deficits, tapping into reserves, and increased poverty. In 2016, Russia's economy stabilized despite sanctions. The economy contracted at a slower rate, private sector capital outflows decreased, inflation dropped to 7.2%, the ruble's value stabilized, and new bonds were successfully sold. Rising oil prices and a flexible exchange rate regime helped cushion the impact of sanctions and oil shocks. Russia's economy stabilized in 2016 despite sanctions, with improved economic indicators and a more stable ruble. Foreign capital access remains limited, but investor sentiment is showing signs of improvement. Net private capital outflows have slowed, and net inward FDI into Russia is starting to resume. Major Western companies like Ikea, Pfizer, and Mars are looking to expand in Russia. The IMF projects modest economic growth of 1.1% in 2017 and 1.2% in 2018, but long-term prospects are subdued due to sanctions and structural challenges. Some analysts have noted that the low value of the ruble may hamper Russia's attempts to innovate and modernize its economy, and that the economy's continued reliance on oil makes it vulnerable to another drop in oil prices. Statistical models estimate the impact of sanctions on Russian individuals, firms, and sectors since 2014, with the IMF suggesting that sanctions reduced output in Russia by 1.0% to 1.5% in the short term and could reduce output by up to 9% in the medium term. Sanctions imposed on Russia have had a significant impact on the economy, with estimates showing a $40 billion annual cost (2% of GDP). The financial sanctions are projected to decrease Russia's GDP by 2.4% by 2017, but the effect is expected to be 3.3 times lower than the impact of lower oil prices. President Putin acknowledged that the sanctions are harming Russia's access to international financial markets, although not as severely as the decline in energy prices. The impact of sanctions on Russia's economy has been significant, with estimates showing a $40 billion annual cost (2% of GDP). Sanctions have led to a decrease in operating revenue, asset value, and employees for sanctioned companies in Russia. However, the overall impact on Russia's economy (GDP and import demand) is smaller compared to the impact of lower oil prices. There is debate about the economic impact of the Ukraine-related sanctions. The economic impact of Ukraine-related sanctions on the United States is debated. U.S. business groups raised concerns about potential disruptions to operations in Russia, while others argue that the targeted sanctions aim to minimize impact on the U.S. economy. Russia is a minor trading partner for the U.S., and sanctions only target a small portion of individuals and entities. The United States and Russia have limited economic ties, with Russia accounting for a small portion of overall U.S. international economic activity. Even before Ukraine-related sanctions, trade and investment between the two countries were minimal. U.S. commodity trade with Russia has declined significantly over the past three years. U.S. commodity trade with Russia has decreased by almost half in the past three years. Merchandise exports and imports have both fallen significantly. Investment ties between the two countries have also weakened, with U.S. investment in Russia declining from $20.8 billion in 2009 to $9.2 billion in 2015. Sanctions related to Ukraine may have contributed to this downward trend, but other factors could also be at play. Several large U.S. companies, including ExxonMobil, PepsiCo, Ford Motor Co., General Electric, and Boeing, have been impacted by sanctions due to their active engagement with Russia in various business activities. Several large U.S. companies, such as ExxonMobil, Boeing, Visa, and MasterCard, have significant business operations in Russia. The U.S.-Russia Business Council, with 170 U.S. member companies, provides services for businesses in Russia. Sanctions imposed in 2014 disrupted operations for companies like ExxonMobil, leading to significant financial losses. Exxon reported $1 billion in losses from Russian operations due to sanctions. Halliburton, National Oilwell Varco, and John Deere also faced restrictions and weaker sales. U.S. gun dealers are limited in importing Russian-made rifles. Financial institutions hired staff to monitor accounts with Russian entities. The full impact of sanctions on U.S. firms is hard to determine. Russia's plans to develop its own national payments system could impact MasterCard and Visa's dominance in the Russian market. Despite this, Russia only contributes a small portion (2%) to their profits. Some U.S. companies have already cut ties with Russian counterparts and relocated manufacturing to the United States in response to sanctions. The phased implementation of sanctions allowed U.S. firms time to prepare for economic disruptions with Russia by developing contingency plans. Some U.S. firms have adjusted to suppliers and banks outside of Russia to minimize the impact of sanctions. Trade and investment trends show mixed results, with some sectors strengthening ties with Russia. U.S. imports of aluminum from Russia increased, but agricultural producers have been adversely affected by retaliatory bans. The impact of sanctions on U.S. agricultural exports to Russia has been significant, with concerns raised by Alaska's seafood industry and Washington State apple and pear producers. Despite initial challenges, alternative markets are being sought to mitigate the effects. Targeted sanctions on key Russian individuals and sectors have been implemented by the U.S. in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on Russia, targeting officials in Putin's inner circle and restricting new debt to specific financial institutions. Congress is evaluating the impact of these sanctions on Russia's economy and foreign policy, as well as on U.S. national security interests. Experts believe that the sanctions are contributing to Russia's economic challenges, but it is difficult to separate their impact from other factors like low oil prices. The effectiveness of sanctions on Russia's behavior is uncertain, despite economic challenges. Russian economy stabilizing, investor sentiment improving. Concerns raised about economic costs of sanctions on U.S. Some U.S. firms impacted. Long-term impact depends on various factors like finding alternative markets and potential retaliatory measures from Russia."
