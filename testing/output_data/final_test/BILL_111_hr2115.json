    "content": "The Act titled \"Men and Families Health Care Act of 2009\" is cited as the short title. The Congress finds that men's health risks are increasing due to lack of education and preventative care, with men leading in top causes of death and a higher cancer diagnosis rate compared to women. The life expectancy gap between men and women has also widened. Studies show women are more likely to seek medical care and preventive screenings than men. According to the Census Bureau, the ratio of men to women decreases to 85 to 100 by age 65, indicating that declining men's health increases the risk of women becoming widows in retirement. Elderly widows living in poverty after their husbands' death were not poor before. Men's health concerns governments due to the costs of premature death and caring for dependents. Educating men, families, and healthcare providers on early detection of male health issues can reduce mortality rates for male-specific diseases and improve overall economic well-being. Attention must be given to the well-being of military personnel and veterans returning from war zones. Regular medical exams, preventive screenings, exercise, and healthy eating habits have been shown to save lives. Men's health is a concern for employers due to medical costs and lost productivity. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in the US for men, with over 185,000 new cases and almost 29,000 deaths annually. Detection and treatment costs exceed $8 billion yearly. In the United States, prostate cancer detection and treatments cost over $8 billion annually, accounting for 8% of cancer and 0.4% of all health-related expenditures. Prostate cancer rates sharply increase with age, with most cases diagnosed in men aged 65 and older. Two-thirds of prostate cancer expenditures are covered by Medicare. African-American men have double the incidence and mortality rate of prostate cancer compared to other men. In 2008, approximately 115,000 men were diagnosed with lung cancer, and nearly 91,000 died from it. Additionally, around 54,000 men were estimated to have been diagnosed with lung cancer in the same year. In 2008, around 54,000 men were diagnosed with colorectal cancer, and over 24,000 men died from it. Men make up over half of diabetes patients in the US, with 10.9 million total, and are 30% more likely to die from the disease. 54 million Americans have pre-diabetes, with 1.5 million new cases diagnosed in 2005. People with diabetes have 2 to 3 times higher medical expenditures compared to those without diabetes. In 2007, the estimated cost of diabetes was $174 million, with $116 million in excess medical expenditures and $58 million in reduced national productivity. Over 8,000 men aged 15 to 40 will be diagnosed with testicular cancer this year, with 380 deaths expected in 2008. Men have shown poorer health outcomes compared to women across all racial and ethnic groups and socioeconomic status. Establishing an Office of Men's Health is necessary to address these findings and promote awareness of men's health needs. Establishment of Office of Men's Health under Title XVII of the Public Health Service Act to address poor health outcomes in men and promote awareness of men's health needs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish the Office of Men's Health to improve men's health in the United States through various programs and activities, including coordination with other government agencies. The Office of Men's Health will coordinate screening programs for prostate cancer, diabetes, colorectal cancer, cholesterol, and mental health for men at increased risk. This includes PSA testing and activities related to men's health. The Office of Men's Health will coordinate programs for men's prostate, cardiovascular, and mental health, including establishing a clinical registries database to assess quality improvement. A report on the activities will be submitted to Congress within 2 years."
