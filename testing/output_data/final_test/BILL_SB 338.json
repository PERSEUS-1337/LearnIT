    "title": "SB 338",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 368 of the Penal Code is amended to provide special protections for elders and dependent adults, similar to those for minor children, due to their vulnerability. Any person who knowingly causes harm to an elder or dependent adult will face consequences. Causing harm to an elder or dependent adult, resulting in injury or endangerment, is punishable by imprisonment or a fine. Causing mental suffering to an elder or dependent adult knowingly or under circumstances likely to produce suffering is punishable by imprisonment or a fine. If the victim suffers great bodily injury, the defendant will receive an additional term in prison based on the victim's age. Any person who knows or reasonably should know that a person is an elder or dependent adult and willfully causes them to suffer unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering will face imprisonment. Additional prison terms are imposed based on the victim's age, with longer terms for victims aged 70 or older. Any person who causes harm to an elder or dependent adult, leading to injury or endangerment, is guilty of a misdemeanor. Repeat offenses can result in a fine or imprisonment. Additionally, individuals who commit theft, embezzlement, forgery, or fraud against elders or dependent adults face punishment if they know or should know the victim's status. Any caretaker of an elder or dependent adult who violates the law by taking or obtaining property exceeding $950 faces a fine up to $2,500 or imprisonment up to one year. For property valued under $950, the penalty is a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to one year. A caretaker of an elder or dependent adult who violates theft, embezzlement, forgery, fraud, or identity theft laws regarding the property or personal information of the elder or dependent adult may face a fine of up to $2,500 or imprisonment up to one year for property exceeding $950 in value. Any person who commits false imprisonment of an elder or dependent adult by violence, menace, fraud, or deceit may face imprisonment for two to four years. An elder is defined as a person 65 years or older, while a dependent adult is between 18 and 64 years of age. A dependent adult is defined as a person between the ages of 18 and 64 who has physical or mental limitations that restrict their ability to carry out normal activities or protect their rights. This includes individuals with disabilities or diminished abilities due to age. A caretaker is someone who has the care, custody, or control of an elder or dependent adult. (j) This section does not prevent prosecution under Section 187 or 12022.7 or any other law. However, a person cannot receive additional imprisonment terms for the same offense. (k) If convicted, the court may require counseling as a probation condition, with the defendant responsible for the costs based on their ability to pay. No one will be denied probation for inability to pay. No reimbursement required by this act as it creates, eliminates, or changes penalties for crimes, per Section 17556 of the Government Code."
