    "content": "The \"Crime Victims with Disabilities Act of 2006\" acknowledges the higher rates of violence and abuse experienced by adults with disabilities, particularly women, and aims to address the underreporting of crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities. The purpose of the Act is to increase awareness, investigation, prosecution, and prevention of crimes against individuals with disabilities, including developmental disabilities, by promoting collaboration among the criminal justice system and agencies providing services to individuals with disabilities. Collaboration is necessary to protect individuals with disabilities by ensuring reported crimes are actively investigated and prosecutors receive adequate training. The Act aims to increase awareness and address crimes against individuals with disabilities by promoting collaboration among criminal justice agencies, ensuring adequate training for prosecutors, and meeting the needs of crime victims with disabilities through communication with relevant organizations. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended to include a new program called the Crime Victims with Disabilities Collaboration Program, which provides grants to respond to crimes against individuals with disabilities. The Crime Victims with Disabilities Collaboration Program defines key terms such as applicant, collaboration program, and criminal justice agency. The term 'adult protective services agency' refers to an agency responsible for providing services to adults with disabilities, including receiving reports of abuse, neglect, and exploitation, investigating such reports, and offering case planning and other services. Implementation grant means a grant under subsection (e) for providing services to adults with disabilities, including medical, social, economic, legal, housing, law enforcement, and support services. Day program refers to a program that offers care, supervision, social opportunities, or jobs to individuals with disabilities aged 18 or older. The curr_chunk discusses definitions such as planning grant, Secretary, and unit of local government in relation to a program for individuals with disabilities. The curr_chunk discusses the authorization for grants to prepare a comprehensive plan or implement a collaboration program for individuals with disabilities, focusing on investigating and remedying abuse or crimes against them, as well as providing services to victims. Grants are to be used for programs that receive and investigate reports of abuse or crimes against individuals with disabilities. The curr_chunk outlines the responsibilities of investigating abuse or crimes against individuals with disabilities, identifying perpetrators, remedying issues, prosecuting crimes, and providing services to victims. To apply for a planning or implementation grant, an applicant must submit an application to the Attorney General with required information. A combined application for both types of grants is allowed, with the possibility of receiving an implementation grant based on the submitted application. The implementation grant is conditional on completing activities funded under the planning grant. A planning grant application must include a budget, budget justification, outcome measures, activity schedule, and personnel description. Implementation grants are contingent on completing activities funded by planning grants. Planning grants are limited to $50,000, with exceptions possible for higher amounts. Only one planning grant per entity is allowed. The collaborative program requires identifying criminal justice enforcement agencies, adult protective services organizations, and other service providers for individuals with disabilities. Each participating agency or organization must outline their responsibilities and how grant funds will be used to improve responses to abuse and crimes against individuals with disabilities. An application for an implementation grant for the collaborative program involving criminal justice agencies, adult protective services, and organizations serving individuals with disabilities must detail guidelines for personnel and explain the need for federal funds to supplement the program adequately. The implementation grant application must outline plans for obtaining necessary support and continuing the collaboration program after the grant concludes. It should also identify methodology and outcome measures for evaluating program effectiveness. The collaboration program's effectiveness is evaluated by the number and type of participating agencies, trends in cases referred for review, timeliness of law enforcement review, and training received. Mechanisms of collaboration are also described. The existing system for evaluating the collaboration program captures data on cases referred to law enforcement, charges filed, and outcomes of referrals. The Attorney General and the Secretary will establish a standardized mechanism for reporting data on violence against individuals with disabilities to law enforcement agencies. Additionally, a percentage of funds will be set aside for collaboration efforts. A maximum of 10 percent of funds from an implementation grant will be allocated for technical assistance from recognized State model programs or national organizations like the National District Attorneys Association. Applicants must explain how their collaboration program relates to other programs serving individuals with disabilities. Implementation grants are available for State, local government, Indian tribe, or tribal organization applicants for a 2-year period, with a possible renewal for an additional 2 years. The grant amount cannot exceed $300,000. The Attorney General will establish an evaluation of program efficacy. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary, will establish a national center to evaluate collaboration programs funded under this section. The center will analyze data from grantees and submit an annual report on the reporting, investigation, and prosecution of crimes against individuals with disabilities. The Attorney General may use up to $500,000 for this purpose. Authorization of Appropriations: The Department of Justice is authorized to receive $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2007 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2008 through 2013 to carry out this section."
