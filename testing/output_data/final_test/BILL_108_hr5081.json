CHAPTER 1607 provides educational assistance for reserve component members called to active service in response to a war or national emergency. The program is established by the Secretary of each military department to recognize the sacrifices made by these members. The program established in this chapter provides educational assistance to members of the Ready Reserve of the armed forces. Educational assistance can be used for approved education programs, and the Secretary concerned will provide an educational assistance allowance to eligible members pursuing authorized programs of education. The allowance amount is based on a percentage of the rate provided under title 38. The educational assistance program in this chapter offers allowances to Ready Reserve members based on active duty completion. The allowance percentage is adjusted based on the duration of active service, ranging from 40% to 80% for different periods. The educational assistance program for Ready Reserve members offers allowances based on active duty completion, with percentages ranging from 40% to 80% depending on the duration of service. The maximum months of assistance provided is 36, and certain educational assistance allowances are not deducted from an individual's entitlement or counted towards the aggregate period limit. The educational assistance program for Ready Reserve members provides allowances for pursuing courses under specific circumstances, such as being ordered to active duty. If an individual had to discontinue their course pursuit due to active duty orders and did not receive credit or training time towards their educational objective, they may be eligible for an educational assistance allowance that is not charged against their entitlement. Eligibility for educational assistance under the program for Ready Reserve members is based on serving on active duty in support of a contingency operation for 90 consecutive days or more, or performing full-time National Guard duty. The educational assistance allowance is not deducted from entitlement if credit or training time was not received for the course pursued. Eligibility for educational assistance under the program for Ready Reserve members is based on serving on active duty in support of a contingency operation for 90 consecutive days or more, or performing full-time National Guard duty under section 502(f) of title 32 for 90 consecutive days or more when authorized by the President or Secretary of Defense for the purpose of responding to a national emergency declared by the President and supported by Federal funds. Disabled members who are released from duty before completing 90 consecutive days due to injury, illness, or disease incurred in the line of duty are entitled to educational assistance. Each member entitled to educational assistance must receive a written notification prior to release from active service. Prior to release from active service, members entitled to educational assistance must receive a written notification summarizing key provisions of the chapter. The Secretary concerned must transmit a notice of entitlement to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs upon request. Members qualifying for educational assistance cannot receive credit under both chapter 30 of title 38 and the current chapter, requiring an irrevocable election for credit. Additionally, individuals entitled to educational assistance are barred from duplicating educational assistance allowance, except under specific circumstances. An individual eligible for educational assistance under various programs must choose one program to receive assistance from, except for a specific entitlement under section 16131(i) of this title. Members retain entitlement to educational assistance while serving, with a time limitation for use of entitlement. Members retain entitlement to educational assistance while serving in the Selected Reserve or Ready Reserve. For disabled members separated from the Ready Reserve due to a non-willful misconduct disability, their entitlement to educational assistance expires after 10 years from the date of eligibility. Educational assistance entitlement for members in the Selected Reserve or Ready Reserve is subject to termination under specific circumstances, such as receiving financial assistance from other programs or separating from the Ready Reserve. The administration of educational assistance is overseen by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Department of Veterans Affairs administers educational assistance for members of the Selected Reserve or Ready Reserve through agreements with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security. These agreements ensure timely fund transfers for payments. Program management follows specific provisions of title 38, including eligibility criteria for veterans and individuals. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may approve flight training for eligible individuals under this chapter if the training is necessary for a vocational objective in aviation, the individual has a private pilot certificate and meets medical requirements, and the flight school meets FAA standards. Administration standards for flight training courses must be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration and the State approving agency. Funding for benefits under this chapter will be derived from the Department of Defense Education Benefits Fund. Conforming amendments include provisions for education liabilities for the Coast Guard under chapters 1606 and 1607. Funding for educational assistance under chapters 1606 and 1607 is provided by the Department of Defense Education Benefits Fund. Section 3695(a)(5) of title 38, United States Code, is amended to include chapter 1607. Clerical amendments are made to the tables of chapters in title 10, United States Code.
