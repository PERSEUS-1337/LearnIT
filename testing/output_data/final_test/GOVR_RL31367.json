    "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that U.S. courts have jurisdiction to hear challenges from detainees at Guantanamo Bay. This overturned the Court of Appeals' decision that no U.S. court could hear petitions for habeas corpus for detainees. In response, the Department of Defense created a new tribunal for detainees to contest their status as \"enemy combatants.\" The Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 established standards for interrogation and limited detainees' access to federal courts. The case of Salim Ahmed Hamdan led to the suspension and restart of military tribunals. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed the decision of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. District judges issued contradictory opinions on the detainees' rights. The Administration filed motions to dismiss detainee petitions based on the DTA, but the Supreme Court rejected this argument in the Hamdan case. Congress passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006, cutting off jurisdiction for habeas cases by aliens at Guantanamo Bay. The treatment of suspected enemy combatants at Guant\u00e1namo Bay has been a point of contention for the Bush Administration. President Bush announced that Taliban fighters are covered by the Geneva Conventions, while Al Qaeda fighters are not. Al Qaeda is excluded from the Conventions because it is not a state. The United States Armed Forces will continue to treat detainees according to policy. The Bush Administration considers detainees at Guant\u00e1namo Bay to be \"unlawful combatants\" who can be held indefinitely without trial. The 9/11 Commission recommended a common coalition approach for the humane treatment of captured terrorists. After the Hamdan decision, Al Qaeda detainees were to be covered by Common Article 3 protections. Approximately 380 detainees, including three children, have been released from Guantanamo Bay, with 85 deemed eligible for transfer. The legal status of detainees has been addressed by the Supreme Court's Hamdan decision and the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005. However, the treatment of remaining detainees remains contentious, with concerns raised by human rights groups about potential harsh treatment permitted by amendments to the War Crimes Act. The amendments to the War Crimes Act are criticized for allowing harsh treatment below international standards. The Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) process, not authorized by Congress but likely ratified, is seen as insufficient by critics to meet the standards set by the Supreme Court's Hamdi ruling. Critics view the CSRT proceedings as inadequate to meet the standards of the Hamdi ruling, which they believe should apply to all detainees regardless of citizenship or place of detention. CSRTs confirmed the status of 520 enemy combatants, with 38 detainees found not to be enemy combatants. The first round of ARBs resulted in decisions to release 14 detainees, transfer 120, and continue detaining 329. Some criticized the President's decision as contrary to international law, arguing it misinterpreted the Geneva Convention. The UNHCR and human rights organizations argue that all battlefield combatants should be treated as POWs until an independent tribunal determines otherwise. The U.N. Commission on Human Rights Working Group criticized the U.S. detention policy for \"enemy combatants\" as arbitrary and inconsistent with international law. The European Parliament expressed concern about detainees in Guant\u00e1namo and called for a tribunal to clarify their legal status. European Union countries voted against a resolution to investigate U.S. detention operations at Guantanamo Bay. The European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the European Council have called for detainees at Guantanamo Bay to be charged, tried, and treated according to international law. The Organization of American States' Inter-American Commission urged the United States to establish hearings to determine the legal status of the detainees, but the US declined, citing lack of jurisdiction to enforce the Geneva Conventions. The Geneva Conventions establish legal procedures for detainees in armed conflicts, granting specific privileges to POWs. The US has been urged to close Guantanamo Bay and provide hearings to determine detainee status, but has declined citing lack of jurisdiction. Groups that do not meet the standards for POW status may be considered \"unprivileged\" or \"unlawful combatants\" and could be treated as civilians under the Geneva Convention. They may be punished for acts of violence that legitimate combatants would not be punished for. Some argue for a third category of combatants from militias that do not qualify for POW status but also do not fall under civilian protection. The Bush Administration believed that the Geneva Conventions do not protect \"unlawful combatants,\" who could be tried by military commission. However, detainees were treated in accordance with Geneva Conventions for prisoners of war. Internal documents clarified the debate on applying the Geneva Conventions to Al Qaeda and the Taliban, with uncertainty on the Taliban's eligibility for POW status. The documents suggest that Afghanistan, as a \"failed state,\" lacked a functional government to field a regular army, raising questions on the conflict with the Taliban qualifying as an international war under GPW art. 2. State practice does not categorically deny POW status to irregular armed forces, with U.S. practice being generous towards irregulars. The U.S. has been generous in granting POW status to irregular forces, even when facing objections. The Geneva Conventions were considered outdated for dealing with terrorists, but their principles would still be followed. The Hamdan decision ruled that Common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applies to Al Qaeda fighters. The law of war, a subset of international law, has evolved to mitigate the harmful effects of war. Nations agree to abide by rules limiting their conduct in war, with two branches: Hague law for rules of engagement and Geneva law for human rights and prisoner treatment. Resorting to war requires separate legal justification. The law of war, a subset of international law, has evolved to mitigate the harmful effects of war. Nations agree to abide by rules limiting their conduct in war, with two branches: Hague law for rules of engagement and Geneva law for human rights and prisoner treatment. The justification for resorting to war in the first place is a separate legal regime, with distinctions between jus in bello and jus ad bellum. Adherence to the law of war is incentivized by the promise of humane treatment and legal privileges for captured members. The law of war aims to mitigate the harmful effects of war by setting rules for conduct. Adherence is incentivized by the promise of humane treatment and legal privileges for captured members. Reciprocity is a motivator, but not an absolute requirement, and reprisals against POWs or protected persons are not allowed. Some experts argue for a broad interpretation of humanitarian law to protect individual rights and reduce suffering. Some argue for a broad interpretation of humanitarian law to protect individual rights and reduce suffering during armed conflicts. The legal status of detainees in such conflicts depends on whether it is international or non-international, with some states treating rebels as common criminals rather than recognizing a state of war. The legal status of detainees in armed conflicts depends on whether it is international or non-international, determined by the status of the parties and the nature of hostilities. The Geneva Conventions apply to declared wars or armed conflicts between two or more parties, with considerations for temporal and geographical boundaries, as well as the status of occupied territories. Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applies to internal hostilities serious enough to amount to an armed conflict, even if not recognized as a state of war by all parties. The law of war does not apply to sporadic violence involving unorganized groups, but basic human rights still do. The classification of armed conflicts is straightforward in declared wars between states, which are now rare. The term \"internal armed conflict\" describes a civil war within a state with an organized rebel force controlling some territory. Classifying conflicts with foreign state intervention adds complexity, with some considering it internal if supporting a legitimate government and internationalized if backing a rebel movement. The war in Afghanistan shifted from internal to international when U.S. forces intervened. The conflict in Afghanistan shifted from internal to international when U.S. forces intervened, leading to debates on whether it met the Geneva Conventions' definition of an international armed conflict. The conflict in Afghanistan shifted to an international armed conflict when U.S. forces intervened, raising questions about the recognition of the Taliban as the legitimate government and the classification of the September 11 attacks as \"war crimes.\" The level of state support for terrorism and the responsibility under international law is debated. Denying state involvement in terrorist acts could impact the treatment of attacks as violations of the law of war. Treating the conflict as international could affect the status of POWs and \"protected persons\" under Geneva Conventions for U.S. and coalition soldiers. The decision to apply Geneva Conventions to the Taliban but not to Al-Qaeda may impact the conflict in Afghanistan. The decision to apply the Geneva Conventions to the Taliban but deny their application to Al Qaeda as a non-party may be an implicit recognition of an international armed conflict with the Taliban. However, the conflict with Al Qaeda is seen as separate, with debates on whether Al Qaeda qualifies as a belligerent. This raises questions about the legitimacy of Al Qaeda and the legality of US military actions. The war on terrorism may be shaping new international law regarding armed conflicts. The new international law allows states to use armed force against para-military groups in self-defense outside their territory, even initiating attacks to weaken or eradicate the group. The traditional rules of belligerents' rights and obligations are challenged, allowing states to wage war against non-entitled persons. Treatment of individuals in armed conflict is based on Geneva Conventions. The right to detain enemy combatants in international armed conflicts is not based on guilt but for security reasons to prevent further participation in combat. POWs and civilians can be punished for crimes committed before or during captivity, but only after a fair trial. Failure to provide a fair trial is considered a grave breach under international law. Neutral countries have an obligation to intern members of belligerent armed forces under the Geneva Conventions of 1949, treating them as POWs with certain exceptions. There is no obligation to detain non-lawful combatants suspected of participating in hostilities before crossing into neutral territory. The privileged status of prisoners of war is based on military necessity. Declarations of \"no quarter\" were forbidden to protect incapacitated enemy soldiers. The objective was incapacitation, not annihilation. Prisoner of war status was not given to brigands, pirates, looters, and pillagers. The Lieber Code was the first set of rules for POW protection, adopted during the Civil War. The Lieber Code established rules for the treatment of soldiers, citizens, and prisoners of war during armed conflicts. It prohibited declaring legitimate levy en masse as bandits and clarified that citizens could not rise up against an occupying force. The United States Army Field Manual 27-10 further expands on these rules for modern interpretation of the law of war. The Army's modern interpretation of the law of war is influenced by warfare and international conventions. Army Regulation 190-8 dictates the treatment of prisoners based on their status, while rules of engagement provide instructions on handling prisoners during combat operations. The authority to detain enemy combatants is based on agency or allegiance to the state, with enemy soldiers expected to cease fighting when hostilities end. Civilians may be interned during war if necessary in occupied or belligerent territory. During war, civilians in occupied or belligerent territory may be interned for security reasons. The Fourth Geneva Convention protects enemy civilians as \"protected persons\" if their state is a party to the convention. Nationals of neutral or co-belligerent states within enemy territory do not have protected status unless their state has diplomatic representation. Common Article 3 provides additional protections for civilians in conflict situations. Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention sets minimum standards for all persons in conflict, regardless of their status as \"protected persons.\" Civilians who engage in combat may be subject to punishment under the law of the jurisdiction where the acts occurred, including civil or military trials. While they may become lawful targets during combat, their status as civilians does not change. Unlawful belligerents, whether combatants or civilians, do not have the status of privileged combatants under the Geneva Conventions. They may be tried and punished under criminal law for their actions during combat, but their civilian status remains unchanged. Unlawful belligerents, such as spies, saboteurs, and mercenaries, act on behalf of a party in a conflict but are not considered lawful combatants. They forfeit combat immunity and may be tried and punished according to civilian law. Spies, in particular, may be denied POW treatment, tried, and possibly executed if captured. Spies and saboteurs, as unlawful belligerents, may be denied POW treatment and subject to trial and punishment. If they rejoin the enemy's army as lawful combatants, they are no longer punished for past acts. Saboteurs are entitled to fair trials before punishment. The Geneva Convention addresses the treatment of spies and saboteurs, applying different standards based on their actions. The Geneva Convention addresses the treatment of spies and saboteurs, applying different standards based on their actions and location. Spies and saboteurs may be denied POW treatment and subject to trial and punishment, with different rules for aliens in a belligerent state and individuals in occupied territory. Persons who forfeit communication rights under the Geneva Convention are to be treated with humanity and given fair trial rights. Mercenaries, who fight for personal gain and lack allegiance to a party, may not be considered valid agents of a conflict party. Mercenaries are individuals who may not have allegiance to a party in a conflict, operate for personal gain, and could switch sides for a better offer. They may have different objectives from the conflict party and could benefit from keeping the conflict ongoing. Non-Afghan members of groups like the Taliban and Al Qaeda have been suggested as potential mercenaries. The fighters in Afghanistan are believed to serve the Taliban or Al Qaeda for ideological reasons, not personal gain. The United States views them as enemies, not the Afghan people. While some individual fighters may be mercenaries, the groups as a whole are not labeled as such. Unlawful belligerents include civilians who engage in combat acts that should be done by authorized combatants. Civilians who engage in combat lose their protected status and may become lawful targets. They can be tried and punished under civil law for their belligerent acts, and may also be interned without trial. The Taliban and Al Qaeda do not fit the definition of unlawful combatants. The Taliban and Al Qaeda may not fit the definition of unlawful combatants as they are considered parties to the conflict who can be lawfully targeted. There is debate over whether they should be treated as civilians participating in armed conflict without authorization. Some argue for a third category of unlawful belligerents, consisting of irregular fighters who do not meet the criteria for prisoner of war status. Irregular fighters have faced uneven treatment in conflicts, with debates over their status as unlawful combatants. The lack of consensus on their treatment has led to efforts to codify the laws of war, but the issue remains contentious among states. Guerrilla tactics themselves are not inherently illegal, and some argue that irregular soldiers conducting conventional warfare are no different. Those who engage in lawful belligerent acts may not be considered unlawful combatants, but could be subject to internment by the state. The treatment of irregular fighters as unlawful combatants remains a contentious issue, with debates over their status and internment without charges. Some argue for applying Common Article 3 and international human rights law, while others believe they fall outside the law altogether. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 require POW status for captured enemy combatants who qualify under GPW article 4. Members of volunteer corps, militias, and organized resistance forces must meet specific criteria to be entitled to POW status under GPW article 4A(2). Regular armed forces of a state, even if unrecognized by the opposing party, do not need to meet the criteria for POW status. Taliban soldiers captured in Afghanistan are considered lawful combatants entitled to POW status, while Al Qaeda members would only qualify if they were part of the armed forces of Afghanistan. The GPW provides criteria for POW status, including being part of the armed forces of a state or an authority recognized in the conflict. Determining if an armed group is part of a regular army can be based on national laws. The GPW provides criteria for POW status based on national laws of the state party to the conflict. In cases of less developed military organizations, determining POW status may not be clear. Al Qaeda combat units incorporated into the Taliban army could argue for POW status. Al Qaeda members could qualify as POWs if they \"belonged to\" a party to the conflict, even if they were not part of the armed forces of Afghanistan. Informal cooperation between militia or volunteer groups and regular troops may bring militia members under POW status. The inclusion of the phrase \"organized resistance groups\" complicates the interpretation of criteria for POW status, especially in cases where a militia is fighting on behalf of a government-in-exile. An Israeli court faced this issue when members of the PLFP sought POW status for acts committed in the West Bank. The Israeli court upheld civil convictions for PLFP members in the West Bank, ruling they were not entitled to POW status as no government claimed responsibility for their actions. The PLFP could only belong to a party if it belonged to Jordan, but since it was illegal in Jordan, its members were not protected as POWs. The connection between the Taliban and Al Qaeda makes the Taliban responsible for Al Qaeda's terrorist acts and subject to military action. The debate over the POW status of detainees revolves around whether the four criteria in GPW art. 4A(2) apply only to irregulars or to all combatants. There is limited legal precedent to interpret these criteria, which have roots in early laws of war. The connection between the Taliban and Al Qaeda holds the Taliban responsible for Al Qaeda's terrorist acts and subject to military action. The criteria for POW status have roots in early laws of war and were a compromise between states with strong armies and weaker states. The Hague Convention prohibited ill treatment of those who do not meet the criteria, with the most important consideration being evidence of serving a government or political entity. The United States practiced according POW status as early as 1900 during the Philippine Insurrection. During the Philippine Insurrection, prisoner of war status was granted to members of the insurgent army recognized by the Philippine government who met certain conditions. Guerrilla band members not part of the regular forces faced severe punishment for violent acts. The British adopted a similar policy during the South African War but faced objections from foreign jurists and British statesmen. A new proclamation clarified that only inhabitants not continuously involved in fighting would be treated as rebels. During conflicts such as the Mexican War and the Franco-Prussian War, different approaches were taken towards irregular fighters. British forces punished those not authorized by a recognized government, while the US shifted to a more severe policy towards guerrillas. German commanders in the Franco-Prussian War refused to treat irregular fighters as lawful combatants. In 1914, the German army invading Belgium also refused to recognize irregular fighters. In 1914, the German army invaded Belgium and refused to recognize citizen defense of unoccupied territories as a valid \"people's war\" due to lack of organization by the Belgian government. Only combatants authorized by a state party to a conflict were allowed to participate in hostilities, with civilians becoming lawful military targets only if they took up arms against a belligerent. This ensured that only authorized persons participated in the conflict, excluding civilians as combatants and targets. Supporters argue that the Geneva Conventions should be interpreted literally regarding POW status for Taliban soldiers. There is debate over whether regular soldiers must meet specific criteria under customary international law. The 1907 Hague Convention could potentially apply these criteria to all military forces, but some argue that it may allow regular armies to evade their obligations. Regular armies could evade their obligations under the law of war by not fulfilling specific conditions, such as having a responsible command element. State recognition is not essential, and an organization can form spontaneously and elect its own officers. The key is acting on behalf of a higher authority. The Taliban is argued to have never fulfilled this requirement according to the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense suggested that the Taliban did not meet the requirement of having a responsible command element, as they were not organized in military units with identifiable chains of command. This could contradict the justification for targeting them. The Taliban's lack of a responsible command element and organization in military units with identifiable chains of command could contradict the justification for targeting them. The requirement for a \"fixed distinctive sign\" is satisfied by wearing military uniform, a helmet, or headdress that distinguishes individuals from civilians. It is desirable for militia members to wear a badge or brassard, but not necessary to inform the enemy of the distinctive sign. The GPW does not clarify the terms \"fixed\" or \"distinctive.\" The GPW does not provide clear definitions for what constitutes a \"fixed\" or \"distinctive\" sign, leading to potential misunderstandings. The requirement for a sign to be \"fixed\" aims to prevent easy removal by fighters, but it is unclear if this requirement should apply even when no military operations are ongoing. Additionally, there is ambiguity regarding how far a sign must be discernible. The evolving methods of locating and camouflaging military targets raise questions about the relevance of these standards today. The purpose of combatants distinguishing themselves from civilians is to protect civilians from being targeted. Requiring combatants to identify themselves with a mark or uniform serves tactical purposes and aids in targeting, preventing surprise attacks, and distinguishing friendly forces. Modern uniforms are designed for camouflage, making it difficult to distinguish soldiers from the surrounding foliage. The requirement for irregulars to wear a uniform is seen as a remnant of outdated warfare practices. The lack of uniform for irregular fighters can lead to loss of prisoner status if they deliberately conceal their identity to gather military information or wage war. This requirement is not more stringent than that set by regular armies. Guerrillas and terrorists lose protected status if they endanger civilians. Soldiers using civilian disguise to evade detection may not violate laws of war. Wearing full uniforms is not required as long as belligerent status is openly displayed. Taliban's lack of distinctive signs led to doubts about their status as combatants. Critics argue that the lack of uniforms worn by the Taliban and Northern Alliance fighters may be due to custom rather than deceit. The Pentagon's position that this makes them \"unlawful combatants\" is questioned, especially since the Northern Alliance conducted most of the hand-to-hand combat with U.S. air support. The success of the armed forces in quickly routing the enemy with no U.S. casualties may make the argument against Taliban force less persuasive. Critics point out U.S. Special Forces occasionally operate in civilian dress or enemy uniforms for infiltration. Carrying arms openly is required to prevent perfidious conduct in violation of the law of war. The distinction between carrying arms openly and visibly is noted by the ICRC to ensure loyalty in combat. The provision aims to ensure combatants are recognized as such by the enemy, regardless of their weapons. It is unclear if arms must always be carried openly or only during hostilities. Camouflage and concealing arms for surprise attacks may be permissible, but using disguised weapons for perfidious attacks could be prohibited. Questions arise about the same requirements for both attackers and the attacked during offensive operations. The Geneva Conventions require combatants to adhere to laws and customs of war, warning against treachery, maltreatment of prisoners, and unnecessary violence. Partisans are expected to respect these conventions fully. Partisans are required to adhere to the Geneva Conventions, including prohibitions on certain weapons like gas. They must follow moral criteria, avoid disproportionate violence, refrain from attacking civilians or disarmed individuals, and uphold principles of honor and loyalty. This is crucial for their recognition as irregular fighters, as states are unlikely to follow laws of war against an unbound enemy. The concept of the laws and customs of war is vague and subject to variation as forms of war evolve. The imprecision could lead to abuse, where a minor violation could be used to deny POW status to an entire army. There is debate on whether criteria apply to each soldier individually or to the army as a whole, and if individual soldiers can still qualify for POW status even if their leaders do not strictly enforce the rules. The United States has historically treated prisoners of war (POWs) in accordance with the Geneva Conventions, even when the opposing side did not follow the rules. This includes treating North Korean, Chinese, North Vietnamese, and some Vietcong prisoners as POWs, despite violations of the conventions by the Communist forces. The United States has historically treated prisoners of war (POWs) in accordance with the Geneva Conventions, even when the opposing side did not follow the rules. Despite North Vietnam's denial of the Geneva Convention's application, some Vietcong prisoners were treated as POWs. President Bush declared detainees as \"unlawful combatants\" not entitled to POW status, sparking debate over the need for a competent tribunal to determine their status. The 1949 Geneva Convention's provision for a competent tribunal to determine POW status was included to prevent summary decisions made by low-ranking soldiers on the battlefield. The United States interprets this as requiring an individual assessment of status before privileges can be denied, ensuring that any individual claiming POW status is entitled to an adjudication of that status. The conflict in Vietnam led to the first implementation of procedures for art. 5 tribunals by the United States Military Assistance Command (MACV) in 1966. POW status was granted to captured North Vietnamese Army and Vietcong fighters, while a tribunal determined the status of others. \"Irregulars\" were categorized into guerrillas, self-defense force, and secret self-defense force, eligible for POW status if captured in combat but denied if involved in terrorism, sabotage, or spying. In Grenada, during the conflict with Cuban military personnel and the Grenadian People's Revolutionary Army, all captives were initially treated as prisoners of war. They were later classified as POWs, retained persons, or civilian internees, with communication rights to their next of kin within seven days of capture. However, seventeen former government members accused of involvement in a coup attempt were initially detained incommunicado and interrogated on U.S. vessels before being transferred to revolutionary courts. The seventeen former government members accused of involvement in a coup attempt in Grenada were transferred to revolutionary courts financed by the United States and staffed by judges and lawyers from various Caribbean nations. They were found guilty, but Amnesty International alleged the trials were unfair and relied on coerced statements. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights later determined that the United States had violated multiple rights in the American Declaration on the Rights and Duties of Man. The current procedures for determining detainee status are prescribed in United States Army Regulation (AR) 190-8. The United States Army Regulation (AR) 190-8 outlines procedures for determining the status of detainees captured on the battlefield, including enemy prisoners of war (EPW), retained personnel (RP), civilian internees (CI), and other detainees (OD). Captives' status is initially determined by military police and intelligence personnel, with those whose status is unclear designated as \"OD\" until a tribunal can make a final determination. OD detainees are treated the same as EPWs according to AR 190-8 sec.1-6. The procedures for determining detainee status, including POW status, are outlined in AR 190-8 sec.1-6. A tribunal of three officers decides detainee status based on evidence, with no specific time limits for a final determination. Those not entitled to POW status cannot be penalized without further proceedings. In U.S. military operations, captured persons are termed \"detainees\" and treated according to humanitarian standards. However, they are not tried by military commission as unlawful combatants. During Operation Just Cause in Panama, detainees were treated as POWs, including members of the Panamanian armed forces. Additionally, common criminals, patients from a mental hospital, and some members of the Noriega regime were also detained. During Operation Just Cause in Panama, detainees, including members of the Panamanian armed forces, common criminals, patients from a mental hospital, and some members of the Noriega government, were classified by a tribunal. Most prisoners were handed over to the new Endara government, while 100 prisoners were retained by U.S. forces. General Manuel Noriega, captured during the operation, was eventually recognized as a POW and tried on drug charges in the United States. The text discusses the uncertainty surrounding General Noriega's status as a prisoner of war under Geneva III. It questions whether a formal complaint or lawsuit is necessary to determine his status, citing the standards set by Articles 2, 4, and 5 of Geneva III. The text also mentions the handling of prisoners during past conflicts, such as the Gulf War and Operation Iraqi Freedom. During Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, U.S. military forces conducted screenings to determine the status of detainees. Non-international armed conflicts are governed by Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and customary international law. The United States has not ratified Additional Protocol I but considers many of its provisions as customary. Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and customary international law do not authorize the detention of suspected combatants. It does not distinguish between lawful and unlawful combatants and does not affect the legal status of non-state parties in a conflict. Recognizing Common Article 3 does not imply belligerency, allowing states to prosecute insurgents for offenses without granting combatant immunity. The laws of war only apply in a belligerency, an armed conflict between two belligerents. Human rights treaties are more relevant in internal armed conflicts than in international armed conflicts. Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions states that individuals not entitled to prisoner-of-war status have the right to protection under Article 75. This includes being promptly informed in a language they understand if arrested, detained, or interned for actions related to the armed conflict. The Department of Defense defends its treatment of detainees at Guant\u00e1namo Naval Station as compliant with the Geneva Convention and other relevant laws. Critics argue that the U.S.' position is controversial. Critics argue that the U.S.' position on the Geneva Conventions could set a precedent for poor human rights practices by other regimes and may lead to harsh treatment of U.S. service members. Granting POW status to detainees could have foreign policy and humanitarian benefits, but the Administration emphasizes the negative impact on the war against terror. The U.S. military's stance on denying POW status to detainees is based on the need for interrogation to gather intelligence. While the Geneva Conventions require basic information from prisoners, detaining powers can request more without coercion. Torture is strictly prohibited for all detainees, regardless of their status. The 1929 Geneva Convention prohibits torture for all detainees, regardless of status. Case precedent on acceptable conduct during interrogation is limited. A British military court convicted German officers for improperly interrogating British POWs by using excessive heat and threats. The court agreed that interrogation was not unlawful under the Geneva Convention in force. Interrogation of prisoners after capture is a common military practice to gather tactical information. While there is no right to counsel during interrogation, POWs accused of crimes have the right to legal representation. The Geneva Convention prohibits coercion to obtain confessions from POWs, suggesting they may be entitled to an exclusionary rule to prevent forced confessions from being used as evidence. The Geneva Convention prohibits coercion to obtain confessions from prisoners of war, ensuring they are not subjected to ill-treatment during interrogations. Prohibited acts include violence, torture, outrages upon personal dignity, and the use of hostages. Additionally, Article 75 of Protocol I prohibits violence to the life, health, or well-being of individuals, as well as humiliating and degrading treatment. Different procedural guidelines may apply for the trial and punishment of detainees based on their status. The Geneva Conventions prohibit coercion and ill-treatment of prisoners of war during interrogations. Different procedural guidelines apply for the trial and punishment of detainees based on their status and the nature of the offense. Military jurisdiction allows for trying enemy POWs and civilians for violations of the law of war, but not for pre-capture acts not connected to the armed conflict. Article 84 of the Geneva Conventions ensures that prisoners of war must be tried by courts offering independence and impartiality, with proper defense rights. Procedural guarantees include no punishment for ex post facto crimes, prompt notification of charges, right to counsel, trial in the presence of a Protecting Power representative, and the right to appeal. The Geneva Conventions ensure that prisoners of war have the right to appeal decisions and serve sentences under humane conditions. Special provisions apply for offenses punishable by death, with a six-month delay before execution. Belligerent states may exercise jurisdiction over civilians in occupied territories, but local penal laws remain unless deemed a threat to security. Occupying powers can enact laws for order and security. The Geneva Conventions guarantee the rights of prisoners of war, including the right to appeal sentences and be treated humanely. Occupying powers must provide a fair trial for accused persons, with the right to counsel, interpreter, and appeal. Protected persons also have the right to have the Protecting Power notified of charges and attend the trial. If a protected person is sentenced to death, the sentence may not be carried out prior to six months after the Protecting Power is notified of the sentence. Chapter IX provides protection against duplicate punishment for civilian internees. Internees may not be punished for simple disciplinary breaches by confinement in a penitentiary. The term \"unlawful belligerents\" is not in the Geneva Conventions, so rules for their trials depend on their classification as civilian or under a separate standard. If Common Article 3 applies, passing sentences and executions without previous notice are forbidden. The Geneva Conventions regulate the use of deadly force to prevent escape, requiring warning before firing shots. Attempted escape is a disciplinary matter, with no punishment if the prisoner is recaptured. Extraordinary surveillance measures may be imposed on prisoners who attempt escape. The Geneva Conventions permit control and security measures for civilian detainees during conflicts, with confinement limited to those awaiting trials. The line between security and punitive measures is unclear, with living conditions at facilities like Guant\u00e1namo Bay potentially seen as punitive. The Department of Defense has added a new medium-security facility, Camp 4, with cells. The Department of Defense has established Camp 4, a medium-security facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, to house detainees deemed less threatening but unable to be repatriated. Detainees are searched for weapons upon capture, and arguments exist regarding POW status and repatriation requirements. Internment of POWs must cease when no longer necessary under GPW art. 21. The Geneva Convention outlines rules for the internment and repatriation of prisoners of war. Repatriation must occur promptly after the cessation of hostilities, with exceptions for those charged with crimes. Case law shows that repatriation is not automatic, as seen in a WWII POW case where hostilities had ceased but no peace treaty was in place. The Geneva Convention states that prisoners of war and interned civilians must be repatriated promptly after the end of hostilities, with exceptions for those facing criminal charges. The responsibility for the proper treatment of prisoners lies with the detaining power. Customary international law also imposes similar rules for individuals deprived of their liberty under Common Article 3. The proper treatment of prisoners is the responsibility of the detaining power and those directly responsible. Mistreatment of prisoners of war may lead to liability under international norms and the UCMJ. Refusal to hold tribunals to determine detainees' legal status may violate the law of war. Detainees have the right to protest their treatment to the detaining power or a neutral organization like the International Committee of the Red Cross. Other signatory states must ensure respect for the Conventions and may issue diplomatic challenges or seek legal action in domestic courts on behalf of detainees. The detainees have limited recourse to challenge their status as \"enemy combatants\" in federal courts under the Detainee Treatment Act and the Military Commissions Act. Congress has the authority to legislate the treatment of battlefield detainees and declare war, which limits some presidential authorities. Despite Congress having the authority to legislate the treatment of battlefield detainees and declare war, they have not been actively involved in prescribing the treatment of prisoners of war. Existing statutes are limited to providing for expenses related to prisoners of war, penalizing those who aid in their escape, and exempting them from certain entitlements. However, prisoners of war are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The Administration argues that the war on terror necessitates new rules and definitions. The war on terror requires new rules and definitions, with Congress playing a crucial role in shaping how the conflict is fought. Courts have not supported the President's authority to determine war tactics, but recent legislation may limit judicial oversight. Measures were introduced in the 108th Congress to address detainee treatment. The 108th Congress introduced legislation to address detainee treatment in connection with the war on terrorism. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2005 emphasized proper treatment of prisoners, prohibiting torture and abuse, ensuring investigation of abuse instances, and providing protection for detainees under the Geneva Conventions. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2005 requires the military to process and prosecute detainees, ensure proper treatment according to obligations, submit regulations to Congress, and report on detainee operations.

The House of Representatives expressed support for interrogation operations at Guantanamo Bay. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2006 prohibits cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of detainees in U.S. custody, based on constitutional amendments and the U.N. Convention Against Torture. It restricts detainees from seeking relief in court for inconsistent treatment and limits court jurisdiction over challenges related to Guantanamo Bay detainees' treatment. The provision also offers legal defense to U.S. officers and agents involved in detainee treatment. This language was added as a compromise to exempt the CIA from the prohibition on cruel treatment. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2006 prohibits cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of detainees in U.S. custody. The DTA sought to exempt the CIA from this prohibition for flexibility in dealing with terrorism. The Graham-Levin Amendment requires the Defense Department to submit procedural rules for detainee status determination to congressional committees. The DTA modified language regarding assessment of statements obtained from detainees and eliminated federal courts' jurisdiction over habeas claims by Guantanamo Bay detainees. The Supreme Court found that some pending habeas corpus claims were not affected, and the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals of status determinations made by a \"Designated Civilian Official.\" The DTA procedures for status determinations of detainees are supported by evidence, with a rebuttable presumption in favor of the government. Appeals can be made based on compliance with Constitution and laws. Jurisdiction ends if detainee is transferred from DoD custody. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 amended DTA provisions for appellate review and habeas corpus. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA) amends DTA provisions for appellate review and habeas corpus jurisdiction, making CSRT review the exclusive remedy for all aliens detained as enemy combatants. It revokes U.S. courts' jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petitions by all aliens in U.S. custody as enemy combatants, regardless of location. The MCA also precludes the application of the Geneva Conventions to habeas or civil proceedings. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA) amends DTA provisions for appellate review and habeas corpus jurisdiction, making CSRT review the exclusive remedy for all aliens detained as enemy combatants.

The Secretary of State must report on progress every 180 days, detailing steps taken to implement recommendations and achieve policy goals. The Military Commissions Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007 (H.R. 267) aims to restore habeas corpus jurisdiction to federal courts for aliens detained as \"enemy combatants.\" It does not restore jurisdiction for other court actions related to such detention but maintains appellate jurisdiction for challenges to military commission final decisions and CSRT review decisions."
