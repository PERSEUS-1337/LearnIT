    "content": "Congress has passed laws requiring federal agencies to purchase goods made in the United States, including the Berry Amendment for Department of Defense purchases and the Kissell Amendment for certain Department of Homeland Security agencies. These laws mandate that items must be 100% domestic unless exemptions apply. Supporters argue that these laws benefit the U.S. economy by preserving the industrial base, creating manufacturing jobs, and reducing dependence on foreign sources for critical needs. The Berry Amendment, enacted in 1941, requires federal agencies to purchase goods made in the United States for military and nonmilitary needs. Supporters believe it benefits the U.S. economy by preserving the industrial base and creating manufacturing jobs, while opponents argue it gives monopolies to certain companies and raises procurement costs. The amendment has been amended multiple times and is a permanent part of the U.S. Code. Proposed changes to the Berry Amendment are typically considered during defense appropriations acts and the National Defense Authorization Act. The Berry Amendment requires DOD to purchase products made entirely in the United States, with exceptions granted only if domestic firms cannot produce the item. This includes raw materials, components, and final assembly all being done in the U.S. This mandate surpasses the Buy American Act of 1933 in terms of domestic content requirements. The Buy American Act of 1933 governs federal procurements, requiring products to be mined, produced, or manufactured in the U.S. The World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement allows foreign products to be treated as domestic in certain cases. The Berry Amendment restricts DOD procurements involving textiles, clothing, food, and hand or measuring tools. It also applies to various U.S. free-trade agreements. The Kissell Amendment, similar to the Berry Amendment, applies to the Coast Guard and TSA within DHS, imposing domestic content restrictions on certain products. The Kissell Amendment, like the Berry Amendment, applies to certain DHS agencies for national security-related purchases of clothing, textiles, and footwear. It requires these products to be wholly produced in the United States, covering a range of items including fabrics, equipment, and footwear. Unlike the Berry Amendment, it does not include food or hand/measuring tools. The Kissell Amendment applies to the Coast Guard and TSA within DHS for national security-related purchases, requiring products to be made in the USA. Other DHS agencies like Customs and Border Protection are not covered by this exemption. Under the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, DHS can purchase textile and apparel products from over 100 countries if certain conditions are met. The United States has free-trade agreements allowing procurement of imported goods. Manufacturers in Mexico, Canada, and Chile are considered \"American\" sources under the Kissell Amendment. The Berry Amendment has exemptions allowing DOD to buy items from non-U.S. sources under specific circumstances. The Kissell Amendment provides exemptions for purchasing textile, clothing, or footwear items in certain situations, such as emergency acquisitions, resale at retail stores, or contracts below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. It shares similarities with the Berry Amendment but also has differences, like the inclusion of \"national security\" limiting language. The Kissell Amendment includes \"national security\" limiting language, restricting coverage to purchases for DHS activities protecting the US from threats. Berry Amendment sales to DOD totaled $2.4 billion in FY2016, accounting for 1% of department spending. In FY2016, the Coast Guard and TSA spent over $30 million on Berry-related products, mainly uniforms. The decrease in Armed Forces personnel has led to a drop in spending on these products. Increased defense spending could boost DOD demand for Berry-applicable items, which must be made in the USA under the Berry and Kissell Amendments. This has created niche markets for domestic producers. In FY2016, DOD spent $1.6 billion on Berry-compliant textile and apparel purchases, while DHS spent over $30 million on apparel under the Kissell Amendment. These purchases accounted for 2% of the $68 billion in textile and apparel shipments from U.S. factories in 2016. Top apparel products consumed by DOD included special-purpose clothing, personal armor, individual equipment, and footwear. Major private contractors benefiting from the Berry Amendment market included American Apparel, Ceradyne, Campbellsville Apparel, and contractors selling textile fabrics to DOD. In FY2016, DOD spent $1.6 billion on Berry-compliant textile and apparel purchases, with major private contractors like American Apparel and Ceradyne benefiting from the market. Puerto Rico is a significant source of military apparel items, with suppliers like Propper International and Federal Prison Industries delivering prison-manufactured apparel compliant with the Berry Act. In FY2016, federal prisons produced clothes and textiles totaling nearly $100 million. Critics have raised concerns about the Department of Defense awarding clothing contracts to these prisons, arguing that it hurts private industry and provides jobs for inmates instead of non-incarcerated residents. The mandatory source provision of FPI/UNICOR requires DOD to purchase from these factories if they can meet the product requirements and offer competitive prices, with waivers granted if the prison share of federal purchases exceeds 5% of total DOD purchases. In FY2016, DOD accounted for over 90% of FPI/UNICOR's textile and apparel sales, with FPI/UNICOR also selling apparel to the U.S. Coast Guard. Congress has considered bills to eliminate FPI's mandatory source clause and require competition for federal contracts. VF Imagewear, a subsidiary of VF Corporation, was TSA's top apparel supplier in FY2016. Congress regularly considers exemptions to the Berry Amendment. Lawmakers have granted exemptions to the Berry Amendment, such as waivers for specific fabrics used in combat uniforms and body armor. Apparel firms outsource manufacturing to low-wage countries, leading to a significant drop in direct employment in apparel manufacturing. The textile manufacturing industry has seen a significant decline in employment, with many workers now focused on producing fabrics for industrial applications. The Berry and Kissell Amendments require apparel manufacturers to use domestic suppliers for components like buttons and zippers, but this has led to challenges in competing in the commercial apparel market. Despite protection from these amendments, domestic production of textiles remains difficult to sustain. Manufacturers struggle to maintain domestic production of textiles and apparel. DuPont closes South Carolina plant due to uncertainty in DOD orders. Bureau of Industry and Security updating assessment of U.S. textile industry. 99% of footwear in the U.S. is imported. The United States has a small number of firms manufacturing nonorthopedic footwear, including military boots, employing about 10,800 workers in 2015. DOD's direct purchases of footwear totaled about $157 million in FY2015, protecting approximately 1,000 jobs. Leading DOD footwear contractors include McRae, Rocky Brands, and Wolverine. Congress extended the Berry Amendment to require the military to provide recruits with 100% U.S.-made running shoes in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act. The new requirement for military recruits to purchase athletic footwear, starting on October 1, 2018, may create a new market for domestically manufactured running shoes. Companies like New Balance and Wolverine Worldwide are adapting to meet the 100% U.S.-made requirement of the Berry Amendment. New Balance currently imports the majority of its inventory from China and Vietnam but plans to manufacture wholly American-made athletic shoes for the military. Wolverine Worldwide, based in Michigan, produces some shoes in the U.S. and others in Asia. Nike and Adidas are major athletic shoe brands that source their footwear from overseas manufacturers. Adidas plans to open a factory in the United States in 2017 to produce U.S.-made running shoes using robots. Military food items are purchased through the Defense Logistics Agency in Philadelphia, with the Berry Amendment requiring food served to U.S.-based troops to be of wholly domestic origin. The Kissell Amendment does not have provisions related to food products. Food products accounted for over $655 million in sales in FY2016, representing 1% of domestic food manufacturing shipments. The Defense Logistics Agency purchases U.S.-origin food products from manufacturers like Kraft Heinz, Nestle, and Tyson Foods for delivery to military dining facilities through a prime vendor program. The Department of Defense (DOD) purchases food products from various vendors, including unique and perishable items directly from producers. Meals ready-to-eat (MREs) are a significant portion of food sourced under the Berry Amendment, with AmeriQual, SoPakCo, and Wornick being the main suppliers. These companies employ over 1,600 people, with AmeriQual generating 85% of its revenue from MRE sales to the military. DOD is required to buy food from U.S. sources under the Berry Amendment, which is easier to meet due to the large domestic agricultural sector. The food industry in the U.S. supplies the majority of food purchased by consumers and has a high domestic content. The Berry Amendment affects food purchases by the Department of Defense, allowing for processed food items with ingredients from other countries. Certain exemptions exist for items not readily available from U.S. growers. The Berry Amendment affects food purchases by the Department of Defense, allowing for items not readily available from U.S. growers, such as bananas, capers, cashew nuts, coffee, cocoa beans, olive oil, bulk spices and herbs, raw sugar, tea, and vanilla beans. The most restrictive provisions pertain to fish, shellfish, and seafood, which must be sourced from U.S. waters and processed in the United States or on a U.S.-flag ship. The Berry Amendment affects food purchases by the Department of Defense, requiring items like fish and seafood to be sourced from U.S. waters. American Samoa's tuna industry has benefited from these provisions, but some companies have reduced operations due to wage increases. Food procurement for military facilities is excluded from the Berry Amendment, with most nonperishable items still acquired from U.S. manufacturers. The Berry Amendment mandates that hand and measuring tools purchased by the Department of Defense must be wholly produced in the United States, unless exemptions apply. Compliance with this mandate can be challenging, as some tool sets or kits may contain thousands of tools, and the domestic supply of certain tools may be limited. In 2016, imports accounted for over 40% of domestic demand for hand tools. The Kissell Amendment does not address hand or measuring tools. In 2016, imports of hand tools made up over 40% of domestic demand. Suppliers to DOD must ensure compliance with the Berry Amendment for tool sets. Hand or measuring tools only make up a small portion of DOD's Berry-applicable contract obligations, valued at around $100 million in FY2016. Leading distributors to DOD include Federal Resources Supply, Snap-On, and Kipper Tool. Despite the law, manufacturers are not incentivized to produce tools in the US. Cutlery and hand tool shipments totaled $10.3 billion in 2015, with DOD sales under the Berry Amendment accounting for about 1%. The Berry Amendment accounted for about 1% of cutlery and hand tool shipments totaling $10.3 billion in 2015. Proponents argue that the laws keep U.S. production lines operating and prevent dependence on foreign sources for critical military items. Critics suggest that the laws may raise procurement costs. Critics argue that amendments requiring the purchase of domestic products could increase costs and delay deliveries. They believe these laws are outdated in today's global manufacturing practices and could strain foreign trade relationships. Despite the controversy, Congress has focused on amending the scope of the laws, waiver requirements, and effectiveness audits, rather than repealing them. There have been efforts to reduce the Berry Amendment's scope, such as bills aiming to eliminate federal contract mandates for FPI/UNICOR. Lawmakers have introduced bills to amend domestic preference laws, including raising the Berry and Kissell thresholds to $500,000. These proposals aim to reduce the number of purchases covered by the amendments, allowing foreign suppliers to bid on more DOD and DHS contracts. In the 115th Congress, the Homeland Production Security Act sought to expand the Kissell Amendment to DHS agencies like Customs and Border Patrol and FEMA. None of these proposals have passed yet. President Donald Trump issued an executive order on April 18, 2017, directing executive branch agencies to prioritize the use of goods produced in the United States and minimize waivers of the Berry Act requirements. The impact of this order on DOD and DHS interpretations of waivers remains unclear. The executive order issued by President Trump on April 18, 2017, prioritizes the use of U.S.-made goods and aims to reduce waivers of the Berry Act requirements. Recent audits show varying levels of compliance by the Navy, Air Force, and Army with the Berry Amendment. Senator Christopher Murphy has requested a Government Accountability Office investigation into U.S. government compliance with the Berry Amendment and the Buy American Act. Additionally, the Senate committee report on the 2016 DHS appropriations bill requested a GAO audit of DHS's compliance with the Kissell Amendment. The Kissell Amendment, part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113), is being studied by the GAO with an expected completion in 2017.
