    "content": "The \"No Child Left Behind Fairness Act of 2004\" is the short title of the Act. It includes a review of adequate yearly progress determinations for schools for the 2002-2003 school year. The Secretary requires each local educational agency to allow schools to request a review of determinations regarding adequate yearly progress for the 2002-2003 school year. Within 30 days of a school's request, the agency must issue a final determination publicly. The agency must consider evidence submitted by the school's principal during the review process. In reviewing determinations of adequate yearly progress for the 2002-2003 school year, a local educational agency must consider amendments to regulations or guidance issued by the Secretary. The Secretary issued a determination regarding limited English proficient children and related requirements under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. If a local educational agency determines a school made revisions, it will have an effect as per the review process. The local educational agency determines if a school met yearly progress for a specific school year. If so, any prior actions taken due to not meeting progress will be terminated, and obligations will cease. Exceptions apply to certain obligations under Section 1116(b)(13) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Section 1116(b)(13) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act requires a local educational agency to allow a transferred child to remain in the new school until completion of the highest grade. Section 1116(e)(8) mandates the agency to provide supplemental educational services until the end of the school year. Subsequent determinations are made to determine if a school needs improvement, corrective action, or restructuring for not meeting yearly progress. Restructuring due to inadequate yearly progress will not be considered if a school's determination is revised and it is found to have made adequate yearly progress. The Secretary must notify schools of their right to request a review, and the public will be informed of the review process on the Department of Education's website within 30 days of enactment. The Secretary will require State educational agencies to allow local educational agencies to request a review of their determination of not making adequate yearly progress for the 2002-2003 school year. The provisions of section 2 will apply to this review process. In this Act, key terms are defined such as \"adequate yearly progress,\" \"local educational agency,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"school.\" The term \"State educational agency\" refers to a State educational agency receiving funds under part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965."
