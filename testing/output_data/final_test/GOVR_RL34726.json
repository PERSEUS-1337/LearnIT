    "content": "The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) applies to all foreign states and their agencies and instrumentalities, providing immunity against suits in U.S. courts based on diplomatic efforts over judicial proceedings. Congress passed the FSIA to codify these principles and clarify limitations on immunity. The FSIA includes a general rule against litigation in U.S. courts but also has exceptions allowing suits against foreign states. Exceptions to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) include cases where a foreign state has waived its immunity, admiralty claims, commercial activities, property rights in the US, tortious conduct in the US, claims under an arbitration agreement, and claims seeking damages from state sponsors of terrorism for terrorist acts. This exception allows jurisdiction over cases involving designated state sponsors of terrorism for acts such as torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, or providing material support for such acts. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) includes exceptions for cases involving designated state sponsors of terrorism, such as Iran, Sudan, and Syria. Before a federal court can accept a case, it must establish jurisdiction over the dispute and the parties involved. Subject matter and personal jurisdiction differ for cases involving foreign defendants, depending on whether the FSIA applies. Subject matter and personal jurisdiction differ when the FSIA applies. Federal law allows subject matter jurisdiction for claims exceeding $75,000 against foreign non-state defendants. The FSIA acts as a gatekeeper for claims against foreign states, denying jurisdiction over immune defendants. Individual foreign officials may be immune under common law. The former president of Saudi-run charities, accused of funding the 9/11 attacks, used common-law foreign sovereign immunity to dismiss the lawsuit. Personal jurisdiction is crucial for asserting authority over foreign defendants, requiring statutory authority and Fifth Amendment due process standards. Statutory authority for personal jurisdiction over foreign defendants under the FSIA requires subject matter jurisdiction for foreign states or their agencies. For defendants who are not foreign states, federal courts must find statutory authority in state laws. Constitutional limits also apply, requiring minimum contacts with the forum and adherence to fair play principles. The type and quantity of contacts needed for \"minimum contacts\" for personal jurisdiction differ for general and specific jurisdiction. General jurisdiction requires \"continuous and systematic\" contacts, while specific jurisdiction requires contacts that \"relate to\" or \"arise out of\" the claim at issue in the case. In August 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed dismissals of claims against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Second Circuit affirmed dismissals of claims against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a Saudi charity, Saudi princes, and a Saudi banker in relation to the September 11 terrorist attacks. The court ruled that U.S. courts lack jurisdiction over the claims due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the FSIA and lack of personal jurisdiction. The court's interpretation of the FSIA, particularly regarding \"agency or instrumentality,\" was a key aspect of the opinion. The Second Circuit affirmed dismissals of claims against Saudi Arabia, a Saudi charity, princes, and a banker related to the September 11 attacks. The court ruled lack of jurisdiction under the FSIA and lack of personal jurisdiction. The case is on appeal at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Plaintiffs in In re Terrorist Attacks, individuals and businesses injured by September 11 attacks, brought claims based on state and federal laws. Dismissed claims include those against Saudi Arabia, Saudi princes, a Saudi charity, and a banker. The allegations centered on defendants' involvement in the attacks. The appeals court affirmed dismissals of claims against Saudi Arabia and Saudi princes for lack of jurisdiction under the FSIA. The court held that none of the FSIA exceptions applied, and claims against princes in their personal capacities were dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court determined whether the Saudi Holding Company (SHC) qualified as an \"agency or instrumentality\" under the FSIA by assessing if it was an \"organ\" of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia using a multi-factor test. The court applied a five-criteria test to determine if the Saudi Holding Company (SHC) was an \"organ\" of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, concluding that it was an agency or instrumentality. The plaintiffs sued four Saudi princes who held positions of power in the SHC. The Second Circuit ruled that individuals acting within their official capacities were considered \"agencies\" of their states and entitled to immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA). This decision was based on textual arguments and the legislative history of the FSIA, which aimed to codify common law principles, including extending immunity to state officials. The court highlighted the potential erosion of immunity for foreign officials if they were not granted protection under the FSIA. The Second Circuit ruled that individuals acting within their official capacities were considered \"agencies\" of their states and entitled to immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA). This decision was based on the potential erosion of immunity for foreign states if immunity extended only to government actions distinct from the actions of officials as individuals. The Supreme Court established the minority position as the correct one, granting jurisdiction over remaining Saudi officials subject to the same inquiry as other individuals. The court of appeals ruled that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) applied to Saudi officials and the Saudi Humanitarian Commission (SHC) as an agency of the Kingdom. The terrorist state exception did not apply as the U.S. State Department had not designated Saudi Arabia as a state sponsor of terrorism. The court also found that the commercial activity and tort exceptions did not apply. The court rejected the argument that the commercial activities exception should apply to the Saudi defendants, as their charitable contributions were not considered money laundering. The definition of \"commercial activity\" under the FSIA was clarified as engaging in trade and commerce. The court upheld the district court's finding that defendants' \"charitable contributions\" were non-commercial in nature, despite alleged money laundering purposes. The court also rejected the tort exception for claims against the Saudi defendants, citing Congress's intent to create liability for incidents like traffic accidents in the US. The expanded tort exception could potentially impact the terrorist state exception under FSIA. A later appellate court panel disagreed with this expansion, overturning the decision for the Second Circuit. In December 2013, the appellate court granted relief to the plaintiffs, sending the case back to the district court to determine the applicability of the tort exception and the defendants' immunity based on their actions. The court was also asked to consider the \"entire tort\" rule in relation to the Saudi government's activities outside the US. The appeals court upheld subject matter jurisdiction for claims against a Saudi banker and princes for actions taken in their personal capacities, but lacked personal jurisdiction over the princes due to insufficient contacts with the forum. Plaintiffs' argument that minimum contacts were satisfied by supporting the attacks was rejected by the court. The court rejected the plaintiff's argument that foreseeability of terrorist attacks was enough to establish minimum contacts for personal jurisdiction. Judge Daniels dismissed claims against Saudi Arabia and the SHC, citing the FSIA tort exception and the discretionary act exception. The Second Circuit applies the \"entire tort\" rule to determine if a foreign government's conduct is subject to the FSIA tort exception. The tort exception only covers torts occurring within the US, requiring the defendant's tortious conduct to also occur within the US to overcome immunity. The appellate court did not rule out jurisdiction unless all conduct associated with the injury happens solely within the US. The Second Circuit applies the \"entire tort\" rule to determine if a foreign government's conduct is subject to the FSIA tort exception. The appellate court clarified that for jurisdiction to apply, it is not necessary for all conduct associated with the injury to occur solely within the United States, but rather that some tortious act must be committed by the defendant in the US. In the case of the Saudi charities, the defendants' conduct was found to have occurred abroad, and their alleged support for terrorist attacks was deemed distinct from the September 11, 2001 attacks. The district court found that the Kingdom and the SHC were immune from jurisdiction under the tort exception. The plaintiffs attempted to attribute the activities of certain individuals in the US to Saudi Arabia, but the court found insufficient evidence to support this claim. The district judge ruled that the Saudi government and the SHC were immune from jurisdiction under the tort exception, based on the discretionary function exclusion. The judge outlined a two-part rule for determining immunity for tortious conduct, emphasizing that the acts alleged must involve judgment or choice grounded in public policy. This decision was influenced by a previous ruling granting immunity for decisions related to funding Islamic charities. The Saudi government and the SHC were granted immunity from jurisdiction under the tort exception due to the discretionary function exclusion. This decision was influenced by a previous ruling regarding funding Islamic charities. Some courts have found the discretionary act exclusion inapplicable to tortious acts in the United States that amounted to illegal conduct. The FSIA tort exception does not apply to bar a suit against a foreign government for ordering or aiding in an assassination, as such actions are illegal and not discretionary acts. The FSIA tort exception does not apply to bar a suit against a foreign government for ordering or aiding in an assassination, as such actions are illegal and not discretionary acts. Courts may view direct involvement of a foreign official overseas in tortious activity on U.S. territory as part of the same tort, suggesting the \"entire tort\" rule may not be strictly followed. The appellate court may reverse the district court's dismissal of the suit on \"entire tort\" grounds, leading to a determination of whether the alleged tortious acts retain immunity as discretionary functions. In a separate decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of claims against five defendants in a case related to the Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001. Plaintiffs brought claims against defendants under common-law tort theory, Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), Alien Tort Statute (ATS), and Torture Victims' Protection Act (TVPA). The ATA allows U.S. nationals injured by international terrorism to recover damages, but plaintiffs failed to show defendants' actions caused their injuries. Appellate court ruled ATA does not cover liability on aiding-and-abetting theory. The Alien Tort Statute provides federal jurisdiction for tort claims by non-U.S. citizens for conduct violating international norms. The Supreme Court limited its scope to specific 18th-century paradigms, excluding international terrorism as of September 11, 2001. The court stated that there is no international consensus on the definition of terrorism, with disagreement among states on what actions constitute terrorism. Terrorism does not provide a basis for universal jurisdiction under customary international law. The court also rejected reliance on the Torture Victim Protection Act for a cause of action. In Terrorist Attacks III, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit narrowly interpreted the exceptions under the FSIA, hindering efforts by September 11 victims to seek recovery in U.S. courts against foreign officials and government-controlled entities. Efforts to hold non-government financial institutions liable for providing material to terrorist organizations have also been impeded by the courts' interpretations of the ATA. Efforts to broaden the FSIA tort exception to cover terrorist acts in the United States have been made in Congress, with bills like the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act being introduced. This legislation aims to make it easier for victims of state-sponsored terrorism to bring lawsuits against foreign officials. The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, introduced in Congress, aims to allow victims of state-sponsored terrorism to sue foreign officials. S. 1894 and H.R. 5904 were introduced in the Senate Judiciary Committee, with S. 1535 passing the Senate in December 2014 but not voted on by the House. The bills would have amended the tort exception to the FSIA to include various terrorism-related claims. The bills introduced in Congress aimed to amend the tort exception to the FSIA to allow victims of state-sponsored terrorism to sue foreign officials. The proposed changes would expand liability for foreign government officials in civil actions for terrorist acts, regardless of where they occur, by amending 18 U.S.C. Section 2337. The amended version of Section 2337 would have exempted only U.S. officials in civil actions for terrorist acts. H.R. 3143 included material support for terrorism in the jurisdiction provision. The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) has returned to Congress as S. 2040 and H.R. 3815, amending the FSIA tort exception to limit injury claims to \"physical injury.\" The bill aims to expand the non-commercial tort exception under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to cover injuries, deaths, and property damage occurring in the United States regardless of where the underlying tortious act occurred. It also includes provisions related to acts of extrajudicial killing, terrorism, and material support for such acts. The bill aims to create a new exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act for acts of international terrorism on U.S. territory, allowing plaintiffs to seek money damages for physical injury or death caused by such acts. This amendment would dispense with certain rules and exclusions, while leaving current law intact for other cases under the FSIA non-commercial tort exception. The bill aims to create a new exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act for acts of international terrorism on U.S. territory, allowing plaintiffs to seek money damages for physical injury or death caused by such acts. S. 2040 would provide for exclusive federal court jurisdiction over foreign states under the new FSIA provision, and would authorize the Attorney General to intervene in such cases to seek a stay of the civil action if the Secretary of State certifies that the United States is engaged in good faith discussions with the defendant state to resolve the claims. The bill allows plaintiffs to seek damages for acts of international terrorism on U.S. territory. The court can issue a stay for 180 days, renewable if negotiations continue. JASTA includes criteria for aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability under the ATA. Aiding and abetting requires the defendant to assist in a wrongful act, be aware of their role, and substantially assist the violation. Conspiracy leads to civil liability with an agreement between parties. The bills would implement secondary liability for acts of international terrorism planned, committed, or authorized by designated foreign terrorist organizations. Liability would apply to entities designated as foreign terrorist organizations at the time of the attack, with secondary liability attaching to any person involved in the agreement. The Senate bill introduces secondary liability for aiding and abetting acts of international terrorism by providing substantial assistance or conspiring with the perpetrator. The House bill also allows for secondary liability for aiding, abetting, or conspiring without specifying the required intent or knowledge. Both bills suggest that providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization should lead to liability under the ATA. H.R. 3815 would amend the ATA to remove immunity of foreign officials from lawsuits and address issues with establishing personal jurisdiction over foreign nationals in cases of international terrorism. The bill would allow district courts to have personal jurisdiction over individuals involved in acts of international terrorism that harm U.S. nationals, while S. 2040 would maintain the foreign official exclusion under the ATA. The new FSIA exception in H.R. 3815 would allow lawsuits by U.S. nationals against foreign states in cases of international terrorism, while S. 2040 would keep the foreign official exclusion under the ATA intact. Both aliens and U.S. nationals could potentially bring lawsuits under other causes of action if jurisdiction is available under the new FSIA exception."
