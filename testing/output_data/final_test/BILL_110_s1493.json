    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Advanced Information and Communications Technology Research Act\". It includes a section on Spectrum-Sharing Innovation Testbed. Within a year of the Act's enactment, the FCC and Assistant Secretary of Commerce will develop a spectrum-sharing plan for Federal and non-Federal users. They will also establish a pilot program with technical specifications for sharing a 10 megaHertz spectrum segment. This spectrum can be taken from bands currently allocated on an exclusive or shared basis. The FCC and Assistant Secretary will transmit a report to Congress 2 years after the pilot program's inception, detailing results and suggesting expansion procedures. SEC. 3. TELECOMMUNICATIONS INNOVATION ACCELERATION. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will establish the \"Telecommunications Standards and Technology Acceleration Research Program\" to promote innovation in telecommunications. At least 8 percent of funds available to the Institute each fiscal year will be set aside for this program. The Director will allocate 80% of funds for the Program to award grants, agreements, or contracts to public or private entities with scientific merit. Projects must involve small or medium-sized businesses, with a focus on joint ventures with educational institutions. Grants will not exceed 3 years and annual proposals will be solicited to address national needs for high-risk, high-reward projects. The Director will allocate 80% of funds for the Program to award grants for high-risk, high-reward telecommunications research. An annual report will describe program activities, metrics for grant funding decisions, and best practices. Administrative expenses are limited to 5% of funding. High-risk, high-reward telecommunications research is defined as research with significant potential impact. The term \"research\" refers to research that has the potential for wide-ranging implications, addresses critical national needs in measurement standards and technology, and is too novel or interdisciplinary for traditional peer review processes. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology supports research and standards development in advanced communication technologies to make services more available and affordable for all Americans. This includes intramural and cooperative research with higher education institutions and industry. The National Science Foundation will establish a program for basic research in advanced information and communications technologies to improve the availability and affordability of communication services for all Americans. A Federal Board will advise the Director on this program, consisting of experts in the field. The National Science Foundation will establish a grant program for basic research in advanced information and communications technologies. The program aims to enhance affordable broadband access, network security, communications interoperability, and networking protocols. The grants will contribute to improving the availability and affordability of advanced communication services for all Americans. The National Science Foundation will establish a grant program for basic research in advanced information and communications technologies, focusing on resilience to outages or attacks, trusted software, privacy, nanoelectronics for communications applications, low-power communications electronics, and equitable access to national advanced fiber optic research and educational networks. The Director will award multiyear grants to institutions of higher education, nonprofit research institutions, or consortia to establish multidisciplinary Centers for Communications Research. The National Science Foundation will establish a grant program for basic research in advanced information and communications technologies. Grants will be awarded to institutions of higher education, nonprofit research institutions, or consortia to establish multidisciplinary Centers for Communications Research. The purpose is to generate innovative approaches to problems in communications and information technology research. Grants will be awarded on a merit-reviewed competitive basis, with priority given to revolutionary breakthroughs. Authorization of Appropriations:\n$40,000,000 for fiscal year 2008\n$45,000,000 for fiscal year 2009\n$50,000,000 for fiscal year 2010\n$55,000,000 for fiscal year 2011\n$60,000,000 for fiscal year 2012."
