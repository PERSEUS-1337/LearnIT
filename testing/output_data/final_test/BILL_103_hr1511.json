The Congress recognizes the importance of agricultural commodity exports to the US economy, with one-third of harvested acreage worth over $40 billion in exports. The newly-formed Republics of the former Soviet Union are in need of agricultural imports to support their transition to democratic government and free market economies.

The recent halt in US agricultural exports to the former Soviet Union Republics has negatively impacted US agricultural producers, potentially adding $1.3 billion to the US deficit if not reversed. The Republics' abundant natural resources and revenue-generating capacity from resource development assure their ability to repay US loans for agricultural exports. The United States has extended authority for the export of agricultural commodities and products, including direct loans, credit guarantees, and programs for barter with importing countries. This is in addition to existing programs like the Export Enhancement Program and the Dairy Export Incentive Program.
