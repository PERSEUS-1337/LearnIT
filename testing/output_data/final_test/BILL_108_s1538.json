    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"DSHEA Full Implementation and Enforcement Act of 2003\". Congress finds that over 158 million Americans use dietary supplements to improve their health, with consumer spending reaching $17.1 billion in 2000. The FDA predicts continued growth in supplement use due to factors like aging populations and advancements in science. The DSHEA was enacted in 1994 to regulate dietary supplements. DSHEA, enacted in 1994, ensures truthful and substantiated claims on dietary supplement labels. It sets standards for manufacturing practices and requires safety information for new ingredients. The FDA has updated its system for reporting adverse events related to dietary supplements. DSHEA provides authorities to remove unsafe supplements from the market and created the Office of Dietary Supplements for research and consumer information. The FDA has not effectively enforced DSHEA and requires more resources for implementation. The FDA has received additional funds beyond the President's budget to enforce DSHEA, reaching $9,700,000 in fiscal year 2003. However, the FDA states that full implementation of DSHEA would require between $24,000,000 and $65,000,000 per year. SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION AND APPROPRIATION OF RESOURCES.
