    "content": "Some in the 112th Congress aim to reduce the budget deficit by cutting foreign affairs funds, while others, including former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, believe a strong foreign affairs budget is crucial for national security. The 112th Congress began considering the State Department's budget in July and September. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2012, approved by Congress in December 2011, includes State-Foreign Operations appropriations for FY2012. This funding covers various international affairs programs and activities under Function 150, such as foreign economic and security assistance, contributions to international organizations, State Department and USAID operations, public diplomacy, and international broadcasting programs. Food aid and other specific programs are funded through separate appropriation bills. The State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill covers international affairs programs under Function 150, separate from other international commissions funded through different bills. Recent congressional activity includes the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012. In mid-December 2011, H.R. 2055 was signed into law (P.L. 112-74), providing a 10% increase in State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Program funds compared to FY2011. The law includes a 12% increase for State Operations, 1% increase for International Broadcasting, and 9% increase for Foreign Operations. The funding is 10% below the Administration's request. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction failed to produce a plan for reducing budgets as required by the Budget Control Act, leading to the possibility of sequestration in January 2013. Two continuing resolutions were passed by Congress and signed by the President: H.J.Res. 94 (P.L. 112-67) on December 16, 2011. President signed two continuing resolutions: H.J.Res. 94 (P.L. 112-67, signed December 16, 2011) continued funding through December 17, and H.J.Res. 95 (P.L. 112-68, signed December 17, 2011) continued funding through December 23. H.R. 2017 (P.L. 112-33, signed September 30, 2011) continued FY2011 government funding, reduced by 1.503% through October 4, 2011; H.R. 2608 (P.L. 112-36, signed October 5, 2011) continued the reduced FY2011 funding through November 18, 2011; and H.R. 2112 (P.L. 112-55, signed November 18, 2011) continues the reduced FY2011 funding through December 16, 2011. This law provides full-year FY2012 foreign food aid funding at $1,630.0 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported out its State-Foreign Operations bill (S. 1601; S.Rept. 112-85) with a total discretionary funding level of $45.1 billion plus $8.7 billion in OCO funding for a total of $53.8 billion in FY2012. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a $1.043 trillion government spending plan in accordance with the Budget Control Act of 2011, allocating $44.6 billion to State-Foreign Operations. The Budget Control Act of 2011 requires specific funding reductions in security and nonsecurity discretionary spending through FY2013, putting all 150 budget accounts, including the Department of State and foreign operations accounts, in direct funding competition with the Departments of Defense. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandates funding reductions in security and nonsecurity spending, putting various departments in direct competition for funding. The House Appropriations Subcommittee proposed a total discretionary appropriation of $47.3 billion for FY2012, which is below the enacted FY2011 total and the President's FY2012 request. The House Appropriations Committee announced subcommittee allocations for FY2012, setting State-Foreign Operations funding at $39.6 billion, 22% below the President's request. The House Budget Committee passed a resolution recommending $36.6 billion for International Affairs and $8.7 billion for overseas contingency funds. Total budget authority approved would be 26% less than the Administration requested. The Obama Administration submitted a FY2012 budget request to Congress for $59.65 billion for international affairs. This represents an 8.2% increase from FY2010 funding and a 21.8% increase from FY2011. Figure 1 breaks down the request by assistance type. The Obama Administration's FY2012 budget request for international affairs is $59.65 billion, an 8.2% increase from FY2010 and a 21.8% increase from FY2011. The State Department's funding priorities for FY2012 include an increase in Administration of Foreign Affairs funding from 22% to 25%, a decrease in Bilateral Economic Aid funding from 46% to 39%, and an increase in Security Aid funding from 12% to 19%. These three categories account for over 80% of the total foreign affairs funding requested. The FY2012 budget request for international affairs is $59.65 billion, with $19.52 billion allocated for broadcasting and related agencies. This includes $4.39 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations funding. The State Department's two largest accounts, Diplomatic and Consular Programs, and Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance, make up 70% of the operations request. Diplomatic and Consular Programs would receive $11.89 billion, a 36% increase from the previous year. The FY2012 budget request for international affairs is $59.65 billion, with $11.89 billion allocated for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, a 36% increase from the previous year. The request for ESCM is $1.80 billion, 11% more than the FY2011 enacted level. Other related agencies include funding for International Broadcasting, Contributions to International Organizations, U.N. Peacekeeping, International Commissions, U.S. Institute for Peace, The Asia Foundation, National Endowment for Democracy, and educational and cultural exchange activities. The State Department's FY2012 request includes funding for \"frontline states\" like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, as well as building Foreign and Civil Service capacity. For short-term activities in Iraq, $3.2 billion in OCO funds is requested for the transition from military to civilian leadership, along with a core budget request of nearly $496 million. The planned withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Iraq by December 31, 2011 will shift the U.S. government's presence to diplomatic engagement led by the State Department. The State Department's FY2012 request includes funding for diplomatic operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan, with a focus on increasing civilian presence and security. The Administration is seeking $757.5 million in OCO funds for short-term needs in Afghanistan, along with $31.9 million for ongoing operations. In Pakistan, there is a request for $89.4 million in OCO funds to support an increased diplomatic presence. The State Department's Human Resources Initiative aims to increase staffing to alleviate shortages, reduce reliance on contractors, and enhance training for critical languages. The Obama Administration's FY2012 budget request adjusted the goal of increasing Foreign Service capacity beyond 2014. Despite budget constraints, the Administration requested funds to support 500-600 new positions annually for the past three years. The Administration requested increased funding of $687.2 million for the Diplomatic & Consular Programs account to rebuild the State Department workforce. This includes adding 197 new positions, with proposed reductions in FY2012 funding for various State Department accounts compared to FY2010 levels. The Administration requested $92.2 million in FY2012 for Conflict Stabilization Operations, a decrease from FY2010 but an increase from FY2011. The funds would support a Civilian Response Corps and contributions to international organizations, with some alternative funding sources. The FY2012 budget proposed increases for contributions to international organizations and peacekeeping operations, reflecting the U.S. commitment to pay assessed contributions. Proposed cuts included reductions for foundations and commissions such as The Asia Foundation, the East-West Center, the National Endowment for Democracy, the Center for Middle East-West Dialogue, and the International Fisheries Commission. The Foreign Operations budget includes U.S. foreign assistance programs managed by USAID and the State Department, as well as contributions to multilateral financial institutions. Food assistance is appropriated through the Agriculture Appropriations bill. The Foreign Operations budget includes U.S. foreign assistance programs managed by USAID and the State Department, as well as contributions to multilateral financial institutions. The budget replenishes U.S. financial commitments to international financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The foreign operations budget request for FY2012 is $40.13 billion, a 21.5% increase from FY2011. Key initiatives include the Global Health, Food Security, and Global Climate Change Initiatives, along with transitioning from military to civilian authority in front-line states. The FY2012 foreign operations budget request includes initiatives for global health, food security, and climate change. With events in the Middle East and calls for budget cuts, foreign assistance priorities are under scrutiny, especially in countries like Egypt. Congressional reaction to foreign policy changes may impact future U.S. assistance. The form of U.S. assistance in the Middle East, particularly in Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya, is under scrutiny. Lawmakers have different opinions on whether to provide debt cancellation, democracy promotion assistance, or focus on economic growth. The United States has pledged support for Tunisia and provided aid to Libyan opposition groups. As events in the region unfold, U.S. aid efforts will likely be adjusted accordingly. The Department of Defense expanded foreign aid activities in Iraq and Afghanistan post-invasions, with high levels of security and economic aid. As stability increased, State and USAID built capacity in these countries, leading to calls for stronger civilian control. However, Congress has not fully supported these transition efforts. The Department of Defense expanded foreign aid activities in Iraq and Afghanistan post-invasions, with high levels of security and economic aid. As stability increased, State and USAID built capacity in these countries, leading to calls for stronger civilian control. However, Congress has not fully supported these transition efforts. Congress cut funding for accounts supporting police training previously funded through the Defense Appropriations bill in FY2011, raising questions about the transition from military to civilian control in Iraq. The fate of this transition will be determined by FY2012 appropriations. The Administration's FY2012 request includes funding for the CCF, PCCF, INCLE programs, and a Global Contingency Security Fund. Congress has concerns about accountability for U.S. assistance dollars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan, citing waste, fraud, and abuse. Billions of dollars lost to waste, fraud, and abuse in Afghanistan and Iraq due to poor planning and corruption. Concerns raised about U.S. funds being misused by elites. Congress withholding aid until corruption issue resolved. Osama Bin Laden found living near military academy in Pakistan before his death in 2011. The discovery of Osama Bin Laden living near a military academy in Pakistan before his death in 2011 has raised doubts about U.S. security assistance to Pakistan and calls for the suspension of aid. Congress will consider the risks of continuing or reducing assistance, as well as the need for enhanced oversight to prevent fraud and abuse. Congressional debate on international family planning and abortion issues focuses on the Mexico City policy and U.S. funding of the UN Population Fund. The Mexico City policy, established in 1984 by President Reagan, required foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to refrain from promoting abortion. The policy has been rescinded and reinstated by past and current Administrations. President Obama rescinded it in 2009, but it was reinstated in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY2012. Previous Administrations have also suspended grants to UNFPA due to coercive family planning practices in China. The George W. Bush Administration suspended U.S. contributions to UNFPA from FY2002 to FY2008 following a State Department investigation of family planning programs in China. President Obama resumed U.S. contributions to the organization in 2009. Congress has enacted certain conditions for U.S. funding of UNFPA in recent years. The Administration requested $769.105 million for family planning and reproductive health assistance in FY2012, including $47.5 million for UNFPA. The Administration also requested $8.72 billion for its Global Health Initiative in FY2012, representing a 10% increase over FY2010 funding. The FY2012 request for the Global Health Initiative (GHI) includes a 10% increase over FY2010 funding, with a focus on maternal and pediatric programs, nutrition, and child health activities. The initiative aims to invest $63 billion over six years, but budget constraints may lead to funding cuts. The 112th Congress may face challenges in determining funding levels for Global Health Initiative (GHI) programs due to budget constraints. The Obama Administration's priority, Feed the Future (FtF), requested $1.56 billion for related programs in the FY2012 budget, a 20% increase from FY2010. FtF aims to address root causes of global hunger with a pledge of at least $3.5 billion over three years. The Obama Administration's Feed the Future initiative aims to allocate at least $3.5 billion over three years to combat global hunger by addressing low agricultural productivity and poor nutrition. Funding is targeted towards countries with widespread hunger and agriculture-based economies, emphasizing multilateral partnerships. The FY2012 budget request includes $308 million for the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, managed by the World Bank. Congress has shown limited support for this approach, appropriating less than requested in FY2011. USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah expressed concerns about potential budget cuts for newer initiatives like Feed the Future in FY2012. The FY2012 budget request for programs supporting the Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) totals slightly over $1.3 billion, a 40% increase over the previous year. The funds would support activities related to climate change, with a focus on adaptation, clean energy technologies, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A significant portion of the funding would be channeled through international financial institutions, emphasizing a multilateral approach to leverage commitments from other donors. The FY2012 budget request for the Global Climate Change Initiative includes a $400 million request for the International Clean Technology Fund and $190 million for the International Strategic Climate Fund. USAID Administrator Shah aims to address procurement and talent management issues through the USAID Forward initiative. The Administration is implementing reforms related to procurement, talent management, policy capacity, monitoring and evaluation, budget management, science and technology, and innovation at USAID. Additional funding is needed for these reforms, including $380 million for hiring mid-career Foreign Service Officers. Funding requests include $358.4 million for capital increases at multilateral financial institutions in FY2012. The Administration is seeking funding for capital increases at multilateral financial institutions, including $106.6 million for the Asian Development Bank, $102.0 million for the Inter-American Development Bank, and $32.4 million for the African Development Bank. Congressional appropriators are hesitant to approve the funds without authorization legislation for reforms. Failure to provide the funding could diminish U.S. influence globally and allow other countries like China to expand their influence. The U.S. seeks funding for capital increases at multilateral financial institutions to maintain global influence and prevent other countries like China from expanding their own. Various policy objectives have evolved over time, from anti-communism during the Cold War to addressing issues like nuclear proliferation, drug trafficking, peace efforts, regional stability, religious freedom, and human trafficking. The focus shifted significantly after the 9/11 attacks, with a greater emphasis on national security and counterterrorism efforts. Since the 9/11 attacks, U.S. foreign aid and diplomatic programs have prioritized national security objectives, particularly in countering terrorism. Development was recognized as a key component of national security strategy in 2002, with a focus on assisting \"front-line\" states in the war on terrorism. Large reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq highlighted the use of foreign aid in combating terrorism. The Obama Administration has continued Bush's foreign aid initiatives, focusing on diplomatic security and public diplomacy in Muslim communities. Efforts include USAID's Development Leadership Initiative, assistance to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, and investments in global health and HIV/AIDS treatment. The Global Health Initiative shifts towards comprehensive health systems. The Administration emphasizes building State Department and USAID capacity, supporting multilateral food security, and addressing global climate change. The Obama Administration continued Bush's foreign aid initiatives, focusing on diplomatic security, public diplomacy in Muslim communities, and investments in global health. Efforts include USAID's Development Leadership Initiative, assistance to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, and addressing global climate change. State Department and USAID capacity are emphasized, along with supporting multilateral food security initiatives. Israel and Egypt historically received the largest U.S. foreign aid, with Iraq and Afghanistan moving into the top five post-reconstruction efforts. In recent years, funding for Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan has included Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) temporary appropriations. Afghanistan tops the list at $3,213.4 million in the FY2012 request, followed by Israel and Pakistan. Iraq moves up to fourth place in the FY2012 request due to specific funding allocations. Under the FY2012 budget request, Africa, Near East, and South Central Asia would receive the most U.S. foreign assistance. Aid to Africa primarily supports health-related programs, while South Central Asia's aid is mostly for Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Near East region's assistance is dominated by Israel, Iraq, Egypt, and Jordan. Haiti, a top recipient in FY2010, would not be among the top 10 recipients in FY2012 due to supplemental funds for post-earthquake relief. The Administration's budget request for FY2012 includes changes in foreign assistance funding, with a decrease in aid to Europe and Eurasia and consistent levels of aid to East Asia and the Pacific. Congress has shown interest in various aid sectors like education and maternal health, but comparisons to prior year allocations are limited. The Administration's FY2012 budget request shows decreases in funding for key interest areas compared to FY2011, with some sectors receiving less funding such as Food Security and Global Climate Change. However, Family Planning, Maternal and Child Health, and Water sectors saw increased funding. Additionally, Gender Funding and Science, Technology, and Innovation were added as new focus areas. The Administration's FY2012 budget request includes decreases in funding for some sectors like Food Security and Global Climate Change, while Family Planning, Maternal and Child Health, and Water sectors receive increased funding. Gender Funding and Science, Technology, and Innovation are new focus areas. The appendices detail the structure of State-Foreign Operations Appropriations and related agencies' appropriations."
