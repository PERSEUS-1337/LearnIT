    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medicare Rural Physician Recruitment and Retention Act of 2010\". It includes findings related to rural healthcare. Congress finds that the United States is facing shortages in various health workforce professions, including a projected deficit of 91,500 physicians by 2020. These shortages will worsen with the increase in insured Americans and the aging population. Efforts to address the physician shortage include expanding medical school class sizes, but there is a need to increase approved medical residency training positions. The Medicare physician fee schedule was created in 1992, and the sustainable growth rate system has led to annual reductions in physician reimbursement rates since 2002, with Congress passing bills to override these decreases. Congress has passed bills to override reductions in physician reimbursement rates. Proposed modifications to the Medicare sustainable growth rate system have not been implemented yet. The Medicare physician fee schedule determines payment rates for over 7,000 services based on 3 relative value units. These units are geographically adjusted to reflect the cost of services in specific locations. Medicare's geographic adjustment for physician payment localities is determined using 3 Geographic Practice Cost Indices corresponding to physician work, practice expense, and malpractice expense. Reimbursements are lower in rural areas due to lower cost-of-living estimates. The indices are based on 1990 earnings of professionals with 5+ years of education, and the office rent portion is based on 2000 residential rental data. The Cost Index is derived from 2000 residential rental data and is used as a proxy for physician office rents. Rural physician employers must offer competitive salaries in regional and national markets. The elderly make up a higher percentage of the rural population, leading to a greater number of Medicare patients in a rural physician's practice. Payment discrepancies in Medicare Geographic Practice Cost Indices can result in significant reimbursement differences. Commercial insurers often base physician reimbursements on Medicare's fee schedule. Recruitment and retention of rural physicians is challenging, with payment disparities in Medicare potentially affecting non-Medicare payors as well. SEC. 101. MEDICARE PHYSICIAN FEE SCHEDULE UPDATE. Update to the Medicare physician fee schedule: Section 1848(d)(11) of the Social Security Act is amended for the remaining portion of 2010 and for 2011 and subsequent years. The Medicare physician fee schedule is updated for 2011 and subsequent years, with the update based on the percentage increase in the MEI. Additionally, there is a conforming sunset of the Sustainable Growth Rate for each succeeding year, ending with 2008. SEC. 102 amends Section 1848(e)(1) of the Social Security Act to recognize equality of physician work in all geographic areas under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. SEC. 103 revises the practice expense geographic adjustment under the schedule. Repeal of certain provisions from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, including the establishment of a floor for practice expense geographic index under the Social Security Act. The provision establishes a floor for practice expense geographic index under the Social Security Act, with exceptions for indexes less than 1.0. TITLE II--RURAL PHYSICIAN RECRUITMENT IN MEDICARE\n\nSEC. 201. DISTRIBUTION OF ADDITIONAL RESIDENCY POSITIONS. Distribution of additional residency positions under Section 1886(h) of the Social Security Act is amended to increase the aggregate number of full-time positions by 15 percent. The Secretary will increase the resident limit for qualifying hospitals that apply, based on cost reports, with the goal of distributing additional residency positions. The Secretary will increase resident limits for qualifying hospitals based on cost reports to distribute additional residency positions. Considerations include the likelihood of hospitals filling positions within specific reporting periods, with priority given to certain areas. The Secretary will distribute additional residency positions to qualifying hospitals based on cost reports. Preference will be given to hospitals in states with low physician-to-population ratios. If positions are not filled in those states, remaining positions will be distributed to qualifying hospitals in other states. The approved FTE resident amounts for additional residency positions in a hospital are determined based on hospital per resident amounts for primary care and nonprimary care. The reference resident level for a hospital is based on the resident level for the most recent cost reporting period. The hospital's resident level for a reporting period ending before the enactment date is determined by the Secretary. A hospital can request an increase in resident level for program expansion. After a hospital expands or establishes a new residency training program, the resident level for cost reporting is determined by the Secretary based on the additional residents. The term 'resident level' is defined in paragraph (7)(C)(i), and the 'otherwise applicable resident limit' for a hospital is determined without regard to certain factors. Additionally, the second sentence of section 1886(d)(5)(B)(v) of the Social Security Act is amended. The provisions of subsections (h)(4)(H)(vi), (h)(7), (h)(8), and (h)(9) are amended in section 1395ww(d)(5)(B)(v). Section 1886(d)(5)(B)(x) of the Social Security Act is redesignated as clause (xi) and amended. Section 422(b)(2) of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 is amended."
