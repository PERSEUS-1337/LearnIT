    "content": "We develop new algorithms for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects by combining transfer learning for neural networks with insights from causal inference literature. Our methods outperform existing benchmarks in simulation studies using voter persuasion experiments and the MNIST database, achieving better results with less data. The rise of massive datasets allows researchers to evaluate treatment effectiveness on individuals more effectively. Transfer learning is applied to estimate treatment effects for individuals based on observed covariates in various fields like medicine, digital experiments, economics, political science, and statistics. The first paper to use transfer learning for this problem shows promise in estimating Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) by splitting a training set into treatment and control groups. Many questions remain despite the growing number of articles on this topic. In the context of estimating treatment effects using transfer learning, the Average Treatment Effect (CATE) is defined as the expected outcome under treatment minus the expected outcome under control. Assumptions and advanced estimators are needed to handle the challenge of observing outcomes for only one treatment group per unit. Recent research emphasizes the importance of using estimators that consider both treatment groups simultaneously, but robust CATE estimators still face difficulties due to large sample sizes required when the number of covariates is not small. Transfer learning can help overcome difficulties in estimating the CATE when the number of covariates is not small. Strategies include utilizing ancillary datasets related to the causal mechanism, such as experiments in different locations, treatment arms, outcomes, and observational studies. By transferring information from these datasets, CATE estimators can converge to better solutions with fewer samples, reducing the cost of collecting additional data. Contributions include introducing transfer learning for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects and MLRW Transfer for CATE Estimation. MLRW Transfer for CATE Estimation adapts meta-learning regression weights for quicker optimization of regression problems. Various MLRW algorithms exist, but their application to CATE estimation is not straightforward due to the need for simultaneous estimation of outcomes under both treatment and control. Additional methods for transfer learning for CATE estimation include warm start, frozen-features, multi-head, and joint training. These methods are applied to challenging data problems. We apply MLRW Transfer for CATE Estimation to challenging data problems, outperforming existing benchmarks. Our methods show superior performance in estimating CATE with fewer observations needed. Open source code for our algorithms is provided. In causal inference, we observe units from a super population with potential outcomes in control and treatment groups. There is no overlap between the two groups, making it impossible to observe both potential outcomes for any unit. Despite this fundamental problem, we can estimate the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) of the treatment. The CATE of an individual feature vector x is defined as \u2327 (x). Estimating \u2327 requires assumptions on the data, such as Strong Ignorability, which ensures no unobserved confounders influencing treatment and potential outcomes. This assumption is difficult to verify in practice. The assumption of Strong Ignorability is challenging to verify in practice. Assumption 2 addresses situations where a portion of the population is consistently treated or in the control group. While these assumptions are crucial in observational studies, caution is advised, especially with numerous covariates. Valid CATE estimators rely on estimating the control and treatment response functions. The CATE estimate is calculated as the difference between the learned estimates \u03bc1(x) and \u03bc0(x). The T-learner method involves estimating \u03bc0 and \u03bc1 using models like linear models, random forests, or neural networks. While using neural networks for this may seem trivial to deep learning practitioners, the T-learner is considered a baseline method in this paper for simplicity. The T-learner is a baseline method used for simplicity in this paper, despite its drawbacks. More advanced learners like S, X, T, R, and Y learners are preferred due to their efficiency. Transfer learning is discussed in relation to the T-learner, but other advanced learners are also considered in practice. In the context of causal inference experiments, transfer algorithms can help achieve faster training with less data by using previous experiments to find an initialization for new experiments. Two types of algorithms are considered: those that build on existing CATE estimators and those that are designed specifically for transfer learning. These algorithms, such as joint training and MLRW, aim to optimize the input space X across all experiments. In causal inference experiments, transfer algorithms like joint training and MLRW optimize the input space X across experiments. Each experiment has distinct outcomes when treatment is received, defining the CATE. Transfer learning aims to transfer knowledge between experiments using neural network parameters. Transfer algorithms optimize the input space X across experiments in causal inference. The algorithms extend existing CATE estimation techniques to transfer learning settings, with a focus on the T-Learner as a base estimator. Warm start involves predicting outcomes to form the CATE estimator for different experiments. In transfer learning for causal inference, the input space X is the same for experiment 0 and experiment 1, but the outcomes \u00b5 0,1 (x) and \u00b5 1,1 (x) differ. Instead of randomly initializing parameters for experiment 1, the parameters are set to those learned in experiment 0. The features encoded by \u21e1 i (X) are used as a transformed input space for \u21e1 \u27130,1 and \u21e1 \u27131,1 to improve CATE estimates. During training of experiment 1, backpropagation is only done through experiment-specific layers \u2713 0,1 and \u2713 1,1, not through 0 and 1. Multi-head setup shares base layers for general feature learning, followed by experiment-specific layers for estimating \u00b5 j,i (x). Training alternates between experiments, with each head being trained several times. During training, heads are switched and trained multiple times. Reptile transfer is used for CATE estimators to learn fast convergence on new experiments by initializing weights efficiently. The technique involves inner updates followed by outer updates to encourage network layers. SF Reptile modifies weights via SGD to encourage different learning rates in network layers. This boosts performance on problems by allowing lower layers to learn slowly-changing features and higher layers to adapt quickly. Joint training involves sharing base layers and using two heads per experiment to predict different values. SF Reptile modifies weights to encourage different learning rates in network layers, boosting performance. Joint training involves sharing base layers and using two heads per experiment to predict different values. MLRW transfer method uses one set of weights to estimate \u00b5 i,j (x) at a time, requiring minimal samples for future predictions. The MLRW algorithm meta-learns regression weights for quick regression onto \u00b5 i,j (x). Transfer learning across elections and regions improves CATE estimators for voter encouragement. Simulated data differs from real-world data, with images as input and continuous outcome variables. Transfer learning is evaluated on real data from large field experiments. In a reanalysis of large field experiments with over 1.96 million potential voters, the effect of a mailer on voter turnout in the 2014 U.S. Midterm Elections was evaluated. The mailer compares voting behavior and increases the likelihood of voting by about 2.2%. Each experiment targeted a different state with varying populations, ballots, and electoral environments. The treatment response function estimates voting propensity for a potential voter who receives a mailer, while the control response function estimates voting propensity without a mailer. The CATE is the change in voting probability when a mailer is received. Transfer learning can be done across 17 different states in the dataset to estimate the treatment effect of sending a mailer. The challenge lies in estimating the treatment effect of sending a mailer in elections. It is important to target individuals whose likelihood of voting would significantly increase with the mailer, while avoiding those who would respond negatively. Evaluating a CATE estimator on real data is complex due to the inability to observe the true CATE for any unit. This is because only one outcome is observed for each unit, making it difficult to create a response model. To estimate treatment effects in elections, linear models or random forests are used to create data based on estimates. Various algorithms are evaluated on the GOTV dataset, with the Y learner showing the best performance. Comparisons are made with non-transfer Y-learner and S learner with random forests as baselines. Previous work achieved state-of-the-art results with S-RF and neural-network-based learners like R and Y-learners. The MLRW algorithm consistently outperforms other transfer learners in the GOTV dataset, showing superior performance in 8 out of 17 trials for version 1 and 11 out of 17 trials for version 2. It does not artificially bottleneck information flow and is resilient to outlier data. Multi-head, frozen-features, and SF algorithms also improve upon non-transfer baselines. The MLRW algorithm outperforms other transfer learners in the GOTV dataset, showing superior performance in multiple trials. Warm start does not work well and often leads to worse results than baseline estimators. Positive transfer between experiments is observed with faster learning rates. Transfer learning significantly improves upon the baseline, as confirmed by a simulation study using MNIST digits rotated by different degrees. In a data generating process using MNIST digits, transfer learning for CATE estimation is applicable. Different outcomes are obtained for each input under various data-generating processes, with \u00b5 0 representing control outcome, \u00b5 1 representing treatment outcome, and \u2327 as the difference. Each process has unique response functions dependent on the image label, aiming to expedite feature learning. See Appendix A for full details. Transfer learning for CATE estimation is explored using MNIST digits data generation process. A transfer learning strategy outperforms non-transfer learning, especially on image data. Different transfer methods are compared, with some performing worse than non-transfer baselines. The study focuses on two common types of transfer techniques: basic fine-tuning and weight-sharing methods commonly used in computer vision literature. In the computer vision literature, various techniques for learning initialization and transfer learning have been extensively studied. Authors have attempted to combine feature embeddings for transfer, modify sampling procedures, and meta-learn optimizers for quicker task solving. Techniques like BID1 aim to overcome forgetting during transfer by introducing systematic methods. In the realm of transfer learning, (Rusu et al., 2016) introduces new network layers with lateral connections to combat forgetting, while (Munkhdalai and Yu, 2017) utilize networks with memory for task adaptation. For a comprehensive overview of transfer learning, refer to (Finn et al., 2017). Despite challenges with implementations of (Rusu et al., 2016; BID1) and (Snell et al., 2017), focus shifted to algorithms for effective initializations, yielding quick and favorable results. Additionally, there is a wealth of research on using neural networks to enhance causal inference algorithms (Ramachandra, 2018; Magliacane et al.). Transfer learning has been extensively explored in the realm of causal inference algorithms. While various papers have been studied, some did not improve the estimation of CATE or performed worse than baseline methods. The extension of transfer learning to other causal inference algorithms remains a promising area of research, raising questions about applying transfer learning when input spaces differ, handling missing data, improving interpretability, and encoding causal relationships into neural networks. These open questions highlight the need for further exploration in the field. In the realm of causal inference algorithms, transfer learning is being explored to improve estimation of CATE. Access to multiple DGPs allows for exploring different transfer learning methods when predicting treatment effects on new images. This research area raises questions about handling missing data and encoding causal relationships into neural networks. In a study on predicting treatment effects, simulations were conducted for the GOTV example and a larger simulation study with 51 experiments was summarized. One specific experiment in Alaska involved 252,576 potential voters randomly assigned to control and treatment groups. Evaluating CATE estimators requires knowing true CATEs, which are often estimated using machine learning methods. This process involves simulating data to evaluate CATE estimators. The researcher uses different estimators to estimate response functions in Real World Data Sets 1 and 2. They generate true CATEs and simulate new outcomes based on real data using a linear model and random forests estimator. The process involves training the estimator on treated and control units separately, sampling units, and generating true outcomes. After generating true CATEs for each unit in 17 experiments, simulations are conducted to evaluate CATE estimators and transfer learners. Simulated experiments are created by sampling units and generating true CATEs and observed outcomes. This process helps assess the generalizability of conclusions beyond voter persuasion data sets. In simulations, true CATEs are generated for each unit in 17 experiments. Experiments range in size from 5,000 to 400,000 units with an 11-dimensional covariate vector. Three different setups are presented: Simulation LM, Simulation RF, and Simulation RFt. Pseudo code for CATE estimators and meta learning algorithms is provided. Y 0 and Y 1 represent observed outcomes for control and treated units. In Section C, Y 0 and Y 1 are observed outcomes for control and treated groups.
