    "content": "Hamas is a Palestinian Islamist movement linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, considered a terrorist organization by the US, Israel, EU, and Canada due to its violent resistance against Israeli occupation and rejection of peace processes. Hamas receives support from Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah. The US aims to deter, transform, marginalize, or neutralize Hamas. The US goal is to deter, transform, marginalize, or neutralize Hamas to eliminate threats to Israel's security and achieve peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Various initiatives have had limited success in countering Hamas's activities and connections with Iran and Syria. Since its inception in 1987, Hamas has maintained political support and military command in Gaza, with a presence in the West Bank. The movement's leadership is based in Damascus, Syria. Hamas's military wing, the Izz al Din al Qassam Brigades, has been responsible for attacks that have killed over 400 Israelis and at least 25 U.S. citizens since 1993. Hamas evolved from small-scale attacks to suicide bombings and rocket attacks against Israeli civilians. They have also targeted Palestinian political opponents, particularly Fatah, in the struggle for control in Gaza since 2005. Hamas gained power democratically in 2006 after an electoral upset, seizing control of the Gaza Strip in 2007 through armed victories over Fatah forces. Efforts to neutralize Hamas have not been successful. Hamas consolidated power in Gaza despite damage from Israeli invasion in 2008-2009. They seek to establish indispensability in Arab-Israeli political arrangements. Hamas aims for leadership in the PA through power-sharing with Fatah or sole leadership. Hamas aims to gain leadership in the Palestinian Authority by either power-sharing with Fatah or winning elections, challenging Fatah's dominance. Efforts to establish a power-sharing arrangement between Hamas and Fatah have stalled, with Hamas gaining popularity among Palestinians. Hamas has gained popularity among Palestinians at Fatah's expense due to its reputation as a less corrupt provider of social services and its image of unflinching resistance to Israeli occupation. Hamas is perceived to be more rooted in the experiences and attitudes of West Bankers and Gazans than Fatah. Many leaders from Fatah spent decades in exile, while Hamas has maintained a strong presence within the Palestinian territories since its inception. Hamas poses a potential threat to Israel's security with its rocket capabilities and presence in the West Bank. Suicide bombings by Palestinian militants, including Hamas, have killed approximately 700 Israelis. Israel also fears coordinated attacks by Iran, Syria, and other regional actors using Hamas as a proxy. The ability of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza to target civilians inside Israel has been reduced through heightened Israeli security measures, including barriers and crossings. Israeli military operations in the West Bank include restrictions on Palestinians' freedom of movement. The Israeli security measures, including barriers and restrictions on Palestinians' movement, have reduced the ability of Palestinians to target civilians in Israel. Palestinian militant groups in Gaza have increased rocket attacks in response to access constraints, leading to Israeli military operations like Operation Cast Lead in 2008. Hamas has since reduced rocket fire, possibly to avoid further conflict. Since Israel's disengagement from Gaza in 2005, Hamas has expanded smuggling tunnels for rearmament with materials for rockets like Qassam, avoiding Israeli-Egyptian restrictions. Hamas has smuggled thousands of mortars and longer-range rockets into Gaza through tunnels, some possibly manufactured in Iran or China. Reports suggest rockets capable of reaching Tel Aviv or Israel's nuclear facilities have been acquired. Additionally, small arms, anti-aircraft, and anti-tank weapons have been received through the tunnels, with approximately 7,000 people working on over 1,000 tunnels of high engineering quality. The tunnels in Gaza, many of which were damaged during Operation Cast Lead, are of high engineering quality with various amenities. Efforts by Israel, Egypt, the US, and NATO countries to stop smuggling have been somewhat limited. Hamas may have the capability to fire rockets into Tel Aviv or Israel's nuclear facilities. Hamas's military capabilities are primarily based in Gaza, with leadership and manpower concentrated there. The Hamas-led government in Gaza also maintains a significant number of police, security, and intelligence personnel. There is a possibility that Hamas could fire rockets from outside of Gaza, as seen in previous incidents in 2010. Hamas in Gaza poses a significant threat to Israel with its military forces and militants. The main concern is Hamas potentially targeting Israeli soldiers for leverage. Despite portraying survival as a victory, analysts believe Israel established deterrence during Operation Cast Lead. Hamas in Gaza is feared for its rule and is now more cautious about provoking Israel. Hamas is compared to Al Qaeda but focuses its militancy on Israel and Palestinian territories only. Hamas describes itself as a national resistance movement with a battle against Israeli occupation. Hamas focuses its militancy on Israel and Palestinian territories only, not engaging in military acts elsewhere. Al Qaeda criticized Hamas for participating in the Palestinian political process, as it believed Hamas was compromising Al Qaeda's pan-Islamic revolution ideal. Hamas states it only resists those who occupy its territories and does not launch religious wars against Jews or Christians. \"Hamas tolerates smaller extremist groups in Gaza that oppose its rule and coordinates with those who reject peace with Israel. Comparisons with groups like Hezbollah, which also blend political Islam with national loyalties, may be more appropriate.\" Hezbollah, with its Shiite identity and strong support from Iran, differs significantly from Hamas. Hezbollah's military capabilities, including training militants and possessing advanced weapons, pose a greater threat to Israel than Hamas. Hamas's claim to an electoral mandate remains strong since its majority win in the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council elections. Many Hamas leaders and supporters align the movement with non-violent Islamist groups like Turkey's AKP and non-militant branches of the Muslim Brotherhood, inspiring other regional Islamist groups. Hamas's ideology combines Palestinian nationalism with Islamic fundamentalism, drawing inspiration from past leaders like Izz al Din al Qassam and Mohammed Amin al Husseini. Concerns arise that non-violent Islamist groups could turn to violence, impacting regional and international stability. Hamas's actions reflect its 1988 founding charter, known for its militant and anti-Semitic agenda. Despite attempts to distance from the charter, analysts debate whether Hamas is evolving or remains uncompromising. Hamas has shown some moderation through political participation, cease-fires with Israel, and agreements with Fatah. Hamas is urged to share power with Fatah, respect previous agreements, and negotiate with Israel. Analysts compare Hamas to the PLO's transformation in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Hamas is seen as unwilling to deviate from its core principles, including resorting to violence and rejecting permanent peace with Israel. Analysts believe that Hamas, while not monolithic, maintains consensus among its leadership on tactical actions within the limits of its core principles. Any hints of permanent compromise are seen as deceptive or marginal views. For example, Hamas's willingness to consider a long-term cease-fire could be a strategic move to consolidate power and wait for a better opportunity to target Israel. Their primary goal remains the \"liberation\" of Palestine. Hamas's primary goal is to achieve the \"liberation\" of all of historic Palestine for Palestinian Arabs in the name of Islam. There is debate among analysts and within Hamas regarding this goal, with some believing Hamas is pragmatic and others believing it does not compromise on core principles. Hamas sees events from a different perspective than international analysts, with a different concept of time. Hamas's 1988 charter commits to the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state in historic Palestine, with anti-Semitic rhetoric. Despite claims of toning down anti-Semitic references, Hamas still promotes negative stereotypes through its media channels. Hamas's charter calls for the liberation of historic Palestine, but leaders have hinted at potential flexibility towards a Palestinian state on 1967 borders. Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal stated in 2010 that Hamas accepts a state on 1967 lines but not a two-state solution. Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal clarified in a 2010 interview that he is focused on establishing a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital and the right of return for refugees. Meshaal emphasized that his concern lies with the Palestinian people and not with giving legitimacy to Israel as an occupying state. Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal emphasizes the establishment of a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, the right of return for refugees, and real sovereignty. The Palestinian state will decide the future relationship with Israel, respecting the majority viewpoint. Hamas's 1988 charter advocates Jihad as the only solution to the Palestinian question, rejecting initiatives and international conferences. Hamas's leadership, led by Khaled Meshaal, has shown a willingness to prioritize political strategies, such as participating in elections, alongside armed resistance. Meshaal believes that maintaining the option of violence gives Hamas leverage in negotiations, unlike the PLO, which he criticizes for solely relying on negotiation without gaining concessions from Israel. Hamas's charter envisions Palestine as an Islamic society allowing coexistence of all religions. Negotiation with Israel should be based on power balance for successful outcomes. Hamas aims for a peaceful coexistence of all religions in Palestine under Islam, rejecting claims of establishing an Islamic state. They prioritize stability over societal transformation by working with international organizations like UNRWA in Gaza. Some Islamists disappointed with Hamas's slow Islamization process have joined more extremist groups, but this does not pose an immediate threat to Hamas's rule. However, there is a gradual move towards greater Islamization through various Hamas community networks. Islamic fatwas are being used as an alternative to secular justice, and there are efforts to enforce Islamic dress codes, especially for women, in public places. In Gaza, Hamas has been working to Islamize government agencies and media, promoting anti-Israel and anti-Semitic teachings. Public dissent is suppressed, and children are indoctrinated with Islamist/Palestinian nationalist views through various channels. Hamas promotes its hybrid Islamist/Palestinian nationalist views through various means, including producing films and recruiting from mosque youth. The organization strategically uses media outlets to tailor messages for different audiences, creating ambiguity over its possible pragmatism. Hamas has a complex leadership structure overseeing political, military, and social welfare activities. Hamas has a complex leadership structure with branches conducting political, military, and social welfare activities. The de facto Hamas government in Gaza has its own leadership structures. Control over strategy, policy, and financial decisions remains unclear, with ultimate control believed to reside with the 15-member political bureau and the movement-wide consultative council. Local Shura committees in the West Bank and Gaza answer to the overarching Shura council. Hamas's leadership structure includes regional Shura councils in the West Bank and Gaza, with branch offices in supportive areas like Lebanon, Sudan, the Gulf, and possibly Iran. Analysts suggest a dispersion of control within Hamas due to the geographical division of core activities between Damascus and Gaza. This system of mutual leverage is based on interactions between Hamas's political, military, and social welfare branches. Hamas seeks to balance its role as a militant organization opposed to Israel with its responsibilities as the de facto government in Gaza. It claims a separation between its leadership and government to avoid accountability. This could hinder its inclusion in political discussions or negotiations. U.S. and international policymakers, including Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, suggest that organizational fissures may exist within Hamas, with divisions between Gaza-based leaders and Damascus-based leaders, as well as between pragmatists and hardliners within the Gaza leadership. There are also tensions between native Gazans and displaced West Bankers within the group. Some analysts speculate that internal struggles within the Qassam Brigades have led to the rise of Jaljalat, an armed militant network of 2,500-3,000 members. Yezid Sayigh of King's College London reported that Jaljalat fears Hamas' shift towards government tasks has compromised its commitment to armed resistance against Israel. Jaljalat is suspected of attacking Hamas vehicles, security offices, and Internet caf\u00e9s, raising concerns for Qassam Brigades commander Ahmed al Jaabari about potential threats from within Hamas in Gaza. Some Hamas leaders in Gaza are building alternative power bases that could threaten internal unity. Hamas may benefit from the perception of division, allowing flexibility in dealing with Western actors and Syrian/Iranian benefactors. Ismail Haniyeh leads a self-appointed cabinet directing the Gaza government and security forces. Decision-making process is opaque but believed to involve the movement-wide. The Hamas-led government in Gaza receives revenue from various sources, including zakat committees, licensing fees, and taxes. While it profits from operating smuggling tunnels, most of the money goes to the organization rather than the Gaza regime. The people of Gaza rely on various entities for access to resources from the outside world. The Hamas-led government in Gaza receives revenue from various sources, including zakat committees, licensing fees, and taxes. The people of Gaza rely on organizations for access to resources like banking, water, and fuel for electricity. The PA in the West Bank continues paying salaries to public sector employees in Gaza, including those in education and health, while some are paid not to perform their duties. This policy helps maintain loyalty but also relieves the regime of economic burden. The Hamas-led regime in Gaza has created a loyalist base by filling key positions in security forces and public institutions. They have their own judicial framework and disciplined security forces, but there are reports of mistreatment of political opponents. Hamas rule is believed to be stable. Hamas rule in Gaza is stable and effective, with a patronage system providing financial aid to families affected by conflict. Hamas benefits from territorial control over Gaza, contrasting with the Palestinian Authority's challenges in the West Bank. Despite its authoritarian nature, Hamas won PLC elections in 2006. Polls in 2010 showed Palestinians favored Fatah over Hamas in the West Bank and Gaza. However, a significant percentage did not have a factional preference, indicating possible malaise or cynicism. A poll in Gaza revealed over 60% supported Hamas's attacks on Israeli settlers and civilians in Israel. Hamas may gain support from Palestinians by resuming attacks on Israel. Polls show divided opinions on a two-state solution. Reports suggest Hamas is building support among Palestinian refugees, potentially giving them leverage with Fatah and Israel. Iran provides financial and military assistance to Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups, with Hamas acknowledging Iran as their primary supporter. Hamas's leadership-in-exile operates from Damascus, Syria, with support from Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon, providing training and support. Iran provides financial and military support to Hamas, with some Palestinians viewing this as leverage against Israel. Reports suggest Iran contributes $20-30 million annually to Hamas. Despite their ties, Hamas and Iran may maintain a deliberate distance from each other. Iran supports Hamas financially and militarily, with a reported annual contribution of $20-30 million. Hamas values its image as a Palestinian offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood rather than an Iranian proxy due to ethnic and sectarian differences. Iran's influence over Palestinian politics is linked to Hamas's success, especially since their rise in the late 1980s. Possible Iranian-backed smuggling of weapons and training for Hamas militants in Gaza reinforces their relationship. Hamas receives support from private individuals and organizations in the Palestinian diaspora and Arab world, including Iran and Lebanon. The United States has taken measures to disrupt Hamas's use of charities as front organizations. Hamas's political and military wings benefit from the international banking system and Gaza-Sinai smuggling tunnels. Hamas's political and military wings receive funding from affiliated Islamic charities, including those in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development was designated a global terrorist for funneling money to Hamas. The Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development was found liable for providing financing to Hamas-linked charities, which were directly tied to Hamas and dispensed funds to Hamas charities in the West. The majority of funds from Hamas-linked charities are dispensed to Hamas charities in the West Bank and Gaza, totaling an estimated $15-$20 million annually. Front organizations in Persian Gulf states also support radical Islamist elements, with funds channeled through Hamas organizations. The Union of Good, chaired by Yusuf al Qaradawi, was identified as a Saudi Arabia-based charity responsible for transferring tens of millions of dollars to Hamas-managed associations in the Palestinian territories. The Union of Good, chaired by Yusuf al Qaradawi, facilitates financial transfers between charitable organizations and Hamas in the West Bank and Gaza to strengthen Hamas' political and military position. The Union of Good facilitates financial transfers to support Hamas in Gaza, including diverting charitable donations and providing social welfare services. Funds have compensated Hamas terrorists and some organizations withdrew funding after its designation. Trade-based money laundering may benefit Hamas and other militant groups through the purchase of high-demand commodities for Palestinian areas. Some U.S. groups have raised concerns over citizens participating in protest convoys to Gaza, citing difficulty in confirming recipients are not linked with Hamas. In 2009, U.S. activists donated $500,000 worth of medical supplies to Palestinian groups through a convoy organized by Viva Palestina. Congress can assess Hamas' evolution and consider legislative options. Congress can evaluate how Hamas has evolved over time and review the effectiveness of various measures to counter the organization. Despite efforts such as political strategies, financial sanctions, and military operations, Hamas continues to play a significant role in Israeli-Palestinian politics and receives support from various sources. Some argue that U.S. policies may have inadvertently strengthened Hamas by increasing its regional and international influence. Hamas's evolution and impact on Israeli-Palestinian politics are being evaluated by Congress. Despite U.S. efforts to counter Hamas, the organization continues to receive support and play a significant role. Questions are raised about Hamas's strength compared to previous years, its rivals, and the ultimate goals of the United States and Hamas. The effectiveness of different options regarding Hamas in achieving these goals is being considered. The current U.S. aid program for the West Bank-based PA led by President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad dates back to June 2007, with approximately $2 billion in bilateral assistance to the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Assistance to UNRWA for Palestinian refugees has totaled over $700 million. The U.S. aid program for the West Bank-based PA has provided over $700 million in assistance since 2007. This includes funding for training, reform, and non-lethal equipment for PA civil security forces loyal to President Abbas. An additional $150 million has been requested for FY2011. The aid program aims to support basic needs in Gaza and prevent destabilization, while also focusing on security assistance for the West Bank. The assistance provided for the West Bank aims to create prosperity under Abbas's rule and combat terrorism from Hamas. Analysts suggest that improvements in material well-being may not be enough without progress on power-sharing and political reform. Nathan Brown warns that continuing with the current strategy of U.S. and Israeli policy inertia could lead to other actors taking the initiative. Potential risks include political missteps, violence against Israeli targets, conflict in Jerusalem, military campaigns in Gaza, or the loss of key figures like Fayyad and Abbas. Continuing U.S. and Israeli policy inertia could lead to risks such as political missteps, violence, conflict in Jerusalem, military campaigns in Gaza, or the loss of key figures like Fayyad and Abbas. Some analysts caution that U.S. policies promoting the West Bank as a model for Gaza could backfire. Some members of Congress advocate for increased humanitarian aid to Gaza while challenging the Israeli-Egyptian closure regime. Senator John Kerry supports these efforts. In February 2009, Senator John Kerry and Representatives Brian Baird and Keith Ellison visited U.N. officials in Gaza to address Gazans' needs after Operation Cast Lead. Representative Baird made subsequent visits in May 2009 and February 2010. In January 2010, 54 Representatives urged President Obama to lift the closure regime. The U.S. provided non-lethal aid to PA civil security forces in the West Bank to counter militants and establish the rule of law. The U.S. assistance program for Palestinian security forces aims to improve professionalism and law enforcement in the West Bank. However, efforts to unify security forces under civilian control accountable to human rights norms have been largely unsuccessful. PA forces have been criticized for politically targeting Hamas with shutdowns and leadership changes in collaboration with Israel and the U.S. The U.S. assistance program aims to improve Palestinian security forces in the West Bank, but efforts to unify forces under civilian control have been largely unsuccessful. The PA has faced criticism for targeting Hamas through leadership changes and arbitrary detentions, leading to opposition from Palestinians. Israeli restrictions and security operations also undermine PA credibility. The United States is the largest donor to UNRWA, providing aid to Palestinians. The United States is the largest donor to UNRWA, which provides essential services to approximately 4.8 million Palestinians in various regions. There are debates about UNRWA's role in Gaza, with some criticizing it for enabling Hamas, while others believe it provides stability and serves as a valuable presence in the region. Many prefer UNRWA's presence over the uncertainty that would arise if it were removed. Under current appropriations legislation, the United States cannot provide financial assistance to Hamas. U.S. assistance to a PA government with Hamas ministers is prohibited unless all ministers accept the \"Section 620K principles\" - recognizing Israel's right to exist and accepting previous agreements. These principles are similar to those required by the international Quartet for dealings with Hamas. Hamas alleges the U.S. has influenced Abbas to veto attempts to broker a deal. The United States has used its leverage with Abbas to veto power-sharing compromises with Hamas. Future debates may focus on relaxing or tightening U.S. restrictions on Palestinian parties and granting the President discretion to waive aid restrictions. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton discussed the possibility of Hamas members in a PA government accepting Quartet principles. The Obama Administration and Congress have proposed funding for Israel's missile defense systems, Iron Dome and David's Sling, to counter threats from Hamas. The United States supports the Lebanese government, despite Hezbollah's presence, to prevent extremism. See CRS reports for more details. The U.S. has taken actions to target Hamas funding sources and hold individuals accountable for supporting Hamas. Congress could consider supporting anti-terrorism efforts, providing oversight, and evaluating alternative actions to hinder Hamas's financial capacity. The freezing of Hamas's assets and global financial transfers has hindered its capacity for terrorist attacks and influenced its political decisions. Despite controlling Gaza, Hamas relies on smuggling cash through tunnels due to banking system controls. Scrutiny of charities has reduced financing networks in North America and Europe. Political sensitivity to Hamas's popularity and hedging bets on the Fatah-Hamas rivalry persist. Arab governments may be hesitant to crack down on their charities supporting Hamas, despite U.S. pressure. Sanctions on Iran and Syria have not significantly impacted their support for Hamas, but some believe sanctions could weaken their future support. Weaker Iranian and Syrian regimes might still sponsor proxies like Hamas to divert attention from internal problems. The ongoing Israeli-Egyptian closure regime focuses on anti-smuggling efforts targeting Gaza-Sinai tunnels. Egypt, with U.S. support, is nearing completion of an underground fence at its border with Gaza. Israeli officials urge Egypt to do more to prevent arms smuggling. United States army engineers are assisting Egypt in building a 6-8 km long steel wall at the border with Gaza, scheduled for completion in 2011. The wall is designed to prevent tunnel construction and is bomb-proofed with 40 cm thick super-strength steel, reaching depths of 25 m. Despite skepticism about its effectiveness due to past smuggling efforts, the wall aims to hinder Hamas' tunnel operations for financial gain. Egypt's underground border fence with Hamas relies on tunnels for money and weapons. Egypt's challenges in shutting down tunnel traffic reveal limits to external influence. Motivations for the Gaza-Sinai border include concerns about Hamas influencing Egyptian politics, fears of Israel transferring Gaza responsibility, historical ties to Gaza, economic and cultural practices in Sinai, and comfort with the status quo. Some analysts suggest that easing the Israeli-Egyptian closure regime could lead to a more focused approach on preventing weapons smuggling. Restrictions on goods entering Gaza limit trade to humanitarian aid. The Bush Administration pledged support to counter smuggling in 2009. In March 2009, eight NATO member states agreed with the United States on a Gaza anti-smuggling program to enhance cooperation in information sharing, diplomatic engagement, and military/law enforcement activities. Israel has been linked to actions like bombing an arms-smuggling convoy in Sudan and assassinating a Qassam Brigades leader in Dubai. In March 2010, Hamas's Al Aqsa Television was designated as a global terrorist, allowing the US to target its finances. In June 2010, France's official broadcast regulator ordered Eutelsat to cease broadcast of Al Aqsa TV due to violations of European anti-incitement laws. The US designation of Al Aqsa as a global terrorist may have influenced this decision. Legislation was considered in the 111th Congress to counter Hamas incitement, urging parties to halt broadcasts of Al Aqsa TV and similar channels. H.R. 2278 aims to counter Hamas incitement by urging satellite providers to stop broadcasting channels like Al Aqsa TV. The bill also calls for an annual report on anti-American incitement to violence. The US and Western countries view Hamas as a terrorist organization, but it receives support from Iran and Syria, as well as other Middle Eastern states like Qatar and Turkey. Most Arab allies, including Qatar, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, recognize Hamas as a crucial part of Palestinian society and advocate for its involvement in peace negotiations with Israel. The question of whether Hamas should be included in US-facilitated talks remains a key issue, as current US policy prohibits contact with the group. The integration of Hamas into the peace process could be a potential consideration. The Obama Administration has not departed from the Bush Administration's stance on Hamas, conditioning its participation in the peace process on meeting Quartet principles. Former U.S. officials have met with senior Hamas leaders since 2009, sparking speculation about potential indirect talks with Hamas. The Obama Administration has not changed the Bush Administration's stance on Hamas, conditioning peace process participation on meeting Quartet principles. There is speculation about potential indirect talks with Hamas, even without its acceptance of Quartet principles. Policy shifts towards Hamas could trigger debate, with concerns that legitimizing Hamas could strengthen its political hand at the expense of more moderate Palestinians. The U.S. military sees the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a threat to its interests in the region, with General David Petraeus highlighting the challenges it poses. Tensions between Israel and its neighbors fuel anti-American sentiment due to perceived U.S. favoritism for Israel. Arab anger over the Palestinian question limits U.S. partnerships in the region, while militant groups exploit this to gain support. Iran gains influence through Hezbollah and Hamas. Pressure may increase for efforts to counteract tensions and discuss alternatives to prevent Hamas's expansion. Efforts to engage Hamas leaders for temporary advantages, part of a broader strategy or focused on improving Gaza's situation. Some analysts suggest following precedents of engaging insurgents in Iraq and Taliban in Afghanistan. Former Israeli officials also advocate negotiating with Hamas. Future debates may arise on whether the US should discourage international engagement with Hamas. Some European actors engage with Hamas despite Quartet principles, potentially aiming for Hamas acceptance in peace process. The Mavi Marmara Gaza flotilla incident in May 2010 drew international attention, leading to the Obama Administration persuading Israel to loosen restrictions on imports to Gaza and Egypt relaxing border crossing regulations. This highlighted the potential for outside events to force a response, despite U.S. reluctance to change the status quo in Gaza. Additional attempts to break the naval blockade are expected. The Turkey-based IHH organization's example from the Gaza flotilla incident in May 2010 could inspire groups sympathetic to Hamas to creatively provide support while avoiding sanctions. International investigations have shown limited U.S. influence in shaping the debate on Hamas's actions during Operation Cast Lead. The U.N. Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, known as the \"Goldstone Report,\" has been criticized for disproportionately condemning Israeli actions during the conflict. Critics argue that Hamas was not sufficiently investigated or criticized for endangering Gaza's civilian population. The House of Representatives passed H.Res. 867 condemning Hamas for using civilians as \"human shields\" and its violent opposition to Israel. Efforts to deter Hamas have had limited success, and support for Israel and the PA/PLO/Fatah may have been counterproductive in strengthening Hamas domestically and internationally. Hamas's strength in the early 1990s, measured by popularity, military force, and leverage with other actors, is compared to its current status. The factional and geographical divisions between Hamas in Gaza and the Abbas-led PA in the West Bank pose challenges for a two-state solution and Palestinian democracy. U.S. policy rejects dealings with Hamas or any PA government including Hamas without conditions contrary to Hamas's principles, limiting the Administration's options. Hamas maintains a unified stance on violent opposition to Israel, receiving support from Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah. Poor conditions in Gaza contribute to international hostility towards Israel. U.S. policy decisions going forward will pose considerable risks. Historical Background and U.S. Policy Pre-1987: Hamas's Emergence can be traced back to the first Palestinian intifada in 1987 in Gaza Strip. The precursor, Al Mujamma al Islami, was established in Israeli-occupied Gaza in the 1970s under the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood. Sheikh Ahmed Yassin focused on religious and social services, following models from Egyptian and Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood branches. The formation of Hamas in Gaza was influenced by the political activism of the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood and the motivation to engage in political Islam following the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Israel supported Hamas as a counterbalance to secular nationalist factions like Fatah. The Palestinian Brotherhood's transformation into a militant organization led to the establishment of Hamas in 1987 during the first intifada, gaining widespread Palestinian support for resistance against Israel. Following the establishment of Hamas in 1987 during the first intifada, the group gained support for resistance against Israel. In response to Hamas kidnappings and killings of Israeli soldiers, Israel deported top Hamas leaders to southern Lebanon in December 1992. The United States and human rights organizations pressured Israel to repatriate the leaders to the West Bank and Gaza, which occurred in late 1993. Hamas, along with other Palestinian factions, rejected the Oslo Accord in September 1993, which limited Palestinian aspirations to the West Bank and Gaza. Hamas shifted its strategy after a 1994 attack in Hebron, targeting civilians in Israel with suicide bombings. Investigations revealed Hamas had been recruiting and fundraising in the US. In the mid-1990s, Hamas was found to be recruiting and fundraising in the US, with the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development being a key hub. President Clinton signed an Executive Order in 1995 blocking assets and transactions with Hamas and other terrorist organizations. In the mid-1990s, Israel targeted extremist groups like Kach and Kahane Chai, while pressuring the Palestinian Authority (PA) to crack down on Hamas. The PA formed security forces to combat terrorism, with support from the US in fostering Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation. The Clinton Administration provided covert assistance to paramilitary and intelligence organizations with ties to Arafat to combat terrorism. The European Union also initiated a counterterrorism program. In October 1997, Hamas was listed as a Foreign Terrorist Organization after a suicide bombing in Jerusalem. The effectiveness of U.S. counterterrorism assistance to the PA remains debated. The Clinton Administration provided covert assistance to combat terrorism, which led to a decrease in attacks until the second Palestinian intifada in 2000. The impact of U.S. aid is uncertain due to its covert nature and other factors like Israeli actions and peace negotiations. Some believe U.S. assistance helped prevent attacks, while others think Arafat's crackdowns had limited lasting value. Hamas demonstrated its capacity for attacks during the second intifada in 2000. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13224 to suppress terrorist activities and financing. Hamas and the Holy Land Foundation were added to the list of designated global terrorist organizations. Six Hamas leaders and five affiliated charities were later added to the list. During the second intifada in 2000, Hamas showed its capacity for attacks. In response to the September 11, 2001 attacks, President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13224 to combat terrorist activities and financing, adding Hamas and the Holy Land Foundation to the list of designated global terrorist organizations. Subsequently, six Hamas leaders and five affiliated charities were added to the list, including Al Aqsa Television and Hamas's Islamic National Bank in March 2010. The Union of Good, a Hamas-related organization based in Saudi Arabia, was also added in November 2008. U.S. counterterrorism assistance to the Arafat-led Palestinian Authority during the intifada was complicated by attacks from offshoots of Arafat's Fatah faction, such as Tanzim and the Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. During Operation Defensive Shield in 2002, Israel targeted Hamas leaders, including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz al Rantissi, in Gaza. President Bush no longer trusted Arafat in the peace process and indicated future U.S. support for the Palestinian Authority would require a new leader. Hamas's leadership shifted to Khaled Meshaal in Damascus, strengthening its reputation and institutions relative to Fatah and the PA. Hamas gained popularity during the second intifada as Fatah's fell, and Israel dismantled Palestinian security organizations. After the IDF dismantled Fatah-dominated PA's security infrastructure, Hamas gained strength and popularity. In 2005, Hamas decided to participate in Palestinian Authority elections, winning a majority in the PLC in 2006. The US sought a successor committed to the peace process after Yasser Arafat's death in 2004. Hamas saw an opportunity with the emergence of Mahmoud Abbas as the successor to Yasser Arafat in 2005. By late 2004, Hamas felt pressure to shift its image from a militant group to a legitimate political movement. US and international efforts, along with Israeli opposition, may have influenced Hamas's decision to participate in Palestinian elections in 2006. Hamas decided to participate in Palestinian elections in 2006 to gain new legitimacy after being classified as a terrorist movement. The move was influenced by international pressure and a desire to shift from a militant group to a legitimate political movement. Hamas participated in the 2006 Palestinian elections as the \"Change and Reform\" party, gaining new legitimacy. The United States, international community, and Israel supported this plan without preconditions, underestimating Hamas's prospects. The Bush Administration provided financial assistance to the PA to boost its public profile before the elections. The USAID allocated $2 million for a media and public outreach initiative to boost the PA's public profile before the 2006 Palestinian elections, coordinated by a U.S. contractor and Palestinian subcontractors through Abbas's office. Concerns were raised about the wisdom of the program, highlighting the challenge of promoting democracy in the Middle East. In the 2006 Palestinian elections, Hamas won a majority of seats in the PLC by outmaneuvering Fatah with a superior campaign strategy. The perception of significant U.S. backing for Fatah backfired, negatively impacting views of U.S. competence in the region.
