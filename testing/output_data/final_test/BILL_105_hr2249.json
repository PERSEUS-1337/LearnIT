SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF REAL-TIME SEISMIC HAZARD WARNING SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT. The Director of the United States Geological Survey shall develop a real-time seismic warning system for high-risk activities, including high-speed rail transportation. The Director will develop a prototype real-time seismic warning system by upgrading seismic sensors and improving communication infrastructure. Agreements or contracts may be entered into as necessary. The Director will develop a communications and computation infrastructure to process data from an upgraded seismic sensor network and facilitate real-time seismic hazard warnings and high-risk activity alerts. Computer hardware and software procurement will also be carried out. The Director will procure necessary computer hardware and software for the program. Reports on progress, including a plan for a real-time seismic hazard warning system, must be submitted to Congress. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for the Director under the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 is $3,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1998 and 1999. The Director will assess regional seismic monitoring networks in the United States to update infrastructure and expand recording capabilities. The Director will assess the need for expanding ground motion recording capabilities, measuring large seismic events accurately, acquiring additional data, and estimating costs. Results will be transmitted to Congress within a year. Additionally, Earth Science teaching materials for local educational agencies will be defined. The Director of the National Science Foundation may use funds to develop and provide earth science teaching materials for schools and educational agencies at a minimal cost. The National Science Foundation provides earth science teaching materials for schools at a minimal cost. The Director conducts a project to improve seismic hazard assessment in seismic zones, submitting reports to Congress annually. The Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency will conduct an assessment of the need for additional Federal disaster-response training capabilities applicable to earthquake response, including a review of existing training programs and an estimate of emergency response personnel. The Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency will assess the need for more disaster-response training, focusing on earthquake response and evaluating existing programs. A report addressing the assessment results must be submitted to Congress by February 15, 1998, including recommendations for additional training centers. SEC. 3. COMPREHENSIVE ENGINEERING RESEARCH PLAN. The National Science Foundation is amending the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act to develop a comprehensive plan for earthquake engineering research in collaboration with FEMA, NIST, and USGS. This plan aims to utilize existing testing facilities, upgrade equipment as necessary, and incorporate new testing approaches. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is amending the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act to collaborate with other agencies in developing a comprehensive plan for earthquake engineering research. This plan includes utilizing existing testing facilities, upgrading equipment, and incorporating innovative testing approaches. The United States Geological Survey is amending the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act to collaborate with other agencies in developing a comprehensive plan for earthquake engineering research, including upgrading facilities, integrating new testing approaches, and effectively using existing testing facilities. The Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act is being amended to collaborate with other agencies in developing a comprehensive plan for earthquake engineering research, including upgrading facilities, integrating new testing approaches, and effectively using existing testing facilities. The Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act is being amended to collaborate with other agencies in developing a comprehensive plan for earthquake engineering research, including upgrading facilities, integrating new testing approaches, and effectively using existing testing facilities. The plan aims to develop a systematic approach to earthquake engineering research by utilizing existing facilities, upgrading equipment as needed, and integrating innovative testing methods. SEC. 4. REPEALS. Sections 6 and 7 of the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 (42 U.S.C. 7705 and 7705a) are repealed."
