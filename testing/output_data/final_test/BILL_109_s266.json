    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stop Government Propaganda Act\". Congress found that since 1951, there has been a prohibition on using appropriated funds for propaganda within the United States. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found violations by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of National Drug Control Policy for creating and distributing fake television news stories. In 2003, the Department of Education violated propaganda prohibitions by using taxpayer funds to create fake television news stories promoting the \"No Child Left Behind\" program and ranking journalists on how positively they portrayed the Administration and the Republican Party. Additionally, taxpayer funds were used to pay journalist Armstrong Williams to promote Administration education policies, violating the ban on covert propaganda. The misuse of taxpayer funds for promoting Administration policies continued with payments to journalist Maggie Gallagher in 2002, construction of school facades to boost the image of the \"No Child Left Behind\" program, and inserting messages into Social Security Administration materials to support President Bush's privatization plan. Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services disregarded legal directives from the Government Accountability Office in 2004. The Department of Justice failed to report Anti-Deficiency Act violations to Congress and the President, despite multiple propaganda law breaches. Stronger measures are needed to enforce the ban on using taxpayer funds for propaganda purposes. SEC. 3. DEFINITION. The term \"publicity\" or \"propaganda\" in this Act includes various forms of communication that do not clearly identify the Government agency financially responsible for the message, such as news releases, audio or visual presentations, internet messages, attempts to manipulate the news media, messages aiding a political party or candidate, and messages for self-aggrandizement. The Act prohibits messages that promote self-aggrandizement, emphasize agency importance, contain misleading propaganda, or support/defeat legislation through various forms of communication. The Act prohibits publicity or propaganda and enforces this prohibition. The Act prohibits publicity or propaganda within the United States. The senior official of an Executive branch agency who authorizes funds for such purposes without legal authorization may face a civil penalty. The Attorney General is responsible for investigating violations and may bring a civil action. Private individuals can also bring civil actions for violations on behalf of the United States Government. The False Claims Act allows civil actions to be brought in the name of the United States Government. The complaint must be filed in camera, remain under seal for at least 60 days, and not be served on the defendant until ordered by the court. The Government may intervene within 60 days after receiving the complaint and evidence. The Government can request extensions for keeping the complaint under seal, supported by affidavits. The defendant responds 20 days after the complaint is unsealed. The Government must take action within 60 days or notify the court of its decision. When a person brings an action under this subsection, only the Government can intervene or bring a related action. If the Government proceeds with the action, it has the primary responsibility for prosecuting it and can dismiss the case. The person bringing the action can continue as a party with limitations. The Government can dismiss or settle an action initiated by a person, even if there are objections, as long as the court provides an opportunity for a hearing. The court can determine the fairness of the proposed settlement after a hearing, which may be held in camera if there is good cause. The court may impose limitations on a person's participation in litigation if it would interfere with the government's prosecution, such as limiting witnesses, testimony length, cross-examination, or overall participation. The court may limit a person's participation in litigation if it would cause harassment, burden, or unnecessary expense to the defendant. If the Government chooses not to proceed with the action, the person who initiated it can continue, providing copies of all pleadings to the Government upon request. The court may allow the Government to intervene in a legal action if there is good cause. If the Government shows that a person's discovery actions would interfere with their investigation, the court can stay discovery for up to 60 days, extendable upon further showing in camera. The court may extend the 60-day discovery stay if the Government shows diligence in pursuing the investigation and if civil discovery would interfere. The Government can pursue its claim through other remedies like administrative proceedings. The final determination in another legal proceeding is binding in actions under this section. If the government proceeds with a case filed by an individual, that person can receive 15-25% of the proceeds, depending on their contribution. The person bringing the action or settling the claim can receive 25-30% of the proceeds as a reward for collecting the civil penalty and damages, along with expenses, attorneys' fees, and costs. If the Government does not proceed, these amounts are awarded against the defendant. The defendant may be awarded attorneys' fees and expenses if the person bringing the action's claim is found to be frivolous, vexatious, or for harassment. The Government is not liable for expenses incurred in bringing the action. In civil actions brought by the United States, prevailing defendants may be entitled to fees and expenses under section 2412(d) of title 28. Whistleblower protection is provided for employees who are discharged or demoted. Any employee facing discrimination for lawful acts related to this section is entitled to relief, including reinstatement, back pay, interest, and compensation for damages. An employee facing discrimination may seek relief, including reinstatement, back pay, interest, and compensation for damages, such as litigation costs and attorneys' fees, through an action in the appropriate district court of the United States. The courts must consider legal decisions by the Government Accountability Office related to this Act. There is a provision for a point of order. The House of Representatives and the Senate cannot pass an appropriation bill for an agency found in violation of the Act by the Government Accountability Office without reducing the agency head's salary by the amount of the illegal expenditure. This rule does not apply if the agency is complying with the GAO's decision. The agency must comply with the Government Accountability Office's decision. A supermajority waiver and appeal process is required in the Senate to challenge rulings on points of order."
