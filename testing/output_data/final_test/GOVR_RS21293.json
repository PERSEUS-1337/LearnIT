A terrorist attack using a nuclear bomb in a U.S. seaport could result in devastating consequences, with estimates of 50,000 to 1 million casualties and significant economic losses. Terrorists could smuggle a bomb into a U.S. port via containers, which are a key vulnerability according to FBI intelligence. Customs and Border Protection screens data for all containers but only inspects about 6 percent of them. The potential for a nuclear weapon to be hidden in a container poses a significant threat. CBP Commissioner Robert Bonner warns of the devastating consequences for the global economy if a terrorist group were to use a nuclear bomb in a container. The potential routes for terrorists to obtain such a bomb include Russia, where shorter-range lower-yield weapons are less secure, and Pakistan, where there is concern about weapons falling into the wrong hands. Reports indicate that Pakistanis aided nuclear programs in Iran, Libya, and North Korea, raising concerns about the security of Pakistani nuclear weapons if President Musharraf were assassinated. The Hiroshima bomb was a \"gun assembly\" weapon using highly enriched uranium, the simplest type of nuclear weapon. Experts believe that terrorist groups could potentially build a crude nuclear weapon using highly enriched uranium (HEU) if they have access to the necessary materials and skills. The main obstacle for countries or competent terrorist groups in developing nuclear weapons is the availability of special nuclear material (SNM), particularly HEU. The threat of terrorist groups obtaining highly enriched uranium (HEU) for a nuclear weapon is a concern. The National Research Council study highlights the high threat level from special nuclear material (SNM) in Russia. Defense in depth is the main approach to reduce vulnerability, using multiple methods to detect and interdict a weapon. Efforts are made to push detection and interdiction away from U.S. shores. The Department of Energy operates the Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting Program to secure fissile materials in former Soviet republics, while the Department of Defense runs the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program to secure nuclear weapons. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative aims to secure fissile and radioactive materials worldwide. The International Atomic Energy Agency has safeguards in place to protect highly enriched uranium in nuclear reactors. The Proliferation Security Initiative, announced by President Bush in 2003, involves the United States and allies working on agreements to search and seize suspect cargo, potentially influencing Libya's decision to end its WMD programs. The Container Security Initiative, started in 2002, screens high-risk containers for WMD before loading onto ships in 34 ports. The Megaports Initiative provides radiation detection equipment and expertise. The Megaports Initiative provides radiation detection equipment and expertise to CBP for screening containers in foreign ports. The International Ship and Port Facility Security Code requires port operators to improve maritime security. DHS has distributed $560 million in port security grants. The Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 requires assessments of vessel and facility vulnerability. CBP is implementing the Automated Commercial Environment to analyze data on goods entering the US for inspection. President Bush issued a Maritime Security Policy directive requiring standards for maritime recovery operations, a coordinating committee, a National Strategy for Maritime Security, global intelligence integration, outreach coordination, and a plan for maritime supply chain security. The government is investing in enhanced technology for detecting nuclear weapons entering the US. Operation Safe Commerce is a program to enhance security for container cargo. The Trade Act of 2002 mandates the evaluation and certification of secure international intermodal transport systems. Terrorists may try to counter new technologies by detonating weapons before inspection. Terrorists may try to evade security measures by detonating weapons before inspection or smuggling them through smaller ports. Detecting HEU bombs is challenging due to low radiation emissions, prompting research and development efforts. In 2002 and 2003, ABC News successfully shipped depleted uranium into U.S. ports undetected, raising concerns about the effectiveness of current inspection processes. DHS highlighted the need for improvements in the inspection process to prevent weapons of mass destruction from entering the U.S. The text discusses the need to prevent weapons of mass destruction from entering the U.S. through oceangoing cargo containers. Legislation such as the Secure Domestic Container Partnership Act of 2005 and the Anti-Terrorism and Port Security Act of 2005 are mentioned. Securing nuclear materials, improving detection equipment, and the importance of forensics in identifying the origin of nuclear material used in a bomb are also highlighted. The text discusses the importance of enhancing forensic capabilities and technology to deter nations from providing nuclear materials to terrorists. It also highlights the need to prioritize security resources at ports with high population density, such as Philadelphia and New York, to mitigate potential terrorist attacks. Additionally, it mentions Cold War civil defense studies on mitigating the destructive effects of a large nuclear attack. The text examines efforts to respond to a terrorist attack using a 15-kiloton nuclear weapon, focusing on port security and the need for further study on global economic consequences. Improving detection of terrorist nuclear weapons in maritime transportation systems could deter attacks on ports. The American Association of Port Authorities supports federal initiatives to enhance security. The American Association of Port Authorities supports federal grants for port security upgrades to comply with the MTSA, but calls for substantially greater resources. More resources are needed to secure U.S. ports, reduce overcrowding of cargo-handling facilities, and hire more workers. Congress must decide how to allocate security funds among ports and other potential targets. Protection, \"Remarks by Commissioner Robert C. Bonner, Council on Foreign Relations, New York, January 11, 2005. Post-Election Analysis: Millions of Dollars Ride on a Simple Definition of 'Inspection,' U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information, Hearing: \"Covering the Waterfront -- A Review of Seaport Security since September 11, 2001,\" January 27, 2004. U.S. Dept. of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Commissioner Robert Bonner, Speech Before the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Washington, D.C., January 17, 2002.\" The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for building nuclear weapons by terrorists, including detailed design drawings, skilled individuals, equipment, and preparations to create a bomb quickly. It also references a report on the role of science and technology in countering terrorism. The curr_chunk provides references to various reports and articles related to nuclear terrorism prevention, port security grants, and national security directives. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of the MTSA Senior Policy Group in 2004 to address mandates in MTSA and the Trade Act for securing international intermodal cargo shipments. Led by the DHS Directorate of Border and Transportation Security, the group includes representatives from various agencies. Customs and Border Protection's procedures to detect uranium in two smuggling incidents were discussed in a report by the U.S. National Commission on Terrorist Attacks. Additionally, the American Association of Port Authorities highlighted the need for more federal security grants for U.S. ports in a news release. The New York Times reported on concerns about security due to cargo backlogs at the nation's ports."
