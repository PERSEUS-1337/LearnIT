    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Right To Know About Airport Pollution Act of 1999\". The purpose of the Act is to address findings related to airport pollution. Congress finds that the serious pollution problems associated with airport operations, including ground level ozone, noise, water pollution, and solid waste disposal, necessitate a comprehensive evaluation of pollution sources. The Clean Air Act mandates states to reduce emissions contributing to ground level ozone and study the effects of sporadic noise, such as jet noise near airports, on public health. Additionally, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act establishes a regulatory program for water pollution control. The Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and Solid Waste Disposal Act regulate pollution sources. A study in California identified airports as significant air pollution sources, leading to the airport bubble concept treating airports as single pollution sources emitting various pollutants. The Act aims to reduce pollution from various sources within airport bubbles, including air, noise, water, and solid waste. It requires a feasibility study on applying airport bubbles to assess and reduce pollution around airports and improve environmental quality. Additionally, a study on air pollutant emission standards for airplane engines is mandated to determine the feasibility of strengthening the standards. The Act defines \"Administrator\" as the head of the EPA and \"airport bubble\" as an area around airports where pollution sources are identified and regulated collectively. A study on implementing airport bubbles is required. The Administrator will conduct a study on regulating pollution from all sources in and around airports using airport bubbles. A working group will be established to assist in the study, including representatives from various organizations and agencies. The working group assisting in the study on regulating pollution around airports includes an airport manager, military air base representatives, bus and taxi service representatives, law enforcement, Air Transport Association, and Airports Council. The study on regulating pollution around airports includes representatives from the Airports Council International-North America, environmental specialists, and an aviation union representing ground crews. The study will collect and analyze information on sources of air, noise, water, and solid waste pollution within airport bubbles, including aircraft, vehicles, equipment, buses, taxis, and limousines. The study on regulating pollution around airports involves considering relevant information from State implementation plans and airport master plans, assessing air quality implications of airport operations, evaluating the environmental and economic impact of regulating airports as significant pollution sources, proposing boundaries for airport bubbles, and defining air pollutant emissions for airport bubbles. The study involves developing an inventory of pollution sources within airport bubbles, evaluating programs for pollution reduction, assessing the feasibility of regulating pollutants in and around airports, and making recommendations for implementation. The Administrator will submit a report to Congress within 3 years of the enactment of the Act, detailing the results and recommendations of the study on airport bubbles, pollution reduction programs, and unique air and noise pollution issues at military air bases. The Administrator will conduct a study on emission standards for airplane engines to determine if they should be strengthened. A report will be submitted to Congress within 2 years. Additionally, progress reports will be submitted annually until the required reports are submitted. The Administrator will require airports serving commercial or military jet aircraft to report toxic chemical releases and waste management activities. This includes chemicals used during aircraft operation, maintenance, and other airport activities. An airport is considered a facility under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act for reporting toxic chemical releases and waste management activities related to aircraft operations. The Administrator will implement the Act using existing funds."
