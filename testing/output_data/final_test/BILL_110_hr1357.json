    "content": "There is no information provided in the prev_chunk to assist with summarizing the curr_chunk. Congress finds that rogue regimes supporting international terrorism, particularly Iran, pose a significant threat by potentially obtaining nuclear weapons. Despite Iran's history of deception in its nuclear program, foreign entities investing in Iran's energy sector have allowed it to evade consequences. US investors have a vested interest in preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. The Act requires the President to publish a list of US and foreign entities investing over $20,000,000 in Iran's energy sector every six months. This list includes details of individual investments such as dollar value, purpose, and status. Additionally, investors must be informed within 30 days of the publication in the Federal Register. Investors in US Government pension plans, private sector pension plans, and mutual funds in the US must be notified if their funds are invested in entities on the list of those investing in Iran's energy sector. Notification must include entity identification, investment amount, potential liabilities, and plans for divestment. Investment managers must notify investors if their funds are invested in entities on the list of those investing in Iran's energy sector. Notifications should include entity identification, investment amount, potential liabilities, and divestment plans. Additionally, this information must be included in prospectuses and regular reports provided to investors. Upon notification under subsection (c), managers of United States Government pension plans or thrift savings plans must divest all investments in entities on the list of those investing in Iran's energy sector. If managers verifiably divest all investments in listed entities and refrain from new investments, they are exempt from including notifications in prospectuses or reports to investors. Upon publication of a list in the relevant Federal Register, managers of pension plans and mutual funds in the private sector should divest all investments in entities listed, with a prohibition on future investments in those entities. Managers of pension plans and mutual funds in the private sector must divest from entities listed in the Federal Register and are prohibited from future investments in those entities. The Office of Global Security Risks within the SEC will issue a report within 30 days of a list being published in the Federal Register, identifying US and foreign entities with operations in Iran that pose risks to the US or face litigation/sanctions likely to impact their financial condition. The Act will end 30 days after Iran stops supporting terrorism and ceases pursuing nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons."
