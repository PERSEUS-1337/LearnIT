The U.S. Government Accountability Office reported on drug trafficking through Venezuela, highlighting the lack of counternarcotics cooperation as a hindrance to U.S. drug interdiction efforts. U.S. and Colombian officials accused Venezuela of supporting armed Colombian groups along the border. On June 25, 2009, the United States and Venezuela agreed to return respective ambassadors, with U.S. Ambassador Patrick Duddy resuming his post in Caracas. Venezuelans voted in a referendum on February 15, 2009, to abolish term limits for elected officials, including the President. President Ch\u00e1vez declared the vote a victory for the Bolivarian Revolution and hinted at running for re-election in 2012. In January 2009, a synagogue in Caracas was vandalized, leading to strong condemnation from President Ch\u00e1vez and Venezuelan officials. On November 23, 2008, Venezuela held state and municipal elections, with government supporters winning 17 out of 22 governorships. The opposition won in the country's largest cities of Caracas and Maracaibo. President Ch\u00e1vez and Venezuelan officials condemned the attack on a synagogue in Caracas in January 2009. On October 3, 2008, Venezuelan military intelligence detained retired General Ra\u00fal Baduel on corruption charges. Baduel, a former Ch\u00e1vez supporter turned critic, was prohibited from leaving the country. Ch\u00e1vez opponents believed this was meant to intimidate the opposition before the November 2008 state and municipal elections. In September 2008, 41 U.S. House members expressed outrage over the expulsion of Human Rights Watch staff and urged President Ch\u00e1vez to improve human rights, democratic institutions, and political pluralism in Venezuela. Human Rights Watch had released a report highlighting setbacks in human rights protections and practices. Human Rights Watch issued a report on human rights setbacks under the Ch\u00e1vez government. Two HRW employees were expelled by the Venezuelan government, sparking condemnation. President Bush waived sanctions on Venezuela for failing to adhere to narcotics control agreements. The U.S. Treasury froze assets of Venezuelan intelligence officials. The U.S. Department froze assets of Venezuelan officials for aiding FARC. Venezuela expelled U.S. Ambassador and accused U.S. of assassination plot. Russian bombers arrived in Venezuela for military exercises. In August 2008, Venezuela's Supreme Court upheld the disqualification of 272 individuals from running for office, including opposition figures like Leopoldo L\u00f3pez. The government enacted 26 presidential decrees granting President Ch\u00e1vez broad powers, including appointing regional leaders, setting up a civilian militia, and expropriating goods from private businesses. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's election in 1998 marked a shift in Venezuela's political landscape, with his victory showing a rejection of traditional parties due to mismanagement and corruption. Ch\u00e1vez's rise to power was fueled by a left-leaning coalition and a promise of constitutional reform to address elite control of the country's resources. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's election in 1998 signaled a change in Venezuela's political scene, rejecting traditional parties for mismanagement and corruption. Ch\u00e1vez advocated for constitutional reform to combat elite dominance and misuse of state resources. The country faced economic and political challenges post-1989, leading to erosion of power of traditional parties. Former President Carlos Andres Perez's austerity measures sparked riots, and Ch\u00e1vez himself attempted a military coup in 1992 against corruption and poverty. Perez was later dismissed in 1993 for misusing public funds. The election of Rafael Caldera as President in December 1993 brought political stability, but a banking crisis cost the government over $10 billion. Despite some economic improvement in 1997, a sharp drop in oil prices led to a deep recession in 1998. Under President Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela underwent significant political changes, including a new constitution and the renaming of the country to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in 1999. President Ch\u00e1vez won three key elections to establish a new constitution, expand his term to six years, and secure a second term. The new constitution revamped political institutions, leading to a mega-election in July 2000 where Ch\u00e1vez easily won with 60% of the vote. His coalition also secured governorships and a majority in the National Assembly. Critics raised concerns about Ch\u00e1vez's government, fearing authoritarian rule due to his domination of institutions. Some saw a cult of personality around him, citing his admiration for Fidel Castro and close ties to Cuba. Military involvement in the government, politicization of the educational system, and mobilization of army reservists for social projects were also criticized. President Ch\u00e1vez faced growing opposition in late 2001 and early 2002 as concerns mounted over his leftist agenda and ineffective governance. Critics feared the formation of Bolivarian circles mirroring Cuba's neighborhood committees, leading to broad coalition protests against his rule. Trade unions and his own political movement also turned against him, culminating in massive opposition demonstrations in April 2002. In April 2002, massive opposition protests and military pressure led to the brief ouster of President Ch\u00e1vez from power. He was ultimately restored to power by the military after being blamed for the death of unarmed civilians. The country's largest business association proclaimed an interim president but quickly lost support due to extreme measures, allowing Ch\u00e1vez to return to power. Carmona stepped down, paving the way for Ch\u00e1vez's return to power on April 14. The interim government's hardline policies and support from Ch\u00e1vez's followers convinced military commanders to back his return. After Ch\u00e1vez regained power, opposition groups formed the Democratic Coordinator (CD) to push for his removal through a referendum, which was denied by the Supreme Court. Ch\u00e1vez argued that the constitution did not allow for such a referendum. President Ch\u00e1vez maintained that a binding referendum on his rule could take place after the halfway point of his term, which would occur in August 2003. The CD orchestrated a general strike from early December 2002 to early February 2003, disrupting Venezuela's economy. Violent clashes between Ch\u00e1vez supporters and the opposition resulted in deaths. The government responded to the strike by firing thousands of PdVSA employees. An agreement was reached on May 29, 2003, with the help of the OAS and the Carter Center to resolve the political crisis. On May 29, 2003, an agreement was reached to resolve the political crisis in Venezuela. Despite difficulties in implementing the accord due to political polarization, a presidential recall referendum was announced for August 15, 2004. Ch\u00e1vez won the referendum with 59.3% support. The constitution required 2.4 million signatures for the recall referendum, but only 1.91 million valid signatures were collected. The CNE updated the number of valid signatures for a recall referendum to 1.91 million, with 1.2 million more that could be valid after a repair period. Opposition protests followed the announcement that there were not enough valid signatures, but a repair period was held from May 27-31, 2004. Observers from the OAS and the Carter Center monitored the process, which was deemed peaceful. Sufficient signatures were eventually secured for a recall referendum on June 3, 2004. The CNE confirmed enough signatures for a recall referendum scheduled for August 15. If held after August 19, VP Jose Vicente Rangel would serve the remainder of Ch\u00e1vez's term if recalled. A \"yes\" majority vote exceeding Ch\u00e1vez's 2000 election votes was needed. New elections would follow within 30 days if Ch\u00e1vez was recalled. It was uncertain if Ch\u00e1vez could run for reelection, but the Supreme Court might have allowed it. The opposition faced challenges due to lack of political coalition organization. Polls showed varying results on support for recalling President Ch\u00e1vez, with some favoring him. By early August 2004, polls indicated Ch\u00e1vez had an advantage. Opinion polls in July and August 2004 showed varying results on support for recalling President Ch\u00e1vez, with some indicating he had an advantage. Despite concerns about hidden voters, Ch\u00e1vez convincingly won the recall referendum with 59.25% voting against his recall. The recall referendum in Venezuela saw 59.25% voting against President Ch\u00e1vez's recall, with 40.74% in favor. The OAS and the Carter Center confirmed the results, despite opposition claims of fraud. The OAS resolution called for respect of the results and encouraged national dialogue for reconciliation. President Ch\u00e1vez's victory in the recall referendum was influenced by factors such as the improved economy due to high oil prices, allowing for increased social spending. The fragmented opposition also played a role, as they did not effectively campaign. Ch\u00e1vez's rule was further strengthened after his allies won majority in gubernatorial and municipal elections in late 2004. Just days before the December 4, 2005 elections in Venezuela, the five major opposition parties announced a boycott, citing concerns about the National Electoral Council's bias towards the government. The boycotting parties included historically dominant parties like Democratic Action and the Social Christian Party, as well as other key opposition parties. Their main concern was the use of digital fingerprint machines by the CNE, fearing government interference. The opposition in Venezuela feared government interference through the use of digital fingerprint machines during the 2005 elections. Despite the CNE's decision not to use the machines, opposition parties still boycotted the legislative elections, causing surprise among election officials and international observers. In the 2005 elections in Venezuela, some opposition groups objected to parties using two separate banners to increase their chances of winning additional seats. The pro-Ch\u00e1vez coalition utilized this method to win 77% of seats in municipal elections. The Supreme Court rejected an injunction filed by the opposition AD against this practice. Due to the opposition boycott, pro-Ch\u00e1vez parties won all 167 seats in the National Assembly, with a low voter participation rate of 25%. In the 2005 Venezuelan elections, pro-Ch\u00e1vez supporters won all 167 seats in the National Assembly due to the opposition boycott, with a low voter participation rate of 25%. Observers predicted pro-Ch\u00e1vez parties would win a two-thirds majority control of the legislature. Both the OAS and the European Union criticized the conduct of the elections. The EU and OAS criticized the conduct of Venezuelan elections, citing widespread distrust in the electoral process and lack of independence in the electoral authority. Despite some positive steps taken by the CNE, the elections were seen as a missed opportunity to bridge societal divides. The EU praised the CNE for allowing external scrutiny of the voting system and making necessary modifications, including the removal of digital fingerprint devices. The opposition's last-minute withdrawal before the election was noted with surprise. The OAS delegation criticized the distrust of the CNE and called for a new democratic consensus through dialogue. It emphasized the importance of an institutional opposition in every democracy. With Ch\u00e1vez supporters dominating the legislature, the opposition parties have no official role in Venezuela's political system. Critics question the wisdom of the opposition's election boycott, while others believe the high abstention rate could undermine the National Assembly's legitimacy. Jose Miguel Vivanco from Human Rights Watch argues that the opposition's tactics won't help them gain support internationally. The boycott of Venezuela's presidential election in 2006 aimed to highlight threats to democracy and increase international pressure on the Ch\u00e1vez government. Despite Ch\u00e1vez's resounding reelection with 62.87% of the vote, critics questioned the legitimacy of the election due to high abstention rates. Ch\u00e1vez's victory was supported by rising oil prices, allowing for increased government spending on social programs. President Ch\u00e1vez's reelection in 2006 showed widespread support for his social policies and the government's misiones. The opposition, led by Manuel Rosales, conceded defeat in a legitimate election despite previous weaknesses. In August 2006, Manuel Rosales emerged as the opposition candidate in the Venezuelan presidential race after eight other candidates dropped out in support of him. Despite trailing in the polls, Rosales ran a strong campaign focusing on social justice and alliances between different income sectors. He criticized the Ch\u00e1vez government for not doing enough to reduce poverty and proposed a controversial program to transfer oil revenues directly to the poor. Manuel Rosales, the opposition candidate in the Venezuelan presidential race, emphasized efforts to boost the private sector, increase investment, improve judicial efficiency, and tackle crime. He proposed new legislative elections with proportional representation and a shorter presidential term. Rosales criticized President Ch\u00e1vez for prioritizing foreign aid over addressing poverty in Venezuela and for alliances with Cuba and Iran. Opposition supporters accused Ch\u00e1vez of using state resources for his reelection campaign. Observers noted that the Venezuelan government was accused of using political coercion to secure support for President Ch\u00e1vez's reelection. International organizations like the OAS and EU sent delegations to monitor the elections and deemed them satisfactory despite some issues. The high turnout and peaceful nature of the elections were praised, opening the way for improvements in electoral processes. President Ch\u00e1vez strengthened his power in 2007 by obtaining broad powers to pass laws by decree for 18 months. Critics fear this move will undermine democratic institutions, while supporters believe it will help enact a new economic and social model in Venezuela. Other proposals included eliminating the autonomy of the central bank and making PdVSA a majority shareholder of Orinoco. In 2007, President Ch\u00e1vez obtained broad powers to pass laws by decree for 18 months, aiming to enact a new economic and social model in Venezuela. Additional proposals included nationalizing telecommunications and electricity companies, changing the constitution for indefinite presidential reelection, and promoting \"Bolivarian popular education.\" In February 2007, the Venezuelan government negotiated agreements to purchase majority stakes in AES and Verizon's stake in CANTV. Foreign investors may be hesitant to invest in Venezuela due to nationalizations and increased government involvement in the economy. President Ch\u00e1vez announced the non-renewal of RCTV's broadcast license in December 2006, citing the station's support of a coup against him in 2002. RCTV could still broadcast on private cable or satellite stations. The Venezuelan government did not renew Radio Caracas Television's (RCTV) broadcast license in December 2006, leading to concerns about freedom of expression from the OAS and human rights organizations. RCTV claims its license is valid until 2022 and accuses the government of trying to silence public opinion. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights also called on Venezuela to protect media pluralism. The Venezuelan government's decision not to renew RCTV's license sparked protests denouncing it as a violation of freedom of speech. Human rights organizations and press associations criticized the move as politically motivated. RCTV ceased broadcasting on May 27, leading to continued student-led protests against the government's actions. Protests against the government's decision to close RCTV have surprised officials. Over 70% of Venezuelans disagree with President Ch\u00e1vez's move. The government has threatened legal action against Globovisi\u00f3n for allegedly inciting violence. Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro accuses the United States of destabilizing Venezuela. The U.S. Senate and European Parliament express concerns over freedom of expression in Venezuela. The State Department calls on Venezuela to reverse its restrictions on freedom of speech. The European Parliament, Brazilian Senate, and Chilean Senate expressed concern over Venezuela's restrictions on freedom of expression. Several nations at the OAS General Assembly also spoke out for press freedom. RCTV resumed broadcasting in July 2007. In July 2007, RCTV resumed broadcasting through cable and satellite as RCTV International, facing government pressure to register as a Venezuelan broadcaster to comply with local regulations. The Venezuelan Supreme Court ruled in favor of cable companies carrying RCTV International despite government threats of fines. Venezuela's telecommunications minister, Jesse Chacon, responded to the Supreme Court's decision by stating that norms defining a national broadcaster would be elaborated to compel RCTV International to submit to government regulation. In August 2007, Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez announced proposals for constitutional reform to move Venezuela towards \"socialism in the 21st century\" with participatory democracy and a mixed economy, aiming to redistribute oil resources to benefit the poor and decentralize political power. Venezuela's National Assembly debated and finalized 69 constitutional amendments proposed by President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in November 2007. The amendments were split into two blocks for a public referendum in December 2007, with Block A including reforms such as lowering the voting age to 16 and prohibiting foreign financing of political associations. The constitutional amendments proposed by President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in November 2007 included lowering the voting age to 16, prohibiting foreign financing of political associations, decreasing the workweek and workday hours, recognizing Venezuela's cultural diversity, promoting socialist economy, adding new property classifications, extending the presidential term, and stating the socioeconomic system of Venezuela. The proposed constitutional amendments by President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in November 2007 included changes such as extending the presidential term, lowering the voting age to 16, prohibiting foreign financing of political associations, and promoting a socialist economy. Other amendments aimed to eliminate the independence of the Central Bank and give the President power to suspend certain constitutional rights during a declared \"state of exception.\" The proposed constitutional amendments by President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in November 2007 included controversial changes such as extending the presidential term, increasing signature requirements for constitutional amendments, and allowing indefinite reelection. These reforms raised concerns about the president's potential to remain in power indefinitely. The proposed constitutional amendments by President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in November 2007 included controversial changes such as giving the state greater control over the economy, eliminating the independence of the Central Bank, and allowing the President to suspend certain rights during a state of emergency. These reforms also aimed to promote a \"socialist economy\" and \"socialist democracy.\" The proposed reforms by President Ch\u00e1vez in 2007 aimed to create new federal districts with autonomy, legal status for communal councils, and increased budget payments to states for financing communal councils. Councils of popular power would be established for citizen participation. The proposed constitutional reforms by President Ch\u00e1vez in 2007 included establishing councils of popular power for citizen participation, incorporating the missions as part of public administration, restructuring the military, and transforming the National Reserves into the National Bolivarian Militia. Despite initial optimism, the approval of the referendum was uncertain leading up to the vote. In the days leading up to the referendum in 2007, there was growing opposition to the constitutional reforms proposed by President Ch\u00e1vez. Various groups, including student organizations, business groups, and even some past supporters of Ch\u00e1vez, were against the reforms. Despite polls showing opposition gaining momentum, observers believed Ch\u00e1vez still had the support to mobilize his followers. However, on December 3, 2007, both blocks of the referendum were rejected by slim margins. President Ch\u00e1vez conceded defeat in a televised address. President Ch\u00e1vez conceded defeat in a televised address after the referendum in 2007 was rejected by slim margins. The large abstention of Venezuelans who previously supported Ch\u00e1vez played a key role in the failure of the reform effort, with about 56% of the electorate participating compared to almost 75% in the previous presidential election. Three million fewer voters supported the constitutional reform than voted for Ch\u00e1vez in 2006. In the 2007 referendum, President Ch\u00e1vez's reform effort was rejected due to a large abstention of his supporters, with concerns about the government's increasing radicalization. The Podemos Party, once supportive of Ch\u00e1vez, opposed the reforms, contributing to the No vote. The opposition of Podemos and key Chavistas, including Marisabel Rodriguez and General Ra\u00fal Baduel, played a significant role in the rejection of President Ch\u00e1vez's reform effort in the 2007 referendum. They opposed the reform, citing concerns about the concentration of absolute power and the potential for a coup d'etat. General Ra\u00fal Baduel, a close advisor to Ch\u00e1vez since 2002, opposed the constitutional reform proposal, criticizing the government's failure to address issues like crime, inflation, housing shortage, and education. Despite economic growth, high inflation and price controls on basic staples contributed to the rejection of the reform. Price controls on basic staples in Venezuela have led to product shortages and long lines due to dwindling domestic production. The overvalued currency and economic difficulties have raised questions about the government's management. The proposed constitutional changes have been strongly criticized by the political opposition, who fear it will extend President Ch\u00e1vez's power and move Venezuela towards Cuban-style totalitarianism. Opposition leader Manuel Rosales called the reforms a \"constitutional coup.\" The opposition criticized the proposed constitutional changes as a \"constitutional coup\" that would worsen shortages in Venezuela. The \"No\" campaign focused on the reforms, not Ch\u00e1vez himself, allowing supporters to oppose the reform without turning against the President. University students, who previously protested the closure of RCTV, led demonstrations against the reform and played a key role in defeating it. Students marched to the Supreme Court and organized a final demonstration with over 100,000 participants. The \"No\" campaign, led by university students, mobilized over 100,000 people in Caracas on November 29, 2007, playing a major role in defeating the constitutional reform effort. Students have historically been influential in political change in Venezuela, and the Catholic Church also criticized the reform for concentrating power in the hands of the President. In October 2007, Venezuelan bishops and human rights groups criticized the proposed constitutional reforms, stating that they would restrict liberties and represent a step backward in progress on human rights. Forum for Life, a coalition of Venezuelan human rights organizations, petitioned the Supreme Court to declare the reforms unconstitutional, citing concerns about the elimination of the right of information and due process. The Forum opposed the constitutional reform that would eliminate key rights during a state of emergency and remove the time limit on a state of exception. The rejection of the reform increased public confidence in the electoral process, with transparency in election results improving trust in Venezuela's ability to conduct fair elections. The rejection of the constitutional reform in Venezuela increased public confidence in the electoral process, despite criticism of the National Electoral Council (CNE) for delays in releasing vote results and allegations of bias towards the government during the campaign. Opposition parties saw the rejection as a victory against the Ch\u00e1vez government. The rejection of the constitutional reform in Venezuela was seen as a victory against the Ch\u00e1vez government at the ballot box. The margin was very slim, with just a small shift of votes potentially reversing the results. Observers suggest that the opposition will need to unify and work with former Ch\u00e1vez supporters to attract more electoral support. President Ch\u00e1vez attempted to unite his supporters into a single party, the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), and floated the idea of another constitutional reform amendment for re-election in December 2012. In 2008, the Venezuelan government nationalized key industries, including food companies, cement industry, and the country's largest steel maker. The nationalizations were justified by low production, labor disputes, and worker exploitation, but criticized as an attack on the private sector. In early June 2008, Ch\u00e1vez rescinded a decree criticized by human rights groups and legal scholars for its impact on citizens' rights. President Ch\u00e1vez's popularity declined in the first quarter of 2008 due to high crime rates, food shortages, and inflation. However, reports later showed that he regained some support, with popular support around 50% in August 2008. In August 2008, the Venezuelan government issued 26 presidential decrees covering various areas like tourism, railways, and social security. Controversial provisions included giving the President authority to appoint regional leaders, set up a civilian militia, and expropriate goods from private businesses. State and municipal elections in November 2008 resulted in mixed outcomes, with both pro-Ch\u00e1vez and opposition candidates claiming victory. In November 2008, pro-Ch\u00e1vez candidates won 17 out of 22 governor's races, while the opposition secured victories in Zulia, Miranda, and Carabobo. Pro-Ch\u00e1vez candidates also dominated over 80% of mayoral races, with the opposition winning in some areas. President Ch\u00e1vez's PSUV held primary elections in June 2008, criticized for lack of transparency, leading to protests. The opposition in Venezuela faced challenges in agreeing on a unified slate of candidates for governor races, including newer parties like Justice First and traditional parties like Democratic Action. The government disqualified hundreds of individuals from running for office, leading to legal challenges. The Venezuelan government faced challenges regarding disqualifications of candidates by the Supreme Court, including high-profile opposition figures like Leopoldo L\u00f3pez. President Ch\u00e1vez took radical actions before the election, such as expelling the U.S. Ambassador and strengthening military ties with Russia. President Ch\u00e1vez took radical actions before the election, such as expelling the U.S. Ambassador, strengthening military ties with Russia, and announcing plans to seek changes to the constitution to lift the two-term limit for the presidency. This move would allow him to run for re-election in 2012 and beyond, with a referendum expanding the amendment to apply to all elected government officials. The referendum on constitutional reform in Venezuela was held on February 15, 2009, with a participation rate of 70%. President Ch\u00e1vez gained ground in polls leading up to the vote, ultimately securing approval for the reform with almost 55% in favor and 45% against. Ch\u00e1vez declared the result a victory for the Bolivarian Revolution and hinted at running for re-election in 2012. The amendment was controversial due to a previous failed attempt in 2007 to remove the presidential two-term limit. Venezuela's opposition argued that President Ch\u00e1vez's attempt to extend the presidential term was illegal due to constitutional restrictions. Student groups played a key role in opposing the abolishment of term limits, leading to protests dispersed by security forces using tear gas and water cannons. President Ch\u00e1vez campaigned for a constitutional amendment to allow him to run for re-election until 2019, facing opposition from student groups, political parties, and some Catholic Church officials in Venezuela. He argued that the change would not guarantee his re-election or indefinite power, but rather ensure the continuity of his revolutionary project. President Ch\u00e1vez campaigned vigorously for a constitutional amendment to allow him to run for re-election until 2019, citing economic problems and the need for continuity of his revolutionary project. His support among poor Venezuelans, driven by increased social spending, was crucial in the vote. The amendment faced opposition from student groups, political parties, and some Catholic Church officials. The current National Assembly is dominated by Ch\u00e1vez supporters as the opposition boycotted the 2005 elections. If the opposition participates in the 2010 elections, an invigorated opposition could make it harder for the government to abolish term limits. In 2009, the Ch\u00e1vez government took actions against opposition leaders and concentrated power in the executive branch over state and local governments. In 2009, opposition leaders in Venezuela faced persecution by the Ch\u00e1vez government. Manuel Rosales fled to Peru to avoid corruption charges, while Antonio Ledezma, the mayor of Caracas, had his powers stripped and transferred to the central government. Ledezma went on a hunger strike to protest the government's actions against elected opposition leaders. Additionally, the Ch\u00e1vez government silenced other opponents. The Ch\u00e1vez government in Venezuela has targeted opposition leaders, including arresting a former Defense Minister on corruption charges and ousting military officers deemed disloyal. There are concerns about legislation tightening control over NGOs receiving foreign assistance, with fears of preventing critical groups from receiving support. Critics claim the judiciary is being used as a political tool against opponents, citing the imprisonment of business leader Eligio Cede\u00f1o. The Ch\u00e1vez government in Venezuela has targeted opposition leaders and threatened opposition media, including the imprisonment of business leader Eligio Cede\u00f1o. Globovision, a critical cable news station, has been accused of inciting panic and its owner, Guillermo Zuloaga, faced legal action unrelated to the station. Zuloaga asserts the charges are harassment, and he has been restricted from leaving the country. In July 2009, the Ch\u00e1vez government targeted 240 radio stations for license revocation due to outdated registration papers. Press rights groups criticize the government for expanding pro-government media and suppressing dissent. Concerns have been raised by human rights organizations and U.S. officials about the deterioration of democratic institutions and threats to freedom of speech and press in Venezuela under the Ch\u00e1vez government. The human rights situation in Venezuela under the Ch\u00e1vez government was characterized by politicization of the judiciary, harassment of the media and political opposition. Despite this, a 2008 poll showed 49% of Venezuelans were satisfied with democracy, although this was a 10% drop from the previous year. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights expressed concern about the deteriorating human rights situation in Venezuela. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights expressed concern about the deteriorating human rights situation in Venezuela, citing attacks on human rights defenders, threats on their lives, and obstacles to freedom of expression. Human Rights Watch criticized the Ch\u00e1vez government for undermining judicial independence by appointing supporters to the Supreme Court, leading to the dismissal of hundreds of judges. The Ch\u00e1vez government in Venezuela enacted laws to restrict news coverage critical of the government and broadened laws punishing disrespect for authorities. Human rights groups criticized these measures for limiting freedom of expression, leading to self-censorship by media outlets. Human Rights Watch reported setbacks in human rights protections under Ch\u00e1vez, including acts of repression by the government. The Venezuelan government under Ch\u00e1vez has engaged in discrimination against political opponents, restricted freedom of expression, violated freedom of association in the labor movement, and hindered human rights advocacy. The Human Rights Watch report recommends actions to promote a more inclusive democracy. In response, the government expelled two staff members of the organization, sparking condemnation from human rights groups in Latin America. In September 2008, 41 U.S. House members condemned President Ch\u00e1vez for expelling Human Rights Watch staff. The Due Process of Law Foundation criticized the imprisonment of police officials in November 2008, citing due process violations and judicial independence concerns. Human rights groups highlighted attacks on media before the November 2008 elections. Human rights groups have raised concerns about attacks on media and journalists critical of the Ch\u00e1vez government, including a shooting in Ciudad Bol\u00edvar and a tear-gas attack at Globovisi\u00f3n television headquarters in Caracas. Venezuelan security forces used force to break up student protests before the 2009 referendum on abolishing term limits. There was also an incident of vandalism at a synagogue in Caracas, condemned by President Ch\u00e1vez and other officials. Anti-Semitic vandalism and attacks on Jewish institutions have been on the rise in Venezuela. In 2007, Jewish leaders condemned an armed police raid on a Jewish center in Caracas in search of weapons. The Anti-Defamation League linked the 2009 synagogue attack to anti-Jewish intimidation by President Ch\u00e1vez. Members of Congress, including Eliot Engel, spoke out against the attack in a letter to President Ch\u00e1vez, expressing concern about the government's expulsion of the Jewish community. In early 2009, concerns were raised about the Ch\u00e1vez government's expulsion of the Israeli Ambassador and its close relationship with Iran. Members of Congress called on Ch\u00e1vez to end the harassment of the Jewish community and provide them with proper protection. Resolutions expressing concern about anti-Semitism in Venezuela were introduced in the 111th Congress. Additionally, the Ch\u00e1vez government took measures to suppress political opponents and critical media outlets in 2009. Venezuela was upgraded to the Tier 2 Watch List category in the State Department's 2008 and 2009 Trafficking in Persons Reports for making significant efforts to combat trafficking. However, it has not progressed further due to lack of evidence in convicting offenders and providing assistance to victims. Venezuela is a source, transit, and destination country for individuals trafficked for sexual exploitation. Venezuela is a source, transit, and destination country for individuals trafficked for sexual exploitation and forced labor. The report recommended amending laws to prohibit all forms of trafficking, intensifying efforts to investigate and prosecute offenders, providing services to victims, improving data collection, and designating a coordinator for anti-trafficking efforts. Venezuela's economy heavily relies on petroleum, accounting for one-third of its GDP and 80% of exports. Despite its oil wealth, economic conditions deteriorated in the 1990s, leading to an increase in poverty levels. Political instability and polarization in 2002-2003 further worsened the situation, resulting in a significant contraction of the national economy. The Venezuelan economy experienced a contraction in the early 2000s, with a significant decline in GDP in 2002 and 2003. However, from 2004 to 2007, fueled by high oil prices, the economy rebounded with strong growth rates. This growth allowed the Ch\u00e1vez government to implement economic goals aligned with his \"Bolivarian revolution,\" including nationalizing various industries and diversifying trade partners. Since 2003, Venezuela implemented social programs called missions, leading to a decline in poverty rates from 48.6% in 2002 to 28.5% in 2007. Despite economic growth, the country faced issues like food shortages and high inflation, reaching almost 19% in 2007 and over 30% in 2008. To combat inflation, a new currency, the bol\u00edvar fuerte, was introduced in January 2008. The introduction of the bol\u00edvar fuerte in Venezuela aimed to reduce inflation, but inflation rates continued to rise. Price controls led to shortages of basic staples like milk, sugar, and eggs in 2007. The government raised price caps on food items, nationalized dairy and food distribution companies, and incorporated them into PdVSA. Despite some improvements, shortages persisted in mid-2009. The global financial crisis and oil price drop further impacted the Venezuelan economy, leading to budget cuts and slowing economic growth in 2008. The Venezuelan government is facing economic challenges, with a forecasted contraction of 4.2% in 2009 and an inflation rate of 28%. To address the crisis, high salaries for officials are being reduced, and foreign reserves are expected to decrease. Despite the downturn, the government is using oil profits to maintain social spending and fight poverty. In 2003, the Ch\u00e1vez government implemented social programs called misiones, which were crucial for his reelection in 2006. The missions operate outside the state bureaucracy and are funded by the government's budget and PdVSA. Some suggest integrating them into existing ministries for better oversight. There are around 20 social missions in Venezuela covering various services. The Misi\u00f3n Robinson, Misi\u00f3n Robinson 2, Misi\u00f3n Ribas, and Misi\u00f3n Sucre are part of Venezuela's social programs aimed at education and providing opportunities for literacy, primary school education, and secondary education for adults. Over 1.5 million Venezuelans have learned to read and write through these programs since 2003. The Misi\u00f3n Barrio Adentro provides free healthcare in marginalized areas with Cuban medical personnel, gradually being replaced by Venezuelan doctors. Thousands of Cuban medical personnel have left, resulting in clinic closures. The Misi\u00f3n Barrio Adentro provides free healthcare in marginalized areas with Cuban medical personnel, gradually being replaced by Venezuelan doctors. A related health mission, the Misi\u00f3n Milagro, offers free eye care clinics and surgery. Another mission, Misi\u00f3n Mercal, ensures poor Venezuelans have access to staple food at subsidized prices through state-run supermarkets and soup kitchens. The Mercal Mission in Venezuela delivers meals to those in extreme poverty, benefiting over 9.5 million people. It is praised for its holistic approach to poverty reduction, seen as an effective alternative to cash transfers. Critics argue that it creates dependency on the state and fails to address the root causes of poverty. Some critics argue that Venezuela's missions create dependency on the state among the poor without providing long-term solutions to poverty. There are concerns about the sustainability of the missions due to their reliance on oil revenues. Tensions between the United States and Venezuela have escalated, with accusations of U.S. involvement in President Ch\u00e1vez's brief ouster in 2002. U.S. officials have also raised concerns about human rights and Venezuela's military arms purchases. Since 2006, the U.S. has prohibited defense sales to Venezuela due to lack of cooperation on antiterrorism efforts. Concerns include Venezuela's military arms purchases, relations with Cuba and Iran, and efforts to export populism. Tensions rose after Colombia's 2008 bombing of a FARC camp in Ecuador, potentially linking Venezuela to supporting the FARC. President Ch\u00e1vez later urged the FARC to end armed struggle. In the 2002-2006 period, Venezuelan officials contributed to tensions in U.S. relations, but the tone changed in the second half of 2006. Despite President Ch\u00e1vez's disparaging remarks towards President Bush, U.S. officials refrained from responding. In 2008, U.S. policy towards Venezuela focused on avoiding conflicts with Ch\u00e1vez and promoting a positive agenda for the hemisphere. Assistant Secretary of State Tom Shannon reaffirmed this commitment in July 2008. In July 2008, Assistant Secretary of State Tom Shannon expressed commitment to a positive relationship with Venezuela and willingness to explore improved relations. However, by September 2008, relations deteriorated as Venezuela expelled the U.S. Ambassador and U.S. officials criticized Venezuela's efforts against drug trafficking. President Bush determined that Venezuela had failed to adhere to its international obligations. The U.S. Treasury Department froze assets of Venezuelan officials for aiding FARC. An agreement was reached in 2009 for the return of ambassadors, but concerns remain about Venezuela's treatment of media and political opposition. Relations between the U.S. and Venezuela worsened in 2005 due to increasing concerns about President Ch\u00e1vez. In 2005, tensions escalated in U.S.-Venezuelan relations due to concerns about President Ch\u00e1vez's power consolidation, arms purchases, and relationships with destabilizing forces in the region. The U.S. expressed worries about Venezuela's military acquisitions from Russia and Spain, as well as the cancellation of a bilateral military exchange program. In April 2005, Venezuela canceled a U.S.-Venezuelan military exchange program, leading to increased tensions.

President Bush later designated Venezuela as a country that failed to adhere to international counternarcotics agreements. Additionally, the President waived economic sanctions on Venezuela for democracy programs. TV evangelist Pat Robertson's comments about assassinating Ch\u00e1vez caused controversy, with the State Department labeling them as \"inappropriate.\" Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Shannon highlighted a growing consensus on democracy in the region. Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Shannon highlighted the international consensus on the threat to democracy in Venezuela and the US's efforts to support Venezuelan civil society. Venezuelan President Ch\u00e1vez responded with harsh rhetoric towards President Bush. The US reacted cautiously to the Venezuelan elections in December 2005, waiting for reports from OAS and EU observers. The State Department pointed to high voter abstention rates in the December legislative election in Venezuela, indicating a lack of confidence in the electoral process. US-Venezuelan relations remained tense in 2006, with incidents and rhetoric exacerbating the situation. President Ch\u00e1vez and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld exchanged comparisons to Hitler, with Ch\u00e1vez also accusing President Bush of planning to invade Venezuela. In February 2006, tensions between the United States and Venezuela escalated with mutual expulsions of diplomats.

The International Atomic Energy Agency opposed reporting Iran to the U.N. Security Council over its uranium enrichment program. Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte raised concerns about President Ch\u00e1vez seeking closer ties with Iran and North Korea. The State Department issued reports on Venezuela's lack of cooperation in the global war on terror, tolerating terrorists and seeking relations with Cuba and Iran. In response, the State Department prohibited the sale of defense articles and services to Venezuela under Section 40A of the Arms Export Control Act. The State Department criticized Venezuela for lack of antiterrorism cooperation, citing support for Iraqi insurgents, Iran's nuclear capabilities, and harboring terrorist groups. They also raised concerns about easy access to Venezuelan travel documents for non-entitled individuals. Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte announced the establishment of a new position in August 2006. Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte established the Mission Manager for Cuba and Venezuela to coordinate intelligence efforts on the two countries. Venezuelan officials threatened to reconsider an anti-drug cooperation agreement following President Ch\u00e1vez's strong criticism of U.S. foreign policy at the U.N. General Assembly. Ch\u00e1vez referred to President Bush as the \"Devil\" and condemned U.S. imperialism. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice criticized Ch\u00e1vez's remarks. President Ch\u00e1vez's remarks at the U.N. were criticized by U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Ambassador John Bolton. Ch\u00e1vez has a history of speaking disparagingly of President Bush and U.S. officials. U.S. officials have focused on criticizing Ch\u00e1vez's policies rather than responding to personal attacks. Several Members of Congress criticized President Ch\u00e1vez for his anti-American rhetoric and military purchases, with resolutions condemning his statements. State Department officials initially looked forward to working with Venezuela post-reelection, but later emphasized threats to democracy in the country. In 2007, U.S. officials expressed concerns about President Ch\u00e1vez's anti-American stance, military buildup, and threats to democracy in Venezuela. Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice highlighted Ch\u00e1vez's efforts to undermine U.S. influence and democracy in the region. They also raised alarm about Venezuela's military purchases and weapons production capabilities potentially sparking an arms race. Venezuelan President Ch\u00e1vez criticized the U.S. and President Bush during a rally in Argentina in March 2007. U.S. officials avoided engaging in a verbal battle with Ch\u00e1vez and focused on positive engagement in Latin America. President Bush's visit to the region was seen as a response to Ch\u00e1vez's growing influence in Latin America. In response to the Venezuelan government's closure of RCTV in 2007, the State Department called for a reversal of policies limiting freedom of expression. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice raised the issue at the OAS General Assembly Meeting, urging member states to respect freedom of expression. Following the rejection of President Ch\u00e1vez's proposed constitutional changes, President Bush and Under Secretary of State Nicholas Burns praised the Venezuelan people for choosing democracy. In testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in February 2008, Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell stated that the defeat of the constitutional referendum in December 2007 may slow President Ch\u00e1vez's movement towards authoritarian rule and socialism in Venezuela. McConnell noted Ch\u00e1vez's ambitions to unite Latin America against the U.S. and his growing relations with Iran and arms purchases from Russia, causing anxiety among Venezuela's neighbors. President Ch\u00e1vez also threatened to stop oil exports on February 10, 2008. President Ch\u00e1vez threatened to stop oil exports to the United States if ExxonMobil froze Venezuela's oil assets. Documents from laptops captured by Colombian forces suggested Venezuela's involvement in arming the FARC, leading to calls for the Bush Administration to designate Venezuela as a state sponsor of terrorism. An inquiry was initiated on this matter. President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez denied accusations of channeling $300 million to the FARC. In a shift in policy, he called for the FARC to disarm and expressed willingness to cooperate with the United States on drug trafficking. This change was noted by Assistant Secretary of State Tom Shannon in congressional testimony. In September 2008, U.S. relations with Venezuela worsened as Venezuela expelled U.S. Ambassador Patrick Duddy over an alleged assassination plot. President Ch\u00e1vez also recalled the Venezuelan Ambassador to the U.S., leading to diplomatic tensions between the two countries.

The U.S. Treasury Department froze assets of Venezuelan officials for aiding the FARC. President Bush criticized Venezuela for not complying with international narcotics control agreements. Barack Obama pledged to engage with Venezuela under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez through principled diplomacy. Senator Hillary Clinton described Ch\u00e1vez as a democratically elected leader during her confirmation hearing for Secretary of State. Clinton characterized President Ch\u00e1vez as a democratically elected leader who does not govern democratically. She emphasized the need for a positive agenda in response to fear-mongering by Ch\u00e1vez and Evo Morales. The Administration believes in bilateral cooperation with Venezuela on various issues, but questions if Venezuela truly wants to improve relations with the United States. President Obama also expressed concerns about Ch\u00e1vez impeding progress. President Ch\u00e1vez criticized Obama for impeding progress in the region and assisting the FARC. Despite the criticism, Ch\u00e1vez expressed interest in restoring bilateral relations to the level of the Clinton Administration. At the fifth Summit of the Americas, Obama met with Ch\u00e1vez and other leaders, leading to the exchange of diplomatic notes and the return of respective ambassadors between the U.S. and Venezuela in June 2009.

The United States has provided funding for democracy projects in Venezuela through various programs, with recent amounts ranging from $2 million to $5 million annually. Projects are implemented by U.S. organizations focusing on dialogue, citizen participation, political party assistance, human rights support, and civil society development. In recent years, funding for democracy projects in Venezuela has ranged from $1.497 million to $6.5 million annually. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) has increased funding for projects in Venezuela since 1992, with amounts reaching $902,000 in FY2005. Additionally, the FY2006 Foreign Operations appropriations measure provided $2 million for democracy programs in Venezuela. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) funded 17 projects in Venezuela in FY2007 with over $800,000 and 18 projects in FY2008 with over $1 million. Critics have raised concerns about NED funding opposition groups involved in events like the 2002 overthrow of Ch\u00e1vez and the 2004 recall referendum campaign. U.S. officials and some Members of Congress defended NED's activities in Venezuela, criticizing the Venezuelan government's intimidation of opposition leaders. The State Department denies charges against the government in Venezuela, calling them an attempt to intimidate civil society. The NED's program in Venezuela focuses on promoting citizen participation, civil rights, freedom of expression, and conflict mediation. NED-funded programs operate on a non-partisan basis, with grants used for citizen campaigns and education on the constitutional referendum process. NED officials clarify they did not fund the Democratic Coordinator's platform development. The NED funded a consensus building project in Venezuela in 2002 with CIPE and CEDICE. In 2005, a grant was approved for S\u00famate to train people on electoral rights. A comprehensive report on NED's activities in Venezuela was required due to controversy. The reporting requirement for NED-funded activities in Venezuela was first included in the FY2005 Commerce, Justice, and State Appropriations bill. Venezuela is a major supplier of foreign oil to the United States, with 68% of its oil exports destined for the U.S. market. In 2007, Venezuela's total exports to the U.S. were $39.9 billion, with oil products accounting for almost 96% of the total. The December 2002 strike orchestrated by the opposition reduced Venezuela's oil exports. The December 2002 strike orchestrated by the opposition reduced Venezuela's oil exports, but production returned to pre-strike levels by May 2003. The rise in world oil prices benefited the Ch\u00e1vez government, leading to increased government revenues and funding for social programs. A tax on foreign oil companies was approved in April 2008, based on the price of crude oil. The government's revenue has decreased due to the decline in oil prices since 2008. Under President Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela increased control over its oil reserves by converting operating agreements with foreign companies to joint ventures, with the government holding majority shares. In 2007, strategic associations involving extra-heavy oil projects saw foreign companies like ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil leaving, while others like Chevron and BP maintained investments. Total, Statoil-Hydro, and Eni signed agreements for potential additional investments. Total, Eni, and other state-owned oil companies have signed agreements for investments in the Orinoco Belt projects. Critics suggest that state ownership has hindered foreign investment and production recovery. PdVSA aims to increase output to 3.5 million barrels a day, but there are doubts about its readiness to take over. Venezuela, a major oil supplier to the United States, has faced tensions with the U.S. government. President Ch\u00e1vez has threatened to stop selling oil to the U.S. on multiple occasions, including warnings of blowing up oil fields and halting oil exports. Despite these threats, Venezuela continues to be a significant oil provider to the United States. Venezuela has threatened to stop oil exports to the U.S. if there is a new coup, elections are not recognized, or the oil industry is overthrown. President Ch\u00e1vez's threats are seen as a way to boost domestic support. Despite these warnings, Venezuela remains a key oil supplier to the United States. Venezuela's President Ch\u00e1vez has threatened to halt oil exports to the U.S. if there is political instability or threats to the oil industry. This has raised concerns about Venezuela's reliability as a major oil supplier. A report by the Government Accountability Office warned that a sudden loss of Venezuelan oil could raise world prices and impact the U.S. economy significantly. The report warned that a sudden loss of Venezuelan oil could impact the U.S. economy significantly. Venezuela suspended cooperation with the U.S. DEA due to alleged spying, leading to tensions between the two countries. President Bush designated Venezuela as a country failing to adhere to international narcotics agreements from 2005 to 2008. President Bush designated Venezuela as a country failing to adhere to international narcotics agreements, but waived economic sanctions on U.S. assistance for democracy programs. The U.S. and Venezuela were close to signing an anti-drug cooperation agreement, but Venezuelan officials reconsidered after the U.S. announced a new position for Cuba and Venezuela. The Bush Administration determined that Venezuela had \"failed demonstrably\" in counternarcotics efforts due to the DEA's uncertain status in the country. The House approved a resolution condemning Venezuela's lack of cooperation with the DEA and called for measures to restore collaboration. In 2008, Venezuela began taking action against drug trafficking by destroying airstrips and tracking smuggling planes. Venezuelan officials claim to have destroyed over 200 illegal landing strips and are cooperating with other countries, including Colombia, in combating drug trafficking. They are setting up a radar system purchased from China to monitor suspected drug flights. President Ch\u00e1vez expressed a desire to reopen cooperation with the United States on drug trafficking. U.S. officials criticized Venezuelan antidrug efforts in August and September 2008. In August and September 2008, U.S. officials criticized Venezuelan antidrug efforts, claiming the country played a leading role in drug trafficking in the Western Hemisphere. The White House reported a tenfold increase in drug flights leaving Venezuela from 2002 to 2007. President Bush waived sanctions despite Venezuela's failure to adhere to international narcotics control agreements. The State Department noted continued growth in drug trafficking to the United States and Europe, despite Venezuelan assurances of increased seizures. Venezuela's refusal to renew counternarcotics cooperation agreements with the United States has led to a halt in U.S. assistance since FY2008. The State Department highlighted Venezuela as a preferred route for trafficking illicit narcotics due to a permissive and corrupt environment. The annual flow of narcotics trafficking through Venezuela has increased fivefold since 2002, reaching an estimated 250 metric tons in 2007. Venezuela reported seizing 54 metric tons of cocaine in 2008, but the United States could not confirm these seizures. Venezuela's corruption problem has worsened due to drug transit, leading to increased crime and violence in the country. Cooperation between Venezuela and the U.S. on counternarcotics has been almost entirely eliminated. Venezuela's cooperation with the U.S. on counternarcotics has significantly decreased, with Venezuela refusing to sign an anti-drug agreement and ending participation in UNODC programs funded by the U.S. They have also not made the U.S.-funded Container Inspection Facility operational. However, Venezuela still allows the U.S. government to board Venezuelan flagged vessels suspected of narcotics trafficking. The State Department is prepared to renew cooperation with Venezuela to combat the increasing flow of illegal drugs. The U.S. is prepared to renew cooperation with Venezuela to combat illegal drug trafficking. Venezuela has been accused of supporting Colombian armed groups and having high levels of corruption within its government and security forces. The lack of Venezuelan counternarcotics cooperation is a significant impediment to U.S. drug interdiction efforts. Concerns have been raised about Venezuela's military equipment purchases, with the Defense Intelligence Agency expressing worry about their increased capability for defense and regional operations. The U.S. is willing to engage in greater technical cooperation if Venezuela allows it. In January 2006, the United States denied licenses for the transfer of U.S. technology for military transport planes sold by Spanish companies to Venezuela, citing concerns about destabilization in Latin America. Spain initially planned to proceed with non-U.S. technology but later canceled the deal due to economic infeasibility. Venezuela labeled the U.S. action as \"imperialist\" and expressed interest in purchasing light-attack aircraft from Brazil. The State Department prohibited the sale of defense articles and services to Venezuela due to lack of cooperation in U.S. antiterrorism efforts. Concerns were raised about President Ch\u00e1vez's military purchases and weapons production capability, which could lead to an arms race in the region. In February 5, 2008, then DNI Michael McConnell expressed concerns about Venezuela's arms purchases from Russia, noting anxiety among its neighbors. McConnell stated that Venezuela's military build-up is excessive for external defense. DIA Director Maples mentioned the potential use of rifles for asymmetric capabilities. Venezuela's President Ch\u00e1vez has spent $5.3 billion on military purchases since 2005, focusing on acquiring equipment from Russia due to the US refusal to sell spare parts for its aging F-16 fleet. The purchases include fighter jets, helicopters, assault rifles, and submarines to bolster the country's defense capabilities. Venezuela has made significant military purchases from Russia since the 1980s, including transport planes, tanks, submarines, and an air defense missile system. In 2008, Russia announced a $1 billion loan to Venezuela for arms purchases. Concerns were raised in 2009 about Venezuela's excessive arms acquisitions, particularly the purchase of shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles from Russia. Sweden requested an explanation from Venezuela regarding Swedish-made anti-tank rocket launchers found in possession of the Colombian FARC, which Venezuela denied involvement with. The Ch\u00e1vez government has focused on countering U.S. influence in Latin America by supporting anti-U.S. and leftist agendas. Concerns have been raised about Ch\u00e1vez exporting his populist ideology to other countries in the region, particularly through his support for Bolivia's President Evo Morales. President Evo Morales received assistance from President Ch\u00e1vez to re-write Bolivia's constitution and implement radical economic reforms. Ch\u00e1vez openly supported a nationalist candidate in Peru's 2006 elections, causing concern for U.S. ally President Alan Garcia. Venezuela also had close ties with Nicaragua and Ecuador under different presidencies. Ch\u00e1vez launched the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA) in 2004, advocating for a socially oriented trade block with a focus on poverty reduction and cooperation in various areas. ALBA, a trade block focusing on poverty reduction and cooperation in various areas, was launched in 2004 by Venezuela and Cuba. By 2009, nine countries in the region had joined ALBA, including Bolivia, Nicaragua, Dominica, Honduras, Ecuador, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Antigua and Barbuda. In 2007, Venezuela and six other South American countries signed the founding act of a new Bank of the South, with a start-up capital of $7 billion largely from Brazil and Venezuela. President Ch\u00e1vez aimed to provide development financing separate from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Since 2005, President Ch\u00e1vez has used \"oil diplomacy\" to provide oil to Caribbean Basin nations on preferential terms through PetroCaribe. Venezuela initially offered 190,000 barrels per day with 50% financed over 25 years at 1% interest. At a 2008 summit, Ch\u00e1vez announced up to 60% financing if oil prices were over $100 a barrel, increasing to 70% if prices exceeded $150. Most Caribbean nations are members, except Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago. Cuba receives over 90,000 barrels per day. In Central America, Nicaragua and Honduras joined PetroCaribe in 2007. Venezuela's \"oil diplomacy\" through PetroCaribe provides preferential oil terms to Caribbean Basin nations. Central American countries like Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala have joined the program. Venezuela is also investing in energy sectors in Latin American countries, such as pledging $1.5 billion in Bolivia's gas industry and signing agreements with Ecuador for joint development in oil, gas, refining, and petrochemical sectors. Additionally, agreements have been made for the construction of an oil refinery in Brazil supplied by both Brazil and Venezuela. Colombia and Venezuela have initiated a gas pipeline project. In July 2006, Venezuela signed agreements with Colombia for a gas pipeline project and with Argentina for cooperation on hydrocarbon exploration. Venezuela also worked on oil projects in Cuba and faced legal issues in the US related to foreign activities. The Venezuelan government was involved in a scheme to conceal the source and destination of $800,000 intended for the presidential campaign of Argentine President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. High-level Venezuelan officials, including from the Office of the Vice President and the Intelligence and Preventative Services Directorate, were implicated. Four defendants were charged, with three pleading guilty and one being convicted and sentenced to four years in prison. Antonio Jos\u00e9 Canchica Gomez, a Venezuelan intelligence official, remains at large. In November 2008, Duran was convicted and sentenced to four years. Colombian President Uribe authorized negotiations with FARC to release high-profile hostages, including American defense contractors held since 2003. Despite Uribe withdrawing support, Chavez continued efforts to release hostages. In January 2008, FARC released two Colombians to Venezuelan officials. Chavez called for international support after their release. On February 27, 2008, the FARC released four former members of the Colombian Congress to Venezuelan officials in Colombian territory. On March 7, 2008, the Venezuelan government received \"proofs of life\" for 10 Colombian soldiers held by the FARC. Despite his efforts in hostage releases, Chavez's role became unclear after the Ecuador-Colombia border crisis. In July 2008, the Colombian military rescued American hostages, including Ingrid Betancourt. Over 700 hostages are still held by the FARC. Venezuela escalated tensions with Colombia after a FARC camp bombing in Ecuador in 2008. President Ch\u00e1vez warned against incursions into Venezuelan territory, mobilized troops, and threatened to send fighter jets. Analysts doubted the seriousness of the threat due to Venezuela's limited military capabilities. Venezuela's military, with 115,000 troops, is overshadowed by Colombia's 254,000 troops experienced in combat. There were doubts about the accuracy of Ch\u00e1vez's troop movements. Despite this, Ch\u00e1vez played a crucial role in resolving the crisis at the Rio Group summit, with OAS Secretary General Insulza praising his constructive contribution. Ch\u00e1vez emphasized the need for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, calling for negotiations instead of military action. Venezuela announced diplomatic ties with Colombia and withdrew troops, resolving conflict. US concerns include lack of antiterrorism cooperation, ties with Cuba and Iran, and Ch\u00e1vez's support for Colombian terrorist groups. Arms embargo imposed since 2006 due to lack of cooperation. The US expressed concerns about Venezuela's lack of antiterrorism cooperation, citing support for Colombian and Basque terrorist groups. Despite initial tensions, President Ch\u00e1vez changed course in 2008, calling for the release of hostages and detaining a senior FARC official. In September 2008, the Treasury Department froze assets of Venezuelan officials for allegedly aiding FARC with weapons and drug trafficking. Venezuelan officials denied the allegations despite evidence from captured computer files. In June 2008, individuals were arrested in Colombia for gun-running to FARC. In April 2009, the State Department reported that Venezuelan territory was used by FARC, ELN, and AUC for rest, regrouping, and criminal activities. Venezuela failed to police its border with Colombia, allowing armed groups and narcotics to flow freely. Venezuelan weapons and ammunition ended up with Colombian terrorist groups, raising concerns about Venezuela's support for illegal activities. The Swedish government questioned Venezuela about Swedish-made anti-tank rocket launchers in FARC's possession. The terrorism report highlighted concerns about Venezuela's lax immigration controls and ties to Iran, including potential support for Hezbollah. Venezuela's easy access to citizenship and travel documents raised worries about it being a transit point for terrorists. Additionally, the country's connections to Iran, particularly under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, raised alarms due to Iran's links to Hezbollah and its involvement in the 1994 Buenos Aires bombing. In 2008, the US Treasury froze assets of two Venezuelans for supporting Hezbollah. In 2008, concerns were raised about Venezuela's ties to Iran and potential support for Hezbollah. The US considered designating Venezuela as a state sponsor of terrorism, but no official designation was made. Additionally, in the same year, a resolution was introduced in Congress urging the Administration to designate Venezuela as such. In 2008, concerns were raised about Venezuela's ties to Iran and potential support for Hezbollah. A resolution was introduced in Congress urging the Administration to designate Venezuela as a state sponsor of terrorism. The EAA requires a validated license for the export of goods to countries on the terrorism list. Additional sanctions include a ban on arms-related exports and sales, restrictions on foreign assistance, and denial of duty-free treatment of goods exported to the US. The potential designation of Venezuela as a state sponsor of terrorism could impact U.S.-Venezuelan economic relations, particularly in the oil sector. Sanctions would include the denial of tax credits for income earned in terrorist-listed countries and the need for validated licenses for exports to Venezuela. This could increase costs for U.S. companies operating in Venezuela and potentially deter some from doing business there. U.S. foreign investment in Venezuela is estimated at $11.6 billion, mainly in manufacturing and mining. The potential designation of Venezuela as a state sponsor of terrorism could complicate U.S. oil imports from Venezuela, as PdVSA owns Citgo, which operates oil refineries in the United States. The designation could also increase popular support for President Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela. Some observers suggest targeted sanctions on Venezuelan officials to show U.S. concern for their alleged support of the FARC. Venezuela's relations with Iran have raised concerns among U.S. officials and Congress. The House approved H.Res. 435 expressing concern about Iran's influence in Latin America and Venezuela's cooperation with Iran. President Ahmadinejad and President Ch\u00e1vez have strengthened bilateral ties through various agreements in agriculture, petrochemicals, and oil exploration. Military cooperation between Iran and Venezuela is also growing. The U.S. imposed sanctions on an Iranian-owned bank in Venezuela for supporting weapons proliferation. Ch\u00e1vez and Ahmadinejad inaugurated a new development bank with $100 million from each country. Venezuela has played a key role in Iran's relations with the region. Iran's expanding relations with Latin America have been facilitated by Venezuela, acting as a bridge for Iran to connect with countries like Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua. Despite promises of assistance and investment from Iran, there is little evidence of these materializing in the form of projects like a deep-water port in Nicaragua. Iran's outreach to Latin America is seen as a way to counter its diplomatic isolation. Iran's increased interest in Latin America, particularly with Venezuela, is seen as a way to develop leverage against the United States. Concerns have been raised about Iran's ties to Hezbollah and its history of activities in the region. The U.S. Treasury Department froze the assets of two Venezuelans for their involvement with Iran. Nasr al Din and Fawzi Kan'an, Venezuelans accused of supporting Hezbollah, are prohibited from engaging in transactions with U.S. citizens. Admiral Stavridis highlighted concerns about Iran's ties to Hezbollah in Latin America, specifically in the tri-border area. Venezuela sought extradition of its citizens from the U.S. in terrorism cases. The extradition of two former Venezuelan National Guard lieutenants, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Colina and German Rodolfo Varela, charged with the 2003 bombings in Caracas. They applied for political asylum but were denied due to suspicions of involvement in the bombings. The Department of Homeland Security sought to deport them, citing the treatment of a former general in a similar case. In late December 2005, Colina and Varela were transferred to Houston for medical treatment after a hunger strike in protest of their U.S. immigration detention. ICE reversed its stance on their deportation case in April 2006, following a joint motion with their attorneys to dismiss the case. The State Department's human rights report on Venezuela was cited as a factor in ICE's decision. The Venezuelan government condemned their release. The Venezuelan government condemned the release of Colina and Varela, labeling the United States as a \"sanctuary for terrorists.\" Venezuela also sought the extradition of anti-Castro activist Luis Posada Carriles for his alleged involvement in the 1976 bombing of a Cuban airliner. Posada entered the US illegally from Mexico and applied for asylum, citing persecution for his opposition to Fidel Castro. He had been imprisoned in Venezuela for the bombing but escaped in 1985. Posada was acquitted but remained in prison pending an appeal. He also allegedly admitted to bombings in Havana in 1997. Luis Posada Carriles denied involvement in bombings in Havana in 1997 and was imprisoned in Panama for a plot to kill Fidel Castro. He was pardoned in 2004 but arrested in 2005 for illegally entering the US. Despite Venezuela's pledge not to hand him over to Cuba, a US immigration judge ruled he could not be deported to Venezuela due to torture concerns. ICE decided in 2006 that Posada would not be released from a federal immigration facility in El Paso. On March 22, 2006, a federal judge in El Paso, Texas, decided not to release Luis Posada Carriles from an immigration facility. In January 2007, he was indicted on seven counts for lying about entering the US illegally in 2005. Posada was later released from jail in New Mexico in April 2007 but faced immigration fraud charges. The charges were dismissed in May 2007 due to mistranslated testimony and manipulated evidence. Posada faced manipulated evidence and was indicted again in 2009 for lying about his involvement in bombings in Havana. Venezuela and Cuba denounced his release, calling him a terrorist. Venezuela requested his extradition, but the State Department ignored it. The Senate approved S.Amdt. 1536 (Martinez) to the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010, requiring a report on Venezuela's weapons purchases and uranium transfers. Posada's trial was rescheduled to February 2010 for his defense preparation. He is also under investigation for the 1997 bombings in Cuba. The Senate approved a report on Venezuela's involvement in nuclear proliferation, support for FARC and Hezbollah, deployment of security personnel to Bolivia, and clandestine support for political movements in the Western Hemisphere. The 111th Congress introduced resolutions and bills related to Venezuela, including H.R. 375 which aimed to restrict nuclear cooperation with countries assisting Venezuela's nuclear programs and authorize the President to impose foreign aid and export controls on countries engaged in military cooperation.

H.Res. 174 acknowledged the growing threat of anti-Semitism in South America, including Venezuela, Bolivia, and Argentina. H.Con.Res. 124 expressed support for the Jewish community in Venezuela, condemning anti-Semitic acts and urging the government to ensure their safety.

Additionally, there were oversight hearings and legislative actions on Venezuela in the 109th Congress, including appropriations for democracy programs and funding under the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. In FY2007, funding under the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) for Venezuela was slightly reduced due to a 1% rescission in Defense Department appropriations. The Administration requested $500,000 in Economic Support Funds (ESF) for Venezuela, but no specific earmark was provided, and the assistance was not allocated. The Administration also requested $1 million in ACI funding, $1.5 million in ESF for democracy initiatives, and $45,000 for International Military Education and Training (IMET) for FY2007. The House-passed bill did not provide ACI funding for Venezuela, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended fully funding the Administration's requests.
