    "content": "The \"Grace Period Restoration Act of 2015\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings and purposes. The \"Grace Period Restoration Act of 2015\" finds that the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act has created uncertainty about the 1-year grace period for inventors to decide on filing a patent application. The Act also states that the regulatory reading of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act does not align with the sponsors' intent. The \"Grace Period Restoration Act of 2015\" acknowledges the challenges faced by institutions of higher education and government laboratories in gaining and utilizing patent rights under the Bayh-Dole Act. Uncertainty surrounding the grace period created by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act hinders job growth, start-up companies, and small businesses, impacting the economy. The ambiguity and uncertainty in statutory text and government regulations lead to abusive and expensive patent litigation, discouraging scientific research publication and delaying the public's access to scientific advances. This also increases the risk of misappropriation of disclosed inventions, especially in countries taking advantage of the United States' technological prowess. The secrecy surrounding the United States patent system is detrimental to promoting scientific progress and compensating inventors. The grace period before the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act was considered the gold standard of best practices by David J. Kappos. The purposes of this Act are to correct the drafting problem in the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act related to the grace period and to maintain the United States' leadership in educational, technological, and scientific progress. SEC. 3. DISCLOSURES FOLLOWING A PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF A CLAIMED INVENTION BY AN INVENTOR. Section 102(b) of title 35, United States Code, is amended to include disclosures by any person after public disclosure of a claimed invention by an inventor. This applies to the inventor, joint inventor, or anyone who obtained the invention from them, and defines the relevant section 112(a) requirements. The disclosure by any person shall not be prior art to a claimed invention under subsection (a) or section 103 if made or filed within 1 year before the effective filing date of the claimed invention, as per section 112(a) requirements. The claimed invention must be publicly disclosed in a printed publication by a covered person to satisfy section 112(a) requirements. The disclosure must consider only the state of the art known before the date of disclosure. Satisfaction of section 112(a) requirements may vary. The 112(a) requirements for a claimed invention can be established by public disclosures in printed publications made by a covered person within a year before the effective filing date, supported by statements under declaration or oath. The applicant must present all disclosures and statements related to the claimed invention before the Patent Office issues a notice of allowance for the patent, to establish the presumption of validity under section 282(a). The Patent and Trademark Office may establish procedures for disclosures that are not prior art to a claimed invention under this paragraph. The amendments made by this Act will be effective as if they were part of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act."
