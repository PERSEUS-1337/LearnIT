    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program is created to fund capital improvements for California's rail and transit systems to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, expand transit service, integrate rail operators, and improve safety. The Transportation Agency will evaluate applications and approve a program of projects for funding. The California Transportation Commission allocates funding for transformative capital improvements in rail, bus, or ferry transit projects to reduce vehicle miles traveled, congestion, and greenhouse gas emissions. Eligible projects include rail capital projects that expand and enhance existing rail systems, including the high-speed rail system. The California Transportation Commission allocates funding for rail, bus, and ferry projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Eligible projects include rail expansions, bus rapid transit, and integration initiatives. Projects must demonstrate emission reductions to be considered for funding. The program aims to allocate 25% of funding to projects benefiting disadvantaged communities. Grant applications will be evaluated based on cobenefits supporting sustainable communities strategies such as reducing vehicle miles traveled, promoting housing near transit centers, expanding transit systems, and implementing clean vehicle technology. The project priorities include implementing clean vehicle technology, promoting active transportation, improving public health, ensuring geographic equity, aligning with sustainable communities strategies, securing supplemental funding from nonstate sources, and increasing transit ridership. The program aims to increase transit ridership by providing funding to public agencies operating intercity or commuter rail, urban rail transit, bus, or ferry services. Recipients can combine program funds with other state funding sources. Applications for grants under the program must be submitted to the Transportation Agency for evaluation following approved procedures and guidelines. Eligible applicants can request multiyear funding commitments for projects, defining project details, costs, funding sources, and completion schedules in their applications. Phases of work seeking funding from the program must be specified in the application. The application for grants must identify funding sources and timing for project phases, including ongoing operating costs. Eligible applicants can submit multiple grant applications. An eligible applicant can use a project study report to demonstrate project eligibility for the multiyear program of projects. The report must define and justify project scope, cost, and schedule. The Transportation Agency must conduct public workshops on draft program guidelines before approval and post them on their website at least 30 days prior to the first workshop. The Administrative Procedure Act does not apply to the development and approval of procedures and program guidelines for the program. The Transportation Agency must approve a program of projects covering five fiscal years by July 1, 2018, and subsequent programs by April 1 of each even-numbered year, outlining the allocation and expenditure of funds. The Transportation Agency must maximize greenhouse gas emission reductions in the program of projects. Multiyear funding agreements can be entered into for projects funded over multiple fiscal years. Section 75225 is added to the Public Resources Code. Section 75225 of the Public Resources Code allows lead applicant agencies to apply for a letter of no prejudice from the commission for project funding. If approved, the agency can use its own funds for the project and be eligible for reimbursement from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The state will reimburse the agency if specific conditions are met and the project has commenced. The lead applicant agency must comply with legal requirements, including the California Environmental Quality Act, for project funding from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Reimbursement is dependent on the availability of funds and a formal agreement between the agency and the commission. The commission may develop guidelines to implement this section in consultation with public transit entities."
