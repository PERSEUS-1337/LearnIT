    "content": "In 2008, oil prices doubled, reaching record levels before falling below $40 per barrel. The 110th Congress proposed legislative initiatives to increase domestic oil production by opening areas of the Outer Continental Shelf and encouraging companies to develop leases. Proponents argued for exploration to maximize production. Legislation for oil and gas development on federal lands was not introduced in the 111th Congress. Development on federal lands has not been introduced in the 111th Congress. The Bush Administration lifted the OCS moratoria in 2008, allowing the annual OCS moratoria to expire in September 2008. A new five-year leasing program for OCS oil and gas was proposed in January 2009, superseding the current program. The Obama Administration is considering a draft proposal to replace the current five-year program for oil and gas leases. Congress would have the option to accept or reject the plan if finalized. Lease terms vary for onshore and offshore leases, with extensions available under specific regulations. The Bureau of Land Management and Minerals Management Service are involved in the process. On July 17, 2008, a bill promoting responsible development of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska was defeated in the House. The bill aimed to deny new leases to lessees not diligently developing their leases. Proponents argued that many lessees were not producing oil or gas on federal leases. The bill retained a 10-year primary lease term. The proposed version of H.R. 6251 aimed to reduce the primary lease term from 10 years to five years for onshore and deepwater offshore leases. The bill was defeated on June 26, 2008, with a vote of 223-195. Supporters argued that existing leased acres could yield crude oil production if companies were to actively develop them. Critics raised concerns that the \"use it or lose it\" policy could discourage companies from seeking leases and result in lower bonus bids on new leases. The proposed bills aimed to reduce the primary lease term from 10 years to five years, but it was argued that this might not lead to increased production sooner. Implementing a \"use it or lose it\" policy could result in fewer bids or lower bid offers. Another bill in the Senate would have denied new leases unless lessees were actively producing oil or gas on current leases. U.S. crude oil production peaked in 1970. The Energy Information Administration projects that U.S. oil production will increase to 6.3 million barrels per day by 2018, then decline to 5.6 million barrels per day by 2030. Offshore crude oil production is expected to rise to 2.2 million barrels per day by 2030. Increased access to the Outer Continental Shelf could lead to an additional 200,000 barrels per day by 2020 and 286,000 barrels per day by 2030. ICF projected a 900,000 barrels per day increase in oil production by 2030 with a larger OCS resource base. Deepwater offshore areas are expected to drive U.S. domestic production growth, accounting for over 70% of offshore production. Shallow water lease sales have decreased while deepwater lease sales have risen significantly since 2002. Exploration activity and finds in the Gulf of Mexico's deep waters have been increasing since 2003. According to the Department of the Interior, there are approximately 67 million acres of active oil and gas leases on federal lands, with 12 million acres onshore and 10.5 million acres offshore in production. The Minerals Management Service estimates 8.55 billion barrels of oil reserves in the OCS, with an additional 6.88 billion barrels categorized as Reserve Appreciation. The MMS estimates 86 billion barrels of oil in Undiscovered Technically Recoverable Resources, with 41 billion potentially from the Gulf of Mexico and 25.3 billion from Alaska. Out of 84.24 billion possible barrels, 66.4 billion are available for leasing. Federal onshore proved oil reserves are 5.3 billion barrels, with 6.3 billion in reserve appreciation. Additionally, there are 24.2 billion possible barrels of undiscovered technically recoverable oil resources on federal lands. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 aimed to expedite oil and gas development on federal lands, but critics argue that permitting is moving too fast without proper environmental review. Various concerns such as rig availability, high capital costs, labor shortages, and leases in the development cycle may hinder oil and gas production. Higher capital costs, skilled labor shortages, legal challenges, holding leases for future sale, securing extensions on non-producing leases, and maximizing returns by holding large contiguous lease tracts. Data on lease development status is not readily available, making it difficult to assess activity levels. In the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriation bill, a Presidential Withdrawal has banned oil and gas leasing and development in offshore OCS areas along the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The Congressional ban on leasing activity in designated areas of the OCS began in 1981 and has been extended annually through the appropriations process. Separate withdrawals, like the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, have placed moratoriums on leasing and drilling in specific regions until certain dates. The Eastern Gulf of Mexico is under a leasing and drilling moratorium until 2022. Legislative proposals have been made to lift the ban on parts of the OCS, such as the GOMESA which opened a section of the Central Gulf of Mexico. Congressional actions have also allowed for future lease sales in the North Aleutian Basin Planning Area of Alaska. The recent congressional action approved the Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2009, which omitted language that provided for the congressional OCS moratoria along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. This opens up those areas for potential oil and gas development activities."
