    "content": "The \"Social Security Account Number Anti-Fraud Act\" requires the establishment of a system for employers to verify social security numbers and aims to reduce the use of fraudulent social security documents for employment purposes. This Act also amends the Social Security Act to include a new subsection for the verification of employee social security account numbers. The Social Security Account Number Anti-Fraud Act mandates a program for employers to transmit new employee's social security numbers to the Secretary within 72 hours of employment commencement. The program established under the Social Security Account Number Anti-Fraud Act requires employers to transmit employee social security numbers to the Secretary, who will then verify the information and notify the employer of any discrepancies. Upon transmission, the Secretary will provide the employer with a verification number for each employee social security account number. The Secretary provides the employer with a verification number and indicates any discrepancies in the employee's social security account number. Records of all contacts between the Secretary and employer must be maintained for a specified period. Employers are required to keep records of all information provided by the Secretary regarding employee social security numbers. The employer must maintain records of employee information for inspection by the Secretary. Guidelines are established for discrepancies in social security numbers, including invalid numbers or names not matching the correct holder. The employer must maintain records of employee information for inspection by the Secretary. Guidelines for discrepancies in social security numbers include unusually frequent use, geographically distant locations, and other factors determined by the Secretary. If a discrepancy is indicated, the Secretary must notify the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization within 24 hours. The Secretary may not notify the employer of the discrepancy. The employer must inform the employee of the discrepancy within 3 days. The employee must contact the Social Security Administration within 3 days. The Secretary will disclose the discrepancy upon request by the employee. The Secretary will notify the employee, current employer, and Immigration Commissioner. The employer must notify the employee of any discrepancy and the employee must contact the Social Security Administration. The current employer must reverify the social security number within 10 days of resolution. The employer cannot penalize the employee unless the discrepancy is confirmed. No fees can be charged for using the program. The employer cannot charge fees to employees or job applicants for using the program. The Secretary may exempt employers from using the program for certain employees. Failure to comply will be considered a violation of immigration laws. The Secretary shall establish a mechanism by regulation for the program under section 274A(e) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. Penalties for obtaining information under false pretenses include fines as per title 18, United States Code. Penalties under section 552a(i) of title 5, United States Code do not apply in this case. The Secretary will establish a mechanism to verify employer identity and ensure legitimate use of the program. A toll-free number will be provided for employee contact with the Social Security Administration.

A 'new employee' is someone starting employment more than 2 years after the Social Security Account Number Anti-Fraud Act.
