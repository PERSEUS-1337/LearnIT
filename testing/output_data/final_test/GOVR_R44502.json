    "content": "Both the House and Senate are considering legislation to support medical innovation by reforming NIH and FDA processes. Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray initiated a bipartisan effort to improve the approval pathways for treatments and devices. This led to a package of 19 bipartisan bills reported out of the Senate HELP Committee. The Senate's medical innovation legislative effort includes 19 bills, with one already passed into law. Some of the bills focus on advancing targeted therapies for rare diseases, enhancing medical rehabilitation research, and improving health information technology. The Senate's medical innovation package includes several bills such as The Medical Electronic Data Technology Enhancement Act, The Medical Countermeasures Innovation Act, and The Advancing Precision Medicine Act. This package is the Senate's counterpart to the House's 21st Century Cures initiative, which resulted in the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act in the House. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has held hearings and roundtable meetings since spring 2014, focusing on topics like modernizing clinical trials, personalized medicine, and digital healthcare. H.R. 6 aims to increase investments in medical research at NIH and change FDA regulatory oversight for new drugs and devices. The report details 18 bills in the Senate medical innovation package, providing background, bill provisions, and comparisons to H.R. 6. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has focused on modernizing clinical trials, personalized medicine, and digital healthcare since spring 2014. H.R. 6 aims to increase investments in medical research at NIH and change FDA regulatory oversight for new drugs and devices. The HHS Human Subject Regulations, known as the Common Rule, set federal standards for protecting human subjects in research funded by HHS and other federal agencies. The House and Senate legislation in H.R. 6 address similar topics with some key differences. For a detailed summary of all provisions in H.R. 6, see CRS Report R44071. Under the Common Rule and FDA regulations, research protocols must be approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) to protect research subjects. FDA's Human Subject Regulations apply to all research it regulates, including clinical trials of new drugs and medical devices. An investigational device exemption (IDE) is required for clinical evaluations of unapproved devices to collect data for premarket approval. The provision would amend Section 520(g) of the FFDCA, regarding IDEs, and Section 520(m) of the FFDCA, regarding HDEs, by removing the word \"local\" in all references to local IRBs, including in the stipulation that an approved humanitarian use device may be used in a facility only after a local IRB has approved such use, except in certain emergency situations. The provision in H.R. 6 and S. 1622 allows for the use of non-local IRBs for review of IDEs and HDEs. The House provision also requires the Secretary to revise or issue regulations within 12 months. CLIA regulates clinical laboratories to ensure test result accuracy, with certification based on testing complexity levels. FDA oversees these regulations. The FDA categorizes clinical laboratory tests as low, moderate, or high complexity. Laboratories performing only low-complexity tests receive a certificate of waiver. FDA determines if a test is waived based on information from the manufacturer. Waived tests are simple with minimal risk of error, as per current law and FDA guidance. Section 1622 Section 3 of the guidance document addresses demonstrating accuracy of tests by comparing to established methods. The Secretary is required to publish draft guidance within a year of enactment, clarifying the use of comparable performance between waived and moderately complex laboratory users. This requirement is also found in Section 2228 of H.R. 6. Section 205 of FDAMA amended the FFDCA, adding the \"Least Burdensome Provisions\" which require FDA to consider the least burdensome data necessary for device effectiveness in PMA applications or 510(k) notifications. This includes specifying clinical data needed for device effectiveness as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary must consider the least burdensome means of evaluating device effectiveness when requesting information for demonstrating substantial equivalence between devices with different technological characteristics. FDA guidance allows for the use of non-clinical data in certain circumstances for PMA device approval. The FDA allows for the use of clinical data for PMA device approval in certain circumstances, with options to shorten study length using surrogate endpoints and statistical methods. However, laboratory data may not always predict device performance in the human body, as seen in cases like the malfunction of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads from Medtronic and St. Jude Medical. The hazards of particles shed from metal-on-metal hip replacements were not predictable based on engineering insights or in vitro studies. FDA's authority to require postmarket studies of medical devices is limited, with a high percentage of inactive surveillance studies. S. 1622, Section 4, aims to amend FFDCA Section 513. S. 1622, Section 4, proposes amending FFDCA Section 513 to require FDA employees involved in premarket submissions to receive training on least burdensome requirements. An audit of this training would be conducted by the FDA ombudsman 18 months after enactment. S. 1622 would amend FFDCA Section 515(c) to require the Secretary to consider the least burdensome means necessary for demonstrating device safety and effectiveness in PMA applications. Postmarket information would also be taken into account for this determination. The audit findings would need to be submitted to Senate HELP Committee, House Energy and Commerce Committee, and posted on the FDA website. The provision in H.R. 6 and S. 1622 aims to ensure device safety and effectiveness by requiring the consideration and application of least burdensome requirements in FDA decisions. The House provision mandates the Secretary to issue updated guidance within 12 months, following a stakeholder meeting for input. The House provision in H.R. 6 and S. 1622 aims to ensure device safety by requiring consideration of least burdensome requirements in FDA decisions. It does not amend FFDCA Section 517A(a) regarding decision summaries by CDRH. Medical device manufacturers must register and report actions to comply with regulatory requirements under FFDCA Sections 514 and 515. This notification is part of the 510(k) premarket approval pathway. The 510(k) premarket approval pathway for medical devices requires manufacturers to show substantial equivalence to a predicate device. Clinical data is usually not needed for this pathway. FDA released guidance on reprocessing reusable medical devices in 2015, including requirements for certain devices like duodenoscopes and endoscopes. Under Section 604 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), manufacturers of certain medical devices like duodenoscopes and endoscopes must submit data validating the effectiveness of their reprocessing methods to the FDA for review. The 2011 draft guidance on 510(k) device modifications was withdrawn, leaving the 1997 guidance in effect. Industry expressed concerns that the 2011 guidance would slow down the device regulatory process. FDASIA also required a report to be submitted to House and Senate committees on when a 510(k) notification should be submitted for modifications to legally marketed devices. S. 2503 would amend FFDCA Section 510 by adding a new subsection (q), \"Reusable Medical Devices,\" requiring the Secretary to identify and publish a list of reusable device types for which reports under Section 510(k) must include instructions for use and validation data. This list would be issued within six months of enactment, and reports issued after must comply with the requirements specified by the Secretary. The FDA Commissioner must issue final guidance on when a 510(k) notification is required for device modifications within a year of the draft guidance comment period closing. FDA may prioritize review of devices that offer breakthrough technologies or significant advantages for life-threatening conditions. FDA issued draft guidance on expedited access for premarket approval of medical devices for unmet medical needs on April 23, 2014. The FDA issued draft guidance on expedited access for premarket approval of medical devices for unmet medical needs on April 23, 2014. The final guidance, issued on April 13, 2015, focuses on balancing risks versus benefits for patients, drafting a Data Development Plan, and collecting postmarket data for medical devices with priority review designation. The Expedited Access PMA program allows for expedited review with lower requirements in the premarket process, relying on surrogate endpoints and postmarket data collection. The FDA's Expedited Access PMA program allows for earlier engagement with FDA staff and senior management, with a collaboratively developed plan for data collection to support approval. Postmarket requirements, including post-approval studies, are imposed to ensure device safety and effectiveness. FDA may withdraw approval if sponsors fail to adhere to these requirements or if postmarket data indicate the device is not safe and effective. The FDA's current authority allows for mandating completion of post-approval studies and withdrawing PMA approval for devices lacking reasonable assurance of safety or effectiveness. Concerns have been raised about FDA's ability to enforce postmarket study requirements and the need for sufficient authorities to promptly withdraw product approval if necessary data is not collected. FDA estimates that about six devices a year may qualify for the Expedited Access PMA program. The FDA estimates that about six devices a year may qualify for the Expedited Access PMA program, representing 15% of total PMA applications. The proposed S. 1077 would establish a Priority Review for Breakthrough Devices, requiring the Secretary to prioritize devices that offer more effective diagnosis or treatment for life-threatening conditions and have no approved alternatives. The proposed S. 1077 would establish a Priority Review for Breakthrough Devices, allowing requests for priority review from device sponsors of PMA medical devices. The Secretary would have 60 days to determine if the request would be granted, with evaluations done by experienced FDA staff. Approvals would require a substantive summary of the rationale, and once approved, the designation cannot be withdrawn even if a breakthrough device is later cleared. The proposed S. 1077 would establish a Priority Review for Breakthrough Devices, allowing requests for priority review from device sponsors of PMA medical devices. Each priority review device would be assigned a team of staff, including a team leader with appropriate subject matter expertise. The Secretary would facilitate efficient development and review of the device, provide interactive communication with the sponsor, expedite review of manufacturing and quality systems compliance, and disclose consultation topics in advance to the sponsor. The proposed S. 1077 would establish a Priority Review for Breakthrough Devices, allowing requests for priority review from device sponsors of PMA medical devices. The Secretary would coordinate with the sponsor on a data development plan, ensure efficient clinical trial design, and facilitate expedited development and review of the device through timely postmarket data collection for PMA applications. Agreements on clinical protocols would be binding and subject to written approval. The Secretary would issue guidance on the implementation of the new Section 515B of the FFDCA within one year of enactment and a report to the Senate on January 1, 2017. The House provision in H.R. 6 requires a report to be issued to specific committees regarding the new program under FFDCA Section 515B, with recommendations to strengthen the program. It allows priority review requests for breakthrough devices from sponsors of 510(k) and PMA medical devices, with the option for denied requests to be reconsidered within 30 days. The provision does not specify the timeframe for FDA to disclose topics to sponsors in advance. The House provision in H.R. 6 adds details on efficient clinical trial design, such as shorter trials and adaptive trial designs. It does not specify written agreement on clinical protocols or a deadline for FDA guidance on FFDCA Section 515B. FDASIA added a new pediatric priority review voucher program under FFDCA Section 529. The FDASIA added a new pediatric priority review voucher program under FFDCA Section 529, funded by user fees, providing a transferable voucher for rare pediatric diseases. The program terminates one year after the third voucher award, with a GAO study on its effectiveness. The FDA awarded the third voucher in March 2015 to study the effectiveness of the voucher program for rare pediatric diseases. The authority was extended until September 30, 2016, by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. S. 1878 would amend the definition of \"rare pediatric disease\" and \"rare pediatric disease product application\" in FFDCA Section 529(a). S. 1878 would amend FFDCA Section 529(b)(4) to require sponsors of rare pediatric disease product applications to notify the Secretary of their intent to request a voucher. Eligibility for a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher would be extended to sponsors who submitted their application at least 90 days after the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 and before the enactment of S. 1878. The authority to award priority review vouchers would be extended until September 30, 2022. The FDA would allow applications submitted after S. 1878 and before September 30, 2022, to receive a priority review voucher for rare pediatric diseases, even if approved after September 30, 2022. Sponsors can only receive one voucher per product application. GAO will study the program's effectiveness by January 31, 2022. H.R. 6 has a similar provision for the reauthorization of the voucher program. The House provision in H.R. 6 extends the rare pediatric disease priority review voucher program until December 31, 2018. It amends the definition of \"rare pediatric disease\" to include individuals aged from birth to 18 years. The House provision in H.R. 6 extends the rare pediatric disease priority review voucher program until December 31, 2018. It adds new criteria for pediatric rare disease product applications and requires a study on the program's effectiveness as an incentive for developing drugs for rare pediatric diseases. Precision medicine, also known as personalized medicine, focuses on providing healthcare based on specific patient characteristics and genetic origins of rare diseases. Rare diseases often have genetic origins, leading to the development of new treatments targeting disease-causing mutations. Developing drugs for rare diseases is challenging due to small patient populations for clinical trials. Targeted therapies are first developed for patients with common mutations, but additional therapies are needed for the full spectrum of genetic rare diseases. Orphan drugs, which treat small patient subsets, lack financial incentives for firms to sponsor them. Orphan drugs receive designation under the Orphan Drug Act to encourage development. Section 526(a) of the Orphan Drug Act incentivizes firms to develop pharmaceuticals for rare diseases by providing market exclusivity. S. 2030 aims to facilitate the development of genetically targeted drugs for rare diseases. The legislation proposed in S. 2030 aims to facilitate the development of genetically targeted drugs for rare diseases by allowing sponsors to rely on previously submitted data for similar drugs. It defines genetically targeted drugs, technology, and variant protein-targeted drugs, without limiting the Secretary's approval authorities. The House bill (H.R. 6) proposes adding a new Subchapter J, Precision Medicine, to Chapter V of the FFDCA. This subchapter includes a new Section 592 for precision drugs designated as orphan drugs for rare diseases. The Secretary can rely on previously submitted information for these drugs. The House bill proposes adding a new Section 592 for precision drugs designated as orphan drugs for rare diseases. The Secretary can rely on previously submitted information for these drugs, allowing for expedited review programs. FDASIA expanded FDA's authorities to safeguard public health and added a new section for patient participation in medical product discussions. S. 1597 proposes amending FFDCA Section 569C to require the Secretary to make patient experience data public upon approval of a new drug application. This aims to involve patients in the regulatory process and ensure transparency in medical product development. S. 1597 would require the Secretary to develop guidance on collecting patient experience data over five years. Patient experience data includes information on patients' experiences with a disease or condition. S. 1597 requires the Secretary to develop guidance on collecting patient experience data, including the impact of diseases or therapies on patients' lives. H.R. 6 also addresses patient experience data but in a different manner by amending FFDCA Section 505. The new provision in H.R. 6 amends FFDCA Section 505 by adding subsections (x) and (y) related to patient experience data collection. Subsection 505(x) requires the Secretary to implement a risk-benefit assessment framework, while subsection 505(y) establishes processes for entities to submit patient experience data for the Secretary's assessment. Patient experience data is defined as information collected by various parties to enhance risk-benefit assessments. The new provision in H.R. 6 adds subsections (x) and (y) to FFDCA Section 505, requiring a risk-benefit assessment framework and patient experience data submission processes. Antibiotic resistance is a significant issue, with millions infected annually and thousands dying. Limited Population Antibacterial Drug (LPAD) approval pathway is proposed to address barriers to new antibiotic drug development. The streamlined approach proposed in H.R. 6 aims to address the limited population of patients with serious infections and unmet medical needs by establishing a new Antibacterial Drug approval pathway. This would require the HHS Secretary to report on drug resistance trends, provide guidance on antibiotic stewardship, and assist states in prevention activities. The proposed Antibacterial Drug approval pathway in H.R. 6 aims to address serious infections in a limited patient population with unmet medical needs. It requires the HHS Secretary to establish a monitoring system for antibacterial and antifungal drugs, including those approved under the LPAD pathway, and to make data summaries publicly available. Additionally, a new FFDCA Section 506(g) would create a Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial Drugs, allowing approval for drugs intended to treat serious infections in patients with unmet needs. The Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial Drugs in H.R. 6 allows approval for drugs targeting serious infections in patients with unmet needs. The pathway requires the Secretary to assess the safety and efficacy of these drugs specifically for the intended limited population. Approved products must have labeling indicating their use for a specific patient population, and sponsors must submit promotional materials for FDA review before dissemination. This pathway can be pursued concurrently with other streamlined approval pathways. Guidance on criteria and processes for this pathway must be issued within 18 months of enactment. The legislation requires the Secretary to issue guidance on criteria and processes for demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of limited population antibacterial drugs within 18 months of enactment. It also allows the Secretary to remove post-marketing conditions for drugs approved for broader indications. Reporting to Congress on approval requests and GAO monitoring activities is mandated. The legislation should not alter current prescribing practices. Section 4 clarifies that S. 185 and the House bill do not change current medical practices. The House bill introduces a new pathway for expedited review of certain antibacterial and antifungal drugs for limited patient populations with severe infections. This pathway aims to balance benefits and risks for patients with limited treatment options. The House and Senate bills share some similarities in the review process. The House bill introduces a new pathway for expedited review of certain antibacterial and antifungal drugs for limited patient populations with severe infections. This pathway aims to balance benefits and risks for patients with limited treatment options. The Secretary could consider limited data sets and non-clinical data as substantial evidence of safety and effectiveness for drugs approved through this pathway. Products must carry labeling noting the intended use for a specific patient population, and sponsors must submit promotional materials for FDA review prior to dissemination. FDA would issue draft implementation guidance within 18 months of enactment. The House provision introduces a new pathway for expedited review of certain drugs for limited patient populations with severe infections. FDA may enter into written agreements with sponsors to define the review process and data needed. The Secretary must conduct an assessment of the program within 48 months of enactment and seek public input. Precision medicine, also known as personalized medicine, focuses on providing healthcare based on specific patient characteristics. Precision medicine aims to tailor medical treatment to individual patients, improving health outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. The White House hosted a Precision Medicine Initiative Summit in February 2016 to mark the initiative's one-year anniversary. The initiative's mission is to enable a new era of medicine through research, technology, and policies that empower patients, researchers, and providers to work together towards individualized care. The Precision Medicine Initiative, led by various government agencies, including FDA, ONC, and NIH, is allocated a budget of $309 million in FY2017. Concerns arise regarding the sharing of health data for precision medicine research, particularly in relation to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) exemptions that allow agencies to withhold certain records. Exemption 3 under FOIA allows agencies to withhold records exempted by other statutes, known as b(3) exemptions. NIH issues Certificates of Confidentiality to protect research data from compelled disclosure, promoting privacy and research participation. The NIH prioritizes sharing genomic data from funded research projects, requiring investigators to outline data-sharing plans in their funding applications. Failure to comply may result in funding being withheld. Precision medicine research often involves partnerships with private industry and is supported by the NIH Common Fund's High-Risk, High-Reward Research Program, offering funding opportunities for innovative scientists. The curr_chunk discusses unique funding opportunities for innovative scientists in biomedical research through other transaction (OT) authority. S. 2713, the Advancing Precision Medicine Act of 2016, includes provisions related to this. The Advancing Precision Medicine Act of 2016, S. 2713, includes provisions to support precision medicine by codifying the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, issuing Certificates of Confidentiality to research investigators, protecting sensitive information, requiring data sharing in certain circumstances, and supporting high-risk, high-reward research. The provision in the Advancing Precision Medicine Act of 2016 would issue Certificates of Confidentiality to federally funded research investigators collecting sensitive information to protect research participants' privacy. It would also allow the Secretary to exempt specified biomedical information from disclosure under FOIA exemption (b)(3) and require data sharing from recipients of NIH grants in compliance with federal law. The Advancing Precision Medicine Act of 2016 includes provisions for Certificates of Confidentiality to protect research participants' privacy and allows the Secretary to exempt biomedical information from FOIA disclosure. It also requires data sharing from NIH grant recipients in compliance with federal law. Additionally, a new provision in the Act allows the NIH Director to approve high-impact research projects through transactions other than contracts, grants, or agreements, with a report to Congress due by September 30, 2020. The product is designated as an orphan drug for serious or life-threatening diseases, allowing expedited review programs and reliance on previous information. Section 1028 of H.R. 6 focuses on high-risk, high-reward research without establishing OT authority or requiring a report to Congress. It mandates NIH institute directors to establish programs for innovative biomedical research projects with a specific percentage of funding allocated. The Senate bill does not mandate a specific percentage of funding for research. FDA's regulatory authority covers drugs, biological products, and medical devices, with different offices responsible for reviewing marketing applications. The Office of Combination Products was established in 2002 to regulate combination products. The Office of Combination Products (OCP) determines the primary mode of action for drug-device combination products and regulates them accordingly. Manufacturers must prove that their product satisfies the device exclusionary clause if it does not rely on chemical action for its primary intended purpose. Products assigned to CDER have higher evidence standards, data requirements, and user fees. S. 1767 would amend Section 503(g) of the FFDCA to assign a primary center for regulating combination products and conducting premarket reviews under a single application when appropriate. The bill requires determining the primary mode of action for a combination product to guide the review process, prohibiting classification based solely on chemical action within the body. The bill, S. 1767, would require the Secretary to provide a scientific rationale for determining the primary mode of action of a combination product. The sponsor can propose additional studies to establish relevance, submit a review plan, and request a meeting if the plan is denied. The bill requires the Secretary to discuss information and requirements for plan approval. A denied plan can be resubmitted, and an accepted plan must remain in effect unless agreed otherwise. For premarket review of a combination product, the Secretary can require additional studies. The Secretary can require sponsors to submit only necessary information for determining the safety of combination products, including any incremental risks or benefits. Applicants can rely on investigational studies for premarket review of combination products containing approved drug constituents, but must certify patents and notify patent holders. The bill outlines requirements for the approval of combination products containing approved drug constituents, including the need for certification and effective dates. It allows for separate applications for constituent parts unless deemed necessary by the Secretary. The Office of Combination Products (OCP) is tasked with coordinating timely reviews, facilitating communication, and resolving disputes related to combination products. The bill outlines requirements for the approval of combination products containing approved drug constituents, including certification and effective dates. It prohibits the use of information from a class III device application in a combination product application with an approved drug constituent without patent certification. The Secretary is required to issue final guidance on the combination product review process and identify types of combination products that may adopt certain requirements within specified timeframes. The bill addresses the approval of combination products with approved drug constituents, requiring certification and effective dates. It also mandates the Secretary to issue final guidance on the review process for combination products and identify types that may adopt specific requirements within set timeframes. Additionally, the use of computer systems in healthcare facilities for administrative tasks and mobile health innovations, such as smartphones and tablets, are on the rise. Mobile health, using portable devices like smartphones and tablets for medical purposes, is increasing rapidly. Health-related mobile apps range from accessing medical information to providing clinical decision support. Regulators are concerned about apps that could pose risks to patients if they malfunction. The FDA has regulatory authority over mobile medical apps that transform a mobile platform into a medical device. They focus on the functionality of the app, not the platform itself, and only regulate apps that pose a risk to patient safety if they malfunction. The FDA released updated guidance on regulating mobile medical apps in February 2015. They provided examples of apps not subject to regulatory authority, such as those for general office operations. The agency also mentioned apps that may meet the definition of a medical device but pose minimal risk, like those for tracking asthma or general wellness. FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for these apps. The FDA updated guidance on regulating mobile medical apps in 2015, providing examples of apps subject to regulatory oversight. These apps pose a significant risk if they do not function as intended, including those that control device operation, analyze patient data, or transform a mobile platform into a medical device. The guidance did not address regulation of CDS software, which is still under consideration. The MEDTECH Act aims to exclude certain health software from the definition of a medical device. The FDA updated guidance in 2015 on regulating mobile medical apps, including examples of apps subject to oversight due to significant risks if they malfunction. The guidance did not cover regulation of Clinical Decision Support (CDS) software, which is still being considered. The MEDTECH Act aims to exclude certain health software from the definition of a medical device, allowing FDA regulatory authority if serious adverse health consequences are likely based on specified criteria. The FDA's risk-based approach to regulating mobile medical apps is reflected in H.R. 6 and S. 1101, which exclude certain software applications from FDA oversight. Both bills exclude software that provides administrative functions, stores patient information, and offers analytic tools. H.R. 6 creates a narrower exception for CDS software that poses significant risks to patient safety. The HITECH Act of 2009 authorized Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments to hospitals and physicians for using certified EHR technology. CMS has made meaningful use measures more stringent over time. Stage 1 requires capturing and storing structured patient data. Providers must use certified EHR technology for these functions. Stage 2 of meaningful use, authorized by the HHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), requires eligible hospitals and physicians to use EHR technology for advanced functions like patient data access and exchange during care transitions. Starting in 2015, non-meaningful EHR users face Medicare payment penalties unless they qualify for a hardship exception. CMS finalized rules in October 2015 for Stage 2 objectives and Stage 3 requirements by 2018, addressing provider concerns about EHR challenges and burdens. The 2015 Edition final rule for the certification program addresses concerns of health care providers regarding EHR technology challenges. CMS focused on advanced uses like CDS and health information exchange, expanded the certification program, and established transparency requirements for HIT developers. The program established new transparency requirements for HIT developers and aims to improve interoperability by requiring certified HIT products to adopt updated standards for structured health information. ONC released a national interoperability roadmap in October 2015 to coordinate efforts towards achieving HIT interoperability goals over the next 10 years. The roadmap discusses the drivers for promoting interoperability in healthcare, including payment and regulatory factors. Overcoming legal and governance barriers is a key challenge to achieve trusted information exchange. MACRA aims for widespread interoperability of EHR technology by 2018, defining it as the ability to exchange and use clinical information to improve patient outcomes. MACRA mandated the establishment of common standards to improve care and patient outcomes. It required the Secretary to report to Congress on ways to help providers select certified EHR technology and establish interoperability metrics. If the interoperability objective is not met by December 31, 2018, a report identifying barriers and recommendations must be submitted by December 31, 2019. ONC released a report on health information blocking in April 2015, defining it as knowingly and unreasonably interfering with information exchange. The April 2015 report defined information blocking as interfering with the exchange of electronic health information. ONC is taking actions to address this issue, but there are gaps in authority. MACRA requires hospitals and physicians to attest that they have not limited interoperability. HIPAA gives individuals the right to access their health information. The 2015 Edition final rule for the certification program requires EHR developers to enable individuals to access their health information. ONC recommended standardizing patient attributes for information exchange and introducing EHR certification criteria for patient identification. The 2015 Edition final rule for the HIT certification program requires EHR systems to capture standardized patient data for patient matching. The Improving Health Information Technology Act (S. 2511) aims to promote HIT interoperability, penalize information blocking, reduce administrative burdens, and increase patient access to electronic health information. The Improving Health Information Technology Act (S. 2511) aims to reduce regulatory burdens for physicians using EHR technology, encourage HIT certification for different medical specialties, and establish a star rating system for certified HIT products based on criteria like security and interoperability. HIT developers would need to report on these criteria for each product, with products receiving at least a three-star rating. The Improving Health Information Technology Act (S. 2511) would require developers of HIT products with one-star ratings to improve or risk decertification. The HHS Office of Inspector General would investigate and penalize information-blocking practices, with penalties for developers, exchanges, networks, and providers. ONC would refer cases of information blocking to the Office for Civil Rights if needed. S. 2511 would establish a trusted exchange framework for electronic health information, require HIT to transmit data to registries, and extend confidentiality protections to HIT developers reporting patient safety information. It would also improve patients' access to their electronic health information through partnerships and education. S. 2511 aims to establish a trusted exchange framework for electronic health information, improve patient access to their data, and require HIT to transmit data to registries. It also includes provisions for educating providers and individuals on patient rights under HIPAA. Additionally, the bill requires GAO to review secure patient matching methods within two years. The House bill, H.R. 6, includes provisions similar to S. 2511 but also introduces new enforcement authority for investigating information blocking by HIT developers. Unlike the Senate bill, H.R. 6 does not include a star rating program for HIT products but instead requires developers to meet certain requirements for certification. Additionally, H.R. 6 extends federal privilege and confidentiality protections to HIT developers reporting patient safety information. H.R. 6 introduces new enforcement authority for investigating information blocking by HIT developers and extends federal privilege and confidentiality protections to those reporting patient safety information. It includes language on developing new interoperability standards, eliminates the HIT Standards Committee, and requires hospitals and physicians to attest they are not engaged in information blocking. Additionally, H.R. 6 repeals interoperability provisions in MACRA and does not establish a star rating program for HIT products. The federal government established new authorities and programs in the Department of Health and Human Services to support the development and procurement of medical countermeasures in response to CBRN agents after the terrorist attacks of 2001. This included the Project BioShield Act, the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, and the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013. The federal countermeasure strategy is coordinated by the Public Health and Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise (PHEMCE), led by the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR). It includes representatives from various agencies like FDA, CDC, NIH, DOD, DHS, USDA, and VA. The ASPR is required to develop an annual \"coordinated 5-year budget plan\" for countermeasure research, development, and procurement activities as per the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) was established to develop and procure medical countermeasures against CBRN agents, pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious diseases. BARDA contracts with companies for development activities that may extend multiple years. The Project BioShield Act allows the HHS Secretary to obligate funds for countermeasures that need up to 10 more years of development, with payments tied to specified milestones and delivery to the Strategic National Stockpile. The Medical Countermeasures Innovation Act of 2016 aims to change how the federal government supports the development and procurement of medical countermeasures against CBRN agents. It includes provisions for timely guidelines on using countermeasures in the Strategic National Stockpile and reporting requirements for Project BioShield procurements. The bill aims to change reporting requirements for Project BioShield procurements when the special reserve fund falls below $1.5 billion. It would specify recipients of the report and move contracting authority for Project BioShield and BARDA advanced development from ASPR to BARDA to enhance program effectiveness and accountability. Additionally, ASPR would need to provide more information in its budget plan, which must be publicly available without compromising national security. The budget plan for Project BioShield and BARDA would need to be publicly available without compromising national security. It would also involve partnering with an independent entity to accelerate the development of medical countermeasures for emerging infectious diseases that threaten the nation. This partner could provide business advice and invest in companies developing these countermeasures, similar to the strategic investor model used by the U.S. intelligence community through In-Q-Tel. The bill proposes establishing criteria for a partner with experience in technology innovation to address government needs through a strategic investor model. The partner would report on fund spending and progress meeting needs, with a Government Accountability Office evaluation after four years. The authority would sunset in 2022. Additionally, the bill would remove the need for presidential approval to use the Project BioShield special reserve fund, following a recommendation to streamline the contracting process. The 21st Century Cures Act contains provisions to streamline the Project BioShield contracting process and specify the congressional committees that HHS must notify of fund usage. It also includes FDA goals for drug review times, with Priority Review aiming for action within 6 months compared to the standard 10 months. The 21st Century Cures Act aims to streamline the Project BioShield contracting process and specify congressional notification requirements for fund usage. It includes FDA goals for drug review times, with Priority Review targeting action within 6 months. The bill proposes a new priority review voucher program to incentivize the development of treatments for agents posing national security threats. The 21st Century Cures Act proposes a new priority review voucher program funded by user fees to incentivize the development of treatments for national security threats. This program would provide a transferable voucher to a sponsor of an approved new human drug product application for a material threat medical countermeasure, allowing for priority review of another application. Section 8 of the bill requires a GAO report on the program's effectiveness. The NIH has initiatives to support young investigators in biomedical research by reducing the time to receive their first independent research grant. A study was conducted by the National Academy of Sciences to analyze policies affecting the next generation of researchers in the US. NIH funds seven loan repayment programs for researchers. The NIH offers various loan repayment programs for researchers, including intramural programs for those from disadvantaged backgrounds, AIDS research, and general research. There are also extramural programs for researchers at qualifying educational institutions, focusing on health disparities, contraception, clinical research, and pediatric topics. Researchers can receive up to $35,000 per year in loan repayment benefits under each program. The NIH loan repayment programs offer up to $35,000 per year in benefits. Regulations governing participant eligibility, application procedures, selection criteria, loan repayment terms, tax liability, service obligation, and penalties apply. S. 2014 aims to develop and retain the biomedical workforce funded by the NIH through the Next Generation of Researchers Initiative. The Next Generation of Researchers Initiative (the Initiative) aims to coordinate NIH policies and programs to support new researchers by collaborating with agencies, associations, and institutions to enhance information on the biomedical workforce. The NIH Director must consider recommendations from the NAS study and report actions taken to congressional committees within two years. Section 3 of S. 2014 proposes amendments to consolidate existing NIH loan repayment programs, transferring authority to the NIH Director, increasing maximum repayment amounts, and expanding eligibility to include research in emerging scientific areas and workforce needs. The provision also allows for adjustments to eligible categories as priorities change. The provision in S. 2014 would amend the NIH's loan repayment programs by increasing repayment amounts to $50,000 per year, setting criteria for individuals to qualify for loan repayment contracts, and allowing appropriated funds to remain available for two fiscal years. The provision in S. 2014 would amend NIH's loan repayment programs by increasing repayment amounts to $50,000 per year, setting criteria for eligibility, and allowing funds to remain available for two fiscal years. It would also expand eligibility to researchers in emerging scientific areas and authorize the NIH Director to adjust categories as priorities change. Additionally, existing authorizations for NIH loan repayment programs would be repealed, and a GAO report would be required to assess NIH's efforts in attracting and developing emerging scientists. Subtitle C of H.R. 6, \"Supporting Young Emerging Scientists,\" includes provisions to attract, retain, and develop underrepresented scientists. Section 1042 requires a report on NIH efforts in this area, while Section 1041 focuses on NIH's loan repayment programs. The Senate bill authorizes a new extramural NIH loan repayment program providing up to $50,000 annually to researchers in NIH scientific or workforce needs. H.R. 6 increases repayment amounts to $50,000 and allows for annual inflation adjustments. NIH strategic planning is emphasized to support research priorities. The focus of NIH research and its organizational structure have been criticized for not prioritizing current health needs like tobacco control, exercise, nutrition, and cost-effective healthcare delivery. Despite high healthcare spending in the US, life expectancy ranks low compared to other OECD countries. The Senate bill proposes a strategic plan for NIH to guide biomedical research investments, promote collaboration, and advance biomedicine. The NIH Strategic Plan aims to identify research priorities, address disease burden, promote collaboration among ICs, prioritize funding through the Common Fund, and train the biomedical workforce. It is comparable to S. 2745 and would require regular preparation of individual IC strategic plans informed by the NIH Strategic Plan. The House provision in S. 2745 adds a new subsection to the PHSA for a Research Strategic Plan for NIH. Every five years, the NIH Director, IC Directors, researchers, patient advocacy groups, and industry leaders must develop a biomedical research strategic plan. This plan will identify research opportunities, develop individual strategic plans for each IC's research activities, focus on common template areas, consider the return on investment, and prioritize Rare and pediatric diseases. The NIH Director, in consultation with IC Directors, must develop a biomedical research strategic plan every five years. The plan will prioritize rare and pediatric diseases, maintain the biomedical workforce diversity, and conduct annual progress reviews. Minorities are underrepresented in clinical trials, with African Americans and Hispanics being significantly underrepresented. Minorities, including African Americans and Hispanics, are significantly underrepresented in clinical trials, with Hispanics making up 16% of the population but only 1% of participants. It is crucial to include women and minorities in NIH-funded clinical research to study the safety and effectiveness of medical products in a broadly representative sample of people. Section 492B of the PHSA mandates outreach to recruit minorities and women into clinical research, with guidelines developed by the Director of NIH in consultation with the Office of Research on Women's Health and the Office of Research on Minority Health. The NIH Director is required to gather accurate data on study populations in clinical research, including women and minority groups, and make it publicly available. Collaboration between research institutes is encouraged to increase the number of subjects studied and address health disparities. Section 4 of the PHSA would require IC Directors to consult annually with the Directors of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities and the Office of Research on Women's Health to ensure IC objectives address women and minorities, focus on reducing health disparities, and include these details in strategic plans. Reporting requirements for IC advisory councils would change to triennial reports including data on women and minorities. Compliance with ClinicalTrials.gov reporting requirements would be considered for future grant awards. Section 5 of the PHSA would amend Part A of Title IV to focus on research related to sexual and gender minority populations. It would require the NIH Director to encourage increased participation of these groups in clinical research and support the development of appropriate measures for reporting health information. Within two years, the Secretary would have to disseminate and make public these measures. Section 6 would amend another section related to these efforts. Section 6 of the PHSA would amend Section 464z-3 to allow the Director of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities to foster partnerships between ICs and encourage collaborative research for minority health. Section 7 would require the Secretary, through the Director of NIH, to convene a working group to enhance the rigor and reproducibility of NIH-funded research, considering factors like experiment design and statistical analysis. The Director of NIH must consider the recommendations within 18 months and update policies accordingly. Section 8 of the PHSA mandates the establishment of a Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant and Lactating Women within 90 days of enactment. The task force's duties, membership, and reporting requirements are specified, with a termination date set for two years after its establishment. The Secretary is required to update regulations and guidance regarding the inclusion of pregnant and lactating women in research within two years of enactment. The bill requires the development of policies for basic research to assess biological variables, including sex differences. It also mandates updating guidelines for clinical research involving women and minorities to reflect the science regarding sex differences. The House provision in S. 2742 aims to increase representation of underrepresented communities in clinical trials. It also includes provisions to streamline administrative matters at NIH and requires the NIH Director to submit biennial reports to Congress on agency activities. The Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) aims to reduce administrative burdens for federally funded research projects. Surveys conducted by FDP found that researchers spend 57% of their time on research and 43% on pre- and post-award requirements, with common time-consuming tasks related to project finances, personnel, and effort reporting. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) requirements were the most time-consuming for research projects involving human or animal subjects. Other time-consuming areas included clinical trials, subcontracts, and cross-agency differences. Additionally, Section 405 of the PHSA outlines the appointment process for the Directors of the National Cancer Institute and other NIH Institutes. Section 202 of the Labor/HHS/ED Appropriations Act, 1993 specifies compensation rates for consultants and individual scientists appointed for limited periods of time. Section 2 of S. 2742 would amend Section 403(a) of the PHSA to replace the biennial reporting requirement of the NIH Director with a triennial requirement, adding new reporting requirements. Section 3 of S. 2742 addresses administrative burden on researchers funded by NIH and other federal agencies by directing a review of financial conflict-of-interest regulations and policies to harmonize and reduce them. The proposed legislation aims to reduce administrative burdens on researchers by harmonizing policies, implementing measures to monitor grant sub-recipients, evaluating financial expenditure reporting procedures, reviewing regulations for laboratory animal care, and clarifying requirements. The proposed legislation aims to reduce administrative burdens on researchers by clarifying OMB Uniform Guidance requirements for personnel expenses and establishing a Research Policy Board to harmonize regulations and minimize administrative burden across federal research agencies. The proposed legislation aims to establish a Research Policy Board to provide recommendations on scientific research policy and reduce administrative burdens on researchers by harmonizing regulations across federal research agencies. The board would sunset on September 30, 2020, and GAO would evaluate its activities within four years of enactment. Section 5 would modify NIH reporting requirements and require IC heads to report funding for collaborative research within two years of enactment. The proposed legislation includes changes to NIH reporting requirements, such as modifying the number of experts and consultants used, adjusting doctoral degree reporting, and altering vaccine reporting. It also proposes amendments to the appointment and term limits of IC directors under the PHSA. The proposed legislation includes changes to NIH reporting requirements and amendments to the appointment and term limits of IC directors under the PHSA. Directors appointed under the new authority would serve a five-year term with no limit on the number of terms, and the NIH Director could terminate appointments before the end of the term. Compensation limitations for consultants and scientists would not apply to these directors. The House provision in H.R. 6 Section 1022 aims to reduce administrative burden on NIH-funded researchers by implementing measures recommended by various bodies. It is comparable to Section 10 of S. 2742, with both focusing on the same goals. The provision also removes compensation limitations for consultants and individual scientists, aligning with the changes to NIH reporting requirements and appointment terms for IC directors. Section 301(a) of the PHSA authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct and promote research on physical and mental diseases, including providing substances and organisms for research purposes. Section 4 proposes amending this authority to allow the Secretary to provide research substances and living organisms. The Secretary may direct contractors to collect payments for research substances and organisms provided to researchers, with the amounts credited to the appropriations accounts. In 1986, Congress established the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program to compensate individuals injured by certain vaccines, waiving liability for manufacturers in most cases. The Secretary can create or modify compensable injuries and time frames for vaccines through rulemaking. Section 6 of S. 2742 would require the Secretary to add vaccines recommended for pregnant women by the CDC to the Injury Table, addressing concerns about discouraging vaccine use in pregnant women due to current VICP limitations. The proposed legislation aims to expand vaccine coverage for pregnant women under the VICP, clarifying eligibility for compensation for both the woman and children in utero. Congress has established federal payment mechanisms and insurance coverage requirements to support vaccine production and use in the US, with incentives tied to CDC recommendations. Unlike the FDA, which focuses on individual safety and efficacy, the CDC considers epidemiology and vaccine availability when recommending routine vaccine use for specific populations. Vaccine manufacturers are interested in understanding these dynamics. The proposed legislation aims to expand vaccine coverage for pregnant women under the VICP, clarifying eligibility for compensation. Vaccine manufacturers are interested in understanding the factors considered by ACIP, CDC, and FDA in making vaccine use and licensing decisions. Section 7 of S. 2742 requires CDC to coordinate vaccine program efforts and report to Congress on promoting innovation in vaccine development. Section 2143 mandates CDC personnel to meet with vaccine developers regarding their licensed products. The proposed legislation aims to expand vaccine coverage for pregnant women under the VICP, clarifying eligibility for compensation. Section 2142 of H.R. 6 requires the CDC Director to review ACIP processes and publish a report with recommendations to improve consistency. H.R. 6 also includes a provision to expedite ACIP's consideration of certain vaccines. Sponsors of clinical trials for FDA-regulated drugs, biologics, and devices must submit registration and results to ClinicalTrials.gov. The NIH Director ensures public access to search entries by disease, drug/device name, and trial location. The data bank is user-friendly and allows easy comparison of entries. Since December 2007, clinical trials of FDA-regulated products must submit registration information to ClinicalTrials.gov. Summary results information for approved products has been required since September 2008, and adverse events information since September 2009. HHS proposed a rule in November 2014 to expand requirements for submission of clinical trial data. S. 2742 would amend the PHSA to require the NIH Director to inform responsible parties of the option to request public posting of medical device trial information. S. 2742 would require the Secretary to submit reports to Congress on education, outreach, and compliance with clinical trial registration requirements for FDA-regulated products. The Secretary would be required to submit reports to Congress on compliance with clinical trial registration requirements for FDA-regulated products, including educating responsible persons. H.R. 6 focuses on public access to information in ClinicalTrials.gov and research, adding new language to ensure registry data bank compliance. The NIH Director must ensure that the clinical trial registry data bank is user-friendly, entries are easily compared, and data is submitted in a standardized format. The Secretary must seek advice on enhancements within 90 days and begin implementation within 18 months. Additionally, a seven-year cooperative agreement will be established for the Clinical Trial Data System. The NIH Director will establish a seven-year cooperative agreement for the Clinical Trial Data System with eligible entities to enable further research on clinical trial data. Eligible entities must demonstrate the ability to compile and maintain standardized data, allow access only to registered users, ensure dissemination of research results, and have a proven track record. The FDA conducts clinical trials in three phases to determine the safety and efficacy of medical products. Phase I trials focus on dosing and side effects with a small number of healthy volunteers. Phase II trials involve more participants with the disease to gather safety data and evidence of beneficial effects. Phase II clinical trials assess dosing requirements and study efficacy of a drug. If the drug shows potential effectiveness and acceptable risks, it advances to Phase III where it is tested in a larger group of participants to further evaluate effectiveness and monitor side effects. Under current law, the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) can support clinical trial activities up to Phase IIB for rare diseases or conditions, with specific conditions to be met. Section 11 of S. 2742 aims to extend this support. The Senate bill S. 2742 aims to extend the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) authority to support clinical trial activities through the end of Phase IIB and the exception for treatment of rare diseases through the end of Phase III. It also includes adding information on methods and tools developed by NCATS in their annual/biennial report. The House provision in H.R. 6 is comparable to S. 2742 in extending NCATS's support for clinical trials up to Phase IIB. S. 800 would amend Section 452 of the PHSA to extend the exception for treatment of a rare disease or condition through the end of Phase III and establish the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research at NIH. S. 800 would amend Section 452 of the PHSA to establish the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research at NIH, requiring the development of a comprehensive plan for medical rehabilitation research every five years. The plan must include goals, progress reports, and recommendations for revisions, to be transmitted to specific committees within 30 days of updating. S. 800 would establish the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research at NIH and require a comprehensive plan for research every five years. It would also define medical rehabilitation research and aim to avoid duplication among federal agencies. Additionally, S. 849 would introduce a new section for advancing research on neurological diseases under the PHSA. The bill S. 849 proposes to establish a new section under the PHSA for advancing research on neurological diseases. It authorizes the HHS Secretary to improve data collection on neurological diseases by creating a new registry focusing on prevalent diseases, collecting demographic and risk factor information, and consulting with experts. The bill S. 849 proposes to establish a new section under the PHSA for advancing research on neurological diseases. It authorizes the HHS Secretary to improve data collection on neurological diseases by creating a new registry focusing on prevalent diseases, collecting demographic and risk factor information, and consulting with experts. The bill also authorizes the Secretary to provide grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements with public or private nonprofit entities for implementation. The Secretary must make information and analysis available to federal health agencies, state and local agencies, and researchers. Reporting to Congress is required within one year of establishing a registry, and biennially thereafter. Section 1122 adds a new PHSA Section 399V-6 for \"Surveillance of Neurological Diseases,\" similar to the Senate bill. The PHSA Section 399V-6, \"Surveillance of Neurological Diseases,\" would establish a National Neurological Diseases Surveillance System to track diseases like multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's. The Secretary must make data available to the public and report to Congress within four years. $5 million would be authorized for each fiscal year from 2016 to 2020. The Silvio O. Conte Senior Biomedical Research Service (SBRS) receives $5 million annually from 2016 to 2020. It is a special hiring mechanism for accomplished scientists in PHS agencies, not subject to civil service requirements. SBRS is limited to 500 members, with a maximum pay of about $206,000 per year. The Secretary can contribute up to 10% of a member's pay to their retirement system. The provision would rename the SBRS as the Silvio O. Conte Senior Biomedical Research and Biomedical Product Assessment Service (the Service), increase the number of authorized members to 2,000, add \"biomedical product assessment\" as a desired field of expertise, clarify that the Secretary is not required to reduce the number of employees serving in other HHS employment systems, require the appointment of experts to agencies within HHS, and authorize the appointment of persons with a master's level degree in engineering, bioinformatics, or related fields. The provision in the emerging field would increase the upper pay rate limit to that of the President, eliminate contributions to a member's preexisting retirement system, and require a study on the changes to the Service. The House bill also includes a similar provision to rename the SBRS and clarify the Secretary's authority regarding employees in other HHS systems. The House bill would require the Secretary to report on changes to the Service and their impact on FDA's ability to hire qualified experts. Various hiring authorities target scientists and technical workers for FDA positions, allowing appointments without following Title 5 requirements. The provision in the House bill would allow the FDA Commissioner to appoint qualified candidates to scientific, technical, or professional positions without following Title 5 requirements. It would also authorize the Commissioner to determine pay for retaining qualified employees. The Senate bill requires a report on FDA workforce planning and GAO study on hiring and retaining qualified staff. The House bill allows the FDA Commissioner to appoint qualified candidates to scientific, technical, or professional positions without following Title 5 requirements. The House provision allows the FDA Commissioner to appoint qualified candidates to scientific, technical, or professional positions within specific FDA centers. The provision also grants the HHS Secretary authority to determine pay for retaining qualified employees. Unlike the Senate bill, the House provision does not require a GAO study on FDA workforce. FDA's regulatory authority covers drugs, biological products, and medical product safety and effectiveness. The FDA has authority over medical product safety and effectiveness for drugs, biological products, and medical devices. Different centers within the agency handle the review of marketing applications. The Obama Administration has proposed an Oncology Center of Excellence to enhance collaboration in cancer treatment. To most benefit those affected by cancer, the FDA needs to take an integrated approach in evaluating products for prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment. The proposed Intercenter Institutes would coordinate activities for major disease areas beyond cancer, such as cardiology, neurology, and infectious disease. The provision in H.R. 2700 calls for the establishment of institutes to coordinate activities for specific disease areas between different FDA centers. The Secretary must establish at least one institute within a year of enactment, with a public comment period. The Secretary can terminate an institute if it no longer benefits public health. No similar provision in H.R. 6. The Office of Management and Budget imposed restrictions on conference travel for federal employees after allegations of misspent funds during a 2010 General Services Administration meeting in Las Vegas. Agencies were directed to spend at least 30% less than in FY2010 on travel expenses from FY2013 to FY2016. Senior-level approval is required for conferences exceeding $100,000, with a $500,000 spending limit unless waived for exceptional circumstances. Under the Senate provision, scientific meetings related to professional duties of HHS staff are exempt from federal reporting requirements and travel restrictions. HHS divisions must report annual scientific meeting attendance and travel spending. The NIH and FDA provisions in H.R. 6 mirror S. 2700, emphasizing the importance of scientific conference participation. The Reagan-Udall Foundation for the Food and Drug Administration was created to advance the mission of FDA by identifying unmet needs, awarding grants, holding meetings, and obtaining patents. It is led by a Board of Directors with members from the National Academy of Sciences and patient advocacy groups. The provision would amend FFDCA Section 770 to change the membership of the Board of Directors, allowing voting members to increase the board size and appoint new members by majority vote. It would limit industry representatives to 30% of the membership and broaden the requirement for specific expertise among all board members. The provision would amend FFDCA Section 770 to change the membership of the Board of Directors, allowing voting members to increase the board size and appoint new members by majority vote. It would limit industry representatives to 30% of the membership and broaden the requirement for specific expertise among all board members. Additionally, the provision would remove the salary cap of the foundation's Executive Director and amend the language regarding separation of funds. The provision in the House bill (H.R. 6) and Senate bill would change how funds received from the Treasury are managed, following best accounting practices. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) requires agencies to seek permission from the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) before collecting information from the public. The provision in the House and Senate bills would exempt NIH research from the Paperwork Reduction Act requirements, allowing for the collection of information during the conduct of NIH research without PRA clearance. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 required the FDA to report to Congress and conduct studies on drug safety and effectiveness. This provision would remove certain reporting requirements from the FDA. Section 505A(p) and 505B(l) of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 mandated studies to be conducted by the IOM within three years of certain enactments. Section 523(d) required a study related to devices to be conducted by the Secretary by January 10, 2007. These provisions outline the framework for FDA approval of drug marketing applications. The FDA requires sponsors to submit a new drug application with data on safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, and labeling for unapproved active ingredients. Once approved, manufacturers must submit a supplemental application for any changes in labeling, manufacturing, dosing, or new indications. Regulations specify the required contents, including clinical data analysis for evaluating safety and effectiveness. The FDA requires sponsors to submit data on safety and effectiveness for new drug applications. This includes information from clinical investigations, commercial marketing experience, and scientific literature. The submission must also include an integrated summary of data demonstrating effectiveness for claimed indications. Amendments would allow the use of qualified data summaries for supplemental NDAs seeking to add new qualified indications. The provision in the Senate bill allows for the submission of qualified data summaries in supplemental NDAs for new qualified indications, demonstrating safety and effectiveness of the drug. This aligns with a similar provision in H.R. 6, addressing data requirements for adding qualified indications to approved drugs. The House bill introduces a streamlined data review program for sponsors to submit a \"qualified data summary\" when there is existing acceptable safety data for a drug developed for approved indications. This summary should demonstrate safety and effectiveness for a qualified indication for use of the drug. The House provision for a streamlined data review program requires sponsors to submit full data sets unless deemed unnecessary by the Secretary. It emphasizes enabling the FDA to make approval decisions based on qualified data summaries and mandates the FDA Commissioner to issue implementation guidance and regulations. The FDAAA mandated actions to inform the public and expert committees about drug safety and effectiveness, including biweekly screening of the FAERS database, quarterly reporting on new safety information, and the development of a website with extensive drug safety information. It also required the Secretary to prepare a summary analysis of adverse drug reaction reports for a drug within 18 months after approval or after use by 10,000 individuals. The FDAAA mandated actions to inform the public and expert committees about drug safety and effectiveness, including biweekly screening of the FAERS database and posting guidelines on the FDA website for drug safety surveillance. It also expanded the risk-management authority of FDA by introducing REMS with elements to assure safe use. The provision would amend FFDCA sections to enhance drug safety surveillance activities for newly approved drugs, including expanding the authority to evaluate risk management strategies and involving other advisory committees in the process. The provision in the curr_chunk would change the evaluation requirement for ETASU for drugs from \"annually\" to \"periodically.\" Biological products must be licensed by the FDA before being marketed in the US, and USP sets standards for medicines worldwide. The curr_chunk discusses the standards set by the USP for drug substances, products, and excipients, as well as the requirements under the FFDCA for drug labeling and compliance with compendial standards. The Senate bill proposes amending the PHS Act to exclude biological products from the FFDCA provisions related to official compendiums. The FDA regulates the sale of drugs and biological products under PHS Act Section 351, requiring approval based on safety and effectiveness evidence. FDA may allow access to unapproved products through mechanisms like compassionate use for patients with serious conditions. The FDA may grant expanded access to patients with serious diseases if the drug's risk is lower than the disease's risk, there is evidence of safety and effectiveness, and it won't interfere with clinical investigations. However, the use of expanded access is limited by whether the manufacturer agrees to provide the drug. FDA cannot force manufacturers to participate, and they consider factors like supply, liability risk, resources, and data needs. The provision would require manufacturers to make their policies on responding to compassionate use requests publicly available, including contact information, request procedures, evaluation criteria, and response time. Posting the policy does not guarantee patient access to investigational drugs, and manufacturers can revise their policy at any time. The provision allows manufacturers to revise their policy on compassionate use requests at any time. It would become effective 60 days after the enactment of S. 2700 or the initiation of a phase 2 or phase 3 study. FDA has approved patient access in over 99% of requests, but some sponsors are hesitant to provide investigational drugs outside of standard processes. The provision in S. 2700 allows manufacturers to revise their policy on compassionate use requests, aiming to address the uncertainty around FDA's consideration of adverse events in expanded access use. It requires finalization of the guidance on \"Expanded Access to Investigational Drugs for Treatment Use\" to define how adverse event data is interpreted. This aligns with the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 incentivizing drug development for rare diseases. The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 incentivizes drug development for rare diseases by offering incentives such as market exclusivity, tax credits, user fee waivers, and federal grants. FDA has approved over 400 new orphan drugs and biological products since the law's passage. Market exclusivity is granted for statutorily defined time periods to the NDA holder for products used in treating rare diseases, first generic versions, certain pediatric uses, and new qualified infectious disease products. The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 incentivizes drug development for rare diseases by offering incentives such as market exclusivity, tax credits, user fee waivers, and federal grants. FDA does not grant marketing approval to another manufacturer's product. Section 5 of the Orphan Drug Act allows the Secretary to make grants and enter into contracts to assist in defraying the costs of qualified clinical testing expenses for drugs for rare diseases. The provision in H.R. 6 aims to broaden the use of grants to assist in developing drugs for rare diseases, including qualified testing expenses. It also expands the definition of qualified testing to include observational studies and analyses for understanding the natural history of rare diseases. The House provision in H.R. 6 adds a new FFDCA Section 505I, extending exclusivity by six months for approved drugs when FDA approves a supplemental application for a new rare disease indication. Sponsor must notify the Secretary of any drug production discontinuance for commercial reasons at least one year prior. The extension is not available for drugs already granted a six-month extension under this provision. Regenerative medicine is defined as creating living tissues to repair lost organ function. The FDA regulates cells or tissues for implantation in patients, known as HCT/Ps. Stem cells are one example. A new section in the FFDCA would establish standards for regenerative medicine and advanced therapies, developed in consultation with stakeholders. The Secretary would establish standards for regenerative medicine and advanced therapies, including cell therapy, gene therapy, and tissue engineering products, through a transparent public process. Regulations and guidance would be updated accordingly. The FDA issues guidance documents to provide interpretation of regulations and inform regulated entities on program implementation. These documents cover various topics such as product design, manufacturing, testing, scientific issues, and inspection policies. FDA issues over 100 guidances annually under the authority of FFDCA Section 701(a) and Section 701(h)(1)(A) directs the Secretary to develop guidance documents with public participation. The FDA issues guidance documents to inform regulated entities on program implementation. Some Members of Congress are concerned with FDA's use of guidance documents instead of the rulemaking process. A proposed amendment would require the Secretary to explain why nonbinding guidance is used and identify specific statutory provisions. This provision is not present in H.R. 6. PHSA Section 319 allows the HHS Secretary to determine public health emergencies. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) ensures federal agencies do not burden the public with data collections. Section 17 would waive PRA requirements for voluntary data collection during a public health emergency, allowing the HHS Secretary to investigate outbreaks more easily. This provision is not present in H.R. 6."
