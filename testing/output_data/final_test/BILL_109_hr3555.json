    "content": "The \"Responsible Funding to Prevent Teen Pregnancy Act\" is cited as the short title. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Grants. The Secretary may award grants to public and private entities to establish or expand teenage pregnancy prevention programs. Grant recipients may include State and local not-for-profit coalitions, agencies, schools, afterschool programs, and community groups. Priority is given to programs targeting communities with high teenage pregnancy rates or increasing rates. The Secretary awards grants to entities for teenage pregnancy prevention programs, prioritizing underserved populations and programs that coordinate with other youth services. Funds must be used for programs proven to delay sexual activity or increase contraceptive use. The grant-funded teenage pregnancy prevention programs must focus on strategies such as delaying sexual activity, providing sex education, offering preventive health services, and promoting youth development. Programs must also provide medically accurate information on contraceptives and barrier methods to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Entities seeking grants for teenage pregnancy prevention programs must submit applications to the Secretary, demonstrating the ability to cover at least 25% of program costs from non-Federal sources. Grant funds should supplement, not replace, existing funds for teenage pregnancy prevention. The Secretary is responsible for program evaluations. The Secretary is required to conduct evaluations for 10% of programs receiving grants under this section, collect basic data, and submit a report to Congress on grant effectiveness. Grantees must cooperate with evaluations. Definitions for \"medically accurate\" are provided in this section. The term 'medically accurate' refers to information supported by reputable medical, psychological, psychiatric, and public health organizations, published in peer-reviewed journals. 'Rigorous scientific research' involves evaluating impact on sexual behavior, pregnancy, or childbearing using well-designed experiments with adequate sample sizes and follow-up periods. Authorization of Appropriations: $20,000,000 allocated for fiscal year 2006, with additional funding as needed for evaluations in subsequent years."
