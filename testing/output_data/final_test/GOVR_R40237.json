    "content": "The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Forest Service (FS) manage a total of 449 million acres of federal land in the U.S., with BLM overseeing 255.8 million acres and FS managing 192.8 million acres, mainly in the West. Both agencies have similar management responsibilities and face common issues, leading to proposals of merging them. The lands are to be administered for multiple uses, including recreation, range, timber, minerals, watershed, wildlife, and conservation, with a focus on sustained yield. The BLM and FS manage federal lands for sustained yield without impairing productivity. BLM focuses on rangelands and mineral development, while FS manages federal forests and assists nonfederal forest landowners. Both agencies historically focused on different issues, with BLM responsible for land disposal, range management, and minerals development since its creation in 1946. The General Land Office and U.S. Grazing Service were created in 1812 and 1934, respectively. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 consolidated BLM's responsibilities, emphasizing federal ownership of public lands and multiple use management. Congress has debated federal land management and ownership over the years. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Forest Service (FS) manage public lands for multiple uses and sustained yield, ensuring fair market value for resources. BLM oversees energy, mineral development, grazing, recreation, wildlife habitat, and cultural resources. FS, established in 1905, manages national forests for timber, grazing, recreation, wildlife, and water resources in a harmonious manner. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 addresses timber harvesting issues and outlines requirements for land and resource management plans. Wilderness protection is also a key issue for the Forest Service, with the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act authorizing wilderness use on national forest lands. Pressure persists to protect the wilderness character of national forests. The report focuses on issues affecting BLM and FS lands of interest to the 111th Congress, including energy resource access, hardrock mining, wildfire protection, wild horses management, wilderness designation, and NEPA implementation. It does not cover general federal land management issues. Access to federal lands for energy and mineral development has been a controversial issue. A BLM-coordinated study found that a significant portion of oil and gas resources on federal land are classified as \"inaccessible\" for drilling and development. The oil and gas industry argues that accessing these areas is crucial for future domestic energy supplies, while opponents suggest that conservation efforts could achieve similar energy gains. Development of oil, gas, and coal on BLM and FS lands is governed by the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 made significant changes to federal energy resource laws. Geothermal leasing on federal lands is conducted under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970. The BLM administers over 400 geothermal leases on federal lands, with 29 operating power plants generating 1,250 megawatts annually. Development of renewable energy like solar and wind requires large land tracts and new transmission capacity. Environmental impacts of renewable energy production, such as effects on wildlife and sensitive areas, have been controversial. The Bush and Obama Administrations responded to provisions of EPAct05 by issuing oil shale research, development, and demonstration leases on federal lands in Colorado and Utah. The terms for the second round of leases included smaller preference right areas, higher application fees, and diligent development milestones. The BLM also completed a final programmatic environmental impact statement for commercial oil shale development. The BLM issued final rules for commercial oil shale and tar sands leasing, improved processing efficiency for oil and gas permits, and amended leasing procedures for geothermal energy on federal lands. Additionally, the Interior Department amended resource management plans for increased geothermal development on federal land. The BLM has authorized wind energy development on public land, with 29 approved projects totaling 437 MW capacity. Interior Secretary Salazar signed the first offshore commercial wind lease for a 130 turbine wind farm generating 468 MW. The BLM is collaborating with DOE to evaluate solar energy. The BLM is working with the DOE to assess solar energy development on public lands, with a focus on identifying suitable zones for large-scale projects. Secretary Salazar has designated 24 solar energy study areas across six western states. A \"fast-tracking\" process is in place to prioritize promising solar projects, with five projects already approved as of October 2010. As of October 22, 2010, the Secretary of the Interior approved five solar projects on public lands, with plans for construction to begin in 2010. The projects will employ different technologies, such as Suncatcher technology on 6,360 acres for the Imperial Valley Solar Project and photovoltaic solar technology on 422 acres for the Lucerne Valley Solar Project. These projects will benefit from ARRA funding. Another project, the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, is a 370-MW proposal using \"power tower\" technology in San Bernardino County. The project using \"power tower\" technology in San Bernardino County could receive $1.4 billion in funding if construction starts before December 31, 2010. There were 188 pending solar applications as of July 2010. The BLM recommended an oil and gas lease sale in Utah near national parks, leading to a lawsuit filed against them. In January 2009, a lawsuit was filed against the BLM in U.S. district court to prevent the sale of 77 parcels. The court issued a temporary restraining order halting the sale due to inadequate environmental review. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced that the bids on the parcels would not be accepted, and the leases would be withdrawn. An Interior review assessed each parcel to determine their status. The Interior Department Review Team assessed 77 parcels to determine their status. They recommended deferring 52 parcels, leasing 17 parcels, and removing 8 parcels from leasing due to critical resource values. Various bills have been introduced to promote renewable energy development, addressing renewable electricity standards and permitting for energy projects on federal lands. Notable bills include H.R. 2454, S. 523, H.R. 2300, S. 1462, S. 539, and S. 1462, which propose establishing renewable energy zones and conducting studies on renewable energy. The General Mining Law of 1872 grants free access for mineral prospecting on public lands and allows staking a claim upon discovery. There is ongoing debate on whether this law should be reformed to balance mineral development. The mining industry supports the claim-patent system, critics view it as a giveaway of publicly owned resources. Congress has imposed a moratorium on mining claim patents since FY1995. BLM study estimated that 165 million acres of lands with federally owned mineral rights have been withdrawn from mineral entry. The lack of direct statutory authority for environmental protection under the Mining Law of 1872 has spurred reform proposals. Critics argue that current laws do not provide adequate environmental protection for mined areas and call for withdrawal of lands from development under the Mining Law. They also highlight the need for clear legal authority to ensure proper reclamation of mining sites. Administrative efforts have focused on addressing these issues since the late 1990s. Reclamation of mining sites has been a focus of administrative efforts since the late 1990s. Legislation (H.R. 699) introduced in 2009 aims to reform the General Mining Law of 1872 by establishing royalties on mineral production and creating a Locatable Minerals Fund with two accounts for reclamation and community impact assistance. The Hardrock Reclamation Account and the Hardrock Community Impact Assistance Account, administered by the Secretary of the Interior, would be used for reclamation and restoration of land and water from past mining activities, and to facilitate public services to affected communities. Revenues from royalties and fees specified in H.R. 699 would be credited to the Locatable Minerals Fund. The bill also requires a reclamation plan by mineral producers and imposes new environmental standards. A royalty rate of 2-5% based on production value on federal land, excluding mining operations already in production or with approved plans. Royalty revenues go to the Hardrock Minerals Reclamation Fund for restoration in 14 western states and Indian land. A fee of 0.3-1.0% of production value from current mining operations on federal lands would also fund the Reclamation Fund. S. 796 would amend FLPMA for land review. S. 796 would amend FLPMA to include a complete \"review of land\" not later than three years after enactment. The Secretary would have the authority to withdraw land from entry under the General Mining Law of 1872 based on specified criteria and would revise land use plans as appropriate to allow for a withdrawal from operations under the 1872 Mining Law. Additionally, H.R. 3201 would limit the issuance of patents and establish various fees and royalties related to mining operations. H.R. 3201 proposes the creation of an Abandoned Locatable Mine Reclamation Fund funded by fees and royalties. It also establishes an Office of Economic Geology within the Department of the Interior to oversee mineral and energy activities. Additionally, the bill requires mineral assessments, identification of critical commodities, and updates to mineral resource models. The Secretaries of the Interior and Energy are required to convene a national summit on uranium, assess the nation's uranium resources, and provide policy recommendations for private sector uranium development. The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Act of 2009 aims to clean up abandoned hardrock mines by establishing a fund and imposing fees on mining operations on federal land. This includes a 4% royalty on existing hardrock mineral producers, an increase in the annual mining maintenance fee to $300 per claim, and a 0.3% annual reclamation fee on gross annual income from mining on federal lands. In the 111th Congress, hearings were held on the Mining Law reform bill, H.R. 699, and on S. 796 and S. 140 to examine royalty regimes, environmental impacts, and abandoned mine cleanup. Testimony highlighted the need for reclamation fees and royalties to be deposited into the Cleanup Fund. Fire seasons have been increasingly severe with more acres burned. Fire seasons have become more severe in the past decade, with a significant increase in acres burned from 2004-2007 compared to previous years. Wildfire funding now makes up nearly half of the FS budget and has grown for DOI as well. Efforts by the FS and DOI have focused on controlling wildfires and reducing hazardous fuels on federal lands to improve fire control effectiveness and reduce costs and damages. Funding for fuel reduction treatments has also increased. Funding for fuel reduction treatments has increased significantly over the years, reaching $791.1 million in FY2009. Various changes have been made to expedite and reduce the cost of treatments, but the impact on the extent or cost is unclear. Efforts have been made by Congress and the Obama Administration to alter the way funds are provided for fire control costs and wildfire damages. The Obama Administration and Congress have made changes to wildfire funding, proposing a new contingency reserve fund for large wildfire suppression activities in the FY2011 budget. The Administration sought to establish reserve funds and FLAME accounts with appropriations for the FS and DOI. Additionally, a significant decrease in suppression appropriations was proposed for FY2011. In FY2011, there was a proposed decrease in wildfire suppression funding for the FS and DOI, with an increase in preparedness funding for the FS to offset the decrease. The FY2010 budget provided $3.37 billion for wildland fire management, including funding for the FLAME Fund. This was $383.4 million less than the total FY2009 funding. The FLAME Act created separate funds for DOI and FS to address concerns about wildfire funding delaying other agency activities. H.R. 1404 passed the House in 2009, and the Act allows funds to be used for individual fires or after regular fire suppression efforts. The FLAME Act created separate funds for DOI and FS to address concerns about wildfire funding delaying other agency activities. It allows funds to be used for individual fires or after regular fire suppression efforts. The act also requires a cohesive wildfire strategy and the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program was enacted to fund ecological restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program is a diverse, multi-party process for restoring forests and reducing wildfire threats on large-scale landscapes. It established a separate Treasury fund to cover treatment costs on national forests, with annual funding authorized at $40.0 million. The program also requires multi-party monitoring and reporting of activities. The Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 aims to protect these animals on federal land under the BLM and FS jurisdiction. Controversies surround management issues such as determining appropriate herd sizes, removal methods, fertility control, funding adequacy, and the potential for slaughter. Adoption has been the primary method of disposal for healthy animals, with over 224,000 adopted from FY1972 to FY2009. The 108th Congress made controversial changes to wild horse management. The 108th Congress enacted controversial changes to wild horse and burro management on federal lands, allowing for the sale of excess animals deemed too old or unable to be adopted. The changes also removed the ban on selling wild horses and burros for commercial products and eliminated criminal penalties for processing their remains. These changes were seen as a cost-effective way to manage the wild horse population. The new authority allows for the sale of excess wild horses and burros on federal lands, aiming to achieve AMLs, improve animal health, protect range resources, and restore ecological balance. Critics fear it may lead to the slaughter of healthy animals. The BLM had sold over 4,200 animals by August 25, 2010, with approximately 38,400 wild horses and burros on BLM lands as of February 28, 2010. Another 3,620 animals were on FS lands as of September 30, 2008, and an estimated 34,500 more were removed from the range by August 2010. The national AML is 26,582, which some critics argue favors livestock. The BLM manages wild horses and burros, focusing on removal from the range, adoption, and long-term care. Challenges include declining adoptions, slow sales, and high holding costs. The agency planned to remove 11,500 animals in FY2010, adopt out 3,595, and administer fertility control to 750 mares. The program was deemed \"unsustainable\" in 2009, leading to proposals to reduce populations and explore new options. The Secretary announced proposals to reduce wild horse and burro populations, establish wild horse preserves, use fertility control to manage population growth, and avoid euthanasia or unlimited sales of older horses. BLM has taken actions to improve management of wild horses and burros. BLM issued a draft strategy document in response to congressional interest in developing a long-term plan for managing wild horses and burros. The document, available for public comment, contains draft goals, objectives, and actions. BLM also announced a new policy handbook on wild horse and burro management to ensure consistency in setting Appropriate Management Levels (AMLs) across all herds. The BLM has requested an independent review of its wild horse and burro program by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council to ensure the use of best science in management. The review will address population estimates, growth rates, and control methods. A private animal activist bought a ranch in Nevada to create a sanctuary for excess horses and burros to prevent slaughter. A proposal from a proponent is under review by BLM to care for thousands of animals in Nevada. Legislation seeks to prohibit slaughter of wild horses and burros, limit their removal from the range, and remove agency authority to sell excess animals. The bills aim to protect wild horses and burros by only allowing their removal from the range under specific circumstances, such as threats to animal health or safety. They also seek to expand the area available for these animals, establish sanctuaries on public lands, and assess the effects of creating new ranges. The bills aim to protect wild horses and burros by establishing sanctuaries, assessing the effects of creating new ranges, and improving methods for estimating animal populations and implementing fertility control. Annual reports to Congress would provide information on animal populations, range health, and funding needs. The BLM estimated that the cost of holding wild horses and burros in facilities in FY2010 would exceed $38 million, which is more than half of its FY2010 appropriation for management. By FY2011, approximately 45,000 horses will be in holding facilities with a care cost of about $48 million. The FY2010 appropriation for wild horse and burro management was $64.0 million, a $23.4 million increase from FY2009. The increase aimed to achieve AMLs by 2013, cover gathering and holding costs, expand adoptions and sales, and enhance fertility control treatments. The estimated cost of management will be around $85 million in FY2012. In FY2012, management costs for wild horses and burros under BLM will be approximately $85 million. The Obama Administration sought $75.7 million for FY2011, an $11.7 million increase for wild horse and burro management. This increase includes funds for Secretary Salazar's proposals, such as increased fertility control treatments and acquiring lands for a wild horse preserve. The 2011 fiscal year appropriations have not been enacted as of October 20, 2010. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report in October 2008 on BLM management of wild horses and burros. GAO found that the costs of holding animals in facilities could overwhelm the program and that the BLM's options for dealing with unadoptable animals are limited. GAO recommended that the Secretary of the Interior direct the BLM to discuss with Congress how to comply with the 1971 Act. The BLM established the National Landscape Conservation System in 2000 to manage and protect specially designated conservation areas. The system covers 27 million acres of land with various federally recognized units, including national monuments, conservation areas, wilderness areas, and historic trails. The 111th Congress legislatively established the system. The National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) was established by the 111th Congress to manage and protect conservation areas, including national monuments, wilderness areas, and historic trails. Funding for the NLCS has increased over the years, with the Obama Administration requesting $75.0 million for FY2011. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has identified four priorities for managing NLCS lands: conservation, communities, recreation, and education. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has identified four priorities for managing NLCS lands: conservation, communities, recreation, and education. BLM asserts that NLCS lands offer unique opportunities for research in scientific fields such as geology, paleontology, biology, archaeology, and history. A 2007 Science Strategy guides scientific research on NLCS lands, promoting science, standardizing permitting, and integrating findings into management decisions. The Administration is celebrating the 10th anniversary of NLCS with events nationwide, including a science symposium to set goals for the next decade. The Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 established the NLCS legislatively to conserve significant landscapes for future generations. The George W. Bush Administration supported this legislation to provide direction to the BLM and strengthen its conservation system. Concerns were raised about potential restrictions on land use within the NLCS. The Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 established the National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) to conserve significant landscapes for future generations. Concerns were raised about potential restrictions on land use within the NLCS, but the law stated that it does not alter current management practices. The law included provisions to address concerns over how areas in the NLCS are managed, ensuring that it does not change existing authorities or regulations. The Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 established the National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) to conserve significant landscapes for future generations. P.L. 111-11 added 1.2 million acres of new BLM wilderness areas, national monuments, and national conservation areas to the NLCS. Questions about funding adequacy for the NLCS have been recurring. Recent debates have focused on whether funding for management and law enforcement in the National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) is adequate to address vandalism and damage to cultural resources. Some question the need for the system, suggesting other agencies like the National Park Service may be better suited for conservation. The 1964 Wilderness Act established the National Wilderness Preservation System, emphasizing Congress's role in designating federal lands. The National Wilderness Preservation System, designated by Congress, restricts commercial activities, motorized access, and development in wilderness areas. Controversy surrounds agency wilderness studies and designations, as they determine future management. The Clinton Administration's rule protecting national forest roadless areas may have been influenced by Congress's slow designation of wilderness areas. The Bush Administration has issued guidance to prevent additional BLM wilderness study areas. The Bush Administration aimed to open areas with wilderness attributes to development by replacing nationwide protections with a state-petition rule. The Obama Administration has not made general rulings on wilderness and roadless area protection. One key issue is when agencies must review the wilderness potential of their lands, as directed by the Wilderness Act. In 1996, DOI Secretary Bruce Babbitt identified 2.6 million acres in Utah with wilderness qualities. Utah challenged the inventory, leading to new wilderness guidance in 2003. The guidance limited further reviews and protected wilderness characteristics of designated areas. Information on 111th Congress bills for wilderness designation is included in Table 1. The Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, P.L. 111-11, designated wilderness areas totaling 2,050,964 acres. Titles I and II included various wilderness designations in states like West Virginia, Virginia, Oregon, Idaho, and New Mexico. The Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 designated various wilderness areas totaling 2,050,964 acres in states like West Virginia, Virginia, Oregon, Idaho, and New Mexico. This legislation included designations for Sabinoso Wilderness in New Mexico, Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore Wilderness in Michigan, Oregon Badlands Wilderness, Spring Basin Wilderness in Oregon, Eastern Sierra and Northern San Gabriel Wilderness in California, Riverside County Wilderness in California, Sequoia and Kings Canyon Wilderness in California, Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness in Colorado, and Washington County in Utah. Legislation was also passed to broadly modify Wilderness Study Areas. Legislation to modify Wilderness Study Areas was offered in earlier Congresses but not enacted. Potential wilderness areas in the National Forest System were examined in the 1970s and 1980s, with about 60 million acres inventoried as \"roadless\" areas. In 2001, the Clinton Administration implemented a nationwide rule for roadless areas, limiting road building and timber cutting. The Bush Administration later introduced the state-petition rule, allowing governors to petition for special rules for roadless areas in their state. The state-petition rule was challenged in court, but states were still allowed to petition for special rules. The Bush Administration allowed states to petition for special rules for roadless areas under the Administrative Procedure Act. Idaho and Colorado filed petitions for managing their roadless areas. A final rule for Idaho was published in 2008, while a modified Colorado petition was accepted in 2010. Critics fear the Colorado petition could set a dangerous precedent for roadless forests. The Secretary issued directives reserving authority for road building and timber harvesting in roadless areas, with exceptions for Idaho and potentially Colorado. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to make the nationwide rule law. The House and Senate bills, H.R. 3692 and S. 1738, establish a nationwide policy to protect roadless areas from development. They differ in how they define roadless areas, with the House bill referencing the final environmental document and the Senate bill using a roadless area map. Legal battles have ensued over the enforcement of these rules, with conflicting decisions from different courts. In July 2003, the U.S. District Court for Wyoming halted the nationwide rule, which was later vacated by the Tenth Circuit due to mootness. In September 2006, the U.S. District Court for Northern California ruled the state-petition rule violated NEPA and the Endangered Species Act, reinstating the nationwide rule. The Ninth Circuit upheld this decision in August 2009, but the Tongass National Forest exemption is in question. Litigation in the Ninth and Tenth Circuits aimed to establish or nullify the nationwide rule. The U.S. District Court for Wyoming held the nationwide rule violated NEPA and the Wilderness Act, enjoining it. The court's decision is being appealed in the Tenth Circuit, potentially leading to conflicting judicial orders for the Forest Service. To avoid this dilemma, a Supreme Court ruling, congressional decision, or new administrative rule may be needed. The Forest Service has historically exempted certain activities from environmental impact analysis under NEPA, citing \"categorical exclusions\" to expedite actions and reduce costs. However, opponents argue that some excluded actions could have significant impacts and should undergo public scrutiny. In 2008, the FS shifted NEPA policies from the Forest Service Handbook to the Code of Federal Regulations, modifying some provisions in the process. The Forest Service has made changes to NEPA policies, including allowing incremental alternative development and limiting consideration of cumulative impacts. They have expanded the types of activities exempt from environmental review and modified the application of extraordinary circumstances. The Forest Service has made changes to NEPA policies, including allowing incremental alternative development and limiting consideration of cumulative impacts. The new rule gives the responsible official discretion to determine whether extraordinary circumstances warrant NEPA analysis and public involvement in otherwise exempt projects. The FS issued new regulations changing its notice, comment, and appeals procedures for land management planning, including a change that a decision to use a CE could not be administratively appealed. Few measures pertaining to CEs are introduced each Congress, with none addressing FS use of CEs in the 111th Congress as of October 19, 2010. Some CE regulations have been challenged in court, but the new appeals regulations remain in place, except that the FS cannot use the hazardous fuels reduction CE. In 2005, a California federal court ruled that the Forest Service Decision Making and Appeals Reform Act was violated by excluding decisions from the public comment and appeals process. The Ninth Circuit reversed most challenges to the regulations, except for a section that prohibited appeals for CE projects. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled that the parties lacked standing to challenge the rule, effectively reinstating it. In January 2007, the U.S. District Court for Alabama upheld new CE types for fire management and limited timber harvesting, finding compliance with NEPA. However, other legal challenges were deemed not ripe for review. The hazardous fuels reduction CE was halted by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in December 2007 for violating NEPA. The Ninth Circuit Court found in favor of the Forest Service in cases involving NEPA reviews, acknowledging the lower court's scrutiny of FS actions. The court emphasized deferring to the FS's expertise and approved the FS's assessment of impacts on wildlife populations in a hazardous fuels reduction project. The court also supported the FS's reliance on qualified scientists' studies for viability conclusions. However, the court noted that NFMA was not followed in a case involving commercial logging and prescribed burns. The Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA) allows for the sale or exchange of BLM lands identified for disposal under land use plans. The law aims to reconfigure land ownership patterns for better resource management and administrative efficiency. The authority briefly expired in 2010 but was extended for one year. The 111th Congress needs to decide whether to retain this authority. The 111th Congress needs to decide whether to retain the authority of the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA), which allows for the sale or exchange of BLM lands. Proceeds from land sales are split between the state and a Treasury account for acquiring nonfederal lands adjacent to federal lands. BLM has used this authority to sell 309 parcels totaling 29,437 acres since FLTFA was enacted. Since the enactment of FLTFA, BLM has sold 309 parcels totaling 29,437 acres for approximately $113.4 million. Acquisitions by the agencies have been smaller, with 28 parcels acquired totaling 16,738 acres for about $43.8 million. The Obama Administration supported making FLTFA permanent and using current land management plans for land sales or exchanges. The George W. Bush Administration also backed using updated land management plans for these decisions. The changing nature of land use plans has prompted interest in amending FLTFA to allow the most current land use plans to be used as the basis of land disposals. BLM has completed 86 new or revised plans from 2001 to FY2009, with 34 more plans anticipated in FY2011. FLTFA sales authority was not tied to future land use plans due to concerns about potential misuse for fund generation. Under FLPMA, BLM is authorized to sell certain tracts of land if they meet specified criteria, but land use plan revisions since 2000 have not significantly changed identified acreage for disposal. A 2008 GAO report found that BLM had not prioritized selling lands under FLTFA. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to amend FLTFA, with H.R. 3339 proposing to make it permanent and S. 1787 seeking a 10-year extension. Both bills would allow updated land management plans to be used for identifying lands for disposal and exchange. The Senate and House bills propose different language regarding the use of updated land use plans. Other pending legislation aims to reinstate funds that were in the FLTFA account when the law briefly expired in 2010. Both bills specify that the balance in the FLTFA account as of July 24, 2010, is to be reinstated for FLTFA purposes. BLM estimates nearly $52 million was in the account. H.R. 6206 and S. 3762 were introduced in 2010 to address the FLTFA account balance of nearly $52 million. The bills do not propose changes to the allocation of land sale proceeds, which has been a topic of debate. One proposal from the Bush Administration suggested depositing 70% of net proceeds into the Treasury's general fund to reduce the federal deficit and increase oversight. The debate over the allocation of land sale proceeds has been ongoing, with proposals to change the allocation to reduce oversight and increase funds for land acquisition. However, concerns have been raised about reducing funds for land acquisition during a time of declining funds from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. There have been discussions about using some funds for other federal lands purposes and whether to retain the requirement that funds be used in the state where they were generated. GAO has noted challenges in acquiring priority lands in states that sell relatively little land due to this requirement. Currently, most revenue for land acquisitions is available in Nevada. In 2009, GAO testified that Nevada has generated the most revenue from land sales, accounting for approximately 78% of the total revenue raised. The pace of land acquisitions has increased, with agencies spending $43.8 million out of $108.9 million in the FLTFA account. Challenges include the time, cost, and complexity of acquisitions. The GAO has identified challenges in land acquisitions, including time, cost, and complexity, as well as difficulties in finding willing sellers and insufficient staff. The Forest Service is required to prepare land management plans with public involvement, multiple use, and sustainability in accordance with the NFMA. Regulations for forest planning were adopted in 1979 and revised in 1982, with emphasis on biological sustainability during the Clinton Administration. The Bush Administration delayed implementation of these rules. The Bush Administration replaced the Clinton rules for national forest planning in 2005, aiming to balance biological and socioeconomic sustainability. The 2008 Bush rules reduced regulatory guidelines and altered public input in the planning process. Plans were exempted from NEPA and ESA, viewed as guides for decision-making. After the 2008 rule was rejected, a new planning rule was announced in 2009. The Forest Service is currently using the 2000 Clinton planning rules while developing the new rule. The agency conducted public meetings from March to May 2010 after the notice of intent closed in February 2010. The Bush planning rules were challenged in court for reducing environmental protection without adequate public comment. The court remanded the rules in 2007 for violating NEPA, ESA, and APA. The Forest Service reissued the 2005 rule as a proposed rule to comply with the court's requirements. The Forest Service issued final planning rules in April 2008, which were invalidated by the court in June 2009 for not complying with NEPA and ESA. The court found that the rules did not allow for adequate public comment and consideration of endangered species."
