    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Quarantining the Ayatollah's State-Sponsored Aggression and Militancy (QASSAM) Act.\" It includes a section on Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps watch list and report, with findings outlined in Section 101. The QASSAM Act outlines findings regarding the threat posed by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to US national security and allies. The IRGC sponsors terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah, supports the Assad regime in Syria, and commits human rights violations. The US maintains sanctions against the IRGC for its terrorist activities and human rights abuses. The Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury includes the IRGC on the SDN list, which blocks assets of entities in which the IRGC owns a 50 percent or greater interest. This regulation, known as the \"50 percent rule\", is used to determine ownership of entities controlled by sanctioned persons. The IRGC maintains a powerful presence in Iran's financial, commercial, and oil sectors, controlling Iranian entities and generating billions of dollars in revenue. It practices sanctions evasion and deceptive business practices to conceal its ownership of entities not on the SDN list. The IRGC, despite not being on the SDN list due to ownership below 50 percent, controls Iranian entities and engages in deceptive practices. As Iran opens up to international commerce, it is crucial to identify all IRGC-influenced entities, even those not meeting SDN list criteria. SEC. 102. Imposition of sanctions against entities owned by IRGC. The President will impose sanctions on entities in which Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps owns a 20 percent or greater interest. Sanctions include blocking transactions involving the entity's property in the United States or under the control of a U.S. person. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act requirements do not apply to this section. Definitions include \"person\" as an individual or entity, and \"United States person\" as a citizen, lawful resident, or entity organized under U.S. laws. SEC. 103. IRGC WATCH LIST AND REPORT.\n\nThe Secretary of the Treasury will establish and publish a list in the Federal Register of entities related to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. This list, known as the \"IRGC Watch List,\" will include entities where the IRGC owns less than 20% interest or influences actions. The Secretary will submit an annual report to Congress on any changes to this list. SEC. 104. DEFINITIONS. The term \"entity\" includes corporations, business associations, partnerships, trusts, and societies. The term \"IRGC\" refers to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. TITLE II--OTHER PROVISIONS SEC. 201. AUTHORITY OF STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DIVEST FROM COMPANIES ENGAGING WITH IRAN'S REVOLUTIONARY GUARD CORPS. States and local governments have the authority to divest from entities involved in investment or business activities with the IRGC. It is the sense of Congress that the United States should support State or local governments that divest from or prohibit investment in entities engaging with Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. States and local governments have the authority to divest from such entities based on credible information available to them. The government can engage in investment or business activities with Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps or its related companies if they have a financial investment, ownership, or provide credit to these entities. The State or local government must provide written notice, allow a 90-day period before applying measures, and offer an opportunity for written comments to individuals involved in investment or business activities with Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps-related company. The measure shall not apply to a person engaging in business or investment activities with Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps or related companies. Congress urges State or local governments to avoid mistakenly targeting individuals and notify the Department of Justice within 30 days of adopting a measure. The government must notify the Attorney General about any measures taken. State or local government measures are not preempted by federal laws. Definitions include 'assets' as public funds and 'investment' as specified. The section outlines the definition of 'investment' and the effective date of measures adopted by State or local governments. It also includes authorization for measures enacted before the Act's enactment date. A State or local government can enforce a measure allowing divestment or prohibiting investment in entities doing business with Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, regardless of certain requirements. The text discusses the application of notice requirements for investment activities related to Iran, with a rule of construction to clarify the authority of states in issuing rules for financial institutions. The table of contents for the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 is amended by adding a new section after section 312. Title III of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 includes the termination clause stating that the Act and its amendments will end 30 days after the President certifies under the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010."
