    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preventing Regulatory Overreach To Enhance Care Technology Act of 2014\" or the \"PROTECT Act of 2014\". It includes findings and a sense of Congress. The mobile health and mobile application economy in the United States is growing rapidly, with a market expected to exceed $26 billion by 2017. This industry has created nearly 500,000 new jobs and has the potential to transform healthcare delivery through technology innovation. There is a need for a new risk-based framework for oversight of clinical and health software due to the fast-paced evolution of these technologies. A working group identified major barriers to regulating health information technology that require changes to existing law. Congress believes intervention is necessary to improve interagency coordination and focus on fostering innovation while protecting patient safety. The President and Congress should collaborate to establish a risk-based regulatory framework for clinical and health software to promote innovation and enhance patient safety. The National Institute of Standards and Technology should oversee technical standards for clinical software in partnership with other relevant agencies. The National Coordinator for Health Information Technology should collaborate with nongovernmental entities to develop certification processes and promote best practice standards for health information technology beyond current oversight efforts. SEC. 3. CLINICAL SOFTWARE AND HEALTH SOFTWARE. The term 'clinical software' refers to software intended for human or animal use that analyzes clinical data and may recommend clinical actions, but does not directly affect the body. 'Health software' is software that captures, analyzes, changes, or presents patient information. The term 'clinical software' and 'health software' refer to software that captures, analyzes, changes, or presents patient information, excluding software that directly diagnoses patients or provides treatment advice without a healthcare provider's intervention. The text prohibits clinical software from providing treatment advice directly to a healthcare provider. Clinical software and health software are exempt from regulation under the Act. The definition of device does not include clinical software or health software."
