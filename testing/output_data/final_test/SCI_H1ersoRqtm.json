    "content": "The study introduces a framework that combines sequence encoders with graph components to improve summarization tasks in natural language processing. The hybrid sequence-graph models outperform pure sequence and graph models in summarizing tasks by capturing long-distance relationships in weakly structured data like text. Automatic summarization involves condensing complex input while retaining core semantics through machine learning techniques. The study introduces a framework combining sequence encoders with graph components to enhance summarization tasks in natural language processing. Recent advancements in sequence-to-sequence models have improved performance by focusing on the decoder, incorporating attention mechanisms and copying facilities. Standard encoders like bidirectional LSTMs struggle with long texts and distractions, prompting the need for improved sequence encoders compatible with various decoder choices. The study proposes a hybrid model combining sequence encoders with graph neural networks to address the long-distance relationship problem in natural language processing. By extending the idea of modeling highly-structured data using graphs to weakly-structured data like natural language, the model outperforms baselines using pure sequence or graph-based representations. The study introduces a hybrid model that combines sequence encoders with graph neural networks to improve natural language processing tasks. The model's contributions include extending standard sequence encoder models with a graph component, applying this extension to various sequence models, and releasing code and data for evaluation. The METHODNAMING dataset involves predicting the name of a function or method in source code. Three summarization tasks are considered, including one for less structured inputs. The tasks aim to translate long sequences into shorter ones while preserving meaning. The METHODNAMING dataset involves predicting function or method names in source code, which are composed of subtokens. Method names provide a concise summary of a function's functionality, with 33% of subtokens directly copied from the source code. The source code's structured input data with known semantics supports name prediction. The METHODDOC task aims to predict a brief description of a method's functionality based on its source code. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of generating method documentation, which differs from method names in terms of length and content. It also touches on abstractive summarization in NLP research, focusing on creating novel summaries from text inputs like news articles. In NLP summarization, text is treated as sequences of sentences and words. The task is recast as a structured summarization problem by incorporating linguistic structures like named entities and coreferences. Standard neural approaches follow a sequence-to-sequence framework, using token representations for attention mechanisms or pointer networks. An extension of sequence encoders leverages relationships among elements in the input data. In NLP summarization, text is treated as sequences of sentences and words. The task is recast as a structured summarization problem by incorporating linguistic structures like named entities and coreferences. Standard neural approaches follow a sequence-to-sequence framework, using token representations for attention mechanisms or pointer networks. An extension of sequence encoders leverages relationships among elements in the input data by combining sequence encoders with graph neural networks (GNNs). This involves using a standard sequential encoder to obtain per-token representations, which are then fed into a GNN for further processing. The resulting per-node representations can be used by an unmodified decoder, surpassing models that use only sequential or graph structures. Gated Graph Neural Networks are used to process graphs, summarizing core concepts of GGNNs. In graph neural networks, nodes are associated with real-valued vectors representing features, and information is propagated through the graph using neural message passing. Each node sends messages to its neighbors using an edge-type dependent function, and new states are computed by aggregating incoming messages. Gated recurrent units are used for updating node states. In graph neural networks, nodes have real-valued feature vectors, and information is passed through the graph using neural message passing. Gated recurrent units update node states. The novel combination of GGNNs and standard sequence encoders involves taking a sequence and binary relationships between elements to construct a sequence GNN. The choice and construction of relationships are dataset-dependent. In graph neural networks, nodes have real-valued feature vectors, and information is passed through the graph using neural message passing. The weighted averaging mechanism is used to compute a graph-level representation for each node in the graph. This method can be extended to support additional nodes not present in the original sequence. Processing large graphs efficiently requires overcoming engineering challenges. Processing large graphs efficiently requires overcoming engineering challenges, such as flattening graphs into a single graph with disconnected components in a minibatch. To handle varying graph sizes, attention and copying mechanisms in the decoder compute a softmax over memories without padding by associating nodes with sample indices. TensorFlow's unsorted segment operations enable an efficient softmax computation over variable representations. Sequence GNNs are evaluated on tasks compared to models using only sequence or graph information. In this study, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are evaluated on three tasks, comparing them to models using only sequence or graph information and task-specific baselines. The tasks, baselines, and data presentation to the models are discussed before analyzing the results. Two datasets are considered for the METHODNAMING task, one from Java projects and another from C# projects mined from GitHub. Performance is measured using the F1 score over generated subtokens. The study evaluates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on various tasks, comparing them to models using sequence or graph information and task-specific baselines. The quality of results is assessed using ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L scores, with a comparison to the current state of the art and a sequence-to-sequence implementation. Different encoders and decoders are combined, including bidirectional LSTM and GNN extensions, with attention mechanisms and pointer network-style copying. Self-attention is also considered as an alternative to RNN-based sequence encoding.

Self-attention is considered as an alternative to RNN-based sequence encoding. Identifier tokens in the source code are broken into subtokens for information extraction. Models are provided with all subtokens of a method, with the method name replaced by a placeholder symbol. To construct a graph from identifier tokens in source code, additional nodes are introduced for each token and connected using INTOKEN and NEXTTOKEN edges. Nodes for parse tree are added with CHILD edges. LASTLEXICALUSE edges connect identifiers to their recent use. Evaluation on Python dataset showed overfitting, so a new dataset of 23 C# projects was used instead. We evaluated our new dataset of 23 open-source C# projects by measuring BLEU, F1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores. The models used were the same as for the METHODNAMING task, with similar configuration and data representation. The comparison was made with a sequence-to-sequence model with attention and copying, but with an improved decoder component. The contribution focuses on improving the encoder component of the model, using a bidirectional LSTM encoder and a GNN extension. The decoder includes an LSTM with attention and a pointer network-style copying mechanism. Data is tokenized using Stanford CoreNLP and named entities are extracted for graph construction. The text describes the process of constructing a graph for summarization by extracting named entities, running coreference resolution, and connecting tokens and sentences. The goal is to annotate important relationships for summarization, with a focus on multi-token named entities. Dependency parse edges were initially considered but found to be not beneficial. Annotations from CoreNLP may contain errors. The text discusses the influence of errors in annotations from CoreNLP on the performance of a method using hybrid sequence GNN encoders for named entity recognition and coreference resolution. Results show the advantage of GNN-augmented models over pure sequence encoders, with improvements in performance on various tasks. The effects of encoder and decoder configurations are shown to be largely independent. The augmentation with graph data improves the BLEU score but worsens the results on ROUGE due to shorter predictions. An ablation study using only graph information shows inferior performance compared to a pure sequenced model. The model with 10 timesteps for GNN propagation performs less well. Our experiments on NLSUMMARIZATION show that our model, originally designed for structured code tasks, is competitive with specialized models for natural language tasks. Despite some gaps in performance, we attribute this to our simplistic decoder and training objective. Ablations in TAB1 demonstrate the impact of our approach. Additionally, we compare our model's performance with baselines, noting slight discrepancies due to hyperparameter optimization. Evaluating CoreNLP's linguistic structure enhancement, we explore coreference and entity features. The CoreNLP linguistic structure enhancements were tested on the baseline BILSTM \u2192 LSTM + POINTER model, showing minimal improvements. The graph-based encoder outperformed the biLSTM encoder in utilizing structured information. Removing linguistic structure still improved the model, indicating the GNN's effectiveness. Long-range dependency edges further enhanced performance, even without linguistic structure. The model showed minor improvements using only syntactical information without semantic parse. Sample suggestions in the dataset highlighted interesting aspects and failure cases. N'golo Kante is attracting interest from Arsenal, Newcastle, and Southampton, with Marseille also keen on signing him for around \u00a35 million. N'golo Kante is wanted by Arsenal, Newcastle, Southampton, and Marseille for around \u00a35 million. The difficulty of the task lies in the large number of distractors and the need to identify the most relevant parts of the input. The model produces typical results on the task, illustrating the challenges of identifying relationships and information flow between variables. The model produces natural-looking summaries with no negative impact on language fluency. The GNN-based model captures central named entities in articles, benefiting from long-distance relationship links. However, it still suffers from information repetition. Future improvements could include considering coverage and optimizing for ROUGE-L scores directly. Recent work in abstractive summarization focuses on using deep learning models with attention to generate concise summaries from input text. Approaches like BID32 and BID39 extend this idea by incorporating pointer networks to allow for token copying. While deep sequence networks can learn natural language structure, experiments suggest that explicitly exposing this structure improves performance. Improved training objectives, such as tracking input document coverage, have been proposed to enhance summarization techniques. Recent work in abstractive summarization has focused on using deep learning models with attention to generate concise summaries from input text. Experiments suggest that explicitly exposing language structure improves performance. Graph-based models have also been explored in natural language processing, such as using graph convolutional networks for single sentence encoding and assisting machine translation. Other approaches involve creating graphs over named entities in documents to aid question answering. In future work, there is interest in combining these efforts with the graph-augmented encoder discussed. In contrast to previous work using AMRs, we directly encode simple relationships on tokenized text for summarization. Future directions may involve combining our encoder with richer graph structures. Previous studies have explored summarization in source code through methods like method naming prediction using various models. The curr_chunk discusses encoding paths from the syntax tree of a program for accuracy in method naming. Various approaches on source code are mentioned, including using tree structures and tree recurrent neural networks. Additional structure on related tasks in source code, such as learned traversals of the syntax tree and graph-based approaches, have also been studied. The curr_chunk introduces a framework for enhancing sequence encoders with a graph component to improve performance on summarization tasks. The integration of mixed sequence-graph modeling shows promising results across various tasks in formal and natural languages. The key insight is that explicit relationship modeling can boost practical performance effectively. The dataset used for the study is BID4, with 106,065 training samples, 1,943 validation samples, and 1,937 test samples. Some samples in the validation and test sets have identical documentation as the training set. Table 4 shows the statistics of the extracted graphs from the Java method naming dataset of BID4."
