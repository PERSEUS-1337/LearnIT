    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Middle East Peace Compliance Act of 2001\". Congress finds that in 1993, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat made commitments to recognize Israel's right to exist, accept UN resolutions for peace, and engage in peaceful negotiations for a lasting resolution in the Middle East. The PLO renounces terrorism and violence, assumes responsibility over its elements, and affirms acceptance of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The PLO renounces terrorism, accepts Resolutions 242 and 338, and declares certain articles of the Palestinian Covenant invalid. The Palestinian Authority was established through agreements with Israel in 1993. The US Congress allows the President to lift restrictions on the PLO if they uphold their commitments. The section discusses reports. The President is required to submit a report to Congress detailing the PLO or Palestinian Authority's compliance with commitments, investigating and prosecuting those responsible for violence, and assessing overall compliance. The President must submit a report to Congress on progress in designating the PLO or its constituent groups as foreign terrorist organizations. The initial report is due within 30 days of the Act's enactment, with subsequent reports to align with the PLO Commitments Compliance Act of 1989. The text chunk \"SEC. 4. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS.\" is a concise statement indicating the imposition of sanctions. If the President determines that the PLO or Palestinian Authority has not complied with commitments, sanctions may include suspending US assistance to the West Bank and Gaza, except for humanitarian aid, and imposing visa denials on PLO and Palestinian Authority officials. The President has the authority to downgrade the status of the PLO office in the United States, prohibiting it from carrying out any functions other than those prior to the Oslo Accord. Sanctions may include suspending US assistance to the West Bank and Gaza and imposing visa denials on PLO and Palestinian Authority officials. The President can impose sanctions on the PLO office in the US, limiting its functions. Sanctions last for 6 months or until conditions change. The President can waive sanctions if it's in the national security interest and report to Congress. SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE; TERMINATION DATE. This Act will be effective upon enactment and will expire 5 years later."
