    "content": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a technique to train an agent for a specific task, but it limits the agent to only that task. A new method is proposed to allow the agent to discover a range of tasks it can perform in its environment. This method uses a generator network to propose tasks for the agent to achieve, optimizing the tasks for the agent's level of difficulty. This approach automatically creates a curriculum of tasks for the agent to learn. The method automatically generates tasks for the agent to learn, enabling it to efficiently achieve a wide range of tasks without prior knowledge of the environment. It can handle tasks with sparse rewards, a challenge for traditional RL methods. RL has shown impressive results in various domains, such as defeating a Go champion, outperforming humans in Atari games, and completing complex robotics tasks. In real-world environments, robots need to perform a diverse set of tasks. The algorithm focuses on maximizing the average success rate of the agent over all possible goals by allowing the agent to generate its own reward functions. This approach enables the agent to efficiently achieve a wide range of tasks without prior knowledge of the environment. The Goal GAN framework allows an agent to quickly learn a policy that reaches all feasible goals in its environment without prior knowledge. It automatically creates a curriculum by generating goals slightly more difficult than what the agent already knows. This method significantly improves the sample efficiency of learning to reach all feasible goals. Our method efficiently handles multi-task learning in various environments, including navigation and manipulation, by dynamically adjusting the goal sampling distribution to ensure appropriate difficulty levels. This approach eliminates the need for manual reward function modifications and improves sample efficiency. Our method for efficient multi-task learning generates a training curriculum directly in continuous task space, utilizing intrinsic motivation to explore parameterized task spaces. Competence-based intrinsic motivation and other formulations have also been explored, but our approach demonstrates more efficient space exploration. Our formulation of intrinsic motivation directly relates to policy performance, motivating the agent to train on tasks that push its capabilities. Curriculum learning involves presenting tasks optimally to agents during training, with hand-designed curricula being common in prior works. Our method trains a policy that generalizes to a set of continuously parameterized tasks and performs well even under sparse rewards by not allocating training effort to tasks that are too hard for the current performance of the agent. In contrast to previous work, our approach focuses on efficiently optimizing a policy across a range of goals in reinforcement learning. The agent's objective is to find a policy that maximizes the expected return by taking actions based on the current state and transition probabilities. In reinforcement learning, the goal is to optimize a policy across a range of goals by maximizing the expected return for different reward functions. Each goal corresponds to a set of states where the agent aims to act optimally. A simple reward function measures goal achievement based on a distance metric in goal space. This method can handle various goals efficiently. Our method can handle generic binary rewards without requiring a distance metric for learning. The MDP is defined so that each episode terminates when the agent reaches a specific set of states. Policies are conditioned on the current goal, and the expected return is based on the probability of succeeding on each goal within a certain number of timesteps. The sparse indicator reward function is simple and applicable to many real-world goal problems. In real-world goal problems, it can be challenging to gauge progress towards a goal but easy to determine when the goal is achieved. Using a sparse indicator reward function, the method aims to learn policies that achieve high rewards for various goals without the need for a distance metric. The focus is on reaching the goal state, and the approach is effective even with sparse rewards. The overall objective is to find a policy that maximizes the average probability of success over all goals sampled from a test distribution. A continuous goal-space representation is needed for efficient generalization, where a policy trained on a set of goals can interpolate to other goals within that area. Our approach involves labeling goals based on difficulty for the current policy, training a generator to output new goals at the appropriate difficulty level, and using these new goals to efficiently train the policy until convergence. Our approach involves modifying the distribution of sampled goals during training to optimize the coverage objective. We aim to train the policy on goals that provide a minimum expected return, ensuring the agent receives enough reward signal for learning without repeatedly sampling from mastered goals. Our approach involves training the policy on goals that still need improvement by setting a maximum level of performance. We aim to efficiently maximize the coverage objective by estimating labels for each goal based on policy performance. This allows us to generate more goals that belong to the set of goals we are focusing on. The approach involves training the policy on goals that need improvement by setting a maximum level of performance. An adversarial training procedure called \"goal GAN\" is introduced to sample new goals uniformly from a distribution. This modification allows training the generative model with positive and negative examples, improving accuracy despite limited positive samples. The choice of GANs for goal generation is motivated by their potential to train from negative examples and generate high-dimensional samples. In high-dimensional goal spaces, a \"goal generator\" neural network is used to generate goals from a noise vector. A \"goal discriminator\" network is trained to distinguish goals in a specific set. The approach is based on the Least Squares GAN method with modifications for training from negative examples. The original hyperparameters from previous research are utilized, resulting in significant improvement. The LSGAN approach improves training stability over vanilla GAN and is comparable to WGAN BID2. The value function V(D) has three terms instead of two, with the discriminator trained to discriminate between real and generated goals. The generator aims to match the distribution of real goals. Algorithm 1 outlines the process of training a policy to maximize coverage objective by generating goals using noise vectors and training with RL using TRPO algorithm. The policy's performance on these goals determines their labels, which are then used to train the goal generator and discriminator in a GAN framework. The algorithm described outlines the process of training a policy to maximize coverage objective by generating goals using noise vectors and training with RL using TRPO algorithm. The generated goals are used to compute the Monte Carlo estimate of expectations with respect to the distribution p data. Our method efficiently finds a policy that optimizes the coverage objective by generating goals in order of increasing difficulty, creating a curriculum of goals as a by-product. Our method generates a curriculum of goals automatically without prior knowledge of the environment or tasks. Experimental results show faster maximization of the coverage objective and dynamic sampling of goals of appropriate difficulty. The method is tested in challenging robotic locomotion tasks with a low-dimensional space of feasible goals. In a study on how the method scales with state-space dimension, the Goal GAN method is compared against four baselines, including Uniform Sampling and methods adapted from literature. An ablation and oracle are provided to understand the importance of sampling \"good\" goals. The ablation GAN method involves training on all goals attempted in the previous iteration, gradually expanding the set of goals. The oracle samples goals uniformly from the state-space, keeping only those that meet specific criteria. This method is more costly but provides an upper-bound for performance estimation. Tested in challenging environments, such as navigating a free space or a maze, the method aims to reach specified goals. In challenging environments like navigating a maze, the task involves reaching a goal within a 2-dimensional space. Training on goals generated by a Goal GAN improves policy training efficiency compared to baselines, as shown in Figs. 2a-FIG0. The method leads to faster training, with the Uniform Sampling baseline performing poorly due to wasted samples on infeasible goals. Training on infeasible goals leads to poor performance as the agent does not receive a learning signal. Adding an L2 loss results in the agent getting stuck in a poor local optima. Other baselines perform better but still do not surpass the method's performance. Asymmetric Self-play requires training the goal-generating policy at every outer iteration, making it less sample-efficient. SAGG-RIAC's partition of the goal-space becomes biased towards certain areas, reducing exploration and slowing down policy expansion. The adaptation of methods to the problem is detailed in Appendices F.1 and F.2. Analyzing the efficiency of the method, the shift in goal distribution and policy coverage improvement are studied in Ant navigation experiments. Generated goals concentrate on areas needing improvement in the maze. The Goal GAN dynamically shifts to sample goals of appropriate difficulty, with around 20% being \"good goals.\" Ablation studies show the importance of generating \"good goals\" for efficient learning, with methods that disregard labels performing worse. Rejection Sampling oracle is used to sample from the set of \"good\" goals. In Section 4.1, the Goal GAN approximates the distribution of \"good\" goals for sampling. Comparing it to rejection sampling, which is much less efficient but provides an upper performance bound, shows that the Goal GAN's performance is close. Real-world RL problems have lower-dimensional feasible states due to environmental constraints, making uniformly sampling goals from the full state-space inefficient. In higher-dimensional environments, the feasible space for the N-dimensional Point Mass is a small subset of the full state-space, with the agent receiving a reward when it moves within a certain distance of the goal state. The volume ratio of the embedded space to the full state space decreases as the embedding dimension increases. The volume ratio of the embedded space to the full state space decreases as N increases, down to 0.00023:1 for 6 dimensions. Our method outperforms others as dimension increases, with Goal GAN generating feasible goals. The GAN fit all variation suffers in higher dimensions by not tracking the feasible region effectively. The Goal GAN successfully discovers the feasible subset of the goal space in a simple task where the optimal policy is to go straight towards the goal. A new paradigm in RL is proposed where a single policy is trained to succeed on various goals under sparse rewards, using automatic curriculum generation that adapts to the agent's performance. Generative adversarial training is used to generate goals of appropriate difficulty levels. In future research, combining goal-proposing strategies with multi-goal approaches like HER could improve goal selection. Building hierarchy on top of a multi-task policy by training a higher-level policy to output goals is another promising direction. Introducing hierarchy could involve using architectures that learn to build implicit plans or leveraging expert demonstrations to extract sub-goals. These approaches have not yet addressed the multi-task learning problem formulated in this work. Additionally, saving a list of goals in a \"regularized replay buffer\" is also part of the training process. In addition to saving goals in a \"regularized replay buffer,\" goals from previous iterations are also used to train the policy to prevent forgetting. Goals for training are sampled from the Goal GAN and replay buffer, with new goals inserted further away to prevent concentration in a small goal space. The goal generator is initialized to produce an initial set of goals before training begins. The goal generator is initialized to output achievable goals for the initial policy to prevent slow training due to sparse rewards. The generator is trained to match the state-visitation distribution of easily achievable states visited by the initial policy. The goal generator is initialized to output achievable goals for the initial policy to prevent slow training due to sparse rewards. This is achieved through traditional GAN training with the ant having 8 actuated joints. The environment in Mujoco BID21 includes joint angles and velocities in the agent's observation. Navigation is complex due to high degrees of freedom, requiring motor coordination. In the goal-oriented version of the Ant, the observation is appended with the goal vector and distance. The objective in Free Ant experiments is to reach any point in the square. The Free Ant experiments aim to reach any point in a square within a maze environment. Goals are sampled from a uniform grid, with a maximum of 500 time-steps given to reach each goal. The N-dim point mass has 400 timesteps to reach the goal, with observations including position and velocity. Noise is added to the goal dimensions sampled from a generator. The generator adds noise to the goals sampled from a normal distribution. The policy is trained for 5 iterations, each with 100 episodes. The GAN is trained for 200 iterations, alternating between training the discriminator and the generator. The generator receives 4-dimensional noise as input. The goal generator and discriminator have specific hidden layer configurations. The policy neural network takes the goal and agent observations as input, with specific hidden layer configurations. The final hidden layer outputs accelerations in N dimensions. Policy optimization uses a discount factor of 0.998 and GAE lambda of 0.995. TRPO with Generalized Advantage Estimation is used for training. Each \"update policy\" consists of 5 iterations. Goals are labeled by estimating expected return through rollouts of the current policy. Rollouts from the most recent policy update are used for labeling to improve sample efficiency. This approximation does not significantly impact learning. The method requires more samples to estimate learning progress accurately, comparing different metrics for building a curriculum. Results show similar learning outcomes for Ant navigation tasks with sparse rewards. Our Goal GAN method efficiently generates goals for a robotic quadruped in free space, producing a growing circle around the origin as the policy learns to move the ant to nearby points. Visualization of policy performance in different parts of the state space shows varying success rates indicated by color. Our Goal GAN method efficiently tracks multi-modal distributions of good goals in a new maze environment with multiple paths. The Ant agent is replaced by a point-mass environment, aiming to learn a policy that can reach any feasible goal. The method produces a multi-modal distribution over goals, tracking areas of appropriate difficulty levels. Samples from the regularized replay buffer contribute to the spread of \"High Reward\" goals. The Goal GAN generates a multi-modal distribution of good goals in a maze environment with multiple paths. It does not require prior knowledge of the distribution to fit and consistently reaches full coverage in the problem. The method can be applied to different problems, like the one presented in the paper. The Goal GAN generates diverse goals in a maze environment. The method proposed by BID17 can be applied with TRPO for goal-directed exploration. The algorithm involves sampling new goals, collecting rollouts, and optimizing parameters. UpdateRegions function is based on Algorithm 2 from the original paper. The UpdateRegions function in the Goal GAN algorithm is based on Algorithm 2 from the original paper. Selfgenerate is a high-level goal self-generation process that is repeated N times to produce a batch of new goals. The competence \u0393yg is determined using a formula from the paper, and C(yg, yf) is computed with equation (7). The collect rollout function resets the state and applies actions following the goal-conditioned policy until the goal is reached or the maximum number of steps is taken. Hyperparameters used include p1 = 0.7, p2 = 0.2, p3 = 0.1, \u03b6 = 100, and gmax = 100. The best performance in a hyperparameter sweep yields \u03b6 = 100, g max = 100. The noise for mode(3) is Gaussian with variance 0.1, same as tolerance threshold max and competence threshold C. No constraints or sub-goals in tasks, \u03c1 = \u2205. Reset value r is 1, explorative movements q \u2208 N with policy gradient update using stochastic policy \u03c0 \u03b8."
