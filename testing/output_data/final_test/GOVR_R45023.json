    "content": "Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, causing widespread flooding and destroying the island's electric grid infrastructure. Recovery efforts focused on restoring power to critical facilities after the storm incapacitated the central power system. The Commonwealth was already recovering from Hurricane Irma, which had left 70% of electricity customers without power. After Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico faced extensive power outages, with officials estimating that a large portion of the population could be without electricity for up to six months. The island's electric power infrastructure was already in poor condition before the 2017 hurricane season due to underinvestment and poor maintenance. Questions are now being raised about rebuilding the electricity grid given the financial debt of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), which had debts totaling about $9 billion at the end of 2016. Governance issues within PREPA have been blamed for many of its problems, and the devastation caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria highlighted the urgent need for improvements in the electricity system. Some have questioned PREPA's decision to give a major repair contract to a small firm after the second storm, which seemed to ignore industry practices. Calls for a new electricity system regime have been made due to the poor state of the system and lack of transparency in decision-making. If Congress considers alternatives to PREPA, the question of replacement entities and structures arises. The report discusses the history of PREPA, the debt crisis in Puerto Rico, and options for restructuring the electricity system. Congress may need to consider investment incentives for public-private partnerships to modernize Puerto Rico's grid and ensure resiliency. Additionally, new investments and federal oversight may be necessary for building a resilient grid in Puerto Rico post-Hurricane Maria. Puerto Rico was already facing a fiscal, economic, and social crisis before Hurricane Maria destroyed the electric grid. The island's economy has shrunk by about 15% in the last decade due to the decline in manufacturing and the end of federal incentives. The fiscal cuts to deal with Puerto Rico's debt crisis and the economy's downward direction are projected to result in an additional 12% contraction in Puerto Rico's economy over the next 10 years. Approximately 45% of the population lives under the poverty level, with the highest unemployment rate in the United States at 10.1%. The population has fallen by about 11% in the last decade, reflecting challenging economic circumstances and a shrinking customer base for goods and services on the island. PREPA, the largest electricity supplier in Puerto Rico, faced challenges due to uncertain future demand levels. In 2014, it ranked in the top 10 of U.S. public power utilities, generating 12.7 million MWh and selling $4.6 billion worth of electricity. The Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority (PRWRA) was established in 1941 to address the increasing demand for electric power in Puerto Rico. Initially relying on hydropower, the PRWRA later acquired other power companies and shifted to using petroleum-based fuels like heavy fuel oil for electricity generation. Currently, heavy fuel oil is the main source of electricity in Puerto Rico, with coal being imported for the Guayama power plant. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority operates several thermoelectric facilities, including the San Juan, Palo Seco, and Costa Sur power plants. The island's electricity is primarily generated at five PREPA-owned power plants, accounting for 62% of total capacity. The majority of electricity in Puerto Rico is generated by heavy fuel oil, with coal imported for the Guayama power plant. The island's electricity is primarily produced at power plants on the southern coast, far from major population centers. Transmission lines carry electricity over the central mountain range to urban areas in the north. Fossil fuels have historically dominated the almost 6 GW power generation capacity in Puerto Rico. Electricity generation in Puerto Rico is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, with petroleum and coal accounting for 64% of generation in 2016. Natural gas and renewables make up the remaining 36%, with most renewable generation coming from small wind and solar installations. PREPA, the island's utility company, faces financial challenges with a $9 billion debt, leading to high electricity prices and unreliable power supply. This has hindered economic development and the well-being of residents. Puerto Rico's energy sector has been shaped by policy developments aimed at modernizing the energy policy and grid, but implementation has been slow. PREPA, the island's utility company, is facing severe financial constraints, leading to high electricity prices and unreliable power supply. Legislation has been enacted to increase the use of renewable energy resources, with a target of 20% of retail sales by 2035. The establishment of the Puerto Rico Energy Commission (PREC) and an office of consumer advocacy in 2014 aimed to address concerns about PREPA's performance. In 2014, PREC was authorized to review PREPA's rates and provide oversight. PREPA faced financial difficulties and negotiated a forbearance agreement in August 2014 to avoid default. Act 57 of 2014 called for governance reforms within PREPA and potential separation of electric generation and distribution. In July 2015, PREC issued regulations to review existing rates and ensure future rates are \"just and reasonable.\" In August 2014, a forbearance agreement required the appointment of a Chief Restructuring Officer (CRO) for PREPA. A tentative Restructuring Support Agreement (RSA) was reached in December 2015 to reduce PREPA's debt. Efforts by the Puerto Rico legislature and PREC aimed to further shape PREPA, including imposing a surcharge on electric bills to repay creditors. The Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) established processes for debt adjustment and a Financial Oversight and Management Board (OB) for Puerto Rico. PROMESA required PREPA to create a fiscal plan and gave the OB wide authorities while the governor and legislature of Puerto Rico retained control. The governor and legislature of Puerto Rico, under the wide authorities of the OB, retained control over public priorities within the constraints of PROMESA. The board approved a revised fiscal plan for PREPA in April 2017, projecting a 23% reduction in energy sales and a target rate of 21 cents per kWh by 2023. After the election of Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 Nevares, changes were made to PREPA's affairs, including an extension of the RSA and concessions from creditors. The structure of PREPA's board was changed, removing members with technical expertise and appointing new members by the governor. A new Puerto Rico agency was established for debt negotiations. Despite aiming to complete RSA negotiations by July 1, 2017, PREPA's RSA was terminated by the OB on July 2, 2017, leading to missed debt service payments. Bondholders requested a receiver to operate PREPA, but the request was denied by U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain in September 2017. Hurricanes Irma and Maria damaged Puerto Rico's electrical system, raising concerns about funding repairs due to PREPA's financial instability. The outmigration of residents to the mainland poses challenges to PREPA's customer base and finances. The Oversight Board is calling for revisions in fiscal plans and stricter oversight of recovery operations, including attempts to appoint a chief transformation officer for PREPA. In November 2017, Judge Swain denied the Oversight Board's request to appoint Noel Zamot as chief transformation officer of PREPA, stating that PROMESA did not grant the authority. PREPA issued a draft fiscal plan in April 2017 to upgrade its aging power infrastructure and incorporate more renewable energy sources. PREPA's draft plan aims to modernize infrastructure through public-private partnerships, renewable energy, smart grid improvements, and maintenance programs. The plan addresses safety, reliability, and resiliency goals while acknowledging challenges such as falling customer demand. The hurricanes in Puerto Rico caused extensive damage to the electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure, hindering the restoration efforts. Falling customer demand may lead to a 23% drop in energy sales, impacting revenue needed for modernization. Recovery efforts have focused on critical facilities like hospitals and water treatment plants. Restoration of electricity transmission and distribution systems is crucial for Puerto Rico's overall recovery from the disaster. The cost estimation for power restoration is ongoing, especially in rural areas. The rebuilt infrastructure must meet current electrical standards for necessary modernization efforts. PREPA, as a public utility, is eligible for federal assistance from FEMA through the PA Program for repair, restoration, and replacement of public facilities in disaster-affected areas. Under the PA Program of the Stafford Act, eligible applicants owning public facilities can receive grants to repair or replace facilities to their predisaster design and function. Grants cover expenses required by current codes and standards due to the disaster. Code-required improvements must meet specific criteria to be eligible. FEMA may require documentation of prior application of standards for repairs to public facilities. PREPA adopted interconnection standards based on the federal Energy Policy Act of 2005. Qualifying projects may need to meet minimum standards for public assistance to enhance resiliency and reduce risks. The FEMA minimum standards policy does not directly apply to power facilities, but there is potential for expansion at FEMA's discretion. The US Army Corps of Engineers supports the Department of Homeland Security in implementing the National Response Framework, providing emergency support funded through the Disaster Relief Fund. In Puerto Rico, USACE is restoring emergency power. In Puerto Rico, USACE is leading grid repair and restoring emergency power for public facilities with the deployment of the power team and 249th Engineer Battalion after Hurricanes Irma and Maria. USACE is leading the repair of Puerto Rico's power grid, focusing on emergency power response for critical facilities. The four-part process includes providing temporary power, ensuring adequate generation, repairing transmission lines, and restoring distribution lines to pre-storm condition. The FEMA Administrator stated that USACE is mobilizing to rebuild Puerto Rico's power grid to U.S. code standards through contracts with private companies. Congress may consider comprehensive energy planning to address the vulnerabilities of Puerto Rico's electric power system to hurricanes and extreme weather events, including assessing current and future energy supply and demand, existing energy policies, and cost-effective renewable energy technologies. The 1982 DOE report evaluated options to diversify Puerto Rico's energy portfolio to decrease reliance on imports, focusing on wind and existing hydropower for near-term priorities. It projected savings in oil imports through the year 2000 by considering renewable energy sources like wind, hydropower, solar, bioenergy, OTEC, and cogeneration. The 1982 DOE report assessed Puerto Rico's energy system, highlighting reliability issues due to isolation, unit size, and maintenance problems. Puerto Rico directed PREPA to create an Integrated Resources Plan (IRP) to address electricity needs until 2035, including new generation, retirements, and transmission projects. In 2017, the Puerto Rico Energy Commission rejected the IRP, emphasizing the need for cost-effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly energy solutions. The Puerto Rico Energy Commission rejected PREPA's Integrated Resources Plan (IRP) due to insufficient processes and mechanisms for achieving renewable integration and lower environmental impacts. The Commission granted an extension to investigate the post-Hurricane Maria changes in the electric system until December 31, 2017. Financial assistance for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects is authorized under DOE and DOI authority. The DOI provides grants for power line projects to enhance system resilience against hurricanes and typhoons. Congress may allocate funds for energy planning and system improvements. Electric utilities are hardening infrastructure to withstand extreme weather, improving durability and stability. Resilient systems can maintain operations during storms and recover quickly from damage. Grid resilience is essential for climate adaptation and includes hardening, advanced capabilities, and recovery/reconstitution. Resilience strategies should focus on improving grid flexibility and control, in addition to system hardening measures. Measures such as pole maintenance, vegetation management, and the use of mobile transformers and substations are crucial for ensuring grid resilience. Activities to improve grid resilience include pole maintenance, vegetation management, use of mobile transformers and substations, and participation in mutual assistance groups. Upgrading facilities to withstand more severe events may be necessary, as seen in Puerto Rico where even concrete poles were destroyed by a Category 4 hurricane. Hardening activities are typically based on regional weather patterns, but considerations for improving resiliency should go beyond historical storm data. Actions for hardening electric grid infrastructure include elevating substations/control rooms/pump to protect against flooding. To protect against damage from flooding and high winds, actions include elevating substations/control rooms/pump stations, relocating/constructing new lines and facilities, upgrading damaged poles and structures, strengthening poles with guy wires, and burying power lines underground. Modernizing electricity systems with smart grid technologies and improving utility preparedness through programs and investments can enhance electric system resiliency. Hurricane preparedness planning involves complying with inspection protocols, managing vegetation, participating in mutual assistance groups, improving employee communications and tracking, purchasing or leasing mobile transformers and substations, and procuring spare equipment. Storm-specific readiness can be enhanced by maintaining fuel tank volumes, facilitating employee evacuation and reentry, securing fuel contracts for emergency vehicles, expanding deployment staging areas, and supplying logistics to recovery staging areas. Distributed resources like microgrids can function independently from centralized power grids, making restoration easier. DOE's recommendations focus on managing costs for promoting system reliability during extreme weather events. A strategy for grid resilience includes risk awareness, cost-effective grid strengthening, and increasing system flexibility with new technologies. This approach aims to improve Puerto Rico's electric power resilience. Increasing electricity generation from renewable sources like solar panels and wind turbines can improve the resilience of Puerto Rico's power system. Renewable power sources do not require fuel to generate electricity, making them beneficial for resiliency. Wind and solar power are the most utilized renewable sources, although they are variable and intermittent. Connecting these sources to distribution systems can provide electricity to local residences and businesses during outages. Renewable electricity generation in Puerto Rico, such as wind power and solar PV panels, requires backup due to resource variability. This backup can come from fast-ramping natural gas capacity or energy storage. New renewable energy technologies like marine and ocean thermal sources show potential for providing firm capacity and on-demand power, but are still in the developmental stage. Wind power and solar PV have capacity factors of 30% and 18% respectively, highlighting the need for reliable backup generation or energy storage. Renewable energy technologies in Puerto Rico, including wind power and solar PV, are still in the developmental stage. Biomass, landfill gas, and alternative energy sources like bagasse are being considered for power generation. Puerto Rico's RPS aims for 12% renewable generation by 2019. A study by Siemens concluded that ramping up renewable energy in Puerto Rico would require new natural gas capacity. The Siemens study found that Puerto Rico's existing electricity system may struggle to achieve its 12% renewables goal by 2019 and the higher 20% RPS goal by 2035 without system improvements or new power generation capable of backing up variable renewable sources. Solar and wind power could contribute up to 10% of capacity, but traditional base load fossil fuel plants may need to ramp up quickly to meet demand as solar generation decreases. Energy storage resources could potentially provide power during times of peak demand and help address load and demand balancing issues with increasing renewable electricity generation. PREPA mandated new wind or solar projects to include energy storage to accommodate variability and provide ancillary services, despite existing options not being economically viable in Puerto Rico. Energy storage is required for new renewable energy projects in Puerto Rico to address variability and provide ancillary services. Developers must allocate 30% of capacity to storage and reserve 45% for ramping and frequency control. Demand response and energy efficiency can help reduce peak load when solar generation declines. Tools to reduce load during peak hours can minimize fossil fuel ramping, especially on days with extreme ramping events. New wind and solar forecasting technologies, along with novel smart grid technologies, could improve renewables integration in Puerto Rico. However, deploying these technologies may require upgrades to the aging transmission and distribution systems, as well as energy storage. It is uncertain if biomass or other alternative fuel providers could efficiently cycle power generation to manage the fluctuations in wind and solar resources. Interconnecting Puerto Rico's grid with other Caribbean islands could enhance renewable electricity integration and reduce the need for backup power sources. Puerto Rico lacks geothermal resources for base load generation, but other Caribbean islands like Dominica, Saint Kitts, and Nevis have such resources. Undersea electricity cables, transmission substations, and government agreements would be necessary for interconnection. Puerto Rico has implemented policies to increase renewable energy generation, including a net metering program for customer-owned power generation facilities and a Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard requiring 20% of retail sales from green energy sources by 2035. Compliance with the standard is demonstrated through procurement of renewable energy credits. Puerto Rico has a Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) that requires 20% of retail sales to come from green energy sources by 2035. Compliance with the RPS is shown through procurement of renewable energy credits. A Green Energy Fund (GEF) has been established to support renewable energy projects, with up to $185 million invested in projects on the island. Despite these efforts, some developers feel that the implementation of renewable policies has been slow. Before Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico had 215 MW of renewable electricity capacity. Renewable electricity development involves choices such as project type and scale. Questions arise regarding utility-scale vs. rooftop residential solar PV, and whether utilities should develop wind power projects or solicit generation from independent producers. Distributed generation can reduce the need for transmission line expansion. Funding is a concern, with some cost risks passed to independent power producers. Residential rooftop solar is encouraged by some governments. Residential rooftop solar PV, encouraged by some governments, can reduce a utility's peak power demand through net metering arrangements. Utilities argue for compensation for backup power and infrastructure costs. Congress may consider restructuring Puerto Rico's electricity system with various options and alternatives, pending agreement from Puerto Rico. The cost of modernizing Puerto Rico's electricity system is estimated at $4 billion, not including hurricane damage. Additional goals like resiliency and recovery could increase costs significantly. Community solar projects are suggested for rural areas to reduce power costs from the central grid. Community solar projects provide power and financial benefits to multiple community members. These projects involve a solar PV system that supplies a portion of a community's electricity demand. Participants can own or finance the project through various options. Ownership-based models allow participants to purchase panels upfront or finance them through a loan. This model is similar to purchasing a rooftop system, but without installation on the participant's property. Community solar projects offer participants the opportunity to own a set number of panels or a certain number of kilowatts in a solar array. Participants can purchase enough share to meet their annual electricity usage, and a matching proportion of the project's output will be credited to them. Ownership-based projects can be complex to develop and administer, posing a barrier to entry for those lacking capital or credit. In areas with good wind conditions, rural communities in Puerto Rico may consider small wind power projects. Community wind projects are utilized by various local communities with agricultural or rural economic interests, or those looking to invest in small wind power projects for their communities. These projects involve turbines with a capacity rating of less than or equal to 100 kW, serving purposes such as providing village power or supplying local electricity to schools, hospitals, businesses, farms, and community facilities. Rural electric cooperatives or municipal utilities can own and operate community wind projects, while groups of local individuals can also form independent power producer groups or limited liability corporations to sell the generated electricity. Community wind projects involve turbines with a capacity rating of less than or equal to 100 kW, serving purposes such as providing village power or supplying local electricity to schools, hospitals, businesses, farms, and community facilities. Owners of these projects can predict energy costs confidently due to no fuel costs and low operating costs. Most community wind projects can easily connect to the distribution grid, operating on a smaller scale than utility-scale wind farms. Microgrids can function independently of a centralized electric power network, but renewable distributed generation systems may require energy storage for consistent electricity services. Microgrids, which can generate electricity using renewable resources, are being installed in many parts of the developing world. However, using solely renewable resources for microgrids can pose technical challenges due to intermittent or variable generation. Load balancing can be an issue, especially in island mode operation. New technologies like smart inverters and energy storage systems are being developed to address technical challenges in microgrid operation, particularly in island mode. These advancements may simplify microgrid design and reduce barriers to adoption. Considerations for costs of control systems and infrastructure should be evaluated when assessing the benefits of microgrids. Different public power options, beyond PREPA, could also be explored for serving Puerto Rico's population. Given Puerto Rico's population distribution and the aged nature of PREPA's power plants, smaller public power entities like municipal utilities or electric cooperatives could be established for a more reliable and resilient electric power system. These entities could better serve rural communities and farming communities outside of urban centers. Electric cooperatives are owned by the consumers they serve, providing a potential solution to the poor reliability experienced under PREPA. Electric cooperatives (co-ops) are nonprofit entities owned by the consumers they serve in rural areas. They are governed by a board of directors elected by members and provide service at cost. Co-ops serve an average of 7.4 consumers per mile of line and collect annual revenue of approximately $16,000 per mile of line. This is in contrast to investor-owned utilities and publicly-owned utilities, which have higher numbers of customers per mile of line and collect more revenue. The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) and the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation provide debt financing for cooperatives to construct electric facilities in rural areas. This includes system improvements, energy efficiency programs, and renewable energy systems. Loans are available to cooperatives, corporations, municipalities, and other entities serving rural areas. Additionally, USDA offers a High Energy Cost Grant program for power providers. The USDA offers a High Energy Cost Grant program to assist energy providers in lowering costs for families in rural areas with high energy costs. Generation and transmission cooperatives can sell electricity to distribution-only cooperatives and employ renewable energy like wind power. Co-ops lead in community solar projects. Municipal utilities, owned by local government bodies, are nonprofit entities that could serve smaller cities and towns in Puerto Rico. They reflect a growing trend in the United States of cities taking over electricity services from private utilities to address climate concerns and increase renewable energy. Municipal utilities in Puerto Rico may not have the option to acquire power plants from their host utility, leading to the need for new power plants or private generators to meet local demand. The Electric Programs of RUS provide loans to municipalities for building or upgrading electric power systems. The Electric Programs of RUS provide loans to municipalities for building or upgrading electric power systems. Table 2 summarizes the organization, management, and regulatory oversight for electricity providers in Puerto Rico, including investor-owned utilities (IOUs). In June 2017, members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico recommended privatization for PREPA to attract necessary investments. Privatization is seen as the solution for PREPA to attract investments, lower costs, and provide reliable power in Puerto Rico. It involves transferring ownership or management of a service from the government to the private sector through various methods like share issue or franchising. This shift is crucial for modernizing power supply, depoliticizing management, and operating more efficiently. Privatization of government-run companies can be done through share issue, asset sale, or voucher privatization. Share issue privatization is the most common method, requiring a developed secondary market. Asset sale privatization involves selling the entire firm or asset to an investor through auction. Voucher privatization distributes ownership shares to citizens for free or at a low price. Privatizing PREPA's generation could involve transferring or selling it to private owners, but the debt situation complicates the process. The costs of acquisition may be minimal compared to potential investments needed for upgrades. The privatization of PREPA's generation assets may be a viable option, considering the need for modernization. However, the focus would likely not include the entire system, leaving the question of how to upgrade the transmission and distribution networks. One possible solution is a public-private partnership (PPP) model, where a private company works with the government to operate certain assets and determine regulated prices. This approach allows for the recovery of operating and capital costs. A public-private partnership (PPP) allows companies to recover costs while serving the public. It is a risk-sharing model where the government and private firms jointly provide services. In Puerto Rico, a public-private combination could involve power generators selling to distribution companies, managed by a publicly owned entity. Congress may consider investment incentives for forming public-private partnerships. A public-private partnership in Puerto Rico could involve power generators selling to distribution companies, managed by a publicly owned entity. Congress may want to consider investment incentives for forming public-private partnerships to modernize Puerto Rico's grid. Retail competition could be allowed if power generation is at a sufficient scale, with consumer protections in place to ensure legitimate competitive processes. Alternatively, a federal government corporation could be established to manage Puerto Rico's transmission system. A federal government entity like the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) could serve as a transaction manager between power generators and retail distribution sellers of electricity. This entity could provide power at cost to distribution companies and procure wholesale power for sale. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were created to market and transmit power from federally owned projects, such as hydropower and coal-fired plants. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established to market federal power generated by dams for various purposes, including irrigation and small community electrification. Each PMA has unique regional issues affecting its operations. Another model, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), focuses on flood control, reforestation, and economic development. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has shifted its focus from flood control and economic development to power generation. TVA's main goal now is to provide electricity at the lowest feasible rates to wholesale customers in the Tennessee Valley region. The TVA Act of 1933 provided funding for building new generation and transmission facilities, as well as acquiring property from other utilities. Congress passed legislation in 1959 to make the TVA power system self-financing, with approximately $1.96 billion in funding appropriated between FY1934 and FY1959. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) received $1.96 billion in funding between FY1934 and FY1959. There is a potential option for a power generation and marketing authority (PGMA) in Puerto Rico, with the possibility of expanding to the wider Caribbean region. The PGMA would need to price its output to cover construction and maintenance costs, with any federal funds used being repaid with interest to the U.S. Treasury. Establishing a PGMA would require an act of Congress. Establishing a PGMA in Puerto Rico and potentially expanding to the wider Caribbean region could provide cheaper and cleaner fuel options for power generation. However, challenges such as bringing natural gas to Puerto Rico affordably need to be addressed, especially considering Jones Act limitations. The 2017 hurricane season highlighted the need for improved infrastructure and disaster preparedness in Puerto Rico. The destruction in Puerto Rico from the 2017 hurricane season has caused an unprecedented disaster, particularly in the electricity system. Restoration of power to the majority of the population is still incomplete. The electric utility, PREPA, had poor service even before the hurricane. Efforts to restore power post-Hurricane Maria have been criticized for questionable contracts and internal disputes. Governance reforms for Puerto Rico may be necessary. Some suggest governance reforms for Puerto Rico, including potentially privatizing the publicly owned utility PREPA to modernize electricity services. Congress may consider creating a federal government corporation for this purpose, but there is no one-size-fits-all solution for rebuilding the grid. Incorporating renewables and natural gas would require grid modernization. The modernization of Puerto Rico's electricity system, including the potential privatization of PREPA's aged generation assets, is being considered. The financial burden on the Commonwealth and its citizens, as well as the potential increase in rates for customers, are key factors to be addressed in any privatization venture. Socioeconomic factors must also be taken into account for the success of such a venture in light of Puerto Rico's economic challenges and declining population."
