    "content": "The federal government operates four regional power marketing administrations (PMAs) through the Department of Energy: Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), and Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). Congressional interest in the PMAs includes rate setting, compliance with the Endangered Species Act, and privatization concerns. PMAs were established to distribute electric power from federal dams for irrigation, flood control, and community electrification. The federal government operates four regional power marketing administrations (PMAs) through the Department of Energy to distribute electric power from federal dams for irrigation, flood control, and community electrification. PMAs must give preference to public utility districts and cooperatives, selling power at cost-based rates regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure repayment of federal facility costs. Power revenues associated with the PMAs have been classified as discretionary offsetting receipts since FY2011. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) was created in 1937 to distribute power from federal dams in the Pacific Northwest. BPA operates and maintains 75% of high voltage transmission lines in its service territory, serving Idaho, Oregon, Washington, western Montana, and parts of other states. It was the first Power Marketing Administration (PMA) and has a large transmission system comparable to the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) operates in the Pacific Northwest, serving Idaho, Oregon, Washington, western Montana, and parts of other states. It is self-financed and covers its operating costs through power rates. BPA has borrowing authority for large projects and had $5.53 billion of bonds outstanding to the U.S. Treasury in 2018. Its current borrowing authority is capped at $7.70 billion. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is exploring various financing options to address its debt limit and changing power generation market. BPA's Strategic Plan for 2018 to 2023 outlines goals for financial health and infrastructure modernization. Wholesale power prices in the U.S. are decreasing, while BPA's firm power rates are increasing. BPA repays its funding through electricity sales, primarily generated from hydropower but facing challenges from growing renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Growing wind and solar capacity installations in the Pacific Northwest are challenging BPA's price competitiveness and ability to repay debts. BPA entered into the Regional Cooperation Agreement with the State of Washington in 2014 to address Energy Northwest's debt. Energy Northwest owns and operates various electric power generation facilities, and the Regional Cooperation debt involves the issuance of new bonds to manage outstanding debts. This allows for integrated debt management for BPA and Energy Northwest, reducing the net effect on their total debt portfolios. The refinancing of debt portfolios for BPA and Energy Northwest has reduced the weighted average interest rate and maturity of BPA's overall debt. This has allowed BPA to prepay higher-interest federal obligations and maintain U.S. Treasury borrowing authority. However, the debt service of the Regional Cooperation Agreement is covered by BPA ratepayers through BPA rates. BPA estimates that the potential principal amount of RCA refunding through bonds issued from 2019 to 2030 could exceed $4.0 billion. BPA is responsible for maintaining and modernizing its infrastructure, including cybersecurity, to adapt to changing energy markets in the western United States. BPA is considering joining the Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) and facing legal challenges regarding the operation of hydropower dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers. Environmental groups blame the dams for the deaths of salmon and steelhead species, with some seeking the removal of lower dams on the Snake River for species survival. In 2016, a federal judge overturned a previous management plan for dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers, citing insufficient protection for salmon runs. President Trump's 2018 Presidential Memorandum accelerated the process for a new management plan, potentially including dam removal. The Southeastern Power Administration, created in 1950, is involved in managing water infrastructure projects. The impact on fish endangerment findings remains uncertain. The Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA) was created in 1950 to carry out functions assigned by the Flood Control Act of 1944 in 11 states. SEPA markets power from 22 water projects operated by the Corps to over 12 million consumers. It does not operate transmission facilities and contracts with other utilities for this purpose. SEPA's facilities are aging, with plans for $1.2 billion in rehabilitations. The agency faces an overcapacity issue. The Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA) in the Corps' Nashville District is facing an overcapacity issue due to projections made before the 2008 economic downturn. This has led to excess capacity that municipalities and electric cooperatives in SEPA's service area must address. One preference customer has already terminated its contract with SEPA as a result. The Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA) was established by the Flood Control Act of 1944 and markets hydroelectric power from 24 Corps dams in six states. SWPA serves over 100 preference customer utilities with more than 8 million end-use customers and manages 1,400 miles of high-voltage transmission lines. SWPA is the only U.S. electrical balancing area supported solely by hydroelectric generation, using alternative financing to fund expenses and purchase power. It faces challenges with low water conditions due to its rain-based water supply, sometimes needing to purchase replacement power during extended dry periods to meet contractual obligations. Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA) relies on hydroelectric generation and alternative financing to fund expenses and purchase power. Congressional authority is needed for SWPA to use revenues from power sales to meet contractual obligations across high and low water years. This authority is crucial for rate stability and operating the program according to sound business principles. The Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977 created Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), the largest Power Marketing Administration (PMA) serving customers in 15 western states. Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) operates a high voltage grid spanning 17,000 miles across 15 western states. It markets and transmits hydropower from federal dams and coal-fired plants, including the Navajo Generating Station. WAPA gives preference to Native American tribes and has a strategic plan titled \"Powering the Energy Frontier\" to address changing power needs. The Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) operates a high voltage grid spanning 17,000 miles across 15 western states, marketing and transmitting hydropower from federal dams and coal-fired plants. WAPA's strategic plan \"Powering the Energy Frontier\" guides its actions for the next 10 years. The Energy Imbalance Market in the West may offer additional options for WAPA to address transmission development needs. WAPA plays a crucial role in relieving transmission congestion within its marketing area, with limited capacity on certain transmission paths affecting utilities' ability to serve electric loads. In 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act gave WAPA authority to borrow up to $3.25 billion for transmission projects integrating renewable generation sources into the grid. The Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) has implemented the Transmission Infrastructure Program (TIP) to upgrade transmission lines for delivering renewable resources to market. WAPA's Upper Great Plains region joined the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) in 2015, transferring control of eligible transmission facilities. WAPA is the first PMA to join an RTO, with benefits exceeding estimates. Other WAPA regions are considering joining SPP. WAPA's other regions are considering joining SPP. In Water Year 2017, WAPA delivered 26,148 gigawatt-hours of hydroelectric power, which is 101% of average annual sales. The West has been facing periodic droughts, leading to lower snowmelts and reduced water for power generation. A \"drought-adder\" reduction program has been implemented to address annual differences, resulting in $40 million annual savings for over 50% of WAPA's customers in several states. In 2018, the Trump Administration proposed selling federal Power Marketing Administrations' transmission assets to increase private sector involvement and efficiency, citing the need to mitigate risks and allocate resources more effectively. Drought conditions in the western United States have led to a drought-adder component in WAPA's rates, with 417 out of 700 customers receiving rate reductions for the second year. The proposal to sell federal transmission infrastructure assets for budgetary savings was dropped due to stakeholder opposition. The Administration had suggested that private sector or state entities could take over transmission functions currently provided by PMAs, with potential savings of $9.5 billion over 10 years. The Department of Energy stated that such a sale would not proceed without Congressional direction. The Trump Administration's proposal to sell federal transmission infrastructure assets, including PMAs, was dropped due to stakeholder opposition. Congress has historically prevented executive branch alterations to PMA structures and authority. The proposal could have impacted the original intent for PMAs to provide low-cost electricity, potentially requiring changes to relevant legislation. Selling federally owned transmission assets under laws like BPA and RPA could impact the preference for public bodies in the sale of federal power, potentially affecting the lowest possible rates of sale."
