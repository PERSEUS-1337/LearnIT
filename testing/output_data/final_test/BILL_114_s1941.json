BHI will pay for all necessary costs for the land exchange, including survey, appraisal, and staff time if requested by the Secretary. BHI and the Secretary may agree to improve, relocate, or alter the condition of the road as needed. Public and administrative access to FSR 371 will be maintained according to the Forest Service travel management plan. SEC. 5. EQUAL VALUE EXCHANGE AND APPRAISALS. Appraisals for land exchange under the Act will be determined by the Secretary following specific standards and instructions. The values of exchanged lands must be equal or equalized through cash payments if not. The Secretary will make cash equalization payments to the United States to achieve equal land value, with excess amounts deposited in the Sisk Act fund for land acquisition in Region 2 of the Forest Service. If the appraised value of non-Federal land exceeds that of Federal land, surplus funds will be addressed. If the appraised value of the Federal land exceeds the final value, no cash equalization payment will be made to BHI. The surplus value of the non-Federal land will be considered a donation to the United States. Appraisal exclusions include special use permits and Barr Trail easement donations. SEC. 6. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. Withdrawal Provisions: Lands acquired by the Secretary under this Act shall be permanently withdrawn from all forms of appropriation and disposal under public land laws. Any public land order withdrawing Federal land shall be revoked to allow disposal to BHI. Federal land authorized for exchange under this Act will be withdrawn or segregated from appropriation under public lands laws. The land acquired by the Secretary under this Act will be withdrawn from public land laws until conveyed to BHI. The acquired land will become part of the Pike-San Isabel National Forest and be managed accordingly. The land exchange directed by this Act should be completed within one year. Minor adjustments and corrections can be made by mutual agreement between the Secretary and BHI. Upon enactment of this Act, the Secretary will file and make available for public inspection in the headquarters of the Pike-San Isabel National Forest all maps referenced. In case of conflict between a map, acreage estimate, or land description, the map will prevail unless mutually agreed otherwise by the Secretary and BHI."
