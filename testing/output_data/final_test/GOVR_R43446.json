    "content": "Federal law mandates the President to submit an annual budget to Congress by the first Monday in February. The budget outlines the President's fiscal policy, including proposed spending, revenues, and deficit/surplus levels. It also highlights priorities for federal programs like defense, education, and healthcare. The budget may include legislative proposals for spending and tax policy changes. President Obama submitted his FY2015 budget to Congress on March 4, 2014. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) administers Medicare under the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS). The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is responsible for administering Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and private health insurance programs. CMS is the largest purchaser of healthcare in the US, covering 123 million individuals in FY2015. This report summarizes the President's budget estimates for each section of the CMS budget and provides descriptions of legislative proposals for Medicare, Medicaid, program integrity, CHIP, state grants, and private health insurance programs. The CMS budget includes mandatory and discretionary spending, with a majority being mandatory for programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The President's FY2015 budget projects an increase in net outlays to $881.2 billion, up by 5.3% from FY2014. Medicare spending baseline is raised without reductions in physician payments, deviating from the current sustainable growth rate formula. The President's FY2015 budget proposes adjustments to the sustainable growth rate formula for physician payments, estimating an increase in CMS's net outlays by $6.2 billion in FY2014 and $13.7 billion in FY2015. The budget also includes legislative changes to various healthcare programs, with a projected increase in total net outlays by $0.5 billion in FY2014 and $3.0 billion in FY2015. Additionally, savings from program integrity activities are estimated at $0.6 billion. The President's FY2015 budget proposes adjustments to the sustainable growth rate formula for physician payments, estimating an increase in CMS's net outlays by $6.2 billion in FY2014 and $13.7 billion in FY2015. Legislative changes to healthcare programs are included, with a projected increase in total net outlays by $0.5 billion in FY2014 and $3.0 billion in FY2015. Additionally, savings from program integrity activities are estimated at $0.6 billion. The President's budget estimates CMS's net outlays to be $897.4 billion in FY2015, an increase of $53.8 billion over FY2014. Medicare, Medicaid, program integrity, CHIP, state grants, private health insurance, CMMI, and program management are the sections of CMS budget. Medicare is a federal program providing health care services to qualified beneficiaries, established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act. Medicare is a federal program that covers individuals 65 and older, as well as those under 65 with certain medical conditions. It consists of four parts (A-D) and provides various healthcare services. The President's FY2015 budget estimates Medicare outlays to be $521.6 billion, with adjustments made to prevent a reduction in physician payments. The President's budget estimates that Medicare's total net mandatory and discretionary outlays for FY2015 will be $532.9 billion, with legislative proposals aimed at decreasing outlays by $2.8 billion in FY2015 and $407.2 billion over the next 10 years. The budget includes a number of legislative proposals for Medicare, with a table summarizing the costs or savings for each proposal. Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program that finances medical services. Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program that finances medical services, jointly funded by the federal government and states. Participation is voluntary for states, with each state administering its own version under federal rules. State variability is common in eligibility levels, covered services, and reimbursement. The President's FY2015 budget estimates Medicaid total net outlays at $331.4 billion. The President's budget includes legislative proposals impacting Medicaid, with estimated net outlays for FY2015 at $336.0 billion, an increase of $27.3 billion from FY2014. The proposals aim to increase net outlays by $4.5 billion in FY2015 and decrease by $7.3 billion over the next 10 years. The Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) program, established under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, focuses on detecting and preventing healthcare fraud in programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Funding for HCFAC is used to expand activities to include Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D, as well as to prevent fraud in the Medicaid program. The President's FY2015 budget estimates $2.0 billion for program integrity activities, with an increase of $461 million over FY2014. Funding includes $1.7 billion in mandatory funding and $0.3 billion in discretionary funding. The section also describes legislative proposals for program integrity. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established CHIP to provide health insurance coverage to low-income, uninsured children. CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, with federal funding capped on a state-by-state basis. The President's FY2015 budget estimates $10.6 billion for CHIP, with a couple of legislative proposals that could impact the program. The President's budget estimates that CHIP outlays would increase by $10 million in FY2015 and $345 million over the next 10 years. The budget also includes various grant programs and activities such as the Money Follows the Person Demonstration and Medicaid Integrity Program. The President's budget estimates a decrease in FY2015 total outlays for state grants and demonstrations by $76 million. Legislative proposals are expected to increase outlays by $25 million in FY2015 and $776 million over the next 10 years. The ACA includes reforms focusing on restructuring the private health insurance market. The Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) within CMS is responsible for implementing ACA provisions for private health insurance programs. The President's budget projects a significant increase in FY2015 total outlays for private health insurance programs, mainly due to the Transitional Reinsurance Program and Risk Adjustment Program. Funding for exchange grants to states decreases in FY2015. The President's budget includes a legislative proposal impacting private health insurance programs, with no budgetary impact estimated. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) was established by the ACA to test innovative healthcare models. $10 billion was appropriated for CMMI activities from FY2011 to FY2019. The President's budget estimates a $1.4 billion total outlay for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) in FY2015, a 37.0% increase from FY2014. The budget does not include any legislative proposals impacting CMMI. Funding for program management activities, including Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP administration, is included in the CMS budget. The FY2015 budget for program management activities, including discretionary and mandatory spending, will be $6.5 billion, a $1.2 billion increase from FY2014. Discretionary funding for program management is estimated at $4.2 billion, a 5.7% increase from FY2014. Mandatory funding is expected to be $199 million, a $64 million decrease from FY2014. The President's budget includes legislative proposals that could impact program management activities. The President's budget includes legislative proposals that would impact program management activities, with an estimated increase of $36 million in FY2015 and $500 million over the next 10 years. Total program level funding for program management activities is projected to be $6.9 billion in FY2015, a 30.2% increase from FY2014. When risk corridor charges are factored in, the funding increases to $12.4 billion in FY2015. The budget contains proposals for program expansions and reducing federal spending. The President's budget includes legislative proposals that impact program management activities, with an estimated increase of $36 million in FY2015 and $500 million over the next 10 years. The proposals aim to expand programs and reduce federal spending. The report provides a description of current law and the President's proposals grouped by program areas such as Medicare, Medicaid, program integrity, CHIP, state grants, private health insurance programs, and program management. Medicare reimburses providers for beneficiaries' unpaid coinsurance and deductible amounts after reasonable collection efforts. The reimbursement rates for Medicare providers were reduced under BIPA and DRA, with bad debt reimbursement for SNFs decreased to 70% in FY2001. Other Medicare providers receiving bad debt reimbursement include critical access hospitals, rural health clinics, and dialysis facilities. The MCTRJCA reduced Medicare bad debt reimbursement rates for providers, with phased reductions for different reimbursement levels. The President's budget proposes further reductions to 25%. Medicare also provides additional payments to hospitals with medical residency programs to cover higher patient care costs. The IME payments to teaching hospitals are calculated as a percentage increase to Medicare's inpatient payment rates based on the hospital's resident-to-bed ratio. MedPAC recommended changes to support necessary workforce skills and reduce IME funding by 10% starting in FY2015. The Secretary of HHS would set standards for teaching hospitals to encourage training of primary care residents. The President's FY2014 budget proposal includes training primary care residents and developing necessary workforce skills. Critical access hospitals (CAHs) are limited-service rural facilities with specific criteria, receiving enhanced cost-based Medicare payments since FY2004. The President's budget aims to reduce Medicare payments to CAHs. The President's FY2014 budget proposal aims to reduce Medicare payments to Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) to 100% of reasonable costs starting in FY2015. To be certified as a CAH, a rural entity must meet specific distance criteria or be designated as a necessary provider by the state. The budget would eliminate states' ability to waive federal mileage requirements for entities less than 10 miles from another hospital or CAH. The President's FY2014 budget proposal aims to reduce Medicare payments to Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) to 100% of reasonable costs starting in FY2015. MedPAC recommended eliminating Medicare payment updates for SNFs, IRFs, LTCHs, and HHAs in its March 2015 report. The ACA amended the annual update policy for post-acute providers to include a productivity adjustment for cost savings. The President's budget proposes additional update reductions for IRFs, LTCHs, and HHAs from FY2015 through FY2024. Payment updates for these providers will not go below 0.0 due to a 1.1 percentage point reduction. SNFs will see a -2.5% update in FY2015, decreasing to a 0.97% update in FY2022. Post-acute care services primarily include nursing and rehabilitation services after a hospital stay. Post-acute care services, including services in LTCHs, IRFs, SNFs, and HHAs, vary across states and heavily influence Medicare spending. The IOM suggests a single payment for an episode of care to improve efficiency and care coordination. CMS's BPCI Initiative tests bundling payment models, with Model 2 focusing on managing a beneficiary's episode of care. In Model 2 of the BPCI, participants manage a beneficiary's episode that includes acute-care hospital services, physician services, and post-acute care. Those achieving a reduction in spending compared to a benchmark can share in savings. The President's budget proposes bundled payments for post-acute care providers to reduce Medicare expenditures by 2.85% by FY2021. Details on how this would work are limited. This proposal was part of the President's FY2014 Budget. Starting October 1, 1983, CMS required facilities to meet specific criteria to be considered Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (IRFs) and receive higher Medicare payments. The \"75 percent rule\" mandated that at least 75% of a facility's inpatient population must have one of 13 specified medical conditions to qualify as an IRF. The compliance threshold for Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (IRFs) was temporarily suspended and reissued in 2004 with revised qualifying conditions and transition periods. The threshold started at 50% in 2004 and increased to 75% in 2007. The DRA extended the 60% threshold in 2006, and the ACA set the compliance threshold at 60% in 2007, including comorbidities as qualifying conditions. The President's budget proposed reinstating the 75% threshold in FY2015. The President's FY2014 budget proposal includes penalties for acute care hospitals with high readmission rates, starting at 1% in FY2013 and increasing to 3% in FY2015. SNFs with high readmission rates are not penalized. MedPAC recommended reducing Medicare payments to SNFs with high rehospitalization rates to improve care coordination. The President's budget would reduce payments to SNFs with high preventable hospital readmission rates by up to 3% starting in FY2018. The President's FY2014 Budget proposes adjusting reimbursement rates in post-acute care settings for certain conditions, limiting payment differentials for specific conditions like hips and knees, and treating IRFs providing intensive rehabilitation as SNFs. Prior to FY2015, acute care hospitals received DSH funds. In FY2015, hospitals received Medicare DSH funding based on their DSH patient percentage and an established formula. DSH payments to qualifying IPPS hospitals were reduced, with 25% of funds distributed based on the existing formula and the rest based on uncompensated care share. CMS used DSH patient days to estimate hospitals' share of uncompensated care. The President's budget clarifies that DSH patient days include days for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries who have exhausted their inpatient Medicare Part A benefits. Value-based purchasing rewards healthcare providers for quality care provided to Medicare beneficiaries. The President's budget proposes value-based purchasing programs for various provider types, tying at least 2% of payments to quality and efficiency of care. Clinical lab services are paid based on fee schedules with a nation-wide payment ceiling. The annual clinical laboratory fee schedule amounts are updated each year, with a payment ceiling set at 74% of the median fee schedule amounts. Payments are adjusted annually based on the consumer price index. Updates were eliminated for certain years by different legislations. Currently, the fee schedule update is based on the CPI-U update reduced by a multi-factor productivity adjustment and 1.75%. The President's budget aims to lower payment rates for clinical laboratory services. The President's budget proposes lowering payment rates for clinical laboratory services by 1.75% annually from 2016 through 2023. It also gives the Secretary authority to adjust rates in a budget-neutral manner and supports electronic reporting of laboratory results. Additionally, Medicare covers some drugs under Part B, where providers buy and administer the drugs, receiving payments for both administration and supply. Medicare reimburses providers for supplying most Part B drugs based on a formula of 106% of the drug's average sales price (ASP). Providers negotiate with drug wholesalers to purchase Part B drugs, with higher volume purchasers often getting discounts below 106% of ASP. The Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General conducts drug price monitoring studies to ensure reimbursement does not exceed the widely available market price by 5% or more. The Secretary has authority to substitute for ASP the lesser of either WAMP or 103% of a drug's AMP for Part B drugs when the drug's ASP exceeds WAMP or AMP by 5% or more. CMS implemented a Part B drug price substitution policy in January 2013 due to a 5% difference between WAMP or AMP and ASP for some Part B drugs. The President's proposed budget in FY2015 aimed to reduce Medicare Part B drug reimbursement from 106% of ASP to 103% of ASP, with drug manufacturers required to pay rebates to providers when drug acquisition costs exceeded 103% of ASP. These rebates would be excluded from ASP calculations. The Secretary also had authority to set a flat fee in drug pricing. The Secretary has authority to set a flat fee in drug pricing and substitute a flat fee for Medicare Part B reimbursement for drugs instead of using the ASP +3% formula. The Stark law prohibits physician self-referrals for designated health services paid for by Medicare or Medicaid if there is a financial relationship with an entity. The Stark law prohibits physician self-referrals for designated health services paid for by Medicare or Medicaid. In 2016, the President's budget proposal aimed to exclude certain services from the in-office ancillary services exception to the Stark law, unless specific accountability standards are met. The proposal modifies the ACA requirement for a face-to-face encounter prior to prescribing durable medical equipment. It allows non-physician practitioners to document the encounter. This proposal was not included in the President's FY2014 Budget. The Medicare Advantage (MA) program allows beneficiaries to receive Medicare covered benefits through private health plans, with payments adjusted for care costs. The ACA required adjustments to MA risk scores for coding differences between plans and providers, with further analyses conducted post-2010. Minimum coding intensity adjustments were specified in 2014. The ACA specifies minimum coding intensity adjustments for Medicare Advantage starting in 2014, with yearly increases until reaching an 8.51% adjustment in 2020. This proposal aims to increase the minimum coding intensity adjustment to improve risk scores. The proposal aims to modify the Medicare Advantage program by allowing employers and unions to sponsor Employer Group Waiver Plans (EGWPs) for their Medicare-eligible members. These plans receive a monthly payment to provide Medicare covered benefits, with adjustments made to ensure adequate funding. Starting in 2012, Medicare Advantage plans receive a payment based on their bid compared to a benchmark. Plans below the benchmark receive a rebate based on quality, while plans at or above the benchmark require additional premiums from enrollees. EGWPs tend to bid closer to the benchmark. From 2016, EGWP payments would be based on average MA plan bids in each market. Medicare Part D provides coverage for outpatient prescription drugs to beneficiaries who enroll in this optional benefit. About 63% of eligible Medicare beneficiaries are currently enrolled in Part D, with some qualifying for low-income subsidies to help with premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. In 2013, an estimated 11.3 million Medicare beneficiaries qualified for these subsidies, with automatic eligibility for dual-eligibles and recipients of certain programs. Others with limited assets and incomes below 150% of FPL may also qualify. Medicare Part D provides coverage for outpatient prescription drugs to beneficiaries, with about 30% qualifying for the Low-Income Subsidy (LIS) to receive assistance for premiums and cost sharing. Prescription drug coverage is offered through private drug plans, with plan sponsors negotiating prices with manufacturers for rebates. Medicaid determines basic prescription drug rebates based on a drug's average manufacturers' price or a flat percentage. The President's budget proposal in 2016 would require drug manufacturers to pay the difference between rebates provided to Part D plans and Medicaid rebate levels for brand name and generic drugs for LIS beneficiaries. An additional rebate would be required for drugs with price increases higher than inflation. The Medicare Part D standard drug benefit includes a coverage gap where enrollees face higher out-of-pocket costs. The Medicare Part D standard drug benefit includes a coverage gap where enrollees face higher out-of-pocket costs. The ACA gradually phases out the coverage gap through discounts and subsidies, with enrollees having a 25% cost share for prescriptions until reaching the catastrophic limit in 2020. Manufacturers began providing a 50% discount for brand-name drugs purchased in the coverage gap in 2011. The federal government is gradually increasing subsidies for brand-name and generic drugs in the Medicare Part D coverage gap. By 2020, the government will subsidize 25% of brand-name drugs and 75% of generic drugs. The President's budget proposes increasing the manufacturer discount for brand-name drugs to 75% from 50% in 2016, effectively eliminating the coverage gap for brand-name drugs. CMS uses a Star Ratings system to assess the quality of Part D plans. The Medicare Part D program uses a Star Ratings system to evaluate plan quality and performance. MA-PD plan sponsors are rated on up to 48 measures, with a 5-star rating being excellent. The average star rating for PDPs in 2014 was 3.04, with 37% of plans rated four stars or higher. For MA-PDs, the average star rating was 3.84, with 38% of plans rated four stars or higher. Part D is designed as a market-oriented program with insurers competing for enrollees by offering lower prices or more generous benefits, while the government provides subsidies to participating plans. The federal government provides substantial subsidies to Part D plans, with beneficiary premiums covering about 25% of the plan cost. The President's budget proposes revising the payment system to reimburse plans based on their Star Rating, similar to the MA quality bonus program. Plans with four stars or higher would receive higher reimbursements, while those below four stars would get less. Recent investigations found some beneficiaries obtaining overlapping prescriptions for abused drugs, prompting CMS to take actions to reduce inappropriate utilization. The President's proposal aims to reduce inappropriate utilization of Part D prescription drugs, particularly opioids and acetaminophen. CMS has implemented controls at the point of sale and quantity limits to prevent over-utilization. Plan sponsors are required to conduct closer reviews of filled prescriptions for at-risk beneficiaries and collaborate with prescribers. The proposal grants the Secretary authority to suspend Part D coverage and payment for mis-prescribed or overprescribed drugs with abuse potential, as well as for prescriptions presenting imminent risks to patients. The proposal aims to reduce inappropriate utilization of Part D prescription drugs, including opioids and acetaminophen. It grants the Secretary authority to require providers to include additional information on certain Part D prescriptions for coverage. LIS beneficiaries in Medicare Part D may qualify for assistance with prescription drug cost sharing based on income. Dual-eligible beneficiaries with income below 100% of FPL have copays for generic and brand-name drugs, while those above 100% have different copayment thresholds. LIS beneficiaries in Medicare Part D have varying copayment thresholds based on income levels. Those with income above 100% of FPL pay $2.55 for generic drugs and $6.35 for brand-name drugs until reaching the catastrophic threshold, where copayment is zero. Other beneficiaries with incomes up to 150% of FPL pay a 15% coinsurance rate up to the catastrophic threshold, with cost sharing above that level. LIS beneficiaries have higher drug costs and lower generic drug dispensing rates compared to non-LIS beneficiaries. The President's budget proposes reducing copayments for generic drugs for LIS beneficiaries while doubling copayments for brand-name drugs. The Secretary would have authority to exclude brand-name drugs in certain cases, and LIS beneficiaries could appeal to CMS to continue buying brand-name drugs at current rates. This proposed cost-sharing change would not apply to LIS beneficiaries. The proposed cost sharing change for Part D beneficiaries with incomes between 135% and 150% of FPL would only apply if they reached their plan's catastrophic coverage limit. This is a modification of a legislative proposal from the President's FY2014 Budget. Low-income individuals must qualify for assistance and enroll in a specific Part D plan, with some being automatically enrolled by CMS into a plan with basic prescription drug coverage. The President's budget proposes a change in the auto-enrollment process for LIS beneficiaries in Medicare Part D, allowing CMS to contract with a single plan for coverage. This would streamline the process and payment method for retroactive drug claims. The FY2014 Budget proposal impacts Medicare and Medicaid budgets by utilizing the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 to allow generic versions of drugs to enter the market more easily after a brand-name product's patent expires. This process, known as an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), helps lower generic drug prices by using safety and effectiveness data from the brand-name firm's new drug application. Generic sponsors can challenge a brand-name manufacturer's patent by filing an ANDA with a paragraph IV certification. The FDA provides 180-day market exclusivity to the first successful paragraph IV filer, preventing other generics from entering the market. Settlements between brand-name and generic sponsors in Hatch-Waxman litigation sometimes involve \"pay-for-delay\" agreements, where the brand-name company pays the generic firm to delay marketing the drug. A legislative proposal aims to prohibit these agreements to promote generic drug entry into the market. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 established a pathway for competing versions of biologics, creating regulations for biosimilar and interchangeable biologics. The FDA plays a key role in setting standards for these products and provides data protection and marketing exclusivity for brand name drugs and follow-on products. Brand name biologic drugs receive four years of marketing exclusivity. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 established regulations for biosimilar and interchangeable biologics, providing data protection and marketing exclusivity for brand name drugs and follow-on products. Brand biologics receive 12 years of data exclusivity, during which competitors cannot rely on the innovator's clinical data for FDA approval. A legislative proposal in FY2015 suggested reducing data exclusivity for brand biologics to seven years and eliminating additional exclusivity for minor product changes. The proposal in the President's FY2014 budget suggests eliminating additional exclusivity periods for minor changes in product formulations for Medicare and Medicaid budgets. Medicare beneficiaries pay Part B premiums based on income thresholds, with higher-income beneficiaries paying a larger share. The ACA imposed income-related premiums for Part D starting in 2011 and suspended inflation-indexing of income thresholds for Parts B and D through 2019 at 2010 levels. In 2012, 4% of Part B enrollees paid higher income-related premiums. The President's budget proposes increasing applicable cost percentages for higher income beneficiaries to 40% to 90%, with new income thresholds and additional high-income brackets. Inflation-indexing of income thresholds would be suspended until 25% of beneficiaries under Parts B and D were subject to these premiums. The 2014 Part B annual deductible is $147, set to increase by $25 in 2018, 2020, and 2022 for new Medicare enrollees. The proposal would create two beneficiary groups with different deductible amounts. The proposal would create two beneficiary groups with different deductible amounts for Medicare enrollees, with the second group facing annual increases of $25 in 2018, 2020, and 2022. This would result in new beneficiaries paying a $75 higher deductible by 2022 compared to those enrolled before 2018. The proposal in the President's FY2014 Budget aims to increase deductible amounts for Medicare enrollees, resulting in higher costs for new beneficiaries compared to those enrolled before 2018. Medigap is private health insurance that supplements Medicare coverage, offering various standardized plans with different levels of coverage. In 2012, 66% of Medigap enrollees were covered by plans offering \"first-dollar\" coverage for Parts A and B deductibles and coinsurance. The President's FY2014 Budget proposed a Part B premium surcharge for new Medicare beneficiaries with low-cost Medigap plans. Medicare covers a 60-day episode of home health care, including skilled nursing, therapy, and medical supplies. Medicare no longer requires cost sharing for home health services, but beneficiaries may have copayments for DME and osteoporosis drugs. MedPAC recommended a per episode copayment for home health episodes without prior hospitalization. The President's budget proposed a $100 copayment for new beneficiaries for each home health 60-day episode with five or more visits. The ACA established the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to develop and submit detailed proposals to Congress and the President to reduce the growth rate of Medicare spending. Proposals will only be required in certain years when the CMS Chief Actuary determines that the projected Medicare per capita growth rate exceeds predetermined spending targets, and will have to meet specific savings targets. Recommendations made by the Board automatically go into effect unless Congress enacts specific legislation to prevent their implementation. The first year the Board's proposals can take effect is 2015. The ACA established the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to reduce Medicare spending growth rates. The CMS Actuary noted that the IPAB trigger would not be activated in 2015. The Congressional Budget Office projected no IPAB activity for the next 10 fiscal years. The President's budget proposes lowering the target rate for 2018 onwards. Medicare and Medicaid appeals processes differ significantly. The Medicare and Medicaid appeals processes vary depending on the specific parts of Medicare. This can lead to confusion, inefficiency, and increased costs for beneficiaries, providers, and states. Dual-eligible beneficiaries, who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, may face challenges navigating these processes. Medicaid serves as the payer of last resort for dual-eligible beneficiaries, covering costs not paid by Medicare. The President's budget proposes legislation to create an integrated Medicare and Medicaid appeals process for dual-eligible beneficiaries to address delays and care interruptions. This proposal aims to reduce administrative costs and duplicative treatments for both programs. The ACA allows CMS to standardize extracts of Medicare claims data. The President's budget proposes expanding the use of Medicare data by qualified entities beyond performance measurement. This includes using the data for fraud prevention, value-added analysis for physicians, and releasing raw claims data for care coordination and practice improvement, for a fee equal to Medicare's cost. The President's FY2014 budget proposal includes expanding Medicare data use for fraud prevention and value-added analysis. The Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) integrates Medicaid and Medicare for dual-eligible beneficiaries ages 55 and over. PACE providers receive capitated payments to provide comprehensive benefits in adult day health center settings. A new pilot demonstration is proposed to expand PACE eligibility to individuals ages 21 to 55. The President's FY2014 budget proposal includes expanding Medicare data use for fraud prevention and value-added analysis. The Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) integrates Medicaid and Medicare for dual-eligible beneficiaries ages 55 and over. A new pilot demonstration is proposed to expand PACE eligibility to individuals ages 21 to 55. This proposal affects both the Medicare and Medicaid budgets by requiring states to pay Medicare Part B premiums for low-income Medicare beneficiaries known as Qualifying Individuals (QIs). States receive federal funding to pay QI's Medicare premiums up to a certain allocation. The QI program has been reauthorized and funded multiple times since its establishment in 1997. The President's FY2014 budget proposal includes extending authorization and funding for the Qualifying Individuals (QI) program through December 31, 2015, with $200 million in funding. States set their own Medicaid provider payment rates, which must be sufficient to ensure access to covered benefits. Concerns about low Medicaid physician payment rates and provider participation persist. The Affordable Care Act mandates raising Medicaid payment rates for certain primary care services. The ACA requires Medicaid payment rates for certain primary care services to match Medicare rates in 2013 and 2014, with the federal government covering the cost. The President's budget proposes extending this through 2015 and expanding eligibility to mid-level providers like physician assistants and nurse practitioners. The ACA requires Medicaid payment rates for certain primary care services to match Medicare rates in 2013 and 2014, with the federal government covering the cost. The President's budget proposes extending this through 2015 and expanding eligibility to mid-level providers like physician assistants and nurse practitioners. States are required to make Medicaid DSH payments to hospitals treating low-income and Medicaid patients, with federal matching funds up to a capped allotment. Medicaid DSH allotment reductions will begin in FY2016 and end in FY2023, with allotments rebounding to pre-ACA levels in FY2024. The President's budget proposes extending the ACA-reduced Medicaid DSH allotment levels to FY2024 and subsequent years, with allotments increasing based on CPI-U. States have flexibility in setting Medicaid payment rates, subject to certain requirements for efficiency and quality of care. The federal regulations specify that states cannot pay more for inpatient hospital services or nursing facility services under Medicaid than under Medicare principles of reimbursement. Medicare historically paid for most DME based on fee schedules, updated annually for price inflation. The MMA established a competitive acquisition program for DME, where prices are determined by suppliers' bids in specified areas. The first round started in 2011, and the second round in 2013. The Secretary is required to extend the competitive acquisition program for DME or adjust fee schedule rates in remaining areas by 2016. The President's budget proposes limiting federal reimbursement for Medicaid spending on certain DME to Medicare rates. CHIPRA created an \"Express Lane\" eligibility option for states to rely on specified agencies for determining and renewing eligibility. The President's Budget proposes a permanent extension of the state option to use \"Express Lane\" for Medicaid and CHIP child eligibility determinations. States must provide transitional medical assistance (TMA) to low-income families who would otherwise lose coverage due to income changes. TMA is required for four months if eligibility is lost due to increased spousal support or earned income. The Congress expanded work-related Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) benefits in 1988, requiring states to provide 6 to 12 months of TMA coverage to families losing Medicaid eligibility due to increased work hours or income. An additional work-related TMA option was created in ARRA, allowing states to provide TMA for a full 12-month period. Congress has extended these expanded TMA requirements on multiple occasions. The President's budget proposes extending expanded TMA requirements through December 31, 2015, allowing states to opt out if they adopt the ACA Medicaid expansion. Section 1915(c) waivers authorize states to offer home and community-based services to specific populations with long-term care needs. The proposal aims to add services in psychiatric residential treatment facilities to the list of qualified institutional benefits for 1915(c) waivers, extending coverage of home and community-based services to eligible individuals with a level of care need for such facilities. This proposal was not included in the President's FY2014 Budget. States can enroll certain Medicaid beneficiaries into Alternative Benefit Plans (ABPs), which have different requirements than traditional Medicaid benefits. ABPs must cover at least the 10 essential health benefits and comply with federal requirements for mental health parity. Benefit substitution can be used to fill coverage gaps. States can use benefit substitution to fill coverage gaps in Alternative Benefit Plans (ABPs) for certain Medicaid beneficiaries. The President's budget proposes benchmark-equivalent coverage for non-elderly, nondisabled adults with income exceeding 133% of the Federal Poverty Level. Medicaid distinguishes between single source drugs and innovator multiple source drugs for prescription drug rebates. Medicaid distinguishes between single source drugs and innovator multiple source drugs for prescription drug rebates. Rebates for drugs under patent have a basic rebate and an additional rebate component based on price comparisons and inflation. Generic drug rebates are set at 13% of the drug's AMP. Manufacturers may market patented products as over-the-counter before patent expiration. The President's budget proposes legislation to clarify that patented products marketed as over-the-counter will still be considered brand name drugs for Medicaid rebate calculations. Medicaid rebate calculations for brand name drugs include a basic rebate and an additional rebate based on price comparisons and inflation. The President's FY2015 Budget proposes to apply the additional inflation adjustment brand name drug rebate to generic drugs as well. Medicaid law requires states to cover outpatient drugs from manufacturers with pricing agreements, excluding certain drugs like prescription vitamins and minerals. The proposal clarifies that states must cover prenatal vitamins and fluoride preparations under Medicaid if deemed medically necessary, exempting them from the prescription vitamin and mineral exclusion. This proposal was not part of the President's FY2014 Budget. The President's budget includes a technical correction to an ACA provision that requires manufacturers to pay Medicaid rebates on line-extension products as if they were the original product. This correction aims to address lower rebate obligations for new formulations of existing products. The budget proposes a technical correction to an ACA provision regarding Medicaid rebates for line-extension drugs by removing the word \"original\" from the definition of single source and innovator multiple source drugs. This correction aims to ensure drug manufacturers comply with Medicaid Drug Rebate program requirements. The President's budget proposes a 12-quarter time limit for manufacturers to dispute state drug utilization data, aiming to resolve outstanding disputes. Authorized generics, licensed by original patent holders to generic manufacturers, are argued to raise prices for consumers and reduce incentives for generic manufacturers to challenge single source drug patents. The President's budget aims to change Medicaid rebate calculations for brand name products by excluding authorized generic sales, increasing manufacturers' rebate obligations. The ACA also refined Medicaid drug definitions, requiring FULs for therapeutically equivalent products. The President's budget proposes excluding brand and authorized generic sales from Medicaid prescription drug FUL calculations, increasing manufacturers' rebate obligations. Medicaid drug rebate program requires manufacturers to make their entire product line available, with rebates calculated based on each manufacturer's sales. The President's budget proposal aims to address irregularities in manufacturers' calculations of Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) for Medicaid drug rebates. Manufacturers sometimes include excluded and non-FDA approved drug sales in their AMP calculations, reducing rebates owed to states. The proposal would require manufacturers to fully compensate states for rebates owed if non-covered drugs were not included in AMP. The President's FY2014 budget proposal aims to address irregularities in manufacturers' calculations of Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) for Medicaid drug rebates. CMS and HHS OIG have authority to monitor drug manufacturers' reporting of drug prices and rebates paid to the Medicaid program. There is variation in methodologies used by manufacturers to report drug prices, impacting the rebates owed, but CMS does not routinely verify manufacturers' documentation. The President's FY2014 budget proposal aims to address irregularities in manufacturers' drug price reporting for Medicaid rebates. The proposal includes regular audits and surveys of drug manufacturers to ensure compliance with rebate agreements, Medicaid statutes, and regulations. The ACA made changes to Medicaid prescription drug pricing policies to create more uniform reporting standards. The FDA approves drugs for safety and effectiveness under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetics Act. Medicaid reimbursement for off-label drugs is limited to listed indications in compendia. CMS proposed changes authorized by the ACA to require electronic listing of products with the FDA for Medicaid coverage. The FDA aligns Medicaid drug coverage requirements with Medicare's, requiring drug manufacturers to offer rebates to states. Manufacturers report drug price information to CMS for rebate calculation. ACA provisions amended the Medicaid drug rebate statute, with CMS proposing changes to implement ACA's Medicaid drug rebate updates. The President's budget proposed increased penalties for drug manufacturers who knowingly report false information under Medicaid drug rebate pricing agreements. Section 6001 of DRA required the Secretary to survey retail pharmacy prices and allocated $5 million annually for five years for the survey and reporting. The President's budget proposed increased penalties for drug manufacturers who knowingly report false information under Medicaid drug rebate pricing agreements. Section 6001 of DRA allocated $5 million annually for five years to fund a nationwide retail pharmacy survey of consumer drug prices, but the survey was suspended in 2013 due to budget limitations. The budget now proposes a mandatory $6 million annual appropriation for five years to sustain the survey and collect information on retail pharmacy prices. The proposal aims to collect wholesale acquisition cost data from drug wholesalers for all Medicaid-covered drugs regularly. This would allow CMS to verify reported AMPs by drug manufacturers. The proposal also grants the Secretary authority to survey wholesale acquisition costs and ensure accurate pricing information. The proposal aims to collect wholesale acquisition cost data from drug wholesalers for all Medicaid-covered drugs to verify reported AMPs by manufacturers. Children in foster care, eligible for Medicaid, often receive psychotropic medications, with certain factors increasing the likelihood. Limited research exists on the safety and effectiveness of psychotropics for children with mental health disorders. The welfare law requires states to provide information on protocols for psychotropic medication use in foster care. The President's budget proposes incentive payments to reduce reliance on psychotropics by promoting evidence-based treatment. This initiative was not in the FY2014 Budget. HHS poverty guidelines are a simplified version of Census Bureau poverty thresholds. The HHS poverty guidelines are based on Census Bureau thresholds and are used for determining financial eligibility for federal programs like Medicaid. The guidelines are updated annually to reflect inflation adjustments and changes in family sizes. The 2014 poverty guidelines reflect price changes between 2012 and 2013. The President's budget includes a provision to ensure the guidelines are only adjusted when necessary. The HHS poverty guidelines are adjusted based on inflation, with a provision in the President's FY2014 Budget to prevent individuals from losing Medicaid coverage due to negative CPI-U. This provision impacts social programs like Medicaid, SNAP, and WIC. Additionally, a special immigrant visa program for Afghans allows those employed by the U.S. government in Afghanistan to be eligible for visas, with a cap of 3,000 principal aliens for FY2014. The special immigrant visa program for Afghans allows for up to 3,000 visas annually for FY2009-FY2013, with a cap of 3,000 principal aliens for FY2014. Unused visa numbers can be carried forward through FY2015. Afghans granted these visas receive legal permanent resident status and are eligible for resettlement assistance and federal benefits. The President's budget proposes issuing up to 3,000 visas in FY2015, with unused numbers carried forward to FY2016. The President's budget proposes extending the current seven-year period of SSI eligibility for refugees, asylees, and humanitarian immigrants to nine years through the end of FY2016. After FY2016, the eligibility period would return to seven years. The President's FY2014 Budget proposes prohibiting the use of child support to repay Medicaid costs associated with giving birth, a practice retained by 10 states. Additionally, there is a history of fraud and abuse associated with DME and PMDs covered by Medicare when deemed medically necessary. There is a history of fraud and abuse associated with DME and PMDs covered by Medicare. CMS began a demonstration in 2012 requiring PMDs in seven states to receive Medicare prior authorization. The growth of imaging services under Medicare has exceeded other Part B services, with advanced imaging spending rising faster than standard imaging services. The GAO study found an increase in self-referred advanced imaging services from 2004 to 2010, raising concerns about their appropriate use in Medicare. The President's budget proposal includes extending the Secretary's authority for prior authorization of Medicare fee-for-service items and implementing prior authorization for advanced imaging services. Medicare providers must submit updated enrollment information within specified time frames. The President's budget proposal includes authorizing civil penalties for providers who fail to update enrollment records on time. Claims processing systems lack data to verify patient visits and medical necessity of services. Many providers are adopting electronic health records with incentives from ARRA and ACA. The ACA incentivized providers to invest in EHR systems that can interact with clinical decision support systems and electronic claims processing. Electronic patient records include detailed information on services ordered by practitioners, while claims processing systems focus on reimbursement details. Implementing an electronic Medicare claims ordering system could help validate high-risk services ordered by practitioners. The President's FY2014 budget proposal included a claims ordering system to validate high-risk services ordered by practitioners. Providers using banking arrangements like sweep accounts and wire-transfers to off-shore accounts pose a higher risk of fraudulent activities. Medicare has faced challenges recovering improper payments due to providers quickly transferring funds to other jurisdictions, shielding payments from recovery actions. The President's budget proposes authorizing the Secretary to require Medicare providers to report the use of accounts transferring funds to sweep accounts in other jurisdictions. The President's FY2014 budget proposal included expanding the Medicare incentive reward program to encourage reporting of fraud or abuse. The proposal aims to increase the amount individuals can collect to 15% of the final amount recovered, up to $1,000. The President's budget proposal for FY2014 included expanding the Medicare incentive reward program to allow individuals to collect up to 15% of overpayment recoveries, capped at $1,000. Territories operate Medicaid programs with different rules than states, including annual federal spending caps and lack of Medicaid Fraud Control Units. The proposal aims to encourage territories to establish Medicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCUs) by exempting federal support from funding caps and statutory payment ceilings. MFCUs investigate and prosecute healthcare fraud in Medicaid programs and receive funding from OIG grants and state matching funds. This proposal was not included in the President's FY2014 Budget. The President's FY2014 Budget includes proposals for states to implement prescription drug monitoring activities in Medicaid, such as \"lock-in\" programs and linking Medicaid data with monitoring programs to combat controlled substance abuse. Some states have also passed laws to increase penalties for diverting Medicaid drugs. The proposal aims to monitor high-risk Medicaid drug billing to identify and address issues. The proposal in the President's FY2014 budget requires states to monitor high-risk Medicaid drug billing to identify potential abuse or excessive utilization patterns. States can tailor their programs by choosing drug classes subject to overuse or abuse and must develop a high-utilization remediation plan. The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 mandates federal agencies to review programs susceptible to erroneous payments and find ways to reduce improper payments if they exceed $10 million per year. The President's FY2014 budget proposal includes the consolidation of the Medicaid Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) and Medicaid eligibility and quality control (MEQC) programs. States have the option to use PERM to fulfill the MEQC requirement. Medicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCUs) investigate and prosecute healthcare providers suspected of defrauding the Medicaid program. The President's FY2014 budget proposal includes allowing Medicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCUs) to receive federal matching funds for investigating and prosecuting abuse and neglect in non-institutional settings, such as home- and community-based services (HCBS). This proposal aims to address the need to monitor and investigate beneficiary complaints on non-institutional providers as Medicaid long-term care services shift from institutional to non-institutional settings. The FY2014 budget proposal includes federal funding for Medicaid and CHIP programs, with Medicaid services reimbursed based on the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) rate. Exceptions to the regular FMAP rate exist for certain states, populations, and services. Federal CHIP matching funds are provided at an enhanced FMAP rate, but with capped annual allotments. States are generally prohibited from using other federal sources to fund the state share of Medicaid. The President's budget proposal in FY2014 would prohibit states from using federal funds for Medicaid or CHIP state shares, except for authorized exceptions. Recovery audit contractors (RACs) receive a percentage of recovered improper payments, with Medicare RAC recoupments returned to the Medicare Trust Fund and Medicaid recoupments returned to the state and federal government based on FMAP rates. The President's budget in FY2014 would allow CMS to use RAC recoveries for program administration but not for funding corrective actions. HHS OIG has the authority to exclude healthcare providers from federal programs, with extended authority under the ACA for false statements on enrollment applications. The President's FY2014 budget proposal aims to expand HHS OIG authority to exclude individuals and entities from federal health programs if they are affiliated with sanctioned entities, closing a loophole that allows individuals to evade exclusion by resigning or divesting ownership. This proposal also includes extending exclusion authority to entities affiliated with sanctioned entities, with no specific penalties outlined for fraudulent use of beneficiary numbers or billing privileges. The President's FY2014 budget proposal aims to strengthen penalties for fraudulent use of beneficiary numbers and billing privileges in Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP programs. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 established performance bonus payments for states increasing Medicaid enrollment among low-income children. Bonus payments began in FY2009, with FY2013 being the final year for states to earn them. In FY2009 through FY2013, 27 states received CHIPRA performance bonus payments totaling $1.1 billion. Funding for the bonuses came from a $3.2 billion initial appropriation in FY2009, with unspent amounts from CHIP allotments and redistributions contributing to the fund balance. However, multiple appropriations laws rescinded $22.6 billion in funding for the bonuses from FY2011 through FY2014. The President's budget proposes to extend CHIPRA performance bonus payments for one year, with a fund balance of $1.8 billion as of February 2014. The proposal includes changes to programmatic requirements for states to qualify for the bonuses. Children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid, with coverage for psychotropic medications. Certain factors predict a higher likelihood of eligibility. The child welfare agency, school-age children in group settings, and living in foster care have a higher chance of taking psychotropic medications. Research on the effectiveness and safety of these medications for children with mental health disorders is limited. Federal law requires states to provide information on protocols for the appropriate use of psychotropic medication. The President's budget proposes a joint initiative to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care by incentivizing evidence-based screening and treatment of trauma and mental health disorders. The proposal for funding competitive grants for screening, assessment, and treatment of trauma and mental health disorders was not included in the President's FY2014 Budget. The Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP) was established by the Secretary to provide dedicated resources for program integrity. MIP supports state efforts in Medicaid program integrity through oversight and technical assistance, enhancing individual state activities. The proposal aims to increase annual MIP appropriations by $25 million and expand statutory authority for using MIP resources, including funding for Medicaid Financial Management program expansion and technical assistance to states. Money Follows the Person Demonstration allows HHS to award competitive grants to transition institutionalized Medicaid enrollees into community settings, promoting the use of Medicaid home and community-based services. The Money Follows the Person Demonstration (MFP) was established under the DRA and extended by the ACA, with an additional $2.25 billion appropriated through FY2016. Eligible Medicaid enrollees transitioning into the community receive increased federal matching rates for 12 months. The President's budget proposes extending the MFP Demonstration through FY2020, allowing funds to prevent institutionalization rather than just transitioning individuals to community-based settings. The proposal aims to transition individuals from institutional to community-based settings, reducing the institutional requirement from 90 to 60 days and allowing Medicare-covered days to count. It also allows for transitioning individuals in certain mental health facilities to community residential settings. States can apply for waivers under Section 1332 of the ACA to modify certain health insurance coverage requirements starting in 2017. The Secretaries have the authority to grant state innovation waivers if certain criteria are met, allowing for modifications to health insurance coverage requirements under the ACA. The President's budget proposal includes provisions of the ACA, allowing states to obtain state innovation waivers earlier. CMS's program management account funds Medicare's administrative functions, with discretionary and mandatory appropriations for program operations, federal administration, survey and certification, research, and state high-risk pools. The President's budget proposal includes mandatory program management appropriations for Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and private health insurance programs. The budget also includes funding for new legislative initiatives and an increase in mandatory funding for Program Management. Section 1891 of the Social Security Act requires HHAs participating in Medicare to comply with certain conditions of participation. The President's budget proposal includes sanctions for noncompliant HHAs, including suspension of Medicare payments and civil monetary penalties. Section 6111 of the ACA allows a portion of penalties to be retained for initiatives improving SNF care. The President's budget proposal includes sanctions for noncompliant HHAs, such as suspension of Medicare payments and civil monetary penalties. Section 6111 of the ACA allows penalties to be retained for initiatives improving SNF care. The budget would authorize CMS to assess a fee to offset administrative costs of the Federal Payment Levy Program. The Department of the Treasury would receive the full amount of the levy, and Medicare providers must pay CMS fees for administrative costs of the Federal Payment Levy Program. The federal government and state governments share responsibility for ensuring Medicare and Medicaid providers meet quality and safety standards. CMS contracts with organizations to conduct inspections and investigate complaints. In FY2014, survey entities completed over 24,434 initial surveys and re-certifications and investigated over 51,400 complaints. CMS conducts initial surveys and re-certifications for facility providers enrolling in Medicare or Medicaid, along with investigating complaints. In FY2014, over 24,434 surveys and re-certifications were completed, and 51,400 complaints were investigated. Surveyors identify deficiencies, giving entities time to correct them before revisiting. The President's budget proposes user fees for revisit inspections to provide resources for follow-up visits and incentivize quick corrections. The President's FY2014 budget proposal includes a phased-in fee for revisit inspections to incentivize quick corrections. Two provisions authorize quality and performance measurement duties for a contracted consensus-based entity, such as the National Quality Forum. These duties include priority setting, measure endorsement, maintenance, convening multi-stakeholder groups, and annual reporting to Congress. Section 3014 of the ACA requires a pre-rulemaking process to select quality measures, involving gathering multi-stakeholder input and making measures available to the public. The President's budget proposal includes funding for quality and performance measurement duties under Section 183 of MIPPA and Section 3014 of the ACA. The proposal extends funding by providing $30 million per year for each section for fiscal years FY2015 through FY2017. Funding allocation between the two sections is unspecified."
