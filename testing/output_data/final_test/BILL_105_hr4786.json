    "content": "Title III of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 is amended to include the treatment of certain contributions and donations to be returned to donors. Title III of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 is amended to include provisions for political committees to transfer contributions or donations over $500 to the Commission if they intend to return them. Contributions made in violation of specific sections must also be transferred. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 requires political committees to transfer contributions over $500 to the Commission for possible return, along with information on the donation and any concerns about its legality. The Commission establishes an escrow account for these transferred amounts. Upon receiving an amount from a political committee, the Commission deposits it into an escrow account and notifies the Attorney General and the IRS. Interest earned on the escrow account is used for the same purposes as the original donation. Returned contributions are treated as complaints. The Commission treats transferred contributions as complaints and may use escrowed amounts to cover fines. Contributions can be returned within 180 days if certain conditions are met. The Commission may return a contribution if it has not determined a violation or if the contribution will not cover fines. The return of a contribution does not affect the status of an investigation. The Commission's contribution or donation under this subsection does not impact the investigation's status. The amount of a civil penalty for violations of section 323 is based on the donation amount. Donation is defined in Section 301 of the Act. The definition of \"donation\" in political contributions is clarified in the Act, and the authority to require forfeiture of donations is established for violations. The amendments made by this Act apply to contributions or donations refunded after the enactment date, regardless of regulatory issuance by the Federal Election Commission or Attorney General."
