    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Economic Growth and Development Act.\" Congress finds that sustainable economic growth is crucial for lifting people out of poverty and addressing development challenges. Private sector investment and economic growth have been key in successful development stories. There has been a significant shift in capital flows to developing countries, with the private sector now accounting for 87 percent of capital. (4) Eleven of the 15 largest importers of US goods and services are countries that graduated from US foreign assistance, and 12 of the 15 fastest growing markets for US exports are former US foreign assistance recipients. (5) With multiple government entities involved in US foreign assistance, it is challenging for US businesses to navigate the bureaucracy to find partnership opportunities. (6) Despite efforts to improve private sector coordination, agency-specific strategies need to be integrated for coherence. President Obama's 2010 Policy Directive on Global Development established an Interagency Policy Committee (IPC) for Global Development, but it lacks a streamlined mechanism for coordinating with the private sector. To enhance the effectiveness of US foreign assistance and promote sustainable economic development, involving the private sector in development planning and programming is crucial. Private sector perspectives and market data would greatly benefit decisions on program prioritization and resource allocations in various development strategies. By involving the private sector in development planning, programs can attract investment and foster public-private partnerships. The Millennium Challenge Corporation and Partnership for Growth analyze growth constraints, but these analyses should inform all agency strategies for more effective development programs. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n(1) Administrator - Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development.\n(2) United States development agencies - Department of State, United States Agency for International Development, Millennium Challenge Corporation, Overseas Private Investment Corporation, Trade and Development Agency, Inter-American Foundation, and African Development Foundation.\n(3) Private sector - for-profit United States businesses.\n(4) Secretary - Secretary of State. The purpose of this Act is to enhance coordination between US development agencies and the private sector, integrate the private sector into planning processes, analyze constraints to growth, and ensure accountability for progress. It also establishes an interagency mechanism to coordinate development programs and private sector investment activities. The President, in consultation with relevant parties, will establish an interagency mechanism to improve coordination of US development programs with private sector investment activities. This mechanism will streamline private sector liaison functions, utilize development and finance tools to attract private sector participation, and provide a single point of contact for partnership opportunities. SEC. 6. INTEGRATING PRIVATE SECTOR CONSULTATION IN COUNTRY, SECTOR, AND GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES. The Secretary and the Administrator will include private sector consultation in all development strategies. SEC. 7. ANALYSIS OF CONSTRAINTS TO GROWTH AND INVESTMENT IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND SECTORS. The Secretary and the Administrator must ensure independent constraints to growth and investment analyses are conducted as part of development strategies. This analysis includes identifying constraints in critical infrastructure, rule of law, tax codes, and economic sectors like agriculture and transportation. Teams from US development agencies, international organizations, and the private sector will conduct the analysis. Results of the analysis will be used to guide resource allocations in development strategies of US development agencies and stakeholders from recipient countries. The President must submit a report to specific Senate and House committees within one year of this Act's enactment, detailing the measures taken to implement the Act and the intended outcomes."
