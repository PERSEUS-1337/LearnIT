    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Vietnam Human Rights Sanctions Act\". The Vietnam Human Rights Sanctions Act finds that Vietnam is a one-party state controlled by the Communist Party, which restricts citizens' rights and freedoms. The government limits public dissent, freedom of speech, press, assembly, and access to the Internet. Cyberattacks originating from Vietnam are also a concern. The Government of Vietnam has disabled dissident websites and introduced new restrictions on public internet shops. They continue to detain, imprison, and restrict individuals for expressing dissenting views, including activists, journalists, bloggers, and members of ethnic minorities. The Government of Vietnam restricts labor rights, harasses activists, and limits freedom of religion by controlling religious groups and restricting independent organizations. The Government of Vietnam restricts religious leaders who do not conform to its demands, leading to harassment, arrests, imprisonment, or house arrest. Serious abuses and restrictions of religious freedom persist, with individuals being detained for religious activities, lack of accountability for officials, illegal independent religious activity, and vague legal protection for approved religious organizations. The Government of Vietnam has halted most religious reforms despite reported progress in church openings and legal registrations of religious venues. Property disputes with the Catholic Church in Hanoi have led to detention, threats, harassment, and violence against peaceful prayer vigils and religious leaders. In November 2006, Vietnam was designated for freedom violations. Unregistered ethnic minority Protestant congregations faced severe abuses by the government, including forced renunciations of faith, pressure to join government-recognized religious groups, arrest, harassment, destruction of churches, confiscation of property, and beatings. In 2008, peaceful Catholic prayer vigils at the Thai Ha Church in Ha Noi were disrupted, leading to detainment, harassment, and destruction of church property. In central Vietnam, church property was destroyed at Bau Sen, Loan Ly, and Tam Toa parishes. More recently, at Dong Chiem parish in Hanoi, religious statues and a crucifix were destroyed, parishioners and clergies were physically harmed. At Con Dau parish, police forcibly dispersed a Catholic funeral ceremony in May 2010, leading to arrests and interrogations of parishioners. One parishioner died from injuries sustained during a beating in July 2010, and two women suffered miscarriages from police tortures. Restrictions on clergy selection and seminary establishment continue for Catholics. The Government of Vietnam imposes restrictions on religious groups, including the Unified Buddhist Church and Catholic clergy. Dissident clerics are under house arrest, and the Supreme Patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Church is also detained. The Bat Nha Buddhists monastery was attacked by government forces in 2009. In October 2009, government thugs attacked a monastery, physically abusing and evicting about 400 monks and nuns. The Government of Vietnam suppresses activities of religious adherents like Cao Dai, Hoa Hao, Mennonites, and Montagnard Christians through detention and imprisonment. Ethnic minority Hmong in Northwest Highlands face restrictions and persecution, with some Hmong Protestants allowed to organize religious activities while others face denial of registration. The Government of Vietnam controls all media, including the Internet, jams foreign radio signals, and imprisons individuals for distributing democracy-related materials. People arrested for political or religious reasons are denied due process, held incommunicado, and tortured to confess to crimes they did not commit. Vietnam is a source and destination country for various forms of human trafficking, including commercial sexual exploitation, forced labor, and child trafficking. Despite expanding relations with the government, Congress has condemned human rights violations in Vietnam, emphasizing the ongoing serious violations of fundamental human rights. The United States and Vietnam have enhanced relations, providing an opportunity for a human rights dialogue. However, future progress on human rights issues in Vietnam is unlikely unless the US emphasizes that such progress is essential for further enhancements in the bilateral relationship. SEC. 3.
