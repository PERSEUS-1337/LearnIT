    "content": "The implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is significantly impacting federal mandatory spending, mainly focused on expanding health insurance coverage through various programs and subsidies. This includes premium tax credits, cost-sharing subsidies, federal matching funds for Medicaid expansion, new Medicare spending, and funding for innovative healthcare models. Additionally, the ACA established special funds to support primary care, public health, and comparative effectiveness. The ACA impacts federal mandatory spending by expanding health insurance coverage through various programs and subsidies. It also established funds for primary care, public health, and comparative effectiveness research. Discretionary spending under the ACA is divided into specific grant programs and administrative costs incurred by federal agencies like CMS and IRS. The report examines the effects of the ACA on discretionary spending, including authorizations for grant programs and administrative costs borne by CMS and the IRS. It also provides background information on enforceable discretionary spending limits and annual spending reductions. The report is periodically updated to reflect legislative and administrative developments. The ACA authorized new discretionary grant programs with specified annual appropriations for various fiscal years. Some provisions also allowed for multi-year appropriations or unspecified amounts for later years. The ACA authorized new discretionary grant programs with specified annual appropriations for various fiscal years, including reauthorizing funding for existing programs through FY2014 or FY2015. It permanently reauthorized appropriations for federal health centers, NHSC, and IHS programs. The ACA's discretionary spending provisions are summarized in tables below. The ACA authorized new discretionary grant programs with specified annual appropriations for various fiscal years, including reauthorizing funding for existing programs through FY2014 or FY2015. Provisions include authorizations of appropriations organized by general topic in tables. Each table row provides information on a specific ACA provision across four columns. The curr_chunk provides details on freestanding and amendatory provisions within the ACA, including administering agencies, program descriptions, eligibility criteria, and funding levels from FY2010 to FY2016. Many programs have seen flat or decreased discretionary funding since FY2010, with additional funding sources noted in parentheses. The curr_chunk provides details on funding figures for discretionary funding listed in the tables in the report, with specific appropriations indicated by the phrase \"No appropriations identified.\" ACA provisions in larger tables are grouped based on reauthorizing funding for existing programs or authorizing funding for new programs. The table entries include the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number for the grant. The curr_chunk discusses the funding discrepancies for discretionary grant programs authorized by the ACA, with a focus on three key programs. Despite the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of nearly $100 billion in appropriations over FY2012-FY2021, the actual funding falls short due to limited funding for new grant programs. The discrepancy in funding for ACA grant programs is due to limited discretionary appropriations and lower funding levels for reauthorized programs. Appropriators face challenges in funding new programs while maintaining existing funding levels. Programs like the federal health center program and NHSC have seen significant reductions in funding. The ACA grant programs, including the NHSC and PPHF, have experienced reduced discretionary appropriations since FY2010. The CHCF funds have become the primary source of funding for NHSC, while PPHF funds have supplemented or replaced annual discretionary appropriations for various programs. Most programs discussed in the report have expired authorizations of appropriations, with only four programs being reauthorized. Several ACA grant programs, including NHSC and PPHF, have seen reduced discretionary appropriations since FY2010. Most programs have expired authorizations of appropriations, with only four programs being reauthorized. CMS and the IRS are facing significant administrative costs to implement the ACA, requesting increased annual appropriations for the past five years, which Congress has denied. CMS has relied on various funding sources for the federally facilitated exchange operations. Total funding for FFE operations since FY2010 is shown in Table 1. The HHS Secretary used various funding sources, including discretionary and mandatory funds from different accounts, to support the development and operations of the federally facilitated exchanges (FFE) under the ACA. This included tapping into the Health Insurance Reform Implementation Fund (HIRIF) and the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) to cover costs. In the FY2013 and FY2014 budgets, CMS requested significant increases in funding for FFE operations, but Congress did not provide additional discretionary funding, leading to the use of alternative funding sources. In FY2014, CMS requested a $1.397 billion increase for FFE operations but Congress did not provide additional funding. CMS used departmental funds, NEF, and HIRIF funding. Congress prohibited the use of PPHF funds. In FY2015, CMS requested a $227 million increase for FFE operations, which was denied. CMS collected $888 million in FFE user fees to support operations. In FY2015, CMS collected $1.225 billion in FFE user fees, covering 61% of total funding for FFE operations. In FY2017, CMS anticipates collecting $1.604 billion in FFE user fees, which will cover about three-quarters of the estimated funding for FFE operations. The IRS has requested additional funding for ACA implementation in the past five years, but Congress has not provided any. The HHS budget office transferred $543 million to the IRS from FY2010-FY2016 to support ACA implementation. Congress has taken steps to limit federal discretionary spending in recent years. The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposed discretionary spending limits for defense and nondefense spending from FY2012 to FY2021, with further annual reductions starting in FY2013. The Act allocated reductions proportionately to discretionary and mandatory spending, with exemptions and special rules. The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposed spending limits on defense and nondefense categories. Reductions are achieved through sequestration and lowering discretionary spending caps. The Office of Management and Budget calculates required reductions and applies exemptions. Mandatory spending is reduced annually through sequestration, while discretionary spending reductions are achieved by lowering caps from FY2014 to FY2021. The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposed spending limits on defense and nondefense categories. Reductions are achieved through sequestration and lowering discretionary spending caps. The cuts within the lowered spending cap may be apportioned through annual appropriations decision-making. Nonexempt nondefense discretionary spending in FY2013 was subject to a 5.0% sequestration. The original nondefense discretionary spending caps for FY2014-FY2017 were lowered by approximately $37 billion to achieve necessary reductions. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 amended the BCA by establishing new levels for the FY2014 and FY2015 NDD spending caps. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA15) amended the Budget Control Act (BCA) by setting new levels for FY2016 and FY2017 NDD spending caps, allowing for additional funding compared to previous years. The revised caps for FY2017 showed a slight increase from FY2016. The revised cap for FY2017 is $40 million above the revised cap for FY2016."
