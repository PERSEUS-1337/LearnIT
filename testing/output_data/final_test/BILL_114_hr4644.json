    "content": "The \"Providing Resources to Improve Dual Language Education Act of 2016\" or the \"PRIDE Act\" aims to support dual language programs for limited English proficient children, as they have shown significant academic gains. Children in dual language programs demonstrate higher performance in language, literacy, and mathematics compared to traditional classrooms. However, access to these programs is limited for children from low-income communities, particularly African-American children. Dual Language Flagship Grants are proposed to address this issue. The section aims to provide incentives for local educational agencies to develop innovative strategies for working with low-income and limited English proficient children, improve school readiness, offer consistent support through dual language programs, and enhance biliteracy skills in impoverished communities. The Secretary is authorized to award grants for partnerships between educational agencies, early childhood programs, and technical assistance providers to implement dual language programs for economically disadvantaged minority students from preschool to fifth grade. The infrastructure supports a rigorous assessment system, curriculum alignment for bilingual competencies, student-centered instructional methods, and professional development for early childhood education instructors. The Act focuses on recruiting, training, and developing staff for high-quality dual language programs, establishing relationships with students' families and the community, and reserving 5% of funds for implementation. The Act focuses on awarding grants for up to five years, requiring eligible entities to submit applications with documentation of partnering with experts in dual language programs for technical assistance and evaluation. The partnership must have qualified personnel to develop, administer, evaluate, and implement the program, serving economically disadvantaged minority and limited English proficient children. The application should include data on serving these children, aligning assessment with instruction language, and program implementation details. The program application must include a description of how the program will be evaluated, how the evaluation will inform efforts to improve instruction for limited English proficient children, and activities that will support school readiness and academic progress through grade five, including culturally and linguistically appropriate dual language curriculum design. The program application must include a description of preschool through fifth grade instructional practices, curriculum, assessments strategies, teacher training, and parent outreach methods. Grantees will be selected based on these criteria through a peer review process. The Secretary will reserve funds for technical assistance and evaluation of dual language programs funded under the Act. This includes providing support to grantees and conducting program evaluations. The Secretary will use evaluations to determine program effectiveness and improve services for children. Evaluations will assess impact on students' literacy and language skills, instructional practices, and professional development strategies. The Secretary will disseminate best practices for early childhood education providers to improve school readiness of limited English proficient children. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2017, with additional funding for the following years. Definitions include \"dual language program\" as an instructional strategy promoting bilingualism and biliteracy. The State-funded preschool program aims to foster bilingualism, biliteracy, and academic achievement in children aged 3 to 5 through early childhood education. It supports cognitive, social, emotional, and physical development, preparing children for a successful transition to kindergarten. The program can be school- or community-based and is funded by a State agency. Limited English proficient children are those who were not born in the US or whose native language is not English. This includes Native Americans, Alaska Natives, or residents of outlying areas who have been significantly influenced by a language other than English. Limited English proficient children are those who may face difficulties in speaking or understanding English, which could hinder their academic success and full participation in society."
