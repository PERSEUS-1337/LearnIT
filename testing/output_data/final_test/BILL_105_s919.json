The Commission, established by the \"Independent Bipartisan Commission on Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1997,\" consists of 12 members appointed by the President within 15 days of the Act's enactment. Members must not be incumbent Members of Congress and should possess relevant qualifications. Appointment procedures involve nominees submitted by the Speaker of the House of Representatives. 3 members, including a political independent, are appointed from nominees submitted by the Majority Leader of the Senate, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, and Minority Leader of the Senate. If a list of nominees is not submitted within 15 days, consequences follow. The Act stipulates that within a 15-day period from enactment, certain provisions no longer apply. The President must appoint 3 members, one of whom must be a political independent meeting specific criteria. A political independent is defined as someone who has not held elective office in the Democratic or Republican party since January 1, 1992, or received compensation from these parties. The President appoints members to the Commission, with one designated as chairperson. Members serve for the life of the Commission, vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment, and no more than 4 members can be from the same political party. The Commission is granted powers as outlined in Section 4. The Commission may hold hearings, with a focus on open meetings for public testimony. A quorum of 7 members is needed, but a lesser number can conduct hearings. Approval of at least 9 members is required for legislation. Members can take actions authorized by the Commission. SEC. 5. ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS. Members of the Commission will be paid at a rate equivalent to level IV of the Executive Schedule and receive travel expenses as per regulations. The Commission will appoint a staff director who will also be paid at the same rate. The Commission's staff director can appoint additional personnel without following typical government hiring rules and can set their pay without restrictions. The appointed individuals cannot earn more than the maximum pay for a GS-15 grade. The Commission can also hire experts and consultants as needed. The Commission can hire experts and consultants on a temporary basis through contracts under section 3109 of title 5, United States Code. SEC. 6. REPORT AND RECOMMENDED LEGISLATION. The Commission must submit a report to the President and Congress by a specified date, including recommendations for changes in election laws and a draft legislation to implement those recommendations. The Commission will consider primary goals when making recommendations and preparing legislation, including encouraging fair and open Federal elections, eliminating special interest financing influence, and creating a more equitable electoral system for candidates. SEC. 7. EXPEDITED CONGRESSIONAL CONSIDERATION OF LEGISLATION. Each bill submitted under section 6(b) must be introduced in the House of Representatives and the Senate within 3 days. It will receive expedited consideration similar to a joint resolution under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990. Special rules apply for these provisions, excluding certain sections and references. Any reference to the resolution in subsection (a) is now a reference to the bill submitted under section 6(b) of this Act. References to specific committees in the House of Representatives and Senate have been updated. The date of the President's report is now the date of the Commission's recommendation submission under section 6(b). Despite certain Act provisions, debate on the bill in the House of Representatives is allowed. Debate on the bill in the House of Representatives and Senate, as well as on all debatable motions and appeals, is limited to 10 hours divided equally between those in favor and those opposing the bill. In the Senate, debate on any single debatable motion is limited to 1 hour divided equally between the proponent and the bill's manager. The bill allows the Minority Leader or their designee to control the time in opposition to a motion or appeal if the bill's manager is in favor. The Majority and Minority Leader can also allocate additional time to any Senator during the consideration of debatable motions or appeals. The Commission will terminate 90 days after submitting its report. Appropriations are authorized for the Commission's duties under this Act."
