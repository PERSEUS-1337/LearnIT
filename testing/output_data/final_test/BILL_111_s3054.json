    "content": "EFFICIENCY STANDARDS FOR BOTTLE-TYPE WATER DISPENSERS, COMMERCIAL HOT FOOD HOLDING CABINETS, AND PORTABLE ELECTRIC SPAS. Definitions for bottle-type water dispenser and commercial hot food holding cabinet are added to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Bottle-type water dispenser refers to a dispenser for hot and cold water using a removable bottle. Commercial hot food holding cabinet is a heated compartment with doors designed to maintain the temperature of cooked food. The term 'commercial hot food holding cabinet' refers to a heated compartment with doors and a volume of 8 cubic feet or more. Exclusions include heated glass merchandising cabinets, drawer warmers, and cook-and-hold appliances. On the other hand, a 'compartment bottle-type water dispenser' is a dispenser for hot and cold water that uses a removable bottle as the water source and includes a refrigerated compartment. A portable electric spa is a factory-built hot tub for heated water immersion, not meant to be drained after each use. It includes a filter, heater, pump, and control. A portable electric spa includes a pump, control, and other equipment like a light, blower, and water sanitizing equipment. Exclusions are spas that are permanently installed or designed for medical treatment. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to include coverage for bottle-type water dispensers, commercial hot food holding cabinets, and portable electric spas. Test procedures for bottle-type water dispensers are based on Energy Star Program Requirements. Program Requirements for Bottled Water Coolers version 1.1 published by the Environmental Protection Agency include specifications for integral, automatic timers and commercial hot food holding cabinets. Test procedures for hot food holding cabinets are based on ANSI/ASTM F2140-01 standards, with interior volume determined according to Energy Star Program Requirements. Test procedures for portable electric spas are based on the California Code of Regulations, with consumption normalized for a water temperature difference of 37 degrees Fahrenheit. If the American National Standards Institute publishes a test procedure, the Secretary will revise the established procedure accordingly. Effective January 1, 2012, new standards are set for bottle-type water dispensers and commercial hot food holding cabinets to limit standby energy consumption. Bottle-type water dispensers should not exceed 1.2 kilowatt-hours per day, while compartment bottle-type water dispensers should not exceed 1.3 kilowatt-hours per day. Effective January 1, 2012, new standards were set for commercial hot food holding cabinets and portable electric spas. The hot food holding cabinet should have a maximum idle energy rate of 40 watts per cubic foot, while the portable electric spa should not exceed a normalized standby power rate of 5 Watts per gallon. The Secretary is required to consider revisions to these standards by January 1, 2013. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to include new efficiency standards for various appliances, effective January 1, 2016. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act was amended to include new efficiency standards for appliances, effective January 1, 2016. Subsection (c) was further modified to include additional regulations, such as redesignating clauses and adding a new paragraph (10). The Energy Policy and Conservation Act was amended to include new efficiency standards for appliances, effective January 1, 2016. Subsection (c) was further modified to include additional regulations, such as establishing efficiency standards for various appliances adopted by the California Energy Commission before January 1, 2013."
