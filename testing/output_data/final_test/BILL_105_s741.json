    "content": "The \"Private Wireless Spectrum Availability Act\" is the short title of this legislation. Definitions are provided in Section 2. The \"Private Wireless Spectrum Availability Act\" defines key terms such as Commission, public safety, and private wireless. The Commission refers to the Federal Communications Commission. Public safety includes fire, police, emergency medical services, and other related services. Private wireless covers land mobile telecommunications systems used internally by organizations. The \"Private Wireless Spectrum Availability Act\" defines key terms such as Commission, public safety, and private wireless. Commercial Mobile Radio Services (CMRS) systems involve spectrum lease fees for the use of electromagnetic spectrum in a specific area. The Congress acknowledges the importance of private wireless communications systems in enhancing American industry competitiveness and promoting national infrastructure development. They recognize the need for alternative license administration methods to serve specialized telecommunications requirements and allocate additional electromagnetic spectrum. SEC. 4. SPECTRUM LEASING FEES. Title I of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include a Spectrum Lease Fee Program. Within 6 months of the Private Wireless Spectrum Availability Act's enactment, the Commission will establish spectrum lease fees for new frequency bands in private wireless service, encouraging licensees to limit radio communications to necessary areas. The Commission will establish spectrum lease fees for new frequency bands in private wireless service, allowing certified advisory committees to assist in fee computation and collection. The fees will be based on a formula that considers technical factors and their relative weights. The fee system for spectrum lease fees in private wireless service will be based on the value of assigned frequencies to licensees, considering factors like bandwidth, coverage area, geographic location, and frequency sharing. The formula for fee calculation may be adjusted for accuracy and fairness, with a cap on the fees set by the Commission. The spectrum lease fees for private wireless service will be capped to ensure that revenues generated over a 10-year license term do not exceed those from comparable spectrum auctions. The Commission will assess these fees for all licensees in new frequency bands allocated for private wireless use after implementing the spectrum leasing fee system. The Spectrum Lease Fee Program will be initiated according to Section 5. The Commission will allocate at least 12 megahertz of electromagnetic spectrum for the spectrum lease fee program, ensuring existing incumbents do not hinder access. This allocation must be done within 6 months of the enactment of the Act. To ensure timely access to allocated electromagnetic spectrum, action must be taken to begin access within 12 months of the Act's enactment. SEC. 6. DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY. Section 5 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to allow the Commission to delegate tasks to certified private land mobile frequency advisory committees for handling spectrum lease fees. The committees will assist in the computation, assessment, collection, and processing of funds generated through the spectrum lease fee program. The decision or order made by these committees will have the same force and effect as those of the Commission. The Commission can delegate tasks to private committees for handling spectrum lease fees, with decisions subject to review in the same manner as other Commission orders. PROHIBITION OF USE OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to preclude the Commission from considering public interest benefits of private wireless communications systems and making allocations in circumstances where predefined geographic market areas for competitive bidding processes are incompatible with radio services needs for site-specific system deployment. The Commission restricts nongovernment access to Federal spectrum to non subscriber-based radio systems due to unique operating characteristics and requirements. Licensee concerns for safety, security, and productivity are prioritized, with no intention to generate subscriber-based revenue on assigned frequencies. Competitive bidding processes may be used at the Commission's discretion. The Commission deems competitive bidding processes incompatible with public interest, convenience, and necessity. SEC. 8. USE OF PROCEEDS FROM SPECTRUM LEASE FEES. An account is established for spectrum license fees generated under the Communications Act of 1934. Proceeds from fees are deposited in the Treasury, with a portion retained for administrative expenses by a certified committee. SEC. 9. LEASING NOT TO AFFECT COMMISSION'S DUTY TO ALLOCATE. SEC. 9. LEASING NOT TO AFFECT COMMISSION'S DUTY TO ALLOCATE. Spectrum lease fees are not a replacement for spectrum allocation procedures. The Commission will continue to allocate spectrum based on service needs, not using fees or auctions for allocation."
