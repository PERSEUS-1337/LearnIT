Census data is crucial for estimating current and future population size, and is widely used by businesses, organizations, researchers, and government entities. Congress delegates the census responsibility to the Secretary of Commerce. The U.S. Constitution mandates a population census every 10 years for apportioning House of Representatives seats, redistricting, and distributing federal funds. The responsibility for conducting the census is delegated to the Secretary of Commerce and the Bureau of the Census. The Census Bureau's task is to count each person in the United States accurately and only once at their usual residence. Nonresponse to the census can result in a fine of up to $5,000. The resources allocated to the decennial census aim to accurately count all U.S. residents, regardless of their characteristics. Inadequate census data can lead to unfair political representation and distribution of federal funds. Balancing the need for accurate results with controlling costs is a key challenge for the Census Bureau. The Census Bureau's response for the 24th decennial census in 2020 includes cost containment, technology, and funding considerations. The report will compare coverage estimates from previous censuses and highlight sociodemographic factors that may complicate the count. Table 1 outlines key 2020 census activities and legal deadlines. The 2020 questionnaire will focus on basic demographic, household, and housing data, with long-form data now collected through the American Community Survey. The American Community Survey (ACS) now gathers data previously collected by the decennial census, with a focus on cost containment and sociodemographic factors affecting census costs. The 2010 census was the most expensive in U.S. history, costing $13 billion, a 50% increase from the 2000 census. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports have consistently highlighted the rising costs of the census since the mid-20th century. The rising costs of the census have been a concern since the mid-20th century. Congress has repeatedly directed the Census Bureau to control spending, focusing on cost-effective designs for accurate results. In FY1993, legislation emphasized the need for a more cost-effective census design for 2000, while in FY1995, the Senate Committee on Appropriations strongly recommended cost considerations in funding CJS entities. In FY1995, the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended cost-effective methods for the Census Bureau due to budget constraints. The committee expressed concerns about the bureau's inability to recognize budget realities and urged early planning to control costs for the Year 2000 Census. The FY2012 CJS appropriations legislation directed the bureau to learn from the 2010 census for future cost control measures. The committee directed the Census Bureau to learn from the 2010 census to create more cost-effective operations for the 2020 decennial census. They emphasized the need to increase response rates while containing costs and not exceed the $13 billion spent on the 2010 census. The Census Bureau is seeking to control costs while maintaining census quality. The Census Bureau aims to reduce costs for the 2020 census while maintaining quality. The rising cost of previous censuses is unsustainable, with projections showing a similar rate of increase without design changes. Director John H. Thompson emphasized the goal of lowering costs per housing unit compared to the 2010 census. The Census Bureau faces a cost problem due to the outdated paper-based process used since the 1970 Census. The goal is to achieve complete and accurate population coverage for the 2020 census, but the current approach is unsustainable for future censuses. The Census Bureau faces challenges in accurately counting the diverse and complex U.S. population in 2020, including difficulties with enumeration due to various factors such as multiple families, low-income individuals, and international migrants. Recurrent undercounts of racial and ethnic minorities are a concern, while overcounts can occur when multiple census forms are submitted from the same households. The current paper-based process used since 1970 is unsustainable for future censuses. The 2010 Census faced challenges with multiple census forms from the same households leading to duplications. The census showed a historic tendency of overcounting non-Hispanic whites and undercounting racial minorities and Hispanics. The net percentage overcount for the total population was 0.01%, compared to 0.49% in the 2000 census. The 2010 Census revealed overcounting of non-Hispanic whites and undercounting of racial minorities and Hispanics. The net percentage overcount for the total population was 0.01%, with specific percentages for different racial groups and ethnicities compared to the 2000 census. The 2010 Census showed overcounting of non-Hispanic whites and undercounting of racial minorities and Hispanics. American Indians on reservations had a significant difference in census coverage from 2000 to 2010. The Census Bureau faces challenges in obtaining an accurate count of the growing population and households in the US. In 2015, smaller proportions of the population included whites (77.1%), the native-born (86.5%), and married-couple families (48.0%) compared to 1970. Public trust in the federal government has significantly declined since 1970, with only 19.0% trusting it in 2015. This erosion of trust is concerning for the Census Bureau, which relies on public cooperation for the decennial census. The Census Bureau is focusing on cost-control innovations for the next enumeration, aiming to save $5.2 billion compared to repeating the 2010 design in the 2020 Census. Before conducting the census, they must verify and update census addresses and maps through an address canvassing operation to ensure accuracy. The Census Bureau is using innovative methods to update the address and geospatial location of housing units in the United States for the 2020 Census. This includes in-office canvassing and data from various sources to continually update the address list. Fieldwork is also being conducted to verify address information. The In-Field Address Canvassing for the 2020 Census will cover approximately 25 percent of all addresses, a significant reduction from previous censuses. The bureau aims to reduce reliance on nonresponse follow-up by maximizing public cooperation with the initial census phase. The bureau's strategy for the 2020 census includes maximizing public cooperation through outreach campaigns, offering multiple response options, and partnering with trusted organizations. Advertising on various platforms and hosting events at community organizations will be key components of the communication strategy. The 2020 census will also reduce reliance on standard mail operations. The 2020 census will offer an Internet response option to save money, modernize census-taking, and engage the public. Forms will be available online in multiple languages, with assistance provided by telephone and web chat. 47% of households in mailout areas are expected to respond online. Other options include paper forms and telephone responses. Addresses not responding will be followed up on. The census will use governmental administrative records to identify vacant housing units and reduce the workload for nonresponse follow-up. They plan to contact nonresponding households once and then use administrative records and third-party data to enumerate occupied housing units. Core administrative records will come from various agencies including the IRS, CMS, IHS, and SSA. The bureau continues to explore additional methods for enumeration. The bureau plans to rely on technology for managing 2020 census fieldwork efficiently. Field staff will perform duties remotely using handheld devices for administrative and data collection tasks, reducing the need for physical space and staff. The bureau plans to streamline fieldwork for the 2020 census by reducing the number of regional census centers and administrative support offices. They aim to use technology for data collection tasks, which will also lead to a decrease in the number of supervisors needed. The Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing (CEDCaP) initiative, started in 2014, will integrate systems for shared data collection and processing across all censuses and surveys, consolidating costs and IT expenditures. The bureau's plan is to streamline fieldwork for the 2020 census by reducing regional centers and using technology for data collection tasks. The 2013 census test explored using administrative records to reduce workload and contact nonrespondents. In 2014, strategies were tested to encourage prompt census responses and limit reliance on paper questionnaires. Mobile devices were tested for field staff, various means of contacting nonrespondents were explored, and different methods for managing assignments were tested. The 2014 test involved identifying addresses of housing units for the census, covering 200,000 units in DC and Maryland. Data collection occurred from June to September 2014, with an address validation test from September 2014 to January 2015. The test included a full-block canvass and geographic specialists finding unrecorded address changes. The bureau conducted a census test in 2015 using digital advertising to increase awareness and prompt responses. Tests were done in Savannah, Georgia, and Maricopa County, Arizona, to streamline nonresponse follow-up and explore new training methods for fieldworkers. The 2015 census test focused on new technology for assigning work efficiently, collecting data via smartphones, and using administrative records to fill data gaps. It covered 1.2 million households, including 20,000 in Puerto Rico, and tested alternative wording of census questions and strategies for prompting responses. The objective was to refine methods for obtaining prompt census responses. The 2016 census test aimed to improve methods for obtaining quick census responses, especially online, and conducting nonresponse follow-up. Efforts were made to engage hard-to-count population groups by offering questionnaire assistance in multiple languages. The test also assessed the use of administrative records and commercial information to reduce workload, technology for assigning cases to field staff, IT system integration and security, and processing responses without identification codes. Conducted in Harris County, Texas, and Los Angeles County, California from March to August 2016. The 2016 census test took place in Harris County, Texas, and Los Angeles County, California from March to August 2016. The test included about 225,000 housing units in each site, chosen for their representation of large metropolitan areas with demographic diversity and high housing vacancy rates. An address canvassing test was conducted in Buncombe County, North Carolina, and St. Louis, Missouri from August to December 2016 to refine methods for producing accurate address lists and spatial databases. The bureau examined the effectiveness of in-office and in-field canvassing methods, utilizing geographic information systems and aerial imagery to add addresses to MAF/TIGER. The 2017 census test is scheduled for April 1, 2017, covering about 80,000 housing units nationwide. It will focus on prompt responses, especially through web, with a Spanish-language option. The test will integrate operational control systems with census questionnaire assistance and assess cloud computing. Additional tests were planned for field operations in Puerto Rico, Standing Rock Indian Reservation, and Colville Indian Reservation. The bureau discontinued preparations for tests on trust land in Washington in October 2016 due to funding uncertainty. Instead, they will incorporate these operations into the 2018 \"end-to-end\" test for the 2020 census, focusing on key technologies and data collection methods. The test will cover more than 700,000 housing units in Pierce County, Washington, starting in August 2017. The Census Bureau will conduct an \"end-to-end\" test for the 2020 Census, covering over 700,000 housing units in Pierce County, Washington; Providence County, Rhode Island; and nine West Virginia counties. The test will include diverse populations with varying sociodemographic characteristics and levels of internet access. Lessons learned will be used to finalize plans and ensure readiness for the 2020 Census. The bureau heavily relies on contractors for various census functions. The Census Bureau relies on contractors for various functions supporting the 2020 census, including communication, IT operations, and questionnaire assistance. Contracts were awarded to General Dynamics Information Technology and Young & Rubicam for these purposes. The Census Bureau awarded contracts to Young & Rubicam for marketing and advertising for the 2000 census, and to T-Rex Corporation for infrastructure planning and design for the 2020 census. Another contract was awarded to CSRA Corporation for automating the recruitment and hiring of temporary fieldworkers. The Census Bureau plans to improve census operations by replacing manual processes with a new system. They will lease smartphones for address listing and enumeration, starting from the 2018 test through the 2020 census. The bureau is requesting larger appropriations from Congress for census operations, especially in information technology, as the 2020 census approaches. This could lead to increased scrutiny of their investments. The Census Bureau is facing scrutiny over their IT systems for the upcoming 2020 census. Concerns have been raised about IT security, testing of nonresponse follow-up operations, and funding for census preparations. The bureau is relying on about 50 IT systems, including 11 CEDCaP enterprise systems. GAO questioned the bureau's readiness for the 2018 end-to-end census test, as only 3 of the 50 systems were ready by October 2016. The Census Bureau faced challenges with IT system delivery for the 2020 census. By October 2016, only 3 out of 50 systems were delivered, with the rest in various stages of development. Concerns were raised about infrastructure identification, contractor management, and system integration. GAO questioned the bureau's readiness for the 2020 census, highlighting uncertainties in IT platform development and field office infrastructure. The 2020 census will be the first time the bureau relies on \"contractor support\" for technical integration and collects data nationwide online. Past efforts to implement new systems have not always gone as planned, with the 2010 census experiencing problems when trying to use handheld mobile devices for field data collection. This led to cost overruns, schedule slippages, and a $3 billion increase in costs due to reverting to paper-based processing. The 2010 Census faced challenges that increased costs by $3 billion and raised the risk of not completing it on time. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) designated the 2010 Census as high-risk in March 2008 due to IT management issues. In 2015, GAO highlighted the need to improve IT acquisitions and operations, naming CEDCaP as one of nine programs needing attention. The 2020 Census was added to the high-risk list in February 2017 due to complex innovations, IT system management issues, and cost estimation control. Technology plays a crucial role in the 2020 Census, emphasizing web responses and the need for information security. The GAO identified key areas for information security in the 2020 Census, including access control for personal data, protection of mobile devices, cybersecurity threats, expertise in IT security, cloud security requirements, and contingency plans for IT systems. The bureau aims to test its ability to secure IT systems and respond to breaches, although many systems are not yet in place. The GAO reported on the evaluation of nonresponse follow-up operations in the bureau's 2016 census test sites, noting that a significant percentage of cases in Harris County and Los Angeles County were coded as \"non-interviews\" due to various issues like language barriers or dangerous situations. The GAO reported that language barriers and dangerous situations hindered the bureau from completing visits. Bureau officials were unsure about the high number of non-interviews and were investigating potential causes, such as enumerators' inconsistent adherence to procedures for proxy interviews. Proxy data was highlighted as crucial for the success of the census, and the bureau pledged to refine procedures for collecting proxy data in 2020. The 2016 test also revealed inflexibility in the automated case management system for fieldwork. The GAO identified issues with the automated case management system for fieldwork and inadequate training for enumerators. Enumerators faced difficulties accessing closed cases and were not always informed about returning at specific times for better interview chances. Concerns were raised about the decision not to conduct 2017 tests in certain areas for budgetary reasons. The GAO expressed concerns about the Census Bureau's plans to incorporate test sites into the 2018 test for the 2020 census, putting pressure on the 2018 test to demonstrate functionality. The Census Bureau's uncertainty about FY2017 appropriations halted some planned tests, highlighting ongoing funding challenges for the 2020 census. Bureau appropriations for the census have been consistently lower than requested from FY2013 through FY2016. The Census Bureau's appropriations for the 2020 census have consistently been lower than requested from FY2013 through FY2016, with enacted amounts below the budget requests. In FY2017, the bureau received funding at the FY2016 level with a slight reduction until December 2016. H.R. 2028, P.L. 114-254, enacted on December 10, 2016, funds the Census Bureau at the FY2016 level with a slight reduction through April 28, 2017. The bureau can use funds from the Periodic Censuses and Programs account to maintain the 2020 census schedule. The director emphasized the need for timely appropriation to stay on track for the 2018 census test, but funding for the rest of FY2017 is uncertain."
