    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Emergency Contraception Access and Education Act of 2014\". Congress finds that a significant number of pregnancies in the US are unintended, with a high percentage ending in abortion. The FDA has approved emergency contraception as safe and effective, with research showing it can reduce the risk of pregnancy by up to 95%. Emergency contraception can be effective up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse. Emergency contraception is a responsible way to prevent pregnancy after unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure. It works by suppressing ovulation and does not terminate an established pregnancy. Most brands contain the same hormones as other birth control methods. The percentage of sexually experienced women using emergency contraception has increased in recent years. The rate of teen pregnancy in the United States has reached a historic low, declining 51 percent since 1990. Research suggests that increasing rates of contraceptive use may be associated with this decline. However, significant disparities exist for young, urban, minority women who lack knowledge about emergency contraception, with 1 in 4 teens unaware of its use. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends discussing emergency contraception with women of reproductive age. Emergency contraception is not consistently offered to all women in need by obstetricians/gynecologists, highlighting the need for increased awareness and education. Approximately 1 out of 5 American women are victims of rape, with an estimated 25,000 to 32,000 becoming pregnant each year as a result. Proper use of emergency contraception could help many rape survivors avoid the trauma of unintended pregnancy. Only 18 States and the District of Columbia require hospital emergency rooms to provide emergency contraception services to sexual assault survivors, with 13 States and the District of Columbia mandating emergency contraception upon request. Some States have restrictions on emergency contraception, while others allow pharmacists to refuse dispensing. Various medical associations endorse wider availability of emergency contraceptives due to their safety and efficacy. Healthy People 2020 aims to increase the availability of emergency contraception by publicly funded healthcare providers and reduce unintended pregnancies by 10%. Public awareness campaigns are crucial in removing barriers to emergency contraception for women in the United States. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
