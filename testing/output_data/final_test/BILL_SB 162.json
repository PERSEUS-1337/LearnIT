    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 25150.7 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to address the unique circumstances of treated wood waste. Treated wood is defined as wood treated with a chemical preservative registered under federal law to protect against decay. This section does not set a precedent for managing other hazardous wastes. The amended section 25150.7 of the Health and Safety Code pertains to the wood preserving industry and the regulation of treated wood waste that is considered hazardous due to preservatives. This section specifically applies to treated wood waste not regulated under federal law and not covered by section 25143.1.5. Treated wood waste must be disposed of in a hazardous waste landfill or a composite-lined portion of a solid waste landfill meeting specific requirements. Landfills accepting treated wood waste must prevent scavenging. To prevent scavenging, manage treated wood waste properly before disposal in a solid waste landfill. If a landfill shows a release from treated wood waste, corrective action must be taken before further disposal. Each wholesaler and retailer of treated wood and treated wood-like products in this state must display information provided by the wood preserving industry regarding the use of these products for various outdoor purposes. Warning\u2014Potential Danger\n\nTreated wood products contain hazardous chemicals and should be handled with care. Precautions include wearing gloves and long sleeves, avoiding skin contact, and washing exposed areas thoroughly after working with treated wood. Check product labels for specific preservative information and Proposition 65 warnings. When machining wood, wear a dust mask to reduce inhalation of wood dusts and eye protection to prevent eye injuries. Launder clothes if preservative or sawdust accumulates on them. Clean up sawdust and scraps promptly and dispose of them properly. Do not use treated wood where the preservative may come into contact with food or animal feed. Only use visibly clean treated wood for patios, decks, or walkways. Do not use treated wood for mulch or burning. Avoid direct or indirect contact with public drinking water.

The wood preserving industry must provide information on handling treated wood waste to various stakeholders by July 1, 2005, through different communication methods such as toll-free numbers, websites, labeling, and mailing. Manufacturers and suppliers must include this information with each shipment of treated wood products. The Contractors\u2019 State License Board provides listings and license application packages for decking, landscaping contractors by mail. The department may offer guidance to the wood preserving industry as resources allow. The department, in consultation with relevant agencies, shall adopt regulations for managing treated wood waste by January 1, 2007, ensuring health and environmental standards are met. Treated wood waste must be properly managed to prevent environmental releases, scavenging, and harmful exposure to people and animals. It should not be reused unless for approved purposes and must comply with all laws. Size reduction should be done safely to prevent hazardous releases. All sawdust and particles from size reduction must be managed as treated wood waste. Employees handling treated wood waste must be trained in safe and legal management practices. Those managing treated wood waste must comply with regulations or the requirements of this chapter. On January 1, 2005, variances granted by the department for managing treated wood waste before that date are no longer valid. Compliance with alternative standards specified in regulations exempts individuals from certain requirements of this chapter. The department retains the authority to establish regulations under other laws. The department must provide a comprehensive report on compliance with handling treated wood waste by January 1, 2018. This report will include data on compliance rates and injuries associated with treated wood waste, based on inspections of generator sites and disposal facilities. Inspections will cover at least 25% of each type of site. The department will survey how households handle treated wood waste, evaluate protective measures, track unauthorized disposal, and draw conclusions on handling practices. The curr_chunk discusses conclusions and recommendations for handling treated wood waste, with specific dates for when certain requirements become inoperative and repealed. The curr_chunk states that no reimbursement is required by this act as it creates new crimes or infractions, eliminates existing ones, or changes penalties, within the meaning of specific government codes and the California Constitution."
