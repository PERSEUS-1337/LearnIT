    "content": "The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P.L. 112-10) was enacted into law on April 15, 2011, providing $48.6 billion for VHA, a 7.8% increase over FY2010. Additionally, $50.6 billion was allocated for medical services, medical support, and compliance in FY2012. The report outlines the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), VA health care system, eligibility, and veteran patient population. It also covers the VHA budget, funding, FY2010 and FY2011 budget summaries, and congressional interests. The history of VA dates back to 1930, with the creation of the Veterans Administration and later the Department of Veterans Affairs in 1989. The VA offers various benefits. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) replaced the Veterans Administration in 1989. The VA provides benefits such as hospital care, disability compensation, education assistance, and home loan guarantees. It operates through three administrations and the Board of Veterans Appeals. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) manages health care services, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) provides compensations and pensions, and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) maintains veterans cemeteries. The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) maintains national veterans cemeteries, provides grants for state veterans cemeteries, and supplies headstones for eligible persons. The VA is transforming into a 21st-century organization with goals like reducing disability claims backlog and improving mental health care. Mandatory funding supports disability compensation, education, and life insurance. In FY2010, the VA budget authority was $110 billion, with 48.3% ($53.0 billion) allocated to discretionary programs, mainly for VA health care programs including medical research. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) operates the largest integrated health care system for veterans. The VA health care system is a veteran-specific national system with 21 geographically defined Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs). VHA operates 153 hospitals, 135 nursing homes, 783 community-based outpatient clinics, 6 independent outpatient clinics, and 299 Readjustment Counseling Centers. In 2009, VA started a Mobile Vet Center program to enhance service access. In 2009, VA initiated a pilot Mobile Vet Center program to improve service access for veterans in rural areas. The department has deployed 50 MVCs and operates 10 mobile outpatient clinics. Medical care funds are allocated to VISNs based on the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) system, which distributes funding based on patient workload. VERA includes General Purpose funds (80% of VHA budget) and Specific Purpose funds. 94% of congressional appropriations are allocated to the 21 VISNs within 45 days. The VERA system allocates congressional appropriations to VISNs, with 94% distributed within 45 days. General Purpose funds include 11 elements, such as basic care, research support, and mental health initiatives. Funding for mental health initiatives was incorporated into the overall mental health funding amount starting in FY2010. The VERA system allocates funds to VISNs through the General Purpose fund, which considers factors like patient mix and geographic costs. Specific Purpose funds are given to VISNs for activities like prosthetics and homeless grant programs. The VHA program offices, like the foreign medical program, reimburse certain medical expenses for veterans traveling abroad. Fee basis care pays non-VA providers for services not available at VA facilities or in emergencies. Inpatient and outpatient care is also provided to eligible dependents under CHAMPVA. VHA grants aid in constructing state-owned nursing homes and collaborates with DOD for health care resources. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) supports veterans with healthcare services, conducts medical research, serves as a backup to the Department of Defense during emergencies, and trains healthcare professionals. VA healthcare is not an entitlement program, and eligibility is based on enrollment priority groups. Not every veteran is automatically entitled to medical care from VHA. Prior to eligibility reform in 1996, provisions of law governing eligibility for VA care were complex. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 established two eligibility categories and required the VHA to manage care through an enrollment system based on priorities. VA provides hospital care and medical services to veterans with service-connected disabilities, former prisoners of war, and those exposed to toxic substances. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 established two eligibility categories for VA care: \"core\" veterans with lower income and net worth, and veterans with no service-connected disabilities and higher income. The Act also authorized the VA to establish a patient enrollment system to manage access to VA health care, giving relative degrees of preference to enrolled veterans based on specified priorities. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 established two eligibility categories for VA care, with the Act authorizing the VA to establish a patient enrollment system to manage access to VA health care. P.L. 104-262 clarified that health care provision for veterans depended on available resources and discretionary appropriations, with a national enrollment system created to manage medical care delivery based on medical judgment rather than legal criteria. Entry into the veterans' health care system begins with completing the Application for Health Benefits. Veterans can apply for enrollment at any time by submitting VA Form 10-10EZ online, in person, or by mail/fax. Once enrolled, veterans do not need to reapply annually, except for those in Priority Group 5 who must submit updated financial information yearly. Veterans' eligibility for VA health care is based on their \"veteran's status\" from military service, requiring active-duty status and an honorable discharge. Those with \"other than honorable\" discharges may still be eligible for benefits. Certain service requirements apply for eligibility, but servicemembers discharged due to service-connected disabilities are exempt. Reservists are also eligible under specific conditions. Members of the reserve components and National Guard may be exempt from certain service requirements for VA health care eligibility if they were called to active duty and completed their term with an other than dishonorable discharge. They can also receive service connection for injuries incurred during duty. Members of the reserve components and National Guard may be exempt from certain service requirements for VA health care eligibility if they were called to active duty and completed their term with an other than dishonorable discharge. They can also receive service connection for injuries incurred during duty, including heart attacks or strokes. National Guard members are not granted service connection for injuries during duty ordered by a governor for state emergencies. Veterans with service-connected disabilities or low incomes are enrolled in Priority Groups 1-6 for VA care. Veterans enrolled in Priority Groups 1-6 for VA care include those with service-connected disabilities, compensable conditions, POWs, Purple Heart recipients, catastrophically disabled, exposed to hazardous agents, and with low income/net worth. VA assesses income/net worth to determine priority category and copayment requirements for nonservice-connected care. The VA may bill health insurance for treatment not related to military service. Veterans in Priority Groups 7 or 8 have nonservice-connected conditions and higher incomes. NDAA FY2008 extended VA health care enrollment for combat veterans. Combat veterans who served in a theater of combat operations after November 11, 1998, are eligible for extended enrollment periods of up to five years. New servicemembers discharged on or after January 28, 2003, can enroll for up to five years after discharge. Veterans discharged between November 11, 1998, and January 27, 2003, can apply for enrollment until January 27, 2011. OEF, OIF, and OND veterans are typically assigned to Priority Group 6 and are not charged copays for combat-related conditions. Veterans enrolled in the VA health care system under extended enrollment authority will continue to be enrolled even after the five-year eligibility period ends. They may be re-enrolled in a different priority group based on their service-connected disability status and income level. National Guard and Reserve personnel called to active duty after November 11, 1998, are also eligible. Once enrolled, veterans receive a standard medical benefits package including inpatient, outpatient, and preventive medical services. The VA health care system provides a range of services including medical, surgical, and mental health care, prescription drugs, durable medical equipment, home health services, and periodic medical exams. Dental benefits have specific eligibility guidelines separate from medical care. Services not included are abortions, in vitro fertilization, and unapproved drugs or devices. The VA health care system covers a variety of services including medical, surgical, mental health care, prescription drugs, durable medical equipment, and home health services. Veterans enrolled in the system do not pay premiums but may have to pay copayments for certain services. Copayments are not charged for veterans in Priority Group 1, even for treatment of nonservice-connected conditions. Veterans in other priority groups may be charged copayments for outpatient, inpatient, extended care services, and medication. However, copayments are not charged for certain outpatient services such as health fairs, screenings, counseling, and laboratory services. Primary care outpatient visits have a $15 copayment, while specialty care outpatient visits have a $50 copayment. Veterans do not receive more than one outpatient copayment per day. Veterans in Priority Groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 do not have to pay inpatient or outpatient copayments. Priority Group 6 veterans may be exempt based on special eligibility. Copayments for extended care services are based on three levels of care. Medication copayments are waived for veterans with a 50% service-connected disability. Veterans with certain eligibility exceptions are not billed for copayments. Priority Groups 2-6 have a $960 yearly cap on copayment charges. Assistance options are available for veterans unable to pay copayments. VA bills private insurers for nonservice-connected care. Medicare supplemental insurance can be billed for covered services. VA offsets any payments received against a veteran's copayment responsibility. In FY2010, approximately 8.4 million of the 23.1 million living veterans in the nation were enrolled in the VA health care system, with a 7.7% increase in enrollees from FY2007 to FY2010. Priority care is provided for non-emergency outpatient medical services for service-connected veterans rated 50% or more. Emergency or urgent care takes precedence over service-connection priority. In FY2010, VA saw a 7.7% increase in enrollees, treating approximately 5.5 million unique veteran patients. For FY2011, VHA estimates treating about 5.6 million unique veteran patients, including over 439,000 OEF and OIF veterans. The total number of patients treated by VA has grown by 10% between FY2007 and FY2010. The number of patients treated by VA has grown by 10% between FY2007 and FY2010, with outpatient visits projected to increase to approximately 78.5 million in FY2010 and 82.7 million in FY2011. VHA estimates spending 57.8% of its medical services account obligations on outpatient care in FY2010. The budget size and character of VHA historically depended on the number of operating beds controlled by Congress, with workload estimates developed system-wide and unit costs derived from field stations' reports. New program costs were estimated by VA central office and added to the budget estimate. The VA central office estimated new program costs and added them to the budget estimate. In 1996, Congress enacted the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act of 1997, requiring VHA to develop a plan for fair allocation of health care resources. The VHA established the Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (EHCPM) in response to Congressional mandates for cost-efficient health care. This model develops estimates of future veteran enrollment, expected health care utilization, and associated costs, which are used to formulate the VHA budget request to Congress. The VHA uses the Enrollee Health Care Projection Model to estimate future veteran enrollment and healthcare costs for budget requests to Congress. The VHA is funded through various appropriations accounts, including medical care, research, administration, and construction of medical facilities. Congress changed the VHA's appropriations structure in FY2004 for better oversight and accurate accounting of funds. The Agencies Appropriations Act, 2004 funded VHA through four accounts: medical services, medical administration (now medical support and compliance), medical facilities, and medical and prosthetic research. The medical services account covers inpatient and outpatient care for veterans, including care in non-VA facilities and aid to state veterans homes. In FY2008, the VA requested transferring food service costs from medical facilities to medical services appropriations, which was approved by Congress. The medical support and compliance account provides funds for various expenses related to VA hospitals, nursing homes, public health programs, research, and training. VA researchers investigate veteran-centric health topics with funding from various sources including the Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health. The VA's research program is mainly intramural, conducted by VA investigators at VA facilities. The VHA has the authority to bill some veterans and health care insurers for nonservice-connected care to help cover costs. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) allowed the VA to retain third-party payments for medical services in the Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF) instead of depositing them in the U.S. Treasury. This change also authorized the VA to bill insurers based on \"reasonable charges\" to increase collections for veterans' care. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 and 2005 allowed the VA to deposit collections from various accounts into the MCCF for medical services for veterans. This provided permanent authority for funds to be used for veterans' care. The MCCF collections for medical services for veterans increased from $1.5 billion in FY2003 to $2.8 billion in FY2009. First-party collections also increased by 30% during this period, reaching $892 million in FY2009. The President's FY2010 budget proposal requested $45.1 billion for VHA, a 7.5% increase over the previous year. The total available resources, including medical care collections, would have provided approximately $48 billion for VHA. The House and Senate passed versions of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2010 differed in funding amounts for VHA. The House bill allocated $45.1 billion, while the Senate amended it to $45.2 billion, exceeding the President's request. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, signed into law on December 16, 2009, included a compromise between the House and Senate versions, providing a total of $45.2 billion for VHA. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2010 allocated $45.1 billion for VHA, with an additional advance appropriation of $48.2 billion for FY2011. The Obama Administration's FY2011 budget request for VHA was $48.8 billion, including $590 million for medical and prosthetic research. The VHA funding level for FY2011 is estimated to be $52.1 billion, with $3.4 billion in medical collections. The President's budget requested $50.6 billion in advance appropriations for FY2012. The House passed a bill for FY2011 with $48.8 billion allocated. The House-passed bill for FY2011 (H.R. 5822) included $48.8 billion for VHA, the same as the President's request. For FY2012, H.R. 5822 provided $39.6 billion for medical services, $5.5 billion for medical support, and $5.4 billion for medical facilities. The bill recommended $590 million for medical research, with an increase for suicide prevention outreach. The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up its version of the MILCON-VA Appropriations bill for FY2011, recommending $120 million above the Administration's request. This included $100 million for medical services and $20 million for medical facilities. VHA would have received $48.9 billion under S. 3615. Funding levels for most VA accounts had not been enacted by Congress at the beginning of the fiscal year. The budget debate continued six months into the new fiscal year, but funding for VA medical services, support, and facilities had already been appropriated by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act provided $52.0 billion for VHA in FY2011, including $48.6 billion in new budget authority and $3.4 billion in medical care collections. Additionally, $50.6 billion in advance appropriations was provided for FY2012. The Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-163) was enacted in response to the need for comprehensive assistance for family caregivers of severely injured service members. This law provides support for veterans undergoing medical discharge with serious injuries incurred in the line of duty after September 11, 2001, who require personal care services. Funding has been included to implement caregiver provisions for eligible veterans who require personal care services. Since 2001, over 2.1 million U.S. troops have deployed in support of Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Iraqi Freedom (OIF), with around 1.1 million veterans becoming eligible for VA health care. Approximately 47.4% of separated OEF and OIF veterans have sought VA health care, with 10%-20% experiencing psychological difficulties that may require treatment. The House Committee on Veterans' Affairs acknowledges the VA's investments in mental health but highlights the ongoing challenges in addressing mental health issues among veterans. The committee emphasizes the need for expanding existing efforts and exploring new evidence-based initiatives to combat rising rates of suicide, incarceration, and homelessness. The VHA's budget for mental health care is projected to increase from $4.8 billion in FY2010 to $5.2 billion in FY2011. The VA's mental health budget is set to increase from $4.8 billion in FY2010 to $5.2 billion in FY2011. The VA has also added over 6,000 mental health providers from FY2008 to FY2010. Veterans in Priority Group 8 have faced enrollment restrictions since 2003, with advocates pushing for their inclusion in VA care. The Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 ensures care based on annual appropriations by Congress. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs announced a temporary suspension of enrolling Priority Group 8 veterans due to increased demand for medical services. Funding was provided in 2009 to support increased enrollment for Priority 8 veterans. VA received funding in 2009 to enroll more Priority Group 8 veterans, with an estimated 258,705 new enrollees planned. By the end of 2010, it is expected that 193,000 veterans will have enrolled. In 2011, VA will expand eligibility further for Priority Group 8 veterans, resulting in an estimated 99,000 more enrollees. In 2011, VA will expand eligibility for Priority Group 8 veterans, resulting in 99,000 more enrollees, bringing the total new enrollees from 2009 to 2011 to 292,000. President's budget estimates 550,000 Priority Group 8 veterans enrolled by FY2013. After the special eligibility period ends, veterans will be reassigned to the appropriate priority group and may be subject to copayments. Copayments apply to Priority Group 6 combat veteran enrollees for care related to pre-existing conditions or conditions with specific causes. Financial income thresholds for VA health care benefits and appropriations are detailed in various appendices."
