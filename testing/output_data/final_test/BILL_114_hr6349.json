    "content": "The \"None of the Above Act\" allows voters in general elections for Federal office to choose \"None of the Above\" as an option on the ballot. If \"None of the Above\" receives the most votes in an election, it will have an effect on the outcome. If \"None of the Above\" wins the most votes in a general election for a Senator or Representative, a special election will be held by the State. If the special election results are not certified before the start of the new Congress, a vacancy will be considered in the office. If \"None of the Above\" wins the most votes in a general election for a Senator or Representative, a special election will be held by the State. Section 26(b) of the Revised Statutes of the United States applies to special elections in the same manner as in extraordinary circumstances, with adjustments for the date of the general election. If \"None of the Above\" wins the most votes in a general election for a Senator or Representative, a special election will be held by the State. The determination of candidates for the special election will be made by the State to ensure it is held within the required deadline. The term \"State\" includes several entities such as States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and others. If \"None of the Above\" wins the most votes in the general election for President and Vice President, a special general election will be held in each State 35 days after the initial election date. Following their appointment, the time for counting of electoral votes by Congress is specified, including provisions for special general elections. The determination of candidates for special elections in a State is left to the State's discretion to ensure fairness. The State must hold a special election within the deadline set by law to ensure compliance. The term \"State\" refers to all states and the District of Columbia. The effective date of this section applies to general elections for Federal office starting from the first regularly scheduled general election after the enactment of this Act."
