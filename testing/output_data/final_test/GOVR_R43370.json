    "content": "The disability insurance portion of the OASDI program, enacted in 1956, provides benefits to disabled workers under the full retirement age based on career-average earnings. Monthly payment levels for SSDI are determined by a statutory formula. The law includes the one-for-five rule, allowing for a maximum of five \"disability dropout years\" for individuals with 25 or more years of earnings. Additionally, \"childcare dropout years\" are applied for years with zero earnings due to caring for an infant child, affecting a small percentage of SSDI beneficiaries. SSDI benefits are calculated based on a statutory formula and are meant to replace lost income from work due to disability. To be eligible, a worker must be disability insured and unable to engage in substantial gainful activity due to a medically determinable impairment. The program is financed through a payroll tax and considers factors like age, education, and work experience when determining eligibility. To be fully insured for SSDI benefits, a worker must have a minimum amount of work experience in employment covered by Social Security. Workers under 31 have special rules for disability insured status. A minimum of six quarters of coverage is required, with each quarter in 2014 requiring $1,200 in earnings. Workers under 31 need credit in half the quarters between age 21 and disability onset, and a recency of work test requires 20 quarters of coverage in the 40 quarters before disability onset. The Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program has specific requirements for workers to qualify for benefits. Workers must have 20 quarters of coverage in the 40 quarters before the onset of disability, with exceptions for those under 31 years old. Additionally, disabled workers must be unable to engage in substantial gainful activity (SGA) and the benefit payment is based on their average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). The Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) is used to calculate the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) for SSDI beneficiaries. AIME is determined by indexing earnings to national average wage growth, with adjustments made for years after the indexing year. The number of computation years used in AIME calculation is based on elapsed years minus any dropout years. The AIME calculation for SSDI benefits uses the individual's highest earnings years as computation years. SSA can remove up to five of a disabled worker's lowest-earning years when calculating the AIME, known as the one-for-five rule. This rule applies to workers with 25 or more years of earnings. The one-for-five rule allows for a maximum of five disability dropout years for a worker with 25 or more years of earnings. This provision reduces the impact of lower earnings on a disabled worker's benefit amount. Additionally, disabled workers may receive up to three dropout years, including childcare dropout years, based on caregiving responsibilities. The CDY provision allows for years to be credited under specific conditions for SSDI claimants with caregiving responsibilities. CDYs are offset by disability dropout years and can only be credited when the number of disability dropout years is less than three. Eligible individuals may be credited with one CDY at three elapsed years, two CDYs at four elapsed years, and a disability dropout year at five elapsed years. At five elapsed years, a disability dropout year may be credited for three total dropout years. CDYs phase out at 10 elapsed years, replaced with disability dropout years. A disabled worker's PIA is determined by applying a formula to the AIME, divided into brackets with bend points. Three replacement factors are applied to the brackets of AIME to calculate the PIA. The disabled worker's benefit is equal to the PIA. Between January 2000 and May 2013, 861,396 disabled workers aged 25 to 36 were awarded SSDI benefits. CDYs were applied to 1,336 recipients, with most receiving one CDY. The distribution of CDY credits skewed towards beneficiaries with lower earnings, with 84.5% having a PIA of less than $1,000."
