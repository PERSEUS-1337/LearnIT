This process is different from excluding a Member-elect for not meeting constitutional qualifications. Members of Congress can be expelled from office by a two-thirds vote of the Senate or House of Representatives, which is different from excluding a Member-elect for not meeting constitutional qualifications. Expulsion is a self-disciplinary action to protect the integrity of the institution, achieved by the House or Senate acting alone without the need for trial and conviction. Expulsion from the Senate or the House of Representatives is the most severe form of congressional self-discipline, typically for cases of disloyalty to the government or criminal offenses. In the Senate, 15 Senators have been expelled, mostly during the Civil War for disloyalty, while in the House, five Members have been expelled, including for disloyalty during the same period. Several Members of Congress have been expelled for various offenses, including conspiracy to commit bribery, receiving illegal gratuities, fraud, and obstruction of justice. While expulsions are rare, some Members have chosen to resign instead of facing expulsion. The authority of Congress to expel Members is extensive, but policy considerations have often restrained the Senate and the House from exercising this power. The Senate and House have shown restraint in expelling Members for past misconduct, especially if the electorate was aware of the conduct before electing or re-electing the Member. This reflects a deference to the popular will and election choice of the people. The Judiciary Committee detailed policy considerations in expulsions for past misconduct in 1914. The House's power to expel members is essential in extreme cases of corruption, but should be used with caution and only when misconduct was public knowledge before the member's election. This power should be exercised sparingly and with great circumspection. The House's power to expel members should be used cautiously, avoiding the abuse of its high prerogative and exceeding constitutional authority by imposing its standards on the electorate's choice. This authority should be exercised sparingly to prevent undermining representative government and usurping the electorate's judgment. The legislature can remove officials through expulsion or impeachment, while voters can do so through a recall election. Recall provisions for state or local officers gained popularity during the progressive movement in the early 20th century. The United States Constitution does not allow for the recall of federal officials like Senators, Representatives, or the President. The United States Constitution does not allow for the recall of federal officials like Senators, Representatives, or the President. The Constitution does not give a Member's constituency the authority to recall such a Member, as it has set out provisions, qualifications, and requirements for Members of Congress to prevent conflicts of interest and assure fealty to constituents. The United States Constitution does not permit the recall of federal officials like Senators or Representatives. Recall provisions were considered during the drafting of the Constitution but were ultimately rejected. There was debate over this lack of recall provision during the ratification process in the states. The United States Constitution does not allow for the recall of federal officials like Senators or Representatives. This was debated during the ratification process, with the understanding that no right or power to recall a Senator or Representative existed under the Constitution as ratified. The idea of placing a recall provision in the Constitution was considered but rejected during the ratification process. The framers and ratifiers sought to remedy the defects of the Articles of Confederation by moving away from excessive democracy. The United States government was designed as a distinct, sovereign entity unlike the former confederation. Members of Congress were no longer considered mere \"ambassadors\" from states but officers of the newly formed national government. The right to remove a Member of Congress before their term resides within each house of Congress, as delegated in the expulsion clause of the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court ruled in Burton v. United States that a provision of federal law cannot act as a forfeiture of a Senator's office, as the only way to remove a Member under the Constitution is by the Senate exercising its authority. The states do not have the authority to change the terms or qualifications for federal officers agreed upon in the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court confirmed in U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton that states cannot change the qualifications or terms of federal officials as outlined in the United States Constitution. States retain sovereign authority in many areas but delegated certain powers to the national government through the Constitution. The U.S. Term Limits case confirmed that states cannot change the qualifications or terms of federal officials outlined in the Constitution. Justice Thomas' dissent emphasized that once a Member of Congress is sworn in, a state cannot recall them or affect their term until the next election. Once representatives are elected to Congress, they become a national body beyond the control of individual states until the next election. The only way to remove a seated Member of Congress before their term ends is through the expulsion clause in Article I, Section 5. Justice Thomas clarified that even if a state disagrees with a Senator's actions, they cannot remove them from office before their term is up. The dissent argued that states cannot influence or threaten to reduce the salary of a Member of Congress as it would resemble a power of recall, which the Framers did not grant to the states. The Supreme Court has clarified that determining qualifications and terms for federal offices is not within the states' reserved authority under the Tenth Amendment. The Tenth Amendment does not grant states the authority to influence federal officers' qualifications or terms, as it is not a power reserved to the states. States cannot reserve powers they did not originally possess under their sovereignty. The Tenth Amendment does not grant states the authority to regulate federal officers' qualifications or terms, as they are federal officials created by the Constitution, not state officers. Members of Congress owe allegiance to the nation, not to individual states. The United States Constitution establishes exclusive qualifications for congressional office, sets specific term lengths for Members of the House and Senators, and delegates each house of Congress the authority to judge elections, qualifications, discipline, and removal of its own Members. This authority is not granted to states as Members of Congress are federal officials, not state officers. The United States Constitution grants Congress the authority to judge elections, qualifications, discipline, and removal of its Members, which supersedes state laws. State recall laws may not be effective in removing Members of Congress from office. State attorneys general and judicial bodies have consistently found state recall provisions to be invalid in altering the constitutionally established term of office for Members of Congress. State recall provisions have been consistently found to be invalid in removing Members of Congress from office as they interfere with Congress's exclusive authority over elections and qualifications. The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to judge and discipline its Members, making state recall laws ineffective in this regard. In 1978, an attorney general opinion in Nevada stated that only the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives can remove their members before the end of their terms. A similar ruling was made in 1994 by the attorney general of Kansas, stating that members of Congress are not subject to state recall provisions. The attorney general's opinion states that only Congress has the authority to punish and remove its members through expulsion, and that states cannot recall or remove members of Congress from office. This ruling is in line with previous opinions from other states' attorney generals. The attorney general found that the Constitution does not allow for the recall of United States officials, including Members of Congress, as this power is delegated to Congress. State laws on recall do not apply to federal officials. In 2010, North Dakota and Arkansas attorney generals also confirmed that congressional officers cannot be recalled. In 2010, the attorney general of Arkansas advised that a proposed recall amendment for Members of Congress is unconstitutional. In the 1970s, an attorney general declined to bar a state agency from accepting a recall petition for a Member of Congress. The attorney general of Wisconsin noted in 1979 that the state election board cannot reject a valid recall petition without a court ruling. Courts have ruled that state laws on recall do not apply to federal officials. Courts have consistently found that state recall laws cannot override the U.S. Constitution when it comes to federal officials like Members of Congress. For example, in 1967, a federal court dismissed a suit trying to recall Senator Frank Church of Idaho, stating that Senators are not subject to state recall statutes. Similarly, in 2007, a Michigan state court rejected a petition to recall a Member of Congress, despite the state law allowing it. The court granted an injunction against the recall effort, stating that Michigan's recall provisions are ineffective under the U.S. Constitution. In New Jersey, a court refused to rule on the constitutionality of the state's recall provision for a Senator due to lack of signatures. The supreme court of New Jersey later found that the Federal Constitution and historical materials supported their decision. The Federal Constitution does not allow for recall, making New Jersey's recall law and State Constitution unconstitutional. To enforce a recall provision against a Member of Congress, a constitutional amendment would be needed. There is little movement for a national recall provision, with supporters viewing it as a way to ensure oversight. Recall provisions are seen as a way to ensure oversight of elected officials and hold them continuously responsible to the electorate. Critics argue that recall petitions can be initiated by a small minority, potentially deterring officials from taking strong political stances. Critics argue that recall provisions may deter officials from supporting long-term plans and programs that do not bring immediate benefits to constituents."
