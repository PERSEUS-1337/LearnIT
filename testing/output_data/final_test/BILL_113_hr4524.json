    "content": "The \"Animal Emergency Planning Act of 2014\" emphasizes the need for disaster planning to protect animals and people. Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy have shown the importance of preparedness. Local responders and private individuals often bear the responsibility for animals during disasters. Commercial animal users should be ready to safeguard the animals in their care. SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT THAT COVERED ENTITIES DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT EMERGENCY CONTINGENCY PLANS under the Animal Welfare Act now includes SEC. 30. ANIMAL EMERGENCY PLANNING. SEC. 30. ANIMAL EMERGENCY PLANNING requires covered persons to develop and follow a contingency plan for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing, and care of animals in emergencies or disasters. The plan must identify potential situations triggering the need for action and outline specific tasks to be carried out in response. The contingency plan for animal emergency planning includes detailed instructions for evacuation, sheltering, and provisions for food, water, sanitation, ventilation, bedding, and veterinary care. It also establishes a chain of command, identifies responsible individuals, and addresses response and recovery procedures. Covered persons must review the plan annually and maintain documentation of any amendments or changes. Each covered person must train personnel in their roles, communicate changes in the contingency plan within 30 days, and document training completion. They must submit the contingency plan and related documentation annually to the Secretary. Covered persons traveling must carry a copy of the contingency plan for inspection. The Secretary of Agriculture must create regulations within 30 days to enforce the Animal Welfare Act. State laws providing equal or greater animal protection are not preempted by this Act. Effective Date: The amendments made by this Act shall apply to covered persons beginning 30 days after enactment."
