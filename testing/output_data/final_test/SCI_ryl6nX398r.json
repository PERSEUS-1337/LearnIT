    "content": "We propose a novel score-based approach to learning a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from observational data, utilizing neural networks to model complex interactions. This method outperforms current continuous methods on most tasks and is competitive with existing greedy search methods for causal inference. Causal inference has applications in genetics, biology, and economics. Bayesian networks encode conditional independencies using directed acyclic graphs and support interventional queries. Causal graphical models can help solve challenges in machine learning systems. Structure and causal learning are difficult tasks, but offer promises for improving machine intelligence. The problem of structure learning is like an inverse problem for the learner. In this work, a novel score-based method named GraN-DAG is proposed for structure learning, aiming to infer the causal structure from observations. The method utilizes a reformulation of the original combinatorial problem into a continuous constrained optimization problem. Unlike traditional methods, GraN-DAG moves towards a continuous paradigm, enabling the use of gradient-based optimization for directed acyclic graph learning. The novel method GraN-DAG extends previous work by incorporating neural networks to handle nonlinear relationships between variables. It outperforms other approaches in structure learning tasks, leveraging the continuous paradigm and utilizing gradient-based optimization algorithms. The GraN-DAG method incorporates neural networks to handle nonlinear relationships in structure learning tasks, outperforming other approaches. It utilizes an evidence lower bound score and provides empirical comparisons to existing methods. The method assumes a random vector X entailed by a DAG, where each node corresponds to a variable in the system. A CGM is a Bayesian Network with causal edges, allowing for interventional distribution queries. Graph identifiability from samples relies on assumptions, with results for continuous and discrete variables obtained by assuming specific parametric families for conditional pdfs. Graph identifiability from samples relies on assumptions about the nonlinearity of a function f i, with G being identifiable from P X. Structure learning involves learning G from a data set of n samples using score-based approaches, which optimize over the space of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Score-based methods typically use maximum likelihood estimation and greedy search procedures. An alternative approach by [18] encodes the graph G as a weighted adjacency matrix to tackle the optimization problem from a continuous perspective. The authors propose a constraint on the matrix U to ensure acyclicity in the directed graph associated with a linear structural equation model. They suggest using a regularized negative least square score for maximum likelihood estimation in a continuous constrained problem. This approach transforms the problem from combinatorial to continuous. The problem has shifted from combinatorial to non-convex optimization due to a non-convex feasible set. A standard numerical solver like augmented Lagrangian method can be used for an approximate solution. The authors propose a new nonlinear extension for neural DAG learning, where each variable is associated with a fully connected neural network with hidden layers. The authors propose a new nonlinear extension for neural DAG learning, where each variable is associated with a fully connected neural network with hidden layers. The idea is to constrain the parameters of the neural networks to ensure that the product of all conditionals outputted by the networks forms a valid joint probability distribution. This is achieved by defining a weighted adjacency matrix A \u03c6 to enforce acyclicity in the model. The term neural network path refers to a computation path in a NN, with the strength of the path determined by the product of weights. Inactive paths have at least one zero weight, and if all paths from input to output are inactive, the output does not depend on the input. The sum of all path products can be computed by taking the absolute value of the weight matrices. The neural network path products from input to output can be summed up to determine C kj. To ensure \u03b8 is independent of X j, the sum of C kj for all m k must equal 0. This constraint helps make the architecture acyclic by deactivating certain neural network inputs. A weighted adjacency matrix A \u03c6, based on the connectivity matrix C (i), is defined to enforce acyclicity. G \u03c6 represents the directed graph of parameter \u03c6, and an adapted acyclicity constraint is formulated to ensure acyclicity in the neural network model. We solve the maximum likelihood optimization problem using an augmented Lagrangian approach and RMSprop for subproblem optimization. GraN-DAG is compared to various baselines on synthetic data sets. In a comparison on synthetic data sets, GraN-DAG outperforms other continuous approaches and is competitive with the best performing discrete approach. The identifiable case is considered, with GraN-DAG making the correct gaussian assumption in its model. Real world data sets are also evaluated, with GraN-DAG found to be competitive with other approaches."
