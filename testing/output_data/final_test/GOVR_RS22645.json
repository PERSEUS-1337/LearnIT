    "content": "The European Union (EU) is a treaty-based framework for economic and political cooperation among 27 member states. It aims to promote peace and prosperity in Europe through integration, including common foreign policy and defense. The U.S. has supported the EU project to foster a stable Europe and strong trading partners. The United States supports EU efforts to expand benefits to central and eastern Europe, Turkey, and the western Balkan states. The economic relationship between the U.S. and EU is significant, with two-way flows exceeding $1.0 trillion annually. However, recent years have seen challenges in the relationship due to trade and foreign policy conflicts, including the 2003 crisis over Iraq. Since 2003, efforts have been made to improve U.S.-EU relations through annual summits, with some tensions remaining. The 2007 summit in Washington, DC, involved President Bush meeting with EU leaders to highlight areas of cooperation in foreign policy. The 2007 U.S.-EU summit in Washington, DC focused on political and security issues, economic integration, air transport agreement, energy security, and climate change. Chancellor Angela Merkel proposed enhancing transatlantic economic relations by reducing trade barriers and costs. Other key topics included the Doha Round, the Middle East, counterterrorism, and the U.S. visa waiver program. Since 1995, efforts have been made to reduce non-tariff and regulatory barriers to trade between the EU and the US. Despite some progress, companies on both sides feel the results have not been significant. The Merkel initiative proposes a new framework for greater commitment from political leaders and accountability from regulators. Business Europe supports this approach for enhancing transatlantic economic relations. The Merkel initiative aims to address regulatory barriers in the transatlantic marketplace, covering issues such as public procurement, intellectual property, energy, environment, financial markets, and security. The 2007 U.S.-EU Summit adopted a Framework for Advancing Transatlantic Economic Integration, establishing a Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) to reduce regulatory barriers to trade and investment. The Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) aims to reduce regulatory barriers by involving stakeholders, including legislators, in discussions and meetings. Despite efforts to harmonize regulations, differences in public values between the US and EU pose challenges. An aviation agreement, Open Skies Plus, was signed at a summit on April 30. An agreement between the US and EU was signed at the April 30 summit, after four years of negotiation. The Open Skies Plus accord will liberalize the transatlantic air services market, allowing unrestricted flights between any city in the EU and the US. It will also open competition at London's Heathrow Airport and enhance foreign direct investment opportunities in airlines. The agreement takes effect on March 30, 2008, with further negotiations planned for May 30, 2008. The European Commission predicts lower fares, increased passengers, and 80,000 new jobs over the next five years. The Open Skies Plus accord between the US and EU will expand passenger numbers and create 80,000 new jobs over the next five years. However, there is controversy as European carriers are not granted rights to fly between US cities and EU ownership of US airlines remains limited. The major US unions oppose the agreement, fearing job losses and reduced benefits. The WTO's Doha Development Round, aimed at liberalizing world trade, has been stalled since 2006 due to disagreements among the US, EU, and developing countries. At the 2007 summit, EU and U.S. leaders expressed a strong desire for a comprehensive trade agreement in agriculture, industrial goods, and services. Developing countries are more vocal in their expectations for trade talks. EU leaders prioritize curbing global climate change through renewable energy and biofuels targets. European officials are seeking U.S. support for an international treaty regulating greenhouse gas emissions and a market-based carbon emissions credit trading system post-2012. The U.S. advocates for transatlantic cooperation on clean energy technology. Initiatives promoting clean coal, carbon capture, energy efficiency, biofuels, and methane recovery were launched at the April 2007 summit. European officials are disappointed by perceived U.S. reluctance to pursue binding international emissions targets and a global carbon trading system. U.S. officials argue that their approach, based on fostering technological innovation, is more effective in curbing global warming. Both sides seek to promote clean and renewable energy sources for increased energy security and to mitigate climate change. The United States and EU have made efforts to increase energy security and curb climate change through past initiatives, but progress has been limited. Despite differences on various policies, recent cooperation between the two sides has shown promise. EU officials urge the U.S. to do more for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, but are encouraged by renewed diplomatic efforts. Many are encouraged by renewed U.S. diplomatic efforts and support from Washington for Germany's EU presidency in revitalizing the two-state solution \"road map\". The U.S. and EU maintain a united stance on Hamas policies since 2006, emphasizing Hamas must recognize Israel and renounce violence. Foreign aid is provided directly to Palestinians, bypassing the Hamas-Fatah coalition government. Concerns arise about potential divergence between the U.S. and EU in the future. The EU may resume direct aid to the new government sooner than the United States. The US, France, Germany, and the UK are cooperating to curb Iran's nuclear program. Limited sanctions have been approved by the UN Security Council. Tensions have escalated between Iran and the West due to various incidents. The US is urging EU countries to take stronger actions against Iran, but the response has been tepid. At the April 30, 2007 summit, the United States and EU reiterated their commitment to prevent an Iranian nuclear weapons capability and expressed mutual concern about Iran's policies in the region, including in Iraq. The EU does not recognize Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, unlike the United States. Both the US and EU have called on Syria to end interference in Lebanese affairs, but there are suggestions that the EU is softening its policy towards the Syrian regime. The United States and the EU are concerned about Syria's role in the region and its repression of civil society. Despite some differences, both sides emphasize the need for constructive actions by Syria to improve relations. Efforts have been made to enhance police and judicial cooperation, counter terrorist financing, and enhance border controls and transport security through various agreements. Challenges still exist in the relationship. Some challenges remain in the relationship between the United States and the EU, such as concerns over privacy rights in exchanging airline passenger data and resistance to adding certain groups to the EU's terrorist list. There are also tensions over Guantanamo Bay and fears of losing Muslim \"hearts and minds\" due to U.S. practices in combating terrorism. The United States and the EU have disagreements over U.S. treatment of prisoners, rendition policy, and CIA programs. U.S. officials are concerned that allegations of wrongdoing and legal proceedings against CIA officials in some EU countries may jeopardize intelligence cooperation. The EU wants the U.S. Visa Waiver Program to include all EU members, but currently, 12 members do not qualify. Discussions during the 2007 summit emphasized the importance of combating terrorism within the bounds of international law. President Bush announced in November 2006 plans to modify the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) to allow new EU members to qualify more quickly and enhance security measures. Some Members of Congress have concerns about expanding the VWP due to security issues, while others support extending it to new EU countries. Legislation on the VWP has been introduced in the 110th Congress. Several pieces of legislation on the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) have been introduced in the House and Senate, aligning with the Bush Administration's goal of expanding and securing the VWP. EU officials are urging equal treatment for all 27 member states under the VWP, with a commitment made at a 2007 summit to work towards visa-free travel to the US for all EU citizens."
