    "content": "Prior to the reauthorization of the HEA in 2008, Title I of the HEA included four parts: (1) Definition of an Institution of Higher Education, (2) Additional General Provisions, (3) Cost of Higher Education, and (4) Administrative Provisions for Delivery of Student Financial Assistance. Part B had specific reporting requirements for institutions, while Part C included implicit reporting requirements related to IPEDS surveys. The HEOA amended institutional reporting requirements in Parts A, B, and C. The HEOA amends institutional reporting requirements in Parts A, B, and C of the HEA. It introduces new reporting requirements in Part C focusing on transparency in college costs and textbook information. Additionally, a new Part E is added for disclosures related to student loans, in addition to existing requirements under Title IV. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) introduces new reporting requirements in Part C of the Higher Education Act (HEA) for transparency in college costs and textbook information. Part E of the HEA defines Institutional Higher Education (IHE) for participation in Title IV programs, requiring institutions to be legally authorized, accredited, nonprofit, offer bachelor's degrees or two-year programs, and enroll students with high school diplomas. The definition of an Institutional Higher Education (IHE) for participation in Title IV programs includes institutions offering training for employment, admitting students beyond compulsory school age, and includes proprietary institutions, vocational institutions, and foreign institutions. Institutions eligible for Title IV programs must meet specific criteria, including being in existence for at least two years and deriving a portion of revenue from non-Title IV funds. Postsecondary vocational institutions must be nonprofit and are not subject to the 90/10 rule. Additionally, institutions must meet requirements based on course of study or enrollment to participate in Title IV programs. Institutions participating in Title IV programs must meet specific criteria, including requirements related to course of study or enrollment. These requirements include limits on the percentage of correspondence courses, students enrolled in correspondence courses, incarcerated students, and students without associate's or bachelor's degrees. Foreign institutions participating in the Federal Family Education Loan program must meet specific criteria, with additional requirements for medical and veterinary schools. Foreign medical institutions must have at least 60% of students and graduates who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents to qualify. Foreign medical institutions participating in the FFEL program must meet specific criteria, including having at least 60% of students or graduates who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Additionally, the institutions must have a clinical training program approved by a state as of January 1, 1991. For foreign for-profit veterinary institutions to be eligible, students must complete their clinical training at an approved veterinary school in the United States. The HEOA amended eligibility requirements for foreign medical and veterinary institutions, as well as added requirements for foreign nursing schools to participate in the FFEL program starting July 1, 2010. Foreign for-profit graduate medical institutions must meet new requirements effective July 1, 2010. They must ensure that at least 60% of students and graduates are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents, and 75% must pass exams administered by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates. Additionally, the institutions must have a state-approved clinical training program. Foreign nursing schools can become eligible to participate in the FFEL program by meeting five eligibility requirements, including agreements with US hospitals or nursing schools for clinical training and degree issuance upon graduation. Foreign nursing schools seeking eligibility for the FFEL program must meet specific requirements, including certifying FFEL program loans, reimbursing loan defaults, ensuring a passing score for 75% of students on the National Council Licensure Examination, and filing disclosure reports for foreign funding exceeding $250,000. Institutions must file disclosure reports for gifts from foreign sources by January 31 or July 31, closest to the gift receipt. Failure to comply may result in legal action to compel compliance and repayment of costs. The HEOA did not amend the HEA requirements for the disclosure of foreign gifts. Reporting requirements for IHEs relating to the disclosure of foreign gifts are outlined. The HEA includes institutional reporting requirements for drug and alcohol abuse prevention. Institutions must certify their prevention programs to receive federal funds. Failure to provide certification renders institutions ineligible for federal assistance. Information on drug and alcohol abuse prevention must be distributed annually to students and employees. Institutions must provide information on drug and alcohol abuse prevention annually to students and employees, including standards of conduct, legal sanctions, health risks, counseling options, and institutional sanctions. They must also conduct a biennial review of program effectiveness, make information available to the Secretary and the public, and enforce required sanctions consistently. The HEOA expanded reporting requirements to include the number of drug and alcohol-related violations and fatalities on campus. The Department of Education collects information on drug and alcohol-related violations and fatalities reported by institutions, along with the sanctions imposed in response. Reporting requirements for drug and alcohol abuse prevention are outlined in Title I, Part C, with data collected annually through IPEDS. Institutions must participate in IPEDS annually to maintain Title IV eligibility and comply with federal data collection requirements. Reporting requirements under the HEOA amendments to the HEA include new data elements in IPEDS and representative NPSAS data for each state. Institutions are mandated to report on college affordability, transparency, tuition, fees, financial assistance, and average aid amounts under HEA, \u00a7 131(a). The HEOA amended the HEA to require institutions to report college affordability data through IPEDS, including lists of institutions with highest/lowest tuition, fees, net price, and cost increases. Institutions on certain lists must also report reasons for cost increases and cost reduction efforts. The HEOA amended the HEA to require institutions to report college affordability data through IPEDS, including lists of institutions with highest/lowest tuition, fees, net price, and cost increases. Reporting requirements for IHEs relating to the cost of higher education are presented in Table 3. The Program Participation Agreement requires all institutions to participate in IPEDS and other data collection efforts designated by the Secretary. The HEOA amended the HEA to require transparency in college tuition for consumers. The Secretary must make consumer information available on the College Navigator website, potentially collected through IPEDS. Table 4 analyzes new consumer information reporting requirements, distinguishing between data collected through IPEDS or other sources pre-HEOA. The HEA previously did not specify data elements for public reporting, except for tuition and fees. The HEOA amended the HEA to require transparency in college tuition for consumers, including the development of a multi-year tuition calculator using data reported by institutions. This calculator will help estimate prices for tuition and fees for each year of a program of study. The HEOA amended the HEA to require transparency in college tuition for consumers, including the development of a multi-year tuition calculator using reported data. This calculator must provide estimates of tuition and fees for future years based on tuition guarantee programs. Additionally, the Secretary was previously required to conduct a triennial survey of federal student aid recipients to gather information on income distribution, aid received, debt burden, and capacity to repay education debts. The HEOA requires a quadrennial survey of federal student aid recipients to assess their debt burden, repayment capacity, and the impact of education debt on their studies and post-graduation plans. The survey must be representative of students from all types of institutions and include various student demographics. The costs of textbooks and instructional materials impact postsecondary education expenses. A new state-by-state student sample may be added to the NPSAS survey, which currently collects student information. Institutions must provide student data to ED through a two-stage process. In the 2008 NSPAS, 1,900 IHEs were included, providing enrollment lists with student details for ED to select 140,000 students for the survey sample. Additional information was requested from IHEs on sampled students. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) requires institutions to provide student data to the Department of Education (ED) for the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS). The HEOA also introduces new requirements for data to be representative by state, increasing the number of students and institutions included in the sample. Additionally, the HEOA amends Title I, Part C of the Higher Education Act by adding new requirements for information about textbooks provided by publishers to faculty members. The new provision under the Higher Education Opportunity Act requires textbook publishers to provide price information and copyright dates to faculty members selecting course materials. Institutions must publish ISBNs and retail prices of course materials online, and textbooks must be available separately from supplements. Under the Higher Education Opportunity Act, institutions are required to provide course schedules, course material information, and enrollment details to college bookstores. They must also inform students about renting textbooks, buying used books, buy-back programs, and alternative ways to access course content. Additionally, the Act establishes new requirements for lenders and institutions regarding federal and private student loans. Institutions participating in preferred lender arrangements must disclose information about student loans, including maximum aid available, loan terms, and reasons for the arrangement. They must also inform students about federal aid options and the potential benefits of federal student loans over private loans. Institutions participating in preferred lender arrangements must disclose information about student loans, including maximum aid available, loan terms, and reasons for the arrangement. They must also inform students about federal aid options and the potential benefits of federal student loans over private loans. Conditions of federal student loans may be more favorable than private loans, with required disclosures on model forms developed by the Secretary and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Institutions in the DL program must provide completed model disclosure forms for DL program loans, which must be posted on their websites and included in financial aid informational materials for prospective students and families. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) requires borrowers of private student loans to self-certify their eligibility by disclosing information such as cost of attendance and expected financial assistance. Title IV, Part G outlines requirements for institutions participating in federal student aid programs, including reporting student eligibility criteria. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) requires borrowers of private student loans to self-certify their eligibility by disclosing information such as cost of attendance and expected financial assistance. Title IV, Part G outlines requirements for institutions participating in federal student aid programs, including reporting student eligibility criteria, need determination, immigration status verification, federal student aid programs, credit transfer policies, drug-related offense penalties, entrance and exit counseling for loans, NSLDS borrower information verification, athletic programs and aid, completion rates, campus security, crime and fire safety, missing persons procedures, and program participation agreements. Title IV, Part G requires institutions to report eligibility and need for federal aid, disclose information on ineligible students, and provide data to USCIS and lenders. Reporting requirements include various aspects of program participation agreements. Prior to the enactment of the HEOA, institutions were required to disseminate information to enrolled and prospective students regarding financial aid programs and how to obtain financial assistance. Compliance with these requirements was necessary for participation in Title IV programs. Students must receive annual notifications about available information. The HEOA added disclosure and regulatory requirements to the HEA, including information on financial assistance programs, costs of attendance, academic programs, facilities for individuals with disabilities, accreditation, student progress standards, completion rates, study-abroad programs, campus crime, and transfer-out rates for institutions preparing students for enrollment elsewhere. The HEOA expanded disclosure requirements for institutions, including policies on copyright infringement, student diversity, employment placement, completion rates, emergency response, transfer of credit, drug policy notifications, and employee reimbursements. For example, institutions must disclose transfer credit criteria and articulation agreements, as well as penalties for drug violations. Institutions must notify students about penalties for drug violations, including options to regain federal student aid eligibility. Initial counseling for student borrowers of FFEL and DL program loans is required, with specific requirements for entrance and exit counseling outlined in Department of Education regulations and statutory provisions. Exit counseling is mandatory for students with FFEL or DL program loans before leaving school. It covers repayment schedules, borrower's rights, available options for deferment, forbearance, forgiveness, and discharge, as well as contact information for loan inquiries. The HEOA amended the HEA to specify statutory requirements for entrance and exit counseling for student loans. New exit counseling requirements include providing information on paying interest on loans, contacting the institution in case of early withdrawal, effects of loan consolidation, and tax benefits for borrowers. Institutions must also inform borrowers that loan information will be submitted to NSLDS. Institutions must report loan information to NSLDS and provide data on athletically related student aid recipients to the Secretary annually by July 1. This includes details on participating students by sport, race, and sex, completion rates by race and sex in specific sports, and overall completion rates for all students. Prospective aid recipients and their families must also receive this information. Institutions with intercollegiate athletic programs must report detailed information on team composition, expenses, coaches, and financial support data annually. This data must be available to students, potential students, and the public upon request. Institutions with intercollegiate athletic programs must report detailed information on team composition, expenses, coaches, and financial support data annually. Enrolled students have the right to request this information, which must be provided to the Department of Education within 15 days of being made available to students and the public. Reporting requirements for athletically related student aid and athletic programs are outlined, along with statutory requirements related to campus crime and security. Institutions must certify compliance with campus security policies and disclose campus crime statistics. Institutions must provide programs on crime prevention, distribute annual security reports to students and employees, report crime statistics to the Department of Education, and inform the campus community about any threats. They must also develop materials on sex offense policies, maintain a daily crime log, and disclose accurate crime information. The HEOA adds requirements for campus crime and security, including expanding the list of crimes for reporting, modifying reporting requirements for campus law enforcement, and informing students and employees about emergency response procedures. Institutions must comply with these regulations to avoid civil penalties under HEA. The HEOA amends the HEA by establishing requirements for fire safety reports, missing student notification policies, and contact procedures for missing students in on-campus housing. Prior to the HEOA, the HEA lacked reporting requirements for missing person procedures. The Program Participation Agreement (PPA) mandates institutions to sign for federal student aid programs, including general reporting requirements. These requirements may overlap with HEA sections or introduce new ones, such as job placement rate disclosures. The HEOA introduced reporting requirements for job placement rates to ensure transparency in attracting students. Institutions must provide recent employment and graduation statistics, state licensing requirements, and other relevant information to support advertised rates. This information is crucial for accrediting agencies to review, as outlined in HEA and CFR regulations. The Program Integrity Triad under Title IV specifies roles for state authorization, accreditation, and eligibility certification to maintain program integrity. The Program Integrity Triad under Title IV ensures eligibility of institutions for federal student aid programs through state authorization, accreditation, and oversight by the Department of Education (ED). State role is for consumer protection, accrediting agencies ensure quality assurance, and ED oversees compliance to protect program integrity. Reporting requirements in Part H are imposed to uphold administrative and fiscal integrity of federal student aid programs. The state's role in the Program Integrity Triad is to provide legal authorization for postsecondary institutions to operate within the state. Institutions must be accredited by a recognized agency to participate in federal student aid programs. The Higher Education Act includes requirements for accrediting agencies to gain recognition from the Secretary. The Higher Education Act includes provisions for accrediting agencies to assess institutions on student achievement, curricula, faculty, and student support services. This may lead to potential reporting requirements for institutions to meet accreditation standards. Accrediting agencies must consistently enforce standards to ensure quality education programs at institutions. These standards assess student achievement, curriculum, faculty, facilities, and student support services. Accrediting agencies must consistently enforce standards to ensure quality education programs at institutions. This includes assessing program length, objectives of credentials offered, student complaints, compliance with Title IV requirements, student loan default rates, financial audits, and program reviews. The HEOA also mandates accrediting agencies to respect the institution's mission and require processes for distance education programs. Accrediting agencies must enforce standards for quality education programs, including assessing program length, credentials offered, student complaints, Title IV compliance, loan default rates, financial audits, and program reviews. Institutions offering distance education must verify student identity and have transparent transfer of credit policies. Accreditation reviews must confirm these policies are publicly disclosed. Institutions must report directly to the Secretary regarding a change in accreditation, providing materials related to prior accreditation and reasons for the change. Institutions seeking multiple accreditations must explain their reasons to the Secretary and each accrediting agency. Potential reporting requirements from accrediting agencies may be imposed on institutions, but it is unclear to what extent institutions must comply. The Secretary is responsible for eligibility and accreditation. The Department of Education (ED) is responsible for verifying institutions' eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs by evaluating their legal authority, accreditation status, administrative capability, and financial responsibility through an Application for Approval. Eligibility is authorized for up to six years under Title IV programs. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) did not amend these requirements. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) did not amend requirements related to eligibility and certification procedures for Title IV programs. The form used to establish institutional eligibility for Title IV programs also serves other purposes, such as deferments on Title IV loans and eligibility for non-Title IV programs. Compliance with reporting requirements on the application impacts an institution's eligibility for both Title IV and non-Title IV programs. The application form is used to establish institutional eligibility for Title IV programs and other non-Title IV programs. It is required for initial certification, recertification, reinstatement, change of ownership, conversion, merger, program eligibility expansion, and updating information. The form collects information to determine eligibility, accreditation, financial responsibility, and administrative capability. Institutions must also describe the relationship between main and branch campuses. The institution must provide information on its administrative capability, fiscal responsibility, and relationship between main and branch campuses to relevant agencies. It must indicate interest in participating in Title IV programs and submit required documentation for certification. Institutions certified to participate in Title IV programs must apply for recertification periodically. Foreign institutions can participate in the FFEL program by submitting an application with required information. Failure to provide this information makes foreign institutions ineligible for FFEL participation. Table 14 summarizes the information collected on the E-App for certification. Institutions applying for recertification must provide various documents based on their circumstances. Required documents include accreditation letter, state license, IRS designation, and financial statements. Initial applicants must also submit audited financial statements and a default management plan. Institutions with ownership changes need to provide additional financial statements. Institutions undergoing ownership changes must submit audited financial statements for the two most recent fiscal years, a same-day balance sheet post-ownership change, and a default management plan if applicable. Foreign institutions must provide a certified English translation of their nonprofit status, catalog sections on degrees and programs, and legal authorization to offer post-secondary education. Institutions must provide legal authorization and certified English translations to award degrees equivalent to those in the US, as well as for graduate medical education if applicable. They also need to submit audited financial statements for the two most recent years and a default management plan. Once certified for Title IV programs, institutions must complete a Program Participation Agreement, binding them to program requirements and regulations. Financial and compliance reports are also required. Some financial and compliance reports are required for Title IV program participation. Reports are used to determine eligibility and must be submitted to the Secretary. Institutions must provide audited financial statements and confirm their designation as a public institution to be considered financially responsible. Compliance with requirements is necessary for certification or recertification. An institution must comply with financial and compliance audit requirements under HEA and Title IV. Results must be submitted to the Secretary and relevant agencies. The financial audit assesses the institution's financial condition, while the compliance audit focuses on funds from HEA or Title IV loans. Audits must be submitted within six months of the fiscal year end. Public institutions must also provide a statement from the State Auditor General confirming financial obligations were met. Institutions must comply with financial and compliance audit requirements under HEA and Title IV. If certain criteria are not met, such as offering more than 50% of courses by correspondence or having a high percentage of students in incarceration, the institution becomes ineligible for Title IV. Reporting violations, such as bankruptcy or fraud involving Title IV funds, is mandatory. Noncompliance may lead to penalties or termination of participation in Title IV programs. Institutions must comply with financial and compliance audit requirements under HEA and Title IV. Failure to meet criteria, such as offering courses by correspondence or having a high percentage of incarcerated students, can result in Title IV ineligibility. Noncompliance, including bankruptcy or fraud with Title IV funds, may lead to penalties or termination of participation in Title IV programs. Financial responsibility, audit submission, and certification issues can also result in fines or limitations on participation. Institutions must comply with financial and compliance audit requirements under HEA and Title IV to maintain eligibility for Title IV programs. If participation ends, the institution must notify the Secretary and submit various documents, including a letter of engagement for an independent audit and financial reports. Specific reporting requirements for the end of participation are beyond the scope of this report. Some Title IV programs have specific reporting requirements for institutions to disclose program-specific information to the Secretary, students, or other entities. This part of the report examines program-specific reporting and disclosure requirements for institutions participating in the FFEL program, the DL program, and the campus-based programs. Requirements include calculating financial need for borrowers, notifying lenders of borrower status changes, and submitting the Fiscal Operations Report and Application to Participate (FISAP). Institutions must comply with reporting and disclosure requirements for the FFEL and DL programs as specified in the HEA and regulations. This includes providing lenders with borrower need analysis data, loan details, and disbursement schedules. Institutions participating in the FFEL and DL programs must provide timely and accurate borrower information, including changes in address and enrollment status. The HEOA did not change these requirements, which are similar to those for FFEL program lenders. The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant program, Federal Work-Study program, and Federal Perkins Loan program are part of the campus-based programs under Title IV. Institutions participating in these programs have specific reporting requirements outlined in the statute or regulations. Funding for campus-based aid comes from federal allocations and institutional matching funds. The FISAP is a data collection tool used for these programs. The FISAP is a data collection instrument used to gather program and fiscal information from institutions participating in campus-based programs. It ensures proper administration of funds received from the Secretary and includes identifying information, enrollment data, and fiscal details for each program. The FISAP is a data collection form used by institutions participating in campus-based programs to report on student financial need, cohort default rates, employment in community service, and administrative costs. It contains over 200 line items with multiple data elements and is due to the Department of Education by October 1 each year. The form is submitted electronically via the Student Aid Internet Gateway. Institutions must report on the FISAP, and may use FWS funds for job location programs for students. They must submit annual reports and evaluations to the Secretary. Institutions offering Perkins Loans must disclose loan information to borrowers before and during repayment. Institutions must disclose information about borrower's Perkins Loans to consumer reporting agencies, including disbursement, repayment, defaults, and rehabilitation. Reporting requirements for terms and conditions of Perkins Loans to borrowers and repayment to consumer reporting agencies are outlined. Additionally, institutions must report Perkins Loans information to the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) as part of program participation agreements. Under Title IV, Part G, institutions must respond to federal data collection efforts promptly and to the satisfaction of the Secretary. The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) is a key data collection program by the National Center of Education Statistics at ED, gathering information from all postsecondary education providers in the U.S. It includes academic, vocational, and professional education data, with mandatory reporting for all institutions. Other postsecondary data collections are not covered in this report. IPEDS collects data from all postsecondary education providers in the U.S., including academic, vocational, and professional programs. Institutions participating in federal student aid programs must respond to IPEDS, while others may choose to participate. Data collected includes institutional characteristics, degree completions, enrollment, human resources, finance, financial aid, and graduation rates. Surveys are conducted annually, and the data is included in the College Navigator website. The IPEDS data collection includes information on institutional characteristics, degree completions, enrollment, human resources, and salaries of full-time instructional staff. This data is collected annually from all postsecondary education providers in the U.S. and is used for various purposes including federal student aid programs. The IPEDS data collection includes information on salaries of full-time instructional staff, fall enrollment, finance, financial aid, and graduation rates. The IPEDS data collection includes information on salaries of full-time instructional staff, fall enrollment, finance, financial aid, and graduation rates. Various surveys are administered to institutions based on their type and only specific categories of students are included in the data elements. For example, the fall staff survey is conducted every odd year, and financial aid data is collected for full-time, first-time, degree- and certificate-seeking students. Graduation rates are calculated based on full-time, first-time, degree- or certificate-seeking students entering an institution during a particular year. Different versions of surveys are given to institutions based on their level (four-year, two-year, less-than-two-year) and whether they are public or private. The IPEDS data collection includes surveys on various institutional factors such as type, public or private status, and number of employees. Surveys are administered in fall, spring, or winter, with different components for each period. For the 2008-2009 academic year, surveys included Institutional Characteristics, Completions, Enrollment, Human Resources, Finance, Graduation Rates, and Student Financial Aid. Specific survey components and items vary based on institutional type and level. Specific survey components and items vary based on institutional characteristics such as level and control."
