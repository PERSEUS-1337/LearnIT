    "content": "The Antiquities Act of 1906 authorizes the President to proclaim national monuments on federal lands containing historic landmarks and structures. Monument proclamations aim to protect federal lands with the smallest area necessary. Presidents have established, modified, or reviewed national monuments since 1906. The establishment and modification of national monuments have been contentious, with criticism focusing on size, resource protection, land use impact, inclusion of nonfederal lands, and lack of public participation requirements. Advocates argue for presidential authority to protect resources promptly, citing public and court support for designations. Congress faces decisions on establishing, amending, or abolishing national monuments, with broad authority to act. Congress has broad authority to establish and modify national monuments on federal lands, including changing monument sizes. Questions for Congress include determining the optimal size of protected areas and the extent of allowed land uses. The debate over whether the President has the authority to abolish national monuments remains unresolved. Congress also oversees presidential monument proclamations and considers altering this authority. This controversy is part of a broader discussion on federal land ownership and management. The debate over federal land ownership and management includes conflicts like the 2016 takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. Stakeholders argue over whether the federal government should dispose of, retain, or acquire lands, with some advocating for state and local ownership. President Trump issued an executive order in 2017 regarding federal land management. President Trump issued an executive order in 2017 requiring a review of national monuments established or expanded since 1996. The order focused on monuments exceeding 100,000 acres or lacking adequate public outreach. The Antiquities Act mandates the smallest area for protection, but not public outreach. The policy aimed to ensure monument designations align with the Act's objectives and balance landmark protection. The review of national monuments established or expanded since 1996 aimed to balance protection of landmarks with appropriate use of Federal lands. Factors for evaluation included the Antiquities Act requirements and proper care of designated objects. The executive order required the Secretary to provide an interim report on Bears Ears National Monument in Utah and other monuments within 45 days. A final report on the secretarial review of monuments was due within 120 days. Most post-1996 monuments are managed by DOI agencies. Since 1996, Presidents Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama have issued 64 monument-related proclamations, with 54 establishing monuments and 8 expanding them. The total area of these designations and expansions is approximately 774.1 million acres, with most of the acreage in marine areas designated by Presidents Bush and Obama. Since 1996, Presidents Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama have issued 64 monument-related proclamations, establishing or expanding 26 national monuments exceeding 100,000 acres in 10 states and 4 marine areas. A total of 27 national monuments were reviewed under the President's executive order, with one monument reviewed for public outreach and coordination, and the remaining 26 monuments reviewed for exceeding 100,000 acres in size. The Secretary of the Interior led the review of 27 monuments, with 22 being land-based. Over 2.8 million comments were received, mostly in favor of maintaining existing monuments for economic benefits and preventing the sale of federal land. Some commenters supported abolishing or modifying monument designations for a broader array of activities. Stakeholder input was gathered through meetings at various monuments, with an interim report issued on Bears Ears. The Secretary of the Interior issued an interim report on Bears Ears National Monument, stating that the monument's size and management provisions do not fully conform with policies. Recommendations include revising the monument boundary and giving tribes a more significant role in management. The Secretary of the Interior recommended revising the monument boundary for Bears Ears National Monument. The final report included extensive recommendations for Bears Ears and concluded the review of six other monuments with no recommended changes. The final report was sent to the President but not publicly released. The Administration provided a two-page summary of the report, with the full report marked as \"Draft Deliberative\u2014Not for Distribution.\" Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke stated that each reviewed monument is unique, some are strongly supported by local communities, while others remain controversial for various reasons. The final report highlighted controversial aspects such as monument size, types of objects protected, land use effects, public access, consultation sufficiency, resource protection, private land inclusion, and overlap with other federal designations. In the final report to the President, the Interior Secretary made recommendations for 10 out of 27 monuments reviewed, with support and opposition from various stakeholders. Recommendations included amending monument proclamations for resource protection and revising boundaries through lawful exercise of the President's discretion. Congress has the authority to modify management and boundaries of monuments established under the Antiquities Act. The Secretary did not provide full details on the recommended changes. The Interior Secretary made recommendations for 10 out of 27 monuments reviewed under the Antiquities Act, suggesting amendments to monument proclamations and boundary revisions. The final report did not specify the exact changes to be made, with varying numbers of recommendations for each monument. The most common recommendation was to amend the proclamations for specified purposes. The Secretary recommended amending the proclamations for six monuments to prioritize public access, traditional use, and hunting and fishing rights. For the other four monuments, amendments would focus on commercial fishing or active timber management. Boundary changes were proposed for four national monuments: Bears Ears, Cascade-Siskiyou, Gold Butte, and Grand Staircase-Escalante, with specific purposes outlined for each. Bears Ears boundaries would be revised to protect objects, Gold Butte to protect historic water rights, Cascade-Siskiyou for sustained timber yield and reducing impacts on private lands, and Pacific Remote Islands Marine and Rose Atoll Marine for boundary adjustments. The final report contained recommendations for 10 monuments, including securing funding for infrastructure, tribal co-management of cultural areas, conservation designations, and assessing risks to border safety and military readiness. The final report included recommendations for 10 monuments, proposing changes to the monument designation process to establish clear criteria and methodology for conservation goals. The Secretary suggested these changes could be implemented through legislation, regulations, or internal guidance within the Executive Branch. Additionally, stakeholders identified Camp Nelson as an area deserving protection and designation under the Antiquities Act. The final report recommended evaluating Camp Nelson in Kentucky, the Medgar Evers Home in Mississippi, and the Badger-Two Medicine area in Montana for national monument designation. The Secretary suggested clarifying executive authority limits under the Antiquities Act and updating monument management plans to address restrictions on allowable uses. Since the enactment of the Antiquities Act in 1906, Presidents have issued 259 proclamations to establish or modify national monuments. Secretary Zinke's final report is interpreted as likely recommending reductions in monument boundaries, although past Presidents have also expanded monuments on 76 occasions. The biggest expansion occurred in 2016 when President Obama enlarged the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument by 283.4 million acres. The Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument was expanded by 283.4 million acres, quadrupling its size to approximately 373 million acres. Presidents have both expanded and diminished national monuments, with some monuments being enlarged multiple times by different Presidents. Diminishments of national monuments varied widely in terms of acreages and percentages, with reductions ranging from 52 acres to 313,280 acres. Some monuments have been reduced multiple times by different Presidents. Since the Antiquities Act, six presidential proclamations have both enlarged and diminished national monuments between 1956 and 1963. Between 1956 and 1963, six presidential proclamations altered the sizes of national monuments, with varying degrees of change. These changes included both enlargements and diminishments, with some proclamations reducing the overall size of the monuments. One example is the Craters of the Moon National Monument, which experienced both enlargement and diminishment following congressional actions in 1936. Following congressional removal of areas from the monument in 1936, President Franklin D. Roosevelt further diminished the monument in 1941, and President Kennedy enlarged it in 1962. In 1996, Congress revised the monument by enlarging some areas and diminishing others, and President Clinton further enlarged it in 2000. The Pinnacles National Monument saw additions in 1976 and further enlargement by President Clinton in 2000. The final report did not recommend abolishing any national monuments, as the Antiquities Act does not give the President the authority to do so. No court cases have addressed this issue. The report suggests amending monument proclamations regarding resources. The final report recommends amending monument proclamations regarding resource management. Presidents have issued proclamations for national monuments on eight occasions between 1911 and 2007, with purposes including resource management and area descriptions. Notable examples include President Roosevelt modifying the Katmai National Monument in 1936 and President Bush amending the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument in 2007. Since the Antiquities Act in 1906, Presidents and Congress have established national monuments on federal lands. Congress has the authority to enact legislation regarding federal lands, allowing for more land uses or additional protections compared to monuments created by the President. Congress has modified monuments, including those created by the President. Congress has modified national monuments, including those created by the President, by changing boundaries, abolishing some, and converting others into different protective designations like national parks. Approximately half of current national parks were originally designated as national monuments."
