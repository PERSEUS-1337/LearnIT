    "content": "The Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for FY2006, enacted as P.L. 109-54, provided $26.20 billion in funding for various agencies and programs. Additionally, $1.50 billion in supplemental funds were allocated for veterans health care resources. Another law, H.R. 2863, signed into law as P.L. 109-148, made adjustments to funding levels through rescissions and emergency supplemental funds. The FY2006 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-54) provided funding for various agencies and programs, including the Forest Service, Indian Health Service, Environmental Protection Agency, arts and cultural agencies, and Department of Energy programs. The FY2006 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-54) transferred DOE programs to House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees for energy and water, while EPA jurisdiction moved to subcommittees covering Interior and Related Agencies. Interior and Related Agencies appropriations acts typically had two primary titles for funding, but the FY2006 law had three titles. The FY2006 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-54) had three primary titles for funding. The report is organized based on these titles, with sections discussing Interior agencies, EPA, other agencies, programs, and entities funded in the law, and cross-cutting topics. Appropriations in the report include total funds available, excluding permanent budget authorities. Funding levels are compared between FY2006, President's request, House and Senate recommendations for FY2006, and FY2005 appropriations. The House Committee on Appropriations provides the funding figures used in the report. The House Committee on Appropriations is the main source of funding figures used in the report, along with other sources like the Senate Committee on Appropriations and agency budget justifications. Some funding figures in the tables may not add up precisely due to rounding. The Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill (H.R. 2361) was signed into law on August 2, 2005 as P.L. 109-54, with supplemental funds included. Some DOI websites mentioned in the report may not be consistently operational due to a court order. The FY2006 appropriations law provided $26.20 billion, an increase of 2% over the President's budget request for FY2006 of $25.72 billion, but a decrease of 3% below the FY2005 enacted level of $27.02 billion. Congress also included $1.50 billion in supplemental funds for veterans' health care resources. The total appropriation reflects an across-the-board rescission of 0.476% to be applied across accounts. The figures used in the report do not include the effect of other rescissions and emergency supplemental funds from P.L. 109-148. Funding for the Forest Service decreased by $507.1 million compared to FY2005. The FY2006 appropriations law provided $26.20 billion, reflecting a 3% decrease from the FY2005 enacted level. The Senate passed H.R. 2361 unanimously, with appropriations of $26.26 billion for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies. The House had previously passed H.R. 2361 with $26.16 billion in FY2006 appropriations. The House passed H.R. 2361 with $26.16 billion in FY2006 appropriations, a 3% decrease from FY2005. The Senate considered numerous amendments during debate on the bill, addressing various agency issues. Amendments not covered in the report included those related to general Interior appropriations or cross-cutting matters. During the House debate on the FY2006 appropriations bill, various amendments were considered, including ones related to family travel to Cuba and emergency supplemental appropriations for the Veterans Health Administration. Some controversial provisions were removed from the bill due to House rules barring legislation on appropriations bills. The FY2006 appropriations bill raised concerns about unauthorized appropriations and amendments were proposed to limit spending on certain programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported H.R. 2361, providing $26.27 billion for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies. The House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Interior reviewed funding bills for FY2006, with the President seeking a 5% decrease in appropriations. The President's budget recommended depositing 70% of receipts from BLM land sales under the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act into the general fund of the Treasury. The budget for FY2006 included BLM land sales under the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act and legislation to open part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas exploration. Budget authority for Interior and Related Agencies for FY2004-2006 is shown in Table 1. The budgetary history of agencies, bureaus, and programs for FY2004-2005, President's budget request for FY2006, House and Senate-passed levels for FY2006, and controversial policy and funding issues are debated during consideration of annual Interior and Related Agencies appropriations bills. Current debate on FY2006 funding levels includes issues like the Abandoned Mine Lands Fund and funding for Arts and Humanities. The report discusses funding for Arts and Humanities, BIA Schools, IHS Hospitals, Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds, and Competitive Sourcing. The report also addresses the Environmental Protection Agency, Competitive Sourcing, Fish and Wildlife Service Programs, and Indian Trust Funds, including issues such as privatization, funding levels, and historical accounting of Individual Indian Money accounts. The curr_chunk discusses various topics such as accounts in a class-action lawsuit, human dosing studies, land acquisition, and outer continental shelf leasing. It also mentions the adequacy of health safety standards for research subjects and the use of data for determining human health risks of pesticides. For more details, refer to the specific sections in the report. The curr_chunk discusses topics such as Outer Continental Shelf Leasing, Superfund funding for hazardous waste cleanup, Wild Horses and Burros management, and Wildland Fire Fighting funding levels. The curr_chunk discusses the appropriate level of funding to fight fires on agency lands, borrowing funds from other agency programs for wildfires, implementing a new program for wildland fire protection, and the impact of environmental analysis and public involvement on fuel reduction activities. The Bureau of Land Management manages public land for various uses and federal subsurface mineral resources. (For more information, see the \"Bureau of Land Management\" and \"Department of Agriculture: Forest Service\" sections in this report.) Table 2 provides information on congressional consideration of the FY2006 Interior appropriations bill. The Bureau of Land Management oversees federal subsurface mineral resources and wildland fire management on millions of acres of land. The FY2006 appropriations law allocated $1.78 billion for BLM, a decrease from the previous year. The Administration's budget proposed amending the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act to change the allocation of proceeds from BLM land sales in Nevada. The FY2006 law allocated $860.8 million for the Bureau of Land Management, an increase of 3% from FY2005. This funding includes various BLM land programs such as protection, recreational use, improvement, development, disposal, and administration. The House had initially approved $845.8 million, while the Senate supported $867.0 million for FY2006. Some programs, like resource protection, would see an increase in funding compared to FY2005. The FY2006 law allocated $860.8 million for the Bureau of Land Management, with increases in programs such as resource protection, law enforcement, and management of various areas. The Challenge Cost Share Program received a 35% increase instead of the requested 89%. The Cooperative Conservation Initiative was not funded, and some programs saw decreased funding compared to FY2005. Energy leasing activities within national monuments were restricted as of January 20, 2001. The FY2006 law continued the boundaries of national monuments as of January 20, 2001, with exceptions allowed by presidential proclamations. It also extended the moratorium on mining and mill site claims on federal lands, except for applications meeting certain requirements filed before September 30, 1994. The House Appropriations Committee directed BLM to report on steps for oil shale development by December 31, 2005, while the Senate supported accelerating oil shale development. The law did not include a limitation on funds for wild horses and burros. The House language in the bill aimed to prevent the sale or slaughter of wild horses and burros, with advocates arguing for alternative population control methods like adoption programs. BLM had sold animals under new authority, some of which were later sent to slaughterhouses. Opponents believed BLM's revised sale procedure would prevent this outcome, but supporters argued the new sale authority was necessary due to insufficient efforts to reduce herd sizes. The Senate Appropriations Committee report encouraged funding for a pilot adoption program by the National Wild Horse Association in Nevada to address the issue of wild horse population control. The appropriations law for Wildland Fire Management for FY2006 allocated $766.6 million, an 8% decrease from the previous year, with the House-passed bill containing $761.6 million due to reduced funding for state and local fire assistance. The Administration proposed zeroing out funds for state programs. The Administration proposed cutting funding for state and local fire assistance in FY2006, but the Senate included $10.0 million in the appropriations law. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concern over the elimination of rural fire assistance. Additionally, $272.9 million was allocated for fire preparedness, a 5% increase from the previous year. In FY2006, funding for fire suppression decreased by 26% to $234.2 million, while other fire operations saw a 2% increase to $259.5 million. The Administration expressed concern over high fire suppression costs and directed examination of fires exceeding $10.0 million in costs. Additionally, hazardous fuels reduction received a 5% increase to $211.2 million. In FY2006, the wildland fire funds appropriated to BLM for fire fighting on Interior Department lands increased by 5% to $211.2 million. The focus is on reducing hazardous fuels to prevent catastrophic fires, in line with the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 and the National Fire Plan. The appropriations law also included $11.9 million for BLM construction, a 5% increase over FY2005, and $8.8 million for Land Acquisition, 22% less than FY2005. In FY2006, the appropriations law included $8.8 million for BLM land acquisition, 22% less than the FY2005 enacted level. The funding was provided for five specific acquisitions, with the House approving $3.8 million for management of the acquisition program and emergencies. The original Senate-passed bill had contained $12.3 million for specified new acquisitions, but a Senate amendment to eliminate funds for BLM land acquisition fell on a point of order. Funding for BLM acquisitions had decreased steadily from $49.9 million in FY2002 through FY2005, with money appropriated from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The FY2006 law allocated $110.1 million for O&C Lands, a 2% increase from FY2005. This funding supports programs for managing resources on these lands. For more information on the Department of the Interior and Bureau of Land Management, visit their respective websites. The FY2006 budget for the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) requested $1.32 billion, slightly less than FY2005. The House approved $1.01 billion, a 4% increase, while the Senate approved $993.5 billion, a 3% increase. The final appropriations law provided $1.01 billion, a 5% increase. The largest portion of the FWS budget is for the Resources Management account. The President's FY2006 budget proposed legislation to open part of the Coastal Plain in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas exploration, with the first lease sale estimated to generate $2.4 billion in federal revenues over five years. This provision was not included in H.R. 6 but may be included in a reconciliation bill in the fall of 2005. Funding for the Endangered Species program in the 109th Congress was a contentious issue. The Administration proposed a 2% reduction in funding from $143.2 million in FY2005 to $140.1 million in FY2006, but Congress approved $151.6 million, a 6% increase. Other related programs also saw changes in funding, with the Landowner Incentive Program receiving $24.0 million instead of the proposed $40.0 million, and Stewardship Grants receiving $7.4 million instead of $10.0 million. In FY2006, funding for the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund increased to $82.2 million, exceeding the Administration's request of $80.0 million. Overall funding for the Endangered Species program and related programs was set at $265.2 million by Congress, lower than the President's proposed $270.1 million. Additionally, refuge operations and maintenance received $393.4 million, slightly lower than the President's proposed $393.9 million. Law Enforcement funding was increased to $57.6 million, a $2.0 million increase. In FY2006, the President proposed $57.6 million for Law Enforcement, an increase of $2.0 million from FY2005. The House-passed level was $57.8 million, the Senate-passed level was $57.6 million, and the FY2006 appropriations law contained $57.7 million. For Land Acquisition, the Administration proposed $41.0 million, 11% over FY2005, but 5% less than FY2004. P.L. 109-54 reduced the program to $28.4 million, funded from LWCF appropriations. The funding for traditional land acquisition has decreased in recent years. In FY2006, Congress reserved $13.7 million for specified land acquisitions and funded the program at $14.7 million. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund compensates counties for federal lands presence. Congress provided $14.4 million for FY2006, an increase from the FY2005 level of $14.2 million. The FY2006 level for the MSCF, combined with expected receipts, would provide about 41% of the authorized full payment, down from previous years. The program benefits various wildlife species and the President's budget proposed moving funding for the NMBCF into the MSCF, which Congress has rejected annually. For FY2006, the President proposed $8.3 million for the MSCF, including cuts in programs for some species and increases for others. Congress enacted modest increases over FY2005 for the subprograms. The State and Tribal Wildlife Grants program, created in the FY2001 Interior appropriations law, helps fund conservation efforts for species of concern to states and tribes. Funding can be used for conservation plans and projects, with a portion set aside for tribal grants. The President proposed $74.0 million for FY2006, but the appropriations law decreased it to $68.5 million. The National Park Service (NPS) oversees 388 park units covering over 84 million acres with 20,000 employees. For more information on the Fish and Wildlife Service, visit http://www.fws.gov/. Funding for the State and Tribal Wildlife Grants program was reduced from $74.0 million to $68.5 million for FY2006. The National Park Service (NPS) manages various natural and historic areas in the US, with different designations like national parks, monuments, and recreational areas. In FY2006, the NPS received $2.29 billion in funding, with plans for security and infrastructure upgrades in certain parks. The funding was slightly lower than the previous year but higher than the requested amount. The FY2006 Interior appropriations bill contained $2.23 billion, slightly less than the Senate-approved $2.32 billion. Provisions included preventing NPS from reducing Lake Powell water levels, funding for a Martin Luther King, Jr. memorial, and extending snowmobile access to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks for the 2005-2006 winter season. The FY2006 Interior appropriations bill included provisions for funding national parks, with a focus on park operations funding which supports essential activities and services. The bill also addressed snowmobile access to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks for the winter season. The FY2006 Interior appropriations law allocated $1.74 billion for park operations, an increase from the previous year. Park advocacy groups estimate that national parks operate with two-thirds of needed funding. The budget supports the U.S. Park Police, providing law enforcement services in metropolitan park areas. The FY2006 Interior appropriations law allocated $81.4 million for U.S. Park Police to support law enforcement in park units system-wide. An internal review in December 2004 redefined USPP priorities to focus on protection of iconic park units, patrol of the National Mall, special events management, criminal investigations, and traffic control. The FY2006 request for protection programs and international park affairs office was $36.8 million, a decrease of $24.2 million from FY2005. Congress provided $11.2 million for National Recreation and Preservation in FY2005, but the FY2006 request did not seek funds for statutory or contractual aid. The FY2006 Interior appropriations law provided $7.1 million for statutory or contractual aid and $55.0 million for the entire line item, $6.0 million below FY2005. The FY2006 request proposed $5.0 million for funding the 27 existing National Heritage Areas (NHAs), a reduction of $9.6 million (66%) from the FY2005 enacted level. Congress has maintained or increased NHA funding in recent years despite lower Administration requests. The FY2006 law provided $13.5 million for NHAs, with potential funding from the Preserve America program. The House included $15.0 million for Heritage Partnership Programs, while the Senate approved $13.6 million for NHAs. The FY2006 Interior appropriations law did not fund Preserve America, a matching grant program created in 1978. Congress has not provided new grants for the Urban Park and Recreation Act since FY2002. Grant administration was transferred to the National Recreation and Preservation line item in FY2005. Over 100 active grants approved in FY2000-FY2002 continue under the program. The FY2006 Interior appropriations law provided $301.3 million for NPS construction, $51.7 million less than FY2005 enacted. The Administration had requested $307.4 million for high priority health, safety, and resource protection needs, a decrease of $45.6 million from FY2005. In FY2006, the NPS received $45.6 million less than the FY2005 enacted appropriation of $353.0 million. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) received $64.9 million, with $34.9 million for NPS land acquisition and $30.0 million for state assistance programs. An additional $9.9 million from prior year balances is allocated for land acquisition within the National Park System. State assistance funds are designated for recreation-related land acquisition and planning by the states. In FY2006, the NPS received $45.6 million less than the FY2005 enacted appropriation of $353.0 million. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) received $64.9 million, with $34.9 million for NPS land acquisition and $30.0 million for state assistance programs. The state assistance funds are designated for recreation planning and development by the states, with funds allocated by a formula and states determining their spending priorities. The FY2006 total was $81.4 million below the FY2005 enacted level. The Administration had requested $54.5 million. The House originally approved $9.4 million, while the Senate-passed bill included $86.0 million. The House did not provide funds for new LWCF State Assistance Grants, but included $1.6 million to administer existing grants. Administration representatives had testified that state project grants are more appropriately funded through other means. The House proposed a reduction in funding for NPS land acquisition in FY2006, with the original budget request at $52.9 million. The Senate approved $56.0 million for NPS land acquisition but faced a point of order on a proposed amendment to cut funding. The Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) provides grants to states for preservation projects. The Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) provides grants to states, territories, and local governments for activities specified in the National Historic Preservation Act. These activities include protecting cultural resources, restoring historic districts, and enhancing economic development. HPF also funds cultural heritage projects for Indian tribes, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. The FY2006 appropriation for HPF was $73.3 million, including grants to states, tribal grants, Save America's Treasures, and funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The FY2006 enacted appropriation for HPF included $30.0 million for Save America's Treasures, a program that preserves significant cultural artifacts and historic structures. $13.3 million would be for competitive grants and $16.8 million for designated projects. The program's funding reflected concerns about geographic diversity and required project recommendations to be approved by the Appropriations Committees. The Senate-passed bill allocated $7.5 million for Preserve America pilot grants within the Save America's Treasures program. Preserve America grants would support community resource management and heritage tourism efforts on a matching basis. The FY2006 appropriation provided $5.0 million for Preserve America grants. The National Historic Preservation Act discusses the funding of historic preservation programs, including the Preserve America program and Save America's Treasures. Congress has funded the National Trust for Historic Preservation on a temporary basis and provided funds for preserving historic buildings on HBCU campuses. Funding for HBCUs under HPF varied in different fiscal years, with competitive grants administered by the NPS in some cases. The FY2006 law provided $3.4 million for HBCUs under HPF, with the House proposing $3.5 million and the Senate agreeing to $2.0 million. The final funding allocated was $3.0 million. There were objections to the appropriation for the Historic Preservation Fund during House debate, citing lack of authorization for FY2006. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is the nation's premier science agency providing information on natural hazards, environment, energy, minerals, water, and biological sciences. It is also the federal government's main mapping agency and a key source of water resource data. USGS funding is allocated for various activities including the National Mapping Program, Geologic Hazards, Water Resources Investigations, Biological Research, Enterprise Information, and Science Support. In FY2006, P.L. 109-54 appropriated $976.0 million for the USGS, an increase of $31.5 million over FY2005. Funding was allocated to various programs including the National Mapping Program, Geologic Hazards, Water Resources Investigations, Biological Research, Enterprise Information, Science Support, and Facilities. The US faced numerous disasters including earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, fires, and floods, with 169 active volcanoes in the US and its territories. The United States has 169 active volcanoes, the most of any country. The USGS is responsible for providing notifications and reducing losses from earthquakes, volcanoes, and landslides. The FY2006 budget proposed funding increases for tsunami monitoring, seismic activity monitoring, and geothermal assessments. P.L. 109-54 provided $6.2 million more than FY2005 for natural hazards. The Administration's FY2006 budget proposed a $28.3 million reduction in the Geologic Hazards line item. The FY2006 budget proposed cuts in the Geologic Hazards, Resource, and Processes line item related to mineral resources. Both the House and Senate recommended restoring this funding, which was done in the enacted legislation. Funding for Water Resources Research Institutes was also proposed to be eliminated, but $6.5 million was provided in FY2006. Additionally, a new line item called Enterprise Information was proposed to consolidate USGS information needs, with $47.1 million provided in P.L. 109-54. The Enterprise Information program within USGS consists of three primary programs: Enterprise Information Security and Technology, Enterprise Information Resources, and Federal Geographic Data Coordination. It aims to support telecommunications, information management, and geospatial data coordination through the Federal Geographic Data Committee. The National Mapping Program aims to provide high-quality geospatial information to the public. In FY2006, $131.2 million was provided, with an increase of $11.7 million to support land remote sensing archives. The USGS sought $6.0 million for the Landsat Program to address a funding shortfall in Landsat 7, a satellite used for environmental monitoring. The Landsat 7 Satellite data showed signs of degradation, but still considered cost-effective for environmental monitoring. The House Appropriations Committee commended the Administration for proposing to continue Landsat operations, while the Senate proposed a $6.0 million reduction. The Senate expressed concerns about the program's plan, stating it resembled previous recommendations for subsidizing current operations. The Committee requested more explanation from USGS and DOI regarding a proposal before considering the Administration's request for FY2006 Interior bill. P.L. 109-54 allocated $238.8 million for Geologic Hazards, Resources, and Processes activities, $9.6 million above FY2005 levels. Funding for Resource Assessments was $77.7 million, despite the Administration seeking a $28.3 million reduction. Both House and Senate bills aimed to restore funding for this program. Proposed cuts in the mineral resources program would halt basic data collection. The proposed cuts in the mineral resources program would terminate the collection of basic geologic and mineral deposit data for the nation, the global mineral resource assessment, and many mineral commodity reports. The Administration had sought approximately $25 million to continue funding minerals surveys and studies relevant to federal land management, regulatory, and remediation activities. The House Appropriations Committee emphasized the importance of minerals to the U.S. economy and stated that minerals resources research and assessments are a core responsibility of the USGS. The House Committee emphasized the importance of mineral resources research and assessments as a core responsibility of the USGS. Funding for Geologic Hazards Assessments program and Water Resources Investigations increased in FY2006, reflecting a focus on monitoring natural hazards and mitigating their effects. The Hydrologic Monitoring, Assessments, and Research activity also received increased funding. The Administration sought to discontinue USGS support for Water Resources Research Institutes. The Administration sought to discontinue USGS support for Water Resources Research Institutes, despite Congress providing funding for the institutes from FY2002 to FY2005. The National Assessment of Water Availability and Use program aims to better understand the nation's water resources, with a pilot study in the Great Lakes Basin in FY2005 and plans to extend to the western United States in FY2006. The House Appropriations Committee expects USGS to continue and expand water resources projects, while also utilizing private sector services when feasible. The Biological Research Program under USGS focuses on conservation and management of biological resources, with funding of $177.5 million for FY2006. The FY2006 funding for Biological Research under USGS is $4.6 million above the requested amount, with increases for deepwater fisheries, freshwater fisheries, and invasive species control. Conference managers allocated funds for the invasive species initiative, leafy spurge eradication, and surveying efforts for the ivory-billed woodpecker population range. The National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) lacks a coordinated budgetary and programmatic plan for expansion. Funding for Science Support in FY2006 was $70.3 million, an increase from FY2005. Facilities received $96.2 million, exceeding the Administration's request. For more information on the U.S. Geological Survey, visit http://www.usgs.gov/. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) administers two programs: the Offshore Minerals Management (OMM) Program and the Minerals Revenue Management (MRM) Program. OMM oversees leasing on Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) lands and production of offshore oil, gas, and minerals. MRM collects and disburses revenue from federal onshore and OCS leases. Revenues are distributed to states, the U.S. Treasury, and designated programs. The MMS estimates collecting over $6 billion annually, fluctuating based on oil and gas prices. The Administration's FY2006 total MMS budget was $290.2 million, with $7.0 million for Oil Spill Research and $283.1 million for Royalty and Offshore Minerals Management. The budget included $148.3 million for OMM, $87.3 million for MRM, and $47.5 million for general administration. The total budget reflected $167.4 million in appropriations and an additional $122.7 million from offsetting collections. This was a 5% increase from FY2005, with a proposed 4% reduction in appropriations for FY2006. The Administration proposed a 4% reduction in FY2006 appropriations for MMS programs, from $173.8 million in FY2005 to $167.4 million. The House-passed version included $282.4 million for MMS programs, with differences in Royalty Management programs. The Senate-passed version allocated $282.2 million for MMS programs and funded the CAM initiative at $43.1 million. The Senate bill funded MMS programs at or near requested levels, settling on a total budget of $283.4 million. This included allocations for OMM, MRM, General Administration, and oil spill research. The FY2006 appropriation was 8% lower than FY2005 levels, with issues not directly tied to funding accounts also considered. Oil and gas development moratoria have been in place since 1982. Oil and gas development moratoria in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) have been in place since 1982. The FY2006 appropriations law retained the moratorium on funding preleasing and leasing activities in the Eastern GOM. Sales in the Eastern GOM have been controversial, with industry groups advocating for more sales due to significant resource potential, while environmental groups and some state officials raise concerns about the risks of development to the environment and local economies. The FY2006 appropriations law continued leasing moratoria in various areas, including the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts. There is industry interest in opening the North Aleutian Basin Planning Area to oil and gas development to offset the fishing industry decline in Bristol Bay, but environmentalists oppose this. The area is not in the current five-year leasing plan. The Secretary of the Interior submits a five-year leasing plan under the OCSLA. Industry groups seek legislation for natural gas drilling in areas under moratoria, allowing state governors to veto proposals within 60 miles of their shores. Amendments to lift moratoria in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico were withdrawn during the FY2006 House Appropriations Committee markup. The House floor saw attempts to lift moratoria on natural gas drilling in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, but faced challenges due to legislative issues. Offshore oil and gas leasing in California remains contentious, with conflicts over consistency with state coastal zone management plans. In June 2001, the U.S. Court for the Northern District of California struck down MMS suspensions, which the Bush Administration appealed to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. A three-judge panel upheld the District Court decision in December 2002. The Department of the Interior is working with lessees to resolve the issue, while a breach-of-contract lawsuit by nine oil companies seeking $1.2 billion is pending. Several oil and gas lessees submitted new suspension requests to prevent lease termination. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) has conducted environmental assessments for Suspension of Production or Operations applications, finding no significant impact. A consistency review with the state will precede any decision on the requests. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 established the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement to ensure coal-mined land is restored. The Act also created an Abandoned Mine Lands fund for reclamation of abandoned sites. For more information on MMS, visit http://www.mms.gov. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 established the Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) fund for reclaiming hazardous abandoned sites. States and tribes develop their own regulatory programs with minimum standards. Fee collections are divided into federal and state shares, with grants awarded based on a distribution formula. Some states seek increased AML appropriations due to unappropriated balances exceeding $1 billion. The total unappropriated balance in the AML fund was nearly $1.7 billion by the end of FY2004. Western states are critical of the AML program due to disproportionate burden of reclamation costs. Legislation was introduced in Congress to address state concerns, but no resolution was reached. A short-term extension was added until May 31, 2005. The AML program's authorization for fee collection was extended multiple times, with the FY2005 and FY2006 appropriations bills extending it to June 2005 and June 2006 respectively. The program's restructuring proposal was included in the FY2005 budget request. In 2006, the FY2005 budget request for the AML fund was $243.9 million, but the final appropriation was $188.2 million. The FY2006 request also aimed to return unobligated state-share balances to the states, totaling $58.0 million. However, this request was rejected by both the House and Senate. The House and Senate agreed on the $188.0 million appropriation for the AML fund. The OSM budget for regulation and technology programs was $108.4 million in FY2005, increasing to $110.5 million in FY2006. The FY2006 request included $10.0 million for the Appalachian Clean Streams Initiative, which was retained in the appropriations law. The Administration requested $356.5 million for OSM in FY2006, but the enacted total was $298.5 million. Additionally, $1.5 million was requested for minimum program states with significant AML problems. The AML fund provides grants to states with significant AML problems, but low coal production. Minimum funding for these states was increased to $2.0 million in 1992, but Congress has only appropriated $1.5 million since FY1996. The Administration requested $2.0 million for FY2005, but it was reduced to $1.5 million for FY2006. Additionally, there was a provision for a $10.0 million allocation for the Small Operators Assistance Program, but no appropriation was made for FY2006. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) provides various services to federally-recognized tribes, including government operations, law enforcement, education, and economic development. BIA's FY2005 direct appropriations were $2.30 billion, with no allocation for FY2006. For more information, visit http://www.osmre.gov/osm.htm. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) FY2005 direct appropriations were $2.30 billion. For FY2006, the Administration proposed $2.19 billion, the House approved $2.32 billion, and the Senate approved $2.27 billion. Congress enacted an FY2006 total of $2.31 billion. Key issues for the BIA include reorganization. The BIA is facing key issues related to the reorganization of the Bureau, particularly in trust asset management functions and problems in the BIA school system. Secretary of the Interior Norton initiated a reorganization in April 2003, which includes the Office of Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs (AS-IA) and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST). This reorganization is linked to trust funds and assets management, aiming to reform and improve trust management responsibilities historically held by the BIA. Trust assets encompass tribal and individual trust funds, trust lands, and their economic resources, covering approximately 45 million acres of tribal trust land and 10 million acres of individual Indian land. The BIA has faced criticism for mismanaging Indian trust funds and assets, leading to a trust reform act in 1994 and a court case in 1996. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians was created in 1994 to oversee trust management reform, with trust fund management transferred to the OST from the BIA in 1996. Trust assets management includes real estate services, transactions processing, surveys, appraisals, probate functions, and land title records activities. The BIA faced criticism for mismanaging Indian trust funds, leading to trust reform in 1994. The OST took over trust fund management from the BIA in 1996. Efforts at trust management reform in the 1990s were unsuccessful, leading to a contract with a management consultant firm in 2001. DOI announced a reorganization plan in 2002, involving improvements in trust management and DOI agency restructuring. The current reorganization plan focuses on trust management structures and functions, expected to be completed in FY2005. The BIA's trust operations are split off from other services under a reorganization plan. The OST adds trust officers to oversee trust management. Certain tribes excluded from the reorganization due to pilot projects. A separate trust management improvement project is being implemented to enhance trust asset systems and reduce backlogs. The court case in 2001 led to a shutdown of BIA's World-Wide-Web connections. Many tribes criticize the reorganization, stating it is premature and lacks clarity on new OST duties. Congress excluded certain tribes from the reorganization for FY2004-FY2006 but did not suspend it. The BIA funds 185 elementary and secondary schools, with over 2,000 structures, educating about 48,000 students in 23 states. Tribes operate 120 of these institutions, with key problems being low student achievement and inadequate school facilities. Congress reduced the administrative cost fund for tribal school boards from $986,000 to $500,000 in FY2006. The FY2006 proposal reduced the education construction fund to $500,000, with many old and dilapidated BIA school facilities having health and safety deficiencies. The BIA prioritizes replacing or repairing schools based on lists, with a current backlog of $942 million for facility repairs. The Administration proposed reducing the FY2006 appropriation for education construction by $89.5 million, including a significant cut for replacement-school construction. The Administration proposed a reduction in education construction funding for FY2006, leading to disagreements with Congress. Congress partially restored the cuts, but still reduced total education construction by $53.5 million and replacement-school construction by $40.1 million from the previous year. A provision was included in the FY2005 appropriations act allowing the BIA to take over management of school construction projects under tribal self-determination contracts if construction did not begin within 18 months of funding availability, a provision retained for FY2006. Some tribes feel that construction appropriations are not meeting their needs quickly enough. In response to tribes' concerns about slow reduction in construction needs, Congress authorized a demonstration program in FY2001-FY2005 for tribes to help fund BIA-funded schools. The program was funded at $12.3 million in FY2005 for three projects. However, the Administration proposed no funding for the program in FY2006. The Office of Insular Affairs provides financial assistance to four insular areas and three former territories. For more information on BIA education programs, visit http://www.oiep.bia.edu. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) manages relations between various jurisdictions and the federal government, providing financial assistance to insular areas and former territories. The total funding request for FY2006 was $392 million, with $345.5 million mandated through statutes. $343 million in permanent funding would be provided, including assistance to three freely associated states under Compacts of Free Association. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) manages financial assistance to insular areas and former territories. The budget includes $115 million for U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam, and $30 million annually for American Samoa, Guam, CNMI, or Hawaii for various services. The OIA budget consists of discretionary and mandatory funds, with two accounts - Assistance to Territories (AT) and Compact of Free Association (CFA) providing grants and federal assistance. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) manages financial assistance to insular areas and former territories through two accounts - Assistance to Territories (AT) and Compact of Free Association (CFA). The FY2006 budget allocated $82.2 million, with $76.9 million for AT and $5.4 million for CFA. Funding for the territories and OIA has seen little debate in recent years. For more information, visit the Insular Affairs website. For FY2006, Congress enacted $236.0 million for Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT), an increase over the FY2005 level. The Administration had recommended cutting PILT funding, but the House agreed to increase it by $12.0 million to support local governments in providing vital services. The House rejected amendments to increase PILT funding, citing concerns about overall bill funding and impact on DOI programs. A Senate amendment to raise PILT funding to $242.0 million was withdrawn. The PILT program compensates local governments for federal land within their jurisdictions, totaling over $3 billion in payments since 1976. Since its inception in 1976, the PILT program has paid out over $3 billion. However, there have been controversies due to funding levels falling short of authorized amounts in recent years. County governments argue that rural areas need more PILT funds to provide essential services. The program was shifted from the BLM to Departmental Offices in DOI in FY2004 to include payments for lands managed by other federal agencies. For more information, visit the BLM website at http://www.doi.gov/pilt/. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) oversees the reform of Interior Department management of Indian trust assets, managing Indian trust funds transferred from the BIA in 1996. Indian trust funds managed by the OST comprise tribal funds owned by about 300 tribes. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) manages tribal funds owned by about 300 tribes and Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts. The total asset value is approximately $3 billion for tribal funds and $400 million for IIM accounts. The funds include monies from various sources such as claims awards, settlements, and investment income. The FY2005 appropriation was $228.1 million, with a proposed increase to $303.9 million for FY2006. However, Congress approved $226.1 million for FY2006, a decrease from both the previous year and the Administration's proposal. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) is undergoing reorganization and historical accounting for tribal and IIM accounts. There is ongoing litigation related to these accounts. The reorganization includes the creation of OST field operations and the placement of fiduciary trust officers at BIA agency and regional offices. Many Indian tribes have raised concerns about the reorganization and have requested further consultation with Congress. The historical accounting effort aims to correct balances for tribal and IIM accounts, some of which date back to the 19th century. The Interior Department proposed a $335 million project in 2003 to reconcile IIM accounts, which is expected to be time-consuming due to the large number of accounts and missing documents. The Administration sought an increase in funding for historical accounting in FY2006, with $95.0 million allocated for IIM accounts and $40.0 million for tribal accounts. However, the House and Senate rejected the proposed increase and capped historical accounting funds for FY2006. The FY2006 historical accounting funds were capped at $58.0 million, with the House and Senate rejecting the proposed increase. Ongoing litigation and uncertainty were cited as reasons for not funding the Administration's full request. The Cobell v. Norton lawsuit filed in 1996 against the federal government by IIM account holders is related to many OST activities. The DOI estimated its proposed method for historical accounting would cost $335 million over five years and produce a total owed to IIM accounts in the low millions; plaintiffs' method estimated to produce a total owed to IIM accounts over $100 billion. In 2003, the district court rejected both proposed historical accounting plans and ordered DOI to account for all trust fund and asset transactions since 1887 without using statistical sampling. The Interior Department estimated that the court's choice for historical accounting would cost $6-12 billion. Congress enacted a provision in the FY2004 Interior appropriations act to delay the historical accounting until specific obligations were delineated by Congress or December 31, 2004. The DOI appealed the court's order, which was temporarily stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Mediation between IIM plaintiffs and the federal government began on April 5, 2004. No bill was introduced in the 108th Congress to address the historical accounting issue. On December 10, 2004, the Appeals Court overturned much of the September 25 order regarding the government's historical accounting obligation. The district court issued a new order on February 23, 2005, similar to the 2003 order, requiring a comprehensive accounting since 1887 without statistical sampling. The DOI estimated compliance would cost $12-13 billion and appealed the order, but the district court did not stay it, keeping deadlines in effect. During the appeal, DOI must meet various deadlines. Congress is concerned about the costs of the Cobell lawsuit, including a potential $12-13 billion for historical accounting, a settlement amounting to the same, and over $100 billion estimated by Cobell plaintiffs. Funding sources for these costs were discussed in a recent House hearing. Costs discussed in a recent House hearing include discretionary appropriations and the Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund.\" Some senior appropriators find the Fund insufficient for a $6-$13 billion settlement. Congress may await court action, enact a delay to the accounting, or take other actions like directing a settlement. The House Appropriations Committee rejects the idea of ordering a historical accounting on the scale of that ordered by the district court in the 1994 Act. A settlement bill (S. 1439) is being considered. A settlement bill (S. 1439) has been introduced and received hearings for a legislative solution to the Indian Trust Fund Litigation. The National Indian Gaming Commission oversees tribal regulation of gaming operations. Funding adequacy for NIGC is a primary appropriations issue. For more information, visit the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians website. The NIGC's funding is a primary appropriations issue, with its budget mainly funded by fees from tribes' gaming operations. The NIGC has requested increased funding due to higher demand for oversight resources. Congress temporarily increased the fee ceiling to $12 million for FY2004-FY2006, and extended it through FY2007. The Administration proposed amending IGRA to create an adjustable fee ceiling based on a formula. The Administration proposed amending IGRA to create an adjustable, formula-based fee ceiling for NIGC funding, which was not supported by gaming tribes. Congress did not agree to the proposed amendment in FY2005 or FY2006 appropriations laws. NIGC activities have been funded solely from fees during FY1999-FY2005, with no direct appropriations. The Administration did not propose a direct appropriation for NIGC in FY2006, and Congress did not consider one. The National Indian Gaming Commission's funding was moved to the jurisdiction of the Interior subcommittees in the 109th Congress. EPA's responsibilities have expanded since its establishment in 1970, including regulating air and water quality, pesticides, toxic substances, waste management, and environmental cleanup. EPA also provides grants to assist state, tribal, and local areas in environmental control. For more information on the National Indian Gaming Commission, visit http://www.nigc.gov/nigc/index.jsp. The EPA's appropriation has increased from $1.0 billion in FY1970 to $8.03 billion in FY2005. For FY2006, P.L. 109-54 provided $7.81 billion for EPA, with $80.0 million rescinded from past fiscal year appropriations, resulting in a net appropriation of $7.73 million. The rescinded funds are taken from grants, contracts, and interagency agreements for various program activities. This provision applies to all EPA appropriations accounts. The provision applies to all EPA appropriations accounts. P.L. 109-54 did not specify redirecting rescinded funds for specific EPA activities in FY2006. Significant increases were included in some activities and programs within each EPA appropriations account in P.L. 109-54, while calling for decreases in other areas compared to the President's FY2006 request and FY2005 appropriations. In FY2006, EPA's annual appropriation was enacted through various line-item accounts, including Science and Technology, Environmental Programs, Inspector General, Buildings, Superfund, Tank Program, Oil Spill Response, and State/Tribal Grants. Funding debates focused on water infrastructure, hazardous waste cleanup, Brownfields program, homeland security, and congressional earmarks. In FY2006, EPA's funding debates included water infrastructure projects, hazardous waste cleanup, Brownfields program, homeland security activities, congressional earmarks, intentional human dosing studies, and Clean Air Act provisions. The appropriations for water infrastructure projects were allocated within EPA's STAG account, with varying amounts provided by different bills and the President's request. In FY2006, Congress provided $850.0 million for the drinking water State Revolving Fund (SRF), the same as the House- and Senate-passed bills and the President's FY2006 request. This funding, along with previous appropriations, supports state loans for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. Disagreement exists over reducing funding for the clean water SRF, with Congress allocating more than the Administration's requests in recent years. Funding for the drinking water SRF has seen less disagreement, although some Members advocate for higher funding to address local needs. In FY2006, Congress provided $850.0 million for the drinking water State Revolving Fund (SRF) to support state loans for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. Amendments to increase funding for the clean water SRF were offered but not adopted, with the Senate recommending $1.35 billion for the clean water SRF in FY2006. The final FY2006 budget resolution approved $1.1 billion for the clean water SRF. In FY2006, Congress approved $1.1 billion for the clean water State Revolving Fund (SRF) in passing H.R. 2361. Funding for individual projects has been reduced below FY2005 levels, with allocations of $33.3 million for research/congressional priorities and $50.5 million for environmental protection/congressional priorities. The House and Senate had differing amounts allocated for these accounts. In FY2006, Congress allocated $200.0 million for special project grants in the STAG account, following differing amounts in the House and Senate bills. Funding for congressional priority projects in the S&T and EPM accounts was not included in the President's FY2006 request. The conferees did not agree to competitive solicitation for these projects, instead designating funding for specified projects or locations within the accounts. The STAG infrastructure grants/congressional priorities include wastewater, drinking water, and storm water projects funded through SRFs. Congress designated $309.5 million for specified projects in FY2005, but the President's FY2006 budget did not include funding for these projects. Debate surrounds whether SRF loan monies or grant assistance should be used to meet these needs. Earmarked funding has been awarded noncompetitively as grants requiring matching funds but not repayment. The House Appropriations Committee did not allocate $200.0 million for specific community projects in its FY2006 bill, stating that the allocation would be determined later in conference. The Senate-passed bill designated the $200.0 million for specific projects. The conference report specified individual projects for the allocation of the funds appropriated in P.L. 109-54 for FY2006, supporting EPA's homeland security activities in various areas. In P.L. 109-54, $130.1 million was allocated for EPA's homeland security activities, the same as proposed in the House-passed bill. The Senate-passed bill would have provided $116.0 million, while the President's FY2006 request included $184.6 million. Reductions in funds were seen in the S&T and Superfund accounts. $1.22 billion was provided for the Hazardous Substance Superfund account after transfers to other accounts. The President's FY2006 request included $1.24 billion for the Superfund program, with Congress appropriating $1.20 billion for FY2005. Funding adequacy for the program is a key issue, with debates on the pace of cleanup and funding sources. An amendment to allocate an additional $130.0 million from the S&T account was not adopted. The ongoing debate includes whether the program should be funded by general Treasury revenues or a reinstated industry tax. The Superfund program funding in P.L. 109-54 comes from general Treasury revenues, sparking debate on the \"polluter pays\" principle. EPA states responsible parties cover cleanup costs at over 70% of sites. $165.0 million was allocated for EPA's Brownfields Program in FY2006, with differing amounts proposed in House and Senate bills. The Brownfields Program received $165.0 million in FY2006 for assessment, cleanup, and redevelopment of abandoned commercial and industrial sites. Congress has interest in EPA's policies on human dosing studies for pesticides, with a provision in P.L. 109-54 prohibiting the use of such studies until relevant final rulemaking is issued. The provision in P.L. 109-54 prohibits EPA from conducting human dosing studies for pesticides until final rulemaking is issued. The rule must not involve pregnant women, infants, or children as subjects and must align with NAS 2004 recommendations and Nuremberg Code principles. Some argue that human dosing studies provide valuable scientific evidence, while others call for strict regulations. Some advocate for strict safeguards in human dosing studies to protect participants' health, while others call for further evaluation to ensure all alternatives are exhausted. Interest in funding for air quality programs has increased due to EPA's actions under the Clean Air Act and efforts to address climate change. Key air quality issues include new ambient air quality standards, reducing human exposure to mercury, and controlling emissions. The Clean Air Act has led to proposed regulations and legislation for emissions control from various sources. Funding of $528.1 million was allocated for air quality programs in FY2006, supporting research, monitoring, and implementation activities. An additional $249.2 million was provided for grants to support state, local, and tribal air quality management. Comparatively, in FY2005, a total of $506.8 million was appropriated for similar programs. In FY2005, Congress appropriated $506.8 million for air quality programs, with $248.3 million in the STAG account. An administrative provision in P.L. 109-54 would impact an EPA regulation on small engine emissions, prohibiting the use of FY2006 funds until a safety study is completed. This provision does not affect existing state standards. The small engine issue was not addressed in the House-passed bill. The Environmental Protection Agency's budget for FY2006 was discussed in various reports, including appropriations for the Forest Service. The FY2006 Interior Appropriations Act provided $4.26 billion for the Forest Service, which was $547.1 million less than the previous year. Title V of the act focused on the Forest Service Facility Realignment and Enhancement Act of 2005. The Forest Service Facility Realignment and Enhancement Act of 2005 authorizes the FS to dispose of \"administrative sites\" by sale, lease, or exchange at fair market value. Receipts would be used for acquiring, improving, or maintaining facilities within the National Forest System. Amendments affecting FS programs were considered in Congress, including a decline in funding for the National Forest System and a proposed prohibition on funds for forest development roads in the Tongass National Forest. The Senate considered amendments related to forest management, including one to prohibit timber road construction in the Tongass National Forest, which was defeated. The conference report directed a study on the Biscuit fire recovery issue. Fire funding and protection programs remain controversial, with debates on funding levels and strategies like thinning and prescribed burning. The National Fire Plan focuses on fuel reduction activities, environmental analysis, public involvement, and challenges to decisions. Total FY2006 funding was $2.56 billion, $76.7 million more than requested, and $413.2 million less than appropriated for FY2005. Funding for the National Fire Plan is not centralized in Interior appropriations acts but can be derived by combining accounts identified by agencies. The FY2006 funding for BLM wildfire was $766.6 million, exceeding the request but less than FY2005. The FS received $1.82 billion for FY2006, including $286.0 million for fuel reduction. Lower funding was due to emergency funding in FY2005. Both agencies' wildfire budgets cover fire suppression, preparedness, and other operations. The FY2006 wildfire suppression funding totaled $934.7 million, equal to the request and less than FY2005, with a greater decrease for the FS (35%) than the BLM (26%). The agencies can borrow funds from other accounts for firefighting during worse-than-average fire seasons, repaid through emergency appropriations bills. The FY2006 wildfire suppression funding totaled $934.7 million, equal to the request and less than FY2005, with a greater decrease for the FS (35%) than the BLM (26%). Such borrowing is repaid through emergency appropriations bills. The act provided $948.9 million for fire preparedness for FY2006, more than the FY2005 appropriation. The Administration's request and enacted increase were for the BLM. The act contained $701.9 million for other fire operations, more than the request and FY2005 appropriation. Fuel reduction funding was approved at $497.2 million, $5.0 million more than the request, and $33.3 million more than for FY2005. The FY2006 Interior Appropriations Act allocated $283.6 million for State and Private Forestry programs, which was more than the Senate, House, and requested levels but less than FY2005. $5.0 million of FS fuel reduction funding was designated for community fire protection, and an additional $5.0 million could be used to promote biomass fuel use. The act also shifted funds among forest health management, cooperative fire assistance, cooperative forestry, and international programs compared to the initial request. The FY2006 Interior Appropriations Act provided $101.9 million for forest health management, matching FY2005 funding and exceeding the Administration's request. Additionally, $39.4 million was allocated for S&PF Cooperative Fire Assistance, a 47% increase from the request. In FY2006, funding for forest health management matched FY2005 levels at $101.9 million, exceeding the Administration's request. Assistance to volunteer fire departments differed by less than 2%, with a funding of $54.4 million, 46% more than the request. Cooperative Forestry received $135.3 million, Forest Legacy was allocated $57.4 million, and Forest Stewardship received $34.7 million. Urban and Community Forestry also received financial and technical assistance. In FY2006, funding for forest health management matched FY2005 levels at $101.9 million, exceeding the Administration's request. Urban and Community Forestry received $28.9 million, more than the request but less than FY2005. Resource inventory was funded at the requested level. The Economic Action Program received $9.7 million, substantially below FY2005 funding. International programs received $7.0 million, more than requested. Total FS Capital Improvement and Maintenance funding for FY2006 was $441.2 million, 25% below total FY2005 funding. In FY2006, funding for forest health management matched FY2005 levels at $101.9 million, exceeding the Administration's request. The primary difference from the regular FY2005 funding was the decline in funds for constructing and maintaining facilities. The FY2006 funds were 36% below regular FY2005 funds for facilities, and nearly matched regular FY2005 funds for roads and trails. The act also included $13.0 million for infrastructure improvement to reduce the agency's backlog of deferred maintenance. In FY2006, funding for forest health management matched FY2005 levels at $101.9 million, exceeding the Administration's request. The FY2006 Interior appropriations act included $283.1 million for FS research, $6.7 million more than FY2005; fire research funding in the National Fire Plan was approved at $31.2 million, $1.6 million more than FY2005. National Forest System funding was supported at $1.42 billion, $31.4 million more than the FY2005 level. In FY2006, National Forest System funding was supported at $1.42 billion, $31.4 million more than the FY2005 level. Changes in NFS funding from FY2005 were relatively modest, except for minerals and geology management which rose by $30.1 million, 54%.

The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides medical and environmental health services for 1.8 million American Indians and Alaska Natives from 561 federally recognized tribes in 35 states. Services are delivered through federal, tribal, and urban Indian-operated programs and facilities, including hospitals, health centers, and residential treatment centers. In FY2006, IHS received a $3.09 billion appropriation, a 4% increase from FY2005. The FY2006 IHS appropriation was $3.09 billion, a 4% increase from FY2005. 88% of the funding is allocated for health services and 12% for health facilities. Reimbursements from private health insurance and federal programs are expected to increase from $598.7 million in FY2005 to $648.2 million in FY2006. In FY2006, the IHS Health Services budget was $2.73 billion, a 5% increase from FY2005. The clinical services budget, which includes primary care at IHS and tribally run hospitals and clinics, was $2.21 billion, with hospital and health clinic programs making up 62% of the budget. Dental programs received $119.5 million, mental health programs $59.3 million, and alcohol and substance abuse programs $145.3 million in FY2006. In FY2006, the IHS Health Services budget was $2.73 billion, with clinical services budget at $2.21 billion. Dental programs received $119.5 million, mental health programs $59.3 million, alcohol and substance abuse programs $145.3 million. Contract care budget increased to $507.0 million, preventive health services received $118.9 million, including funding for public health nursing, health education, immunizations in Alaska, and the community health representatives program. The FY2006 budget for IHS Health Services was $2.73 billion, with $404.7 million allocated for other health services, including $268.7 million for contract support costs. Funding also included $31.5 million for health-care scholarships, $2.4 million for tribal management grants, $33.2 million for urban Indian health, $63.1 million for direct operations, and $5.8 million for self-governance. The FY2006 budget for IHS Health Services included $404.7 million for other health services, $268.7 million for contract support costs, $31.5 million for health-care scholarships, $2.4 million for tribal management grants, $33.2 million for urban Indian health, $63.1 million for direct operations, and $5.8 million for self-governance. The conference agreement allocated $358.5 million for facilities, with $38.3 million designated for specific projects. The FY2006 budget for IHS Health Services allocated funds for various facilities including Barrow Hospital, AK ($8.0 million), Fort Belknap, MT staff quarters ($3.3 million), Kayenta, AZ Health Center ($3.9 million), mobile dental units ($2.0 million), Phoenix Indian Medical Center, AZ ($8.0 million), San Carlos, AZ Health Center ($6.1 million), and small ambulatory centers ($7.0 million). The appropriations law also mentioned replacing a health facility in Nome, Alaska. Congress emphasized the need for more aggressive proposals for health facility construction in future budgets. Indians have a high rate of Type 2 diabetes, with mortality 4.3 times higher than the general U.S. population. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created programs for diabetes in Indian populations. The IHS Special Diabetes Program for Indians and the NIH Special Research Program for Type 1 Diabetes received funding from the SCHIP appropriation, with $30 million allocated to each program annually. The Benefits Improvement and Protection Act increased funding for these programs to $100 million each for FY2001, FY2002, and FY2003, with $30 million from SCHIP and $70 million from the general Treasury in the first two years. Funding was extended through December 2002. In December 2002, Congress extended funding for special diabetes programs through amendments to the Public Health Service Act, authorizing $150 million annually for FY2004 through FY2008. The funding is separate from regular IHS and NIH appropriations and is distributed to communities based on disease burden, active users of IHS services, and tribal size adjustment. The funding is used for prevention services, as reported in a December 2004 Interim Report to Congress. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) was created to resolve a dispute between the Hopi and Navajo tribes over lands originally set aside for a reservation in 1882. Pursuant to a 1974 act, the lands were partitioned between the two tribes, with relocation of tribe members living on the other tribe's land being voluntary. ONHIR's main activities include land and housing acquisition, infrastructure development, and providing new homes at federal expense. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) is involved in land and housing acquisition, infrastructure development, and providing support for families being relocated. Congress has expressed concerns about the speed of the relocation process and avoiding forced relocations. ONHIR's funding for FY2005 was reduced by 63% to $4.9 million, with an estimated $18.9 million in carryover funds to be used. The Administration proposed a 74% increase in funding for FY2006, which was approved by Congress. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) received increased funding for FY2006, approved by Congress. The relocation process, which began in 1977, is not yet complete, with a backlog of relocatees awaiting replacement homes. Most families subject to relocation were Navajo, with only 26 eligible Hopi families living on Navajo partitioned land. About 250 Navajo families signed \"accommodation agreements\" in the late 1990s, allowing them to stay on Hopi land under Hopi law. By the end of FY2004, 100% of families on Navajo partitioned land were relocated to replacement homes. 96% of Navajo families have completed relocation, with 130 families still awaiting relocation. Of the 130 families, 119 are not currently residing on Hopi partitioned land and are in various stages of acquiring replacement housing. Eleven Navajo families are still residing on Hopi land, with three families seeking homes and eight families refusing to relocate. Negotiations are ongoing with the Hopi Tribe to allow the eight families to stay on Hopi land as autonomous families. ONHIR estimated in its FY2006 budget that relocation moves for eligible families will be completed by the end of FY2006. The addition of Navajo families opting out or filing late appeals would delay completion until FY2008. Post-move assistance would require two more years of expenditures. ONHIR contends that the government could face litigation if 210 families are not accommodated. Legislation has been introduced to sunset ONHIR in 2008 and transfer duties to the Secretary of the Interior. A proviso prohibits ONHIR from evicting Navajo families without providing replacement homes, but forced eviction may become an issue in the future. The Hopi Tribe has a right to take legal action against the United States for not providing \"quiet possession\" of all Hopi partitioned lands. The Smithsonian Institution is a federally funded museum and research complex with numerous facilities across the United States and worldwide. In FY2006, Congress allocated $624.3 million for the Smithsonian Institution, with $524.3 million for Salaries and Expenses and $100.0 million for Facilities Capital. This included funding for administration, program support, outreach, and facilities services. The amount for Facilities Capital was reduced compared to FY2005 due to the completion of the Patent Office Building renovation. The FY2006 appropriations allocated $18.1 million for revitalization, $8.0 million for facilities planning and design, and $30.5 million for operating resources for the National Museum of the American Indian. The total construction cost for the NMAI was $219.3 million, with the groundbreaking ceremony in 1999 and the grand opening in 2004. Other groups, like Latinos, are also seeking museum space on the Mall, including the new National Museum of African American History and Culture. The National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) has been authorized within the Smithsonian Institution through P.L. 108-184. Congress allocated $3.9 million for the NMAAHC in FY2006, with plans to cover operating costs and personnel for planning and fundraising. The museum will focus on African American historical and cultural material, including periods such as slavery, Reconstruction, the Harlem Renaissance, and the civil rights movement. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed support for the museum and intends to meet future funding requests. The National Museum of the American Indian's opening raises concerns about space for the NMAAHC on the Mall. The House Appropriations Committee requires consultation for Smithsonian's building purchases. FY2006 appropriations law allocated $20.2 million for National Zoo expenses, addressing public and congressional concerns. The Smithsonian has a plan to revitalize the zoo for public safety and animal health. The Administration's FY2006 request allocated $13.0 million for the revitalization of the National Zoo, including renovation of the bird exhibit, new roofs and facades at Rock Creek, and upgrades to critical infrastructure. Construction projects, such as the new elephant yard (Asia II), aim to meet Department of Agriculture and American Zoo and Aquarium Association standards. The House redirected $8 million from the wetland exhibit to Asia II. The Senate-passed bill allocated $13.0 million for the National Zoo's facilities capital projects. The FY2006 appropriations law specified that funds could not be used for the Holt House unless to minimize water damage. The Smithsonian Institution receives income from trust funds for program expansion, including general trust funds, private contributions, and government grants. The Smithsonian Institution receives income from various sources including general trust funds, private donor-designated funds, and government grants and contracts. Concerns have been raised about the control the institution has over donor-designated funds, which may impose restrictions on the use of funding, such as renaming buildings for donors. The Smithsonian Institution receives income from various sources including general trust funds, private donor-designated funds, and government grants and contracts. There is debate over whether companies advertising at cultural events might compromise the institution's integrity. Congress has considered these issues in recent appropriations debates. The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, which includes the NEA, NEH, and Institute of Museum and Library Services, operates on temporary authority since their authorization expired in FY1993. The Institute of Museum and Library Services and the Office of Museum Services were created by P.L. 104-208 and reauthorized by P.L. 108-81. They receive appropriations through acts for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies. Congress debates federal funding for arts and humanities, with opponents arguing for abolishing NEA and NEH, while proponents advocate for federal support citing a long tradition of cultural support. The government has a long tradition of supporting culture through programs like national touring theater and dance companies. Some in the private sector believe they cannot fill the funding gap left by abolishing NEA and NEH. NEA has provided over 120,000 grants to all states since 1965, with Congress allocating $126.3 million for NEA in FY2006. In FY2006, the NEA and NEH received a $5.0 million general increase in appropriations. The NEA's budget was set at $131.3 million and the NEH's at $143.1 million. $17.9 million, including $3.0 million from the general increase, was allocated for Challenge America grants. Additionally, $10.0 million was designated for the American Masterpieces program, with $2.0 million from the general increase. This program supports arts education, outreach, and community arts activities. The NEA and NEH received a $5.0 million increase in appropriations in FY2006. Concerns about previous questionable NEA grants have led to congressional support with restrictions on grants. NEA guidelines now specify funding priorities and restrictions on grants, limiting support for seasonal groups and individuals. The NEH focuses on humanities education, research, preservation, and public programs. The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) received $143.1 million in appropriations for FY2006, supporting various humanities programs and regional centers. NEH has provided around 61,000 grants since 1965, including a Challenge Grant program to match private donations. The FY2006 law allocated $15.4 million for matching grants, $127.6 million for grants and administration, and $11.2 million for the \"We the People\" initiative, focusing on improving humanities education in schools. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is authorized at $900 million annually through FY2015 for acquiring lands and funding recreational development by federal agencies and state/local governments. More information can be found on the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities websites. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is used for acquiring lands and funding recreational development by state and local governments through a grant program administered by the NPS. Congress has appropriated money from the LWCF for related activities that do not involve land acquisition, starting from FY1998. Total authorized amount for LWCF since FY1964 is $28.1 billion, with actual appropriations totaling $14.2 billion. Funding for federal land acquisition has generally increased in recent years. The funding from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) for federal land acquisition has fluctuated over the years. It increased significantly from $138.0 million in FY1996 to $453.2 million in FY2001, but then declined to $114.6 million in FY2006. The decrease in appropriations was due to differing spending priorities, views on fund usage, and concerns over the budget deficit. This reduction in funding for federal land acquisition and state grants was last seen in the early and mid-1990s as part of efforts to address the federal budget deficit. The federal budget deficit has drawn increased attention, with funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) declining from FY2002 to FY2006. The FY2006 budget allocation was $363.9 million, a decrease from previous years and the Administration's request. This decrease was attributed to the need to address the budget deficit and prioritize funding for national priorities, including the war on terrorism. The FY2006 budget recommendations aimed to stay within a constrained allocation, with new land acquisition being a low priority. The Senate initially provided more funding for federal land acquisition and stateside grants but less for other programs. A Senate amendment to reduce funds for land acquisition was rejected. The FY2006 appropriations law allocated $114.6 million for federal land acquisition, with an additional $9.9 million for the National Park Service from prior year balances. The FY2006 appropriations law allocated funds for federal land acquisition, with earmarked funds for specific acquisitions and a reduction in the stateside grant program compared to previous years. The House allocated $1.6 million for the administration of the stateside grant program in FY2006 but did not provide funding for new state grants. The Administration did not request funds for state grants, citing federal deficits and alternative funding sources for states. This decision to not fund state grants is not new, as previous administrations have also proposed eliminating funding for the stateside program. The largest appropriation for the LWCF in FY2006 was for programs other than land acquisition and stateside grants. The FY2006 appropriations law allocated $219.3 million for various programs, which was smaller than the Administration's request of $531.7 million for other programs. Congress provided some programs with non-LWCF funding, with the Senate initially approving $220.2 million and the House supporting $185.3 million. Congress created the Conservation Spending Category (CSC) in the FY2001 Interior appropriations law (P.L. 106-291) to combine funding for various resource protection programs, including the LWCF. The CSC was authorized for five years and would terminate at the end of FY2006 unless reauthorized. This was in response to the Clinton Administration's request for increased funding under the Lands Legacy Initiative and congressional interest in the Conservation and Reinvestment Act (CARA). Total spending for the CSC was set to increase each year. The FY2001 Interior appropriations law authorized an annual increase of $160.0 million for the Conservation Spending Category (CSC) from $1.6 billion in FY2001 to $2.4 billion in FY2006. The appropriations history through FY2006 shows funding exceeding targets in FY2001 and almost reaching targets in FY2002. The FY2003 request for the Interior portion was $1.67 billion, below the target of $1.92 billion. Congress appropriated $1.51 billion, with $1.03 billion for the Interior portion. The FY2004 request was $1.33 billion, below the target of $2.08 billion. The request for the Interior portion was $1.00 billion, with an alternative estimate increasing it to $1.22 billion. The FY2005 request was not specified. The FY2005 appropriation for the CSC was not specified in congressional documents. The Department of the Interior requested $1.05 billion for the CSC, an increase of $140 million from FY2004. The total appropriated amount for the CSC in FY2005 is unclear, with the House Appropriations Committee's report mentioning funding levels at $850 million below the target of $1.7 billion. Neither the Forest Service nor the Department of Commerce used the CSC for their funding requests. The FY2005 appropriation for the Conservation Spending Category (CSC) was not specified in congressional documents. The Senate Appropriations Committee's report discussed conservation funding but did not mention CSC. It appears that Congress is discontinuing the use of the CSC structure for appropriations decisions. In 1996, Congress authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to create a plan to restore the South Florida ecosystem, including the Everglades. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was completed in 1999, with federal involvement in ecosystem restoration authorized by Congress in the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. The Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (WRDA 2000, P.L. 106-541) is considered the seminal law for Everglades restoration, focusing on redirecting excess freshwater to restore the natural hydrological functions of the South Florida ecosystem. The federal government, along with state, local, and tribal entities, collaborates on restoration efforts, with the federal government responsible for half the cost of implementing CERP. The State of Florida, local tribes, and stakeholders, along with the federal government, collaborate on Everglades restoration through the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). CERP consists of 68 projects with an estimated total cost of $7.8 billion, with the federal share at $3.9 billion. WRDA 2000 authorizes $1.4 billion for initial projects under CERP, with funds allocated through various DOI agencies for restoration activities in southern Florida. Federal and state funding for Everglades restoration projects exceeded $2.3 billion and $3.6 billion respectively from FY1993-FY2005. The average annual federal cost for restoration activities in southern Florida is expected to be around $286 million per year for the next 10 years. The Administration requested $220.0 million for restoration efforts in the Everglades for FY2006, with $76.6 million allocated for CERP implementation. DOI requested $83.5 million for CERP and non-CERP activities related to restoration in the South Florida ecosystem for FY2006, with NPS requesting $62.7 million for land acquisition, construction, and research activities, and FWS requesting $12.5 million. For FY2006, the Department of the Interior (DOI) requested $8.6 million for activities authorized by CERP, with a total of $84.0 million provided for Everglades restoration. Specific funding for restoration projects was not specified in the law or conference report. Funding for Everglades restoration projects is typically not specified in legislation, with details often not known until after appropriations are enacted. P.L. 109-54 allocated $25.0 million for the Modified Water Deliveries project, with $17.0 million coming from unobligated balances. Additionally, $9.9 million was provided for planning and coordination by the National Park Service, but specific programs were not identified. The primary increase in funding for Everglades restoration for FY2006 compared to FY2005 was due to increased funding for the Modified Water Deliveries Project (Mod Waters) under NPS, with $25.0 million funded for construction\u2014an increase of approximately $17.0 million over the FY2005 enacted level. This project aims to improve water deliveries to Everglades National Park and restore natural hydrological conditions. The completion of this project is necessary before certain projects under CERP can be constructed. Additionally, the Corps requested $35.0 million for Mod Waters for FY2006, with future funding expected from 2007 to 2009. The federal government's commitment to Everglades restoration is a concern due to the lack of authorized projects since WRDA 2000. Observers question the level of commitment based on the frequency of authorized projects and appropriations. Some believe federal commitment will be evident through funding for construction once projects begin in the next few years. The federal government's commitment to Everglades restoration is a concern as projects move into construction. Some officials argue for increased federal funding over state funding. The House Appropriations Committee emphasizes the need to overcome challenges and achieve restoration goals, expressing concern that the restoration initiative may not be meeting the primary federal interest. Stakeholders are worried that the Acceler8 initiative in Florida is too focused on water storage projects that may not provide natural benefits. The House Appropriations Committee directed the Secretary of the Interior to submit a report on Everglades projects, focusing on anticipated environmental benefits and project implementation priorities. P.L. 109-54 conditioned funding for the Modified Water Deliveries Project on meeting state water quality standards. The EPA, Attorney General, and House and Senate Committees on Appropriations report that water entering the A.R.M. Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge and Everglades National Park does not meet state water quality standards. This is due to concerns about a Florida state law authorizing a new plan to mitigate phosphorus pollution in the Everglades, which is a primary cause of ecosystem degradation. Some Members of Congress disapproved of the Florida laws. Funding for the Modified Water Deliveries Project is conditioned on meeting state water quality standards. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concern over Florida's efforts to improve water quality in the Everglades, noting that state actions to reduce phosphorus have not been successful. The Committee directed the FWS to provide monitoring and modeling information in reports for the A.R.M. Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. For more information on Everglades Restoration, visit the websites of the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Program and the Corps of Engineers. Various CRS reports cover topics such as federal funding, water deliveries, phosphorus mitigation, and the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. The Bush Administration's Competitive Sourcing Initiative aims to save money through public-private competition in government activities. The Bush Administration's Competitive Sourcing Initiative, first outlined in 2001, aims to save money through competition between government and private businesses in areas like law enforcement, maintenance, and administration. Concerns have been raised about whether it would save money and if the private sector could provide the same quality of service. The FY2006 appropriations law placed caps on competitive sourcing studies for agencies funded by the Interior appropriations bill, including the National Park Service and the Forest Service. The FY2006 appropriations law placed caps on competitive sourcing activities at $3.0 million, with the Administration urging removal of funding limitations to improve program management. Agencies were required to report costs associated with sourcing studies. Language on this was removed during initial House floor consideration. The FY2006 appropriations law placed caps on competitive sourcing activities at $3.0 million. The law also contained Senate-passed language related to the effect of Forest Service competitive sourcing on wildland fire management activities. The Forest Service did not request funds for competitive sourcing studies in FY2006 but asked for the limitation on funding to be removed. The National Park Service requested $956,000 for competitive sourcing activities in FY2006. The NPS requested $956,000 for competitive sourcing activities in FY2006, similar to the previous year. They plan to examine 955 full-time equivalent positions through various studies.
