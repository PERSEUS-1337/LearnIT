    "content": "The \"Teague Grant Reauthorization Act\" is also known as the Act. It addresses the success of the Veterans' Administration Medical School Assistance and Health Manpower Training Act of 1972 in alleviating shortages of health care professionals. Congress finds a severe shortage of physicians and healthcare professionals in the US predicted for the next two decades, with up to 50,000 physicians shortage by 2010 and up to 200,000 by 2020. The Veterans' Administration Medical School Assistance and Health Manpower Training Act of 1972 helped prevent this shortage. The Veterans' Administration Medical School Assistance and Health Manpower Training Act of 1972 led to the establishment of five new medical schools in the United States, in partnership with the Department of Veterans Affairs. These partnerships not only prevented a predicted physician shortage but also improved physician education, medical research, and healthcare delivery. Congress recognizes the 30th anniversary of the Veterans' Administration Medical School Assistance and Health Manpower Training Act of 1972, acknowledging its role in addressing the shortage of physicians and healthcare professionals. Medical schools affiliated with veterans' health care facilities have provided valuable educational experiences for healthcare professionals and enhanced medical care for veterans and their families. The importance of partnerships between the Department of Veterans Affairs and medical schools affiliated with the Department is emphasized for continued growth. Section 8221 of title 38, United States Code, is amended to address shortfalls in the number of physicians and other health care professionals employed in the Veterans Health Administration. Grants under this subchapter shall be known as 'Teague Grants' in honor of the most-decorated veteran ever to have served in Congress, the Honorable Olin E. 'Tiger' Teague of Texas. Section 8222 of title 38, United States Code, is amended to authorize appropriations of $10,000,000 for fiscal years 2005 through 2009 for programs under this subchapter. Criteria for grants under section 8223 are amended to include increasing the number of medical or nursing students attending the school. The Secretary shall prioritize grant awards to medical schools under subchapter I based on demonstrated benefits to the Department and veterans' care."
