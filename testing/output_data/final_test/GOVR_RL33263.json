    "content": "Congress has historically debated the division of authority between federal and state governments regarding the nation's waterways. The concept of \"navigable waters\" has evolved over time, expanding to include waterways that could be made navigable with improvements. Despite this expansion, Congress felt that the term was too limited for the Clean Water Act of 1972. The Clean Water Act of 1972 expanded the definition of \"navigable waters\" to \"waters of the United States\" to prevent pollution. Section 404 required permits for discharging material into these waters, initially limited to traditionally navigable waters despite the broader definition. The Clean Water Act of 1972 broadened the definition of \"navigable waters\" to \"waters of the United States\" to prevent pollution. The Corps issued new regulations in 1975 that expanded the reach of wetlands under the Section 404 permit program, leading to a ongoing debate on which wetlands are included. Wetlands, found throughout the country, vary in physical characteristics and vegetation due to soil wetness. Some areas are constantly flooded, while others are not. Coastal areas experience daily flooding with tides. The Supreme Court upheld the Corps' extension of Section 404 jurisdiction to adjacent wetlands in Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc. v. United States in 1985. The Court reasoned that adjacent wetlands are inseparably bound up with \"waters of the United States\" due to the broad water-quality objectives of the Clean Water Act. The Supreme Court upheld the Corps' extension of Section 404 jurisdiction to adjacent wetlands in Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc. v. United States in 1985. The Court found that adjacent wetlands are inseparably bound up with \"waters of the United States\" due to the broad water-quality objectives of the Clean Water Act. In 2001, the Court revisited the geographic reach of Section 404 in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (SWANCC), focusing on the \"isolated waters\" component of the Corps' definition of \"waters of the United States.\" The Supreme Court ruled that the Migratory Bird Rule, which asserted jurisdiction over isolated waters based on potential use by migratory birds, was not authorized by the Clean Water Act. This decision also appeared to limit federal jurisdiction over isolated, nonnavigable waters under Section 404. The Supreme Court's ruling in SWANCC limited federal jurisdiction over isolated, nonnavigable, intrastate waters, leading to uncertainty regarding the Corps' jurisdiction. The concept of \"adjacent wetlands\" became crucial in the Rapanos decision, highlighting the need for clarity in Section 404 regulations. The Rapanos case involved the Corps' jurisdiction over wetlands adjacent to a tributary that flowed into a navigable water. The Sixth Circuit ruled that Section 404 reached the wetlands, emphasizing the issue of \"adjacent wetlands\" in defining \"waters of the United States.\" The Sixth Circuit ruled that immediate adjacency of wetlands to traditional navigable waters is not required for Section 404 jurisdiction. Instead, a \"significant nexus\" between the wetlands and navigable waters, established through a hydrological connection, suffices. The Rapanos wetlands had surface water connections to tributaries of navigable waters, meeting the criteria for Section 404 jurisdiction. The distance of the hydrological connection to traditional navigable waters did not affect the court's decision. The Sixth Circuit ruled that immediate adjacency of wetlands to traditional navigable waters is not required for Section 404 jurisdiction. Instead, a \"significant nexus\" between the wetlands and navigable waters, established through a hydrological connection, suffices. The Rapanos wetlands had surface water connections to tributaries of navigable waters, meeting the criteria for Section 404 jurisdiction. The distance of the hydrological connection to traditional navigable waters did not affect the court's decision. The circuit aligned itself with the majority of appellate courts in ruling that a surface water connection to a tributary of a navigable water was sufficient for jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. The court ruled that a manmade berm blocked surface water drainage to a tributary, disconnecting the wetlands from navigable waters. The \"tributary\" being a man-made ditch did not impact the case. The court affirmed that SWANCC only addressed \"isolated waters\" jurisdiction, not the broader \"adjacent wetlands\" authority. The Carabells questioned if Section 404 applies to wetlands isolated from \"waters of the United States.\" The Rapanos decision disappointed many waiting for clarification on \"waters of the United States.\" The Court split 4-1-4 on whether the Corps' 404 jurisdiction claims aligned with the CWA. Justice Scalia's plurality opinion found the Corps had overreached, leading to vacating and remanding the Sixth Circuit decisions. Justice Kennedy, in a separate concurrence, also disagreed with the Corps' interpretation but proposed a different approach. His vote supported vacating and remanding, making it the Court's judgment. The Supreme Court's decision in Rapanos led to a split among the Justices, with no single rationale commanding majority support. Lower courts have since struggled with determining the rule of decision for Corps 404 jurisdiction challenges. Justice Scalia's plurality opinion presents a narrow view of 404 jurisdiction, emphasizing the significant costs of applying for permits. The Supreme Court's decision in Rapanos highlighted the costs of applying for 404 permits and criticized the expansion of federal regulation under the Clean Water Act. Justice Scalia's opinion emphasized the limited definition of \"waters of the United States\" to include only permanent bodies of water, excluding intermittent or ephemeral flow channels. Wetlands are considered \"adjacent\" only when they have a continuous surface connection to qualifying bodies of water. The Supreme Court's decision in Rapanos clarified that wetlands with intermittent hydrological connections to \"waters of the United States\" are not covered by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Justice Scalia's opinion focused on the limited definition of jurisdictional waters, while Justice Kennedy proposed a case-by-case \"significant nexus\" test for determining regulatory coverage. Justice Kennedy proposed a case-by-case \"significant nexus\" test for determining regulatory coverage under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. He defined significant nexus as the ecological impact of a wetland on traditional navigable waters, including flood retention and pollutant trapping. This test allows for intermittent or ephemeral waters to be included if they affect water quality significantly. Justice Kennedy proposed a case-by-case \"significant nexus\" test for determining regulatory coverage under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. This formulation allows the Corps to regulate wetlands adjacent to navigable waters based on adjacency alone. However, wetlands adjacent to non-navigable tributaries require a significant nexus to be shown on a case-by-case basis. Justice Kennedy also suggested that the Corps could establish regulations declaring certain categories of wetlands to have a significant nexus per se. This approach rejects the previous notion that any hydrological connection to a navigable water, no matter how distant, is sufficient for coverage. The dissenters in the Supreme Court found the Corps' assertion of jurisdiction over wetlands reasonable in both cases, arguing that previous decisions endorsed jurisdiction over non-isolated wetlands without case-by-case analysis. The jurisdictional questions raised by Rapanos and Carabell presented federalism and property rights concerns, questioning the line between federal and state authority over wetlands. The Rapanos and Carabell cases raised federalism and property rights concerns regarding wetlands jurisdiction. The broad interpretation of \"waters of the United States\" by the Corps led to disputes with property owners over Section 404 permits, resulting in legal challenges based on Fifth Amendment takings. The Justices' split reflected differing views on statutory language interpretation and the implications for the Clean Water Act. The Justices in the Rapanos case split on their views regarding the Corps' jurisdiction over adjacent wetlands. Lower courts are struggling to determine a rule of decision from the fractured nature of the case, with different tests being drawn from the decision. The federal circuits have ruled on CWA jurisdictional questions, with different tests being applied. The Supreme Court has declined to review these decisions, leading to consistent denials. The Supreme Court has consistently denied reviewing CWA jurisdictional questions, with district court decisions following either the Kennedy test alone or the Kennedy-or-plurality test view. The United States has taken the Kennedy-or-plurality position in litigation. In the aftermath of the Rapanos case, pressure is mounting on the Corps and EPA to clarify the scope of \"adjacent wetlands\" permitting jurisdiction under the CWA. Factors driving this include multiple opinions in Rapanos urging agency action, the complexity of the Kennedy case-by-case approach, and conflicting lower court rulings post-Rapanos. The agencies may need to provide further clarification and definition of key terms in the future. The Rapanos opinions acknowledge that SWANCC eliminates jurisdiction over isolated, intrastate, nonnavigable waters. This could impact the Corps' authority beyond adjacent wetlands. The decision in Rapanos focused on statutory grounds, not the Commerce Clause issue raised in the petitions for certiorari. The Corps' view of its wetlands jurisdiction was criticized for stretching Congress' commerce power limits. In response to the Rapanos ruling, EPA and the Corps issued non-binding guidance on interpreting jurisdictional determinations. The Court's rulings on jurisdictional issues were discussed following the Rapanos ruling. Informal guidance was issued in 2006, replaced by formal guidance in June 2007, and further revised in December 2008. The 2008 guidance adopts the Kennedy-test-or-plurality-test view, with agency interpretation of vague phrases in the Kennedy ruling. Some argue for revised regulations, while others suggest a legislative remedy may be necessary. The 2008 guidance adopts the Kennedy-test-or-plurality-test view, with agency interpretation of vague phrases in the Kennedy and plurality opinions. It categorizes waters as within, outside, or evaluated case-by-case under \"waters of the United States.\" Traditional navigable waters and their adjacent wetlands are categorically labeled \"waters of the United States.\" Non-navigable tributaries are included if they are \"relatively permanent waters.\" The 2008 guidance categorizes waters as within, outside, or evaluated case-by-case under \"waters of the United States.\" It includes non-navigable tributaries that are not relatively permanent and their adjacent wetlands, based on a significant nexus with traditional navigable waters. The 2008 guidance evaluates hydrology, ecologic factors, and flow characteristics to determine the \"significant nexus\" of tributaries and adjacent wetlands in protecting downstream traditional navigable waters. Swales, erosional features, and ditches excavated in uplands are generally not considered \"waters of the United States.\" The 2007 guidance required the Corps and EPA to document jurisdictional determinations more thoroughly. Stakeholder groups expressed disappointment or frustration with the 2007 guidance and the 2008 revision. The 2008 guidance on protection of wetlands and U.S. waters has received mixed reactions, with industry groups and environmentalists expressing concerns about the \"significant nexus\" test. Industry groups feel the guidance lacks clarity and certainty, while environmentalists believe it does not fully consider cumulative effects. The guidance focuses on evaluating the \"significant nexus\" of a tributary and adjacent wetlands, without modifying the 2007 guidance. The 2008 guidance on protection of wetlands and U.S. waters has sparked debate. Industry groups see some improvements but environmental advocates argue it limits CWA protections. Confusion remains on CWA jurisdiction over wetlands not directly connected to navigable waters, especially in certain circuits. The permitting process has become more complex and slower since the issuance of the 2007 guidance. The 2008 EPA memorandum revealed that the Rapanos ruling and 2007 guidance have negatively impacted approximately 500 enforcement cases under the Clean Water Act. This includes instances where enforcement was not pursued due to jurisdictional uncertainty, cases where enforcement priority was lowered, and situations where lack of CWA jurisdiction was used as a defense. The government faces challenges due to the presumption of non-jurisdiction for intermittent and ephemeral tributaries. The 2008 EPA memorandum recommended revisions to the guidance on jurisdictional determinations under the Clean Water Act, in response to the Rapanos ruling. The guidance did not address Justice Kennedy's suggestions on evaluating wetlands, leading to resource-intensive determinations for Corps staff. The 2008 joint guidance on Clean Water Act jurisdictional determinations, following the Rapanos ruling, raised concerns about delays in permitting. House committee chairmen reviewed EPA and Corps documents, noting a decline in CWA enforcement post-Rapanos. The EPA Inspector General's 2009 report highlighted uncertainty in permitting and enforcement due to jurisdictional issues and complex terms like \"isolation\" and \"adjacency.\" In 2011, the Obama Administration proposed new joint agency guidance with EPA and Army Corps to clarify regulatory jurisdiction over U.S. waters and wetlands. The guidance aimed to protect smaller waters that feed into larger ones to prevent upstream pollutants from affecting downstream water quality. The proposed revisions were based on existing guidance but allowed for a wider evaluation of jurisdiction than the 2008 guidance. The proposed revisions to the 2008 guidance on regulatory jurisdiction over U.S. waters aimed to increase the number of protected waters under the Clean Water Act. The EPA and Corps believed that the existing guidance under-protected waters and created uncertainty, leading to the need for clarification. The revisions were intended to address these issues and clarify the determination of \"significant nexus\" waters. The proposed revisions to the 2008 guidance on regulatory jurisdiction over U.S. waters aimed to clarify the scope of CWA-regulated waters. Industry criticism focused on concerns about broadening the number and kinds of regulated waters, while government officials maintained that the guidance would not extend federal protection beyond historical boundaries set by the Clean Water Act. The proposed guidance on regulatory jurisdiction over U.S. waters aimed to clarify CWA-regulated waters. Concerns were raised about potential costs to states and localities, while environmental groups supported the new guidance. Congressional attention was drawn to the issue, with some members criticizing the guidance as exceeding clarification and resembling a de facto rule. Legislative provisions to prohibit funding for revising the guidance were included in appropriations bills, but none were enacted. The uncertainties from the Rapanos decision led to anticipation of administrative action by the Corps and EPA. In response to the uncertainties from the Rapanos decision, there was widespread anticipation for administrative action by the Corps and EPA to clarify CWA jurisdiction. The agencies released guidance in 2007 and revised it in 2008, but many stakeholders urged for a rulemaking to revise regulations. The 2011 proposed guidance was not finalized, leading to continued reliance on the existing 2003 and 2008 guidance. In May 2015, EPA and the Corps announced a rule to revise regulations defining \"waters of the United States\" under the CWA. The new Clean Water Rule replaces previous guidance and rules, reflecting legal rulings and scientific understanding of water interconnectedness. The agencies assert their expertise in administering the CWA. The EPA and the Corps have extensive experience in administering the CWA, including making numerous jurisdictional determinations. The new Clean Water Rule focuses on clarifying the regulatory status of isolated surface waters and small streams affected by previous court rulings. The rule was developed based on a synthesis of over 1,200 scientific reports to understand the connections of streams and wetlands to larger water bodies. The scientific synthesis report summarized the connections between streams, wetlands, estuaries, and oceans. EPA's Science Advisory Board reviewed the report in October 2014. The final Clean Water Rule clarifies jurisdiction without expanding it, based on the Supreme Court's ruling. EPA and the Corps aim to clarify their jurisdictional boundaries. The agencies believe the proposed rule would expand CWA jurisdiction but not protect new types of waters. Controversies have surrounded the rule since its proposal in 2014, with officials defending it vigorously. The Corps and EPA defend the changes to the regulatory definition of \"waters of the United States\" under the CWA. The rule aims to provide clarity on when the CWA applies, with some industries and agriculture groups objecting to potential broad interpretations. Concerns have been raised about the impact on exemptions for agriculture and the increase in federally regulated ditches. Many states and environmental agencies support the rule. Many states and environmental agencies support a rule to clarify the scope of CWA jurisdiction, but there is no state consensus on the revised rule. Some are generally supportive, while others believe there was insufficient consultation with states prior to proposing the rule. Environmental groups defend efforts to protect U.S. waters, suggesting the proposed rule should have been strengthened by designating additional categories of waters as jurisdictional. The final rule requires case-specific analysis for waters like prairie potholes to determine jurisdiction. The revised rule on CWA jurisdiction became effective on August 28, 2015, but faced legal challenges from industry groups, states, and environmental organizations. The lawsuits will test the agencies' interpretation of CWA jurisdiction and could result in the rule being tied up in court for years before implementation. The legal challenges to the revised rule on CWA jurisdiction, involving 90 plaintiffs, will test the agencies' interpretation of CWA jurisdiction and compliance with laws. Petitions for review have been filed in federal district courts and courts of appeals, with the Sixth Circuit placing a nationwide stay on the rule. The central question before the court is the interpretation of the appellate judicial review provision of the CWA. The Sixth Circuit ruled that challenges to the CWA jurisdiction rule should be heard in circuit courts, not district courts. Legal complexities persist with ongoing cases in other circuits and a pending decision in the Eleventh Circuit. The Corps and EPA will continue to make jurisdictional determinations based on 2008 guidance. The 2008 guidance continues to be used for jurisdictional determinations under the Clean Water Act. Legal and policy questions surrounding the extent of regulatory authority have been ongoing since the act was passed in 1972. Disputes often revolve around the definition of \"navigable waters\" and its implications for regulatory programs like Section 404. Critics, including land developers and agriculture, have raised concerns about the Section 404 regulatory program. Critics argue that the Corps' wetlands program has illegally expanded its jurisdiction since 1972, advocating for the Corps and EPA to relinquish control over non-navigable tributaries. Jurisdictional waters are subject to CWA regulations, while non-jurisdictional waters lack federal legal protection. The CWA defines \"navigable waters\" uniformly throughout the law, impacting discharge prohibitions, permit requirements, water quality standards, and oil spill prevention. The Clean Water Act impacts various environmental laws, including the Oil Pollution Act and Endangered Species Act. A non-jurisdictional determination could eliminate ESA consultation by removing the need for a CWA permit. The scope of the Corps' 404 jurisdiction is debated, with some arguing it may affect other provisions. The Clean Water Act's impact on environmental laws like the Oil Pollution Act and Endangered Species Act is debated. EPA may issue guidance on Rapanos effects on other CWA programs. SWANCC invalidated CWA jurisdiction over non-navigable waters based on bird habitat use. Post-SWANCC cases are ongoing. EPA sought state guidance on CWA jurisdiction due to uncertainty, especially in western states with intermittent streams. Wetlands play a crucial role in the aquatic ecosystem, providing various functions such as water storage, purification, habitat for plants and animals, and recreational opportunities. The values of wetlands depend on their location, size, and relationship to adjacent land and water areas. The significance of wetlands in supporting migratory bird habitat has been a key issue in post-SWANCC cases determining federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. Streams that are isolated in the landscape from other waters have functions and values that have been recognized recently. Despite federal laws encouraging wetland protection, there is still pressure to modify or develop wetlands for economic reasons. Scientists argue that there are no clear boundaries to separate waters and wetlands, emphasizing the importance of wetlands in supporting navigable waters. Scientists argue that terms like \"isolated waters\" and \"adjacent wetlands\" are artificial constructs, as all waters and wetlands are interconnected through subsurface or overflow hydrologic connections. This interconnectedness is crucial for protecting the integrity of habitats and wildlife downstream, despite the lack of a clear boundary for federal jurisdiction over wetlands. Despite efforts to clarify the jurisdiction of wetlands following court rulings like SWANCC and Rapanos, there is still uncertainty over the scope of regulated areas. The 4-1-4 Supreme Court ruling did not provide the desired clarity on what constitutes \"waters of the United States,\" leaving various interest groups with differing views on the issue. The impact of these decisions on wetlands and acreage remains uncertain due to differing interpretations. The SWANCC and Rapanos rulings, along with subsequent lower court decisions, have created uncertainty regarding the jurisdiction of wetlands under the Clean Water Act. The interpretation of key terms such as \"adjacent,\" \"tributary,\" and \"significant nexus\" is crucial in determining the extent of federal jurisdiction. Before SWANCC, the Corps had broadly defined \"waters of the United States,\" leading to almost all U.S. wetlands and waters falling under CWA jurisdiction. Depending on how these terms are defined, the reduction in federal jurisdiction could impact a wide range of wetlands and waters. Estimates suggest that changes in jurisdiction post-SWANCC could affect anywhere from 20% to 80% of the nation's total estimated 100 million acres of wetlands. The Rapanos decision further added to the uncertainty, particularly concerning the regulation of wetlands. The Rapanos decision raised concerns about its impact on arid and semi-arid states, excluding streams and wetlands from CWA jurisdiction. EPA estimated that up to 59% of total stream length in the US could be affected, with 34% of industrial and municipal dischargers located on these segments. Public drinking water systems serving over 110 million people could also be impacted. The EPA analyzed data on non-navigable tributaries to estimate that headwater streams provide drinking water for 117 million people in the US. These streams are at risk from pollution due to various human activities. Wetland regulation gaps could potentially be addressed by other federal or state programs. Some argue that wetland restoration programs and private conservation efforts can still protect wetlands, even if they are no longer under federal jurisdiction. However, these programs may not fill all gaps, especially in urban areas. States play a role in protecting waters not covered by federal law, with the Section 404 program providing a national approach to wetlands protection. Since some wetlands are no longer federally jurisdictional, the Section 404 program may no longer set consistent standards for regulating wetlands. States have the option to protect non-jurisdictional waters through their own actions, but few have done so. Prior to SWANCC, 15 states had programs regulating isolated freshwater wetlands to varying degrees. Some states have updated regulations since 2001, with ongoing debates on proposals that either strengthen or weaken wetland protection at the state level. Critics question the broad assertion of federal jurisdiction. Critics question broad federal jurisdiction over water resources, noting that most states have their own regulations. However, state rules are often tied to federal definitions, leading to gaps in wetland protection. In states without independent wetlands programs, Section 401 water quality certification procedures are used to protect wetlands by allowing states to influence federal permits and regulate wetlands without establishing separate programs. Many states are hesitant to take on regulatory control over wetlands due to budget constraints and concerns about private property rights. This reluctance limits the effectiveness of federal wetlands protection programs, as states may not be able to provide the necessary backstop. Some argue for legislative action to clarify CWA jurisdiction, while others believe the Rapanos decision did not impact Congress's willingness to act. Bills in the 109th Congress aimed to address CWA jurisdictional issues but no action was taken. Legislation introduced in the 109th Congress aimed to clarify the definition of \"waters of the United States\" under the Clean Water Act to protect U.S. waters from pollution. Other bills, such as the Federal Wetlands Jurisdiction Act of 2005, sought to restrict regulatory jurisdiction by narrowing the definition of navigable waters and excluding certain wetlands from federal oversight. Similar legislation was introduced in the 110th Congress, but no action was taken. The House and Senate committees held hearings on legislation related to the Clean Water Act in 2007 and 2008. Proponents argue that the legislation clarifies unresolved issues from Supreme Court rulings, while critics believe it expands federal authority. The legislation related to the Clean Water Act would expand federal authority, leading to concerns about constitutionality. Critics argue it exceeds Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause, while supporters believe it is grounded in Congress's commerce power. The Bush Administration did not take a position on the legislation, but Congressional attention increased in the 111th Congress, especially after statements by Obama Administration officials. In May 2009, heads of various agencies jointly wrote to Congress regarding the need for legislative clarification on \"waters of the United States\" protected under the CWA. In June 2009, the Senate Environment and Public Works approved a modified version of the Clean Water Restoration Act, deleting \"navigable waters\" from the CWA and using \"waters of the United States\" to define jurisdiction. The legislation aimed to broadly protect the nation's waters and promote consistency between CWA and agricultural wetlands programs. The Clean Water Restoration Act in 2009 aimed to define \"waters of the United States\" broadly to include various water bodies and exclude activities that affect them. The Clean Water Restoration Act in 2009 aimed to define \"waters of the United States\" broadly to include various water bodies and exclude activities that affect them. SWANCC decision and Congress's authority were discussed in relation to bills that aimed to narrow the statutory definition of waters subject to CWA jurisdiction. Bills were introduced to block EPA and the Corps from issuing revised \"waters of the United States\" guidance in the 114th Congress. Future prospects for legislation on the geographic scope of CWA jurisdiction are uncertain due to differing views of proponents and opponents. Legislating changes to specify which waters are subject to the act's jurisdiction is challenging because of complex scientific questions. Debates over revising the act highlight the difficulties in resolving these issues in law. Debates over revising the Clean Water Act highlight challenges when science, law, and policy intersect."
