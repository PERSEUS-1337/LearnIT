    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Security Letter Judicial and Congressional Oversight Act.\" It requires approval from a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court Judge or a United States Magistrate Judge for National Security Letters. No national security letter can be issued without approval from a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court Judge or a United States Magistrate Judge, who must find that the information requested is relevant to an authorized investigation on international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities, not solely based on activities protected by the first amendment, and there are specific facts linking the information to a foreign power or agent. The court under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act will establish an electronic filing system for documents related to national security letters. Congress believes challenges to nondisclosure requirements should be certified by the Attorney General or appropriate department head. The Attorney General will establish minimization procedures to ensure that information obtained through national security letters is destroyed when no longer relevant to an authorized investigation. The Attorney General will submit a semiannual report to congressional committees on the total number of national security letters issued and the specific authorities under which they were issued in the preceding six months. The Attorney General will submit a semiannual report to congressional committees on the total number of national security letters issued in the preceding six months for both United States and non-United States persons. The report will also include a description of minimization procedures, challenges made by recipients in court, and the effectiveness of information obtained through national security letters in aiding investigations. The Attorney General will submit a semiannual report to congressional committees on the total number of national security letters issued, including details on how the information obtained has aided investigations and prosecutions. Definitions for \"Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge\" and \"designated United States Magistrate Judge\" are also provided. The term \"national security letter\" refers to a request for information under specific sections of the United States Code. It can be issued by the Chief United States Magistrate Judge of a district court or another designated Magistrate Judge authorized by the Chief Justice of the United States. The Privacy Act of 1978 and various sections of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and National Security Act of 1947 outline specific provisions related to the disclosure of information."
