    "content": "The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR) was ratified by the United States in 1969, codifying consular practices. By becoming a party to the VCCR's Optional Protocol, the US accepted the jurisdiction of the ICJ to resolve disputes. The ICJ is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, and parties to the Optional Protocol agree to comply with its decisions. The United States withdrew from the Optional Protocol of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations in 2005, no longer recognizing the ICJ's jurisdiction over VCCR claims. Article 36 of the VCCR requires authorities to inform detained nationals of their right to have their consulate notified, which can be beneficial for legal representation or obtaining evidence. Foreign nationals detained by U.S. state and local authorities may not always receive necessary consular information, leading to some being convicted without consulate notification. Procedural default rules in state and federal law can prevent foreign nationals from seeking remedies for VCCR violations post-conviction. State procedural default rules typically bar reopening cases for claims not raised in a timely manner. The rule limits claims based on treaty or constitutional violations in state criminal convictions. Federal habeas review requires raising claims in state court first for an evidentiary hearing. The ICJ considered a claim by Mexico against the US for violating VCCR Article 36 before the US withdrew from the Optional Protocol. The ICJ in Avena held that Article 36 grants an individually-enforceable right to consular notification. Article 36 grants an individually-enforceable right to consular notification, leading to review and reconsideration of state convictions for 51 Mexican nationals. Despite the US withdrawal from the Optional Protocol, the President instructed state courts to adhere to the ICJ's decision in Avena. In Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon (2006), the Supreme Court ruled that suppression of evidence is not a remedy for an Article 36 violation, and procedural default rules limit the raising of untimely Article 36 claims. The Supreme Court did not consider the ICJ's interpretation of Article 36 as legally binding or persuasive in the Sanchez-Llamas case, which did not involve individuals named in the Avena decision. The ruling did not address the domestic effect of the ICJ judgment on certain Mexican nationals' state criminal convictions or the legal weight of the President's Memorandum instructing state courts to comply with the Avena judgment. Ernesto Medell\u00c3\u00adn, convicted in Texas state court for murder, was named in the Avena decision. In 2004, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Medell\u00c3\u00adn v. Dretke, where Medell\u00c3\u00adn argued for reconsideration of his conviction in light of the ICJ's ruling. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in Medell\u00edn to review the Texas court's judgment regarding the enforceability of the ICJ's decision in Avena and the President's Memorandum. The Supreme Court addressed two issues in the Medell\u00edn case: whether the ICJ's decision in Avena was enforceable in U.S. state courts, and whether the President's Memorandum required states to reconsider the claims of Mexican nationals named in Avena. The Court examined whether the ICJ's judgment constituted binding domestic law, acknowledging international law obligations but ultimately ruling against Medell\u00edn's habeas petition reexamination. The Supreme Court explained the distinction between self-executing and non-self-executing treaties, stating that self-executing treaties become federal law upon ratification, while non-self-executing treaties require implementing legislation by Congress for domestic effect. The Court emphasized that international agreements, even if self-executing, do not automatically benefit private individuals without proper implementation. The Supreme Court clarified that international agreements, even if self-executing, do not automatically create private rights or a private cause of action in domestic courts without implementing legislation by Congress. The Court determined that the Avena judgment did not constitute enforceable domestic law as none of its underlying treaty sources created binding domestic law without implementing legislation. The Court looked at the treaty text to assess if it reflected a determination for domestic effect, acknowledging that treaty interpretation involves both textual and nontextual resources. The Supreme Court clarified that international agreements do not automatically create private rights in domestic courts without implementing legislation. The Court found that the Optional Protocol grants jurisdiction to the ICJ but does not compel parties to comply with its decisions. Compliance with ICJ judgments is derived from Article 94 of the U.N. Charter. The ICJ decisions do not automatically become enforceable domestic law, as parties are only committed to future political action to comply with them. Noncompliance can lead to referral to the U.N. Security Council, where the U.S. retains veto power. Interpreting ICJ judgments as automatically enforceable domestic law would eliminate the option of noncompliance with ICJ decisions contemplated under Article 94(2). The ICJ Statute provides that ICJ decisions have \"no binding force except between the parties,\" and only nations, not individuals, may be parties in cases before the ICJ. The Court reasoned that an individual like Medell\u00edn could not be considered a party to the Avena decision, and therefore could not rely on its judgment. The Court stated that treaties do not create domestically enforceable law, as confirmed by the understanding of other signatories to the Optional Protocol. No country treats ICJ judgments as automatically binding on domestic courts. The Court's conclusion is supported by general principles of interpretation, and it clarified that treaties can sometimes have binding domestic effect on international tribunal judgments. The Court clarified that treaties do not create domestically enforceable law, and ICJ judgments are not automatically binding on domestic courts. However, in some cases, international agreements to abide by international adjudications may be self-executing. The Court emphasized that its decision did not affect the enforcement of foreign judgments or international arbitral agreements by U.S. courts. Justice Stevens concurred, noting wisdom in the dissenting opinion. Justice Stevens agreed with the majority that the relevant treaties did not authorize the Court to enforce the ICJ's judgment in Avena. He emphasized that while the decision was not directly enforceable by U.S. courts, it imposed an international legal obligation on the federal government and each U.S. state, including Texas. Justice Stevens urged Texas to comply with the Avena judgment to avoid causing the United States to default on its international law obligations. In dissent, Justice Breyer argued that the ICJ judgment should be enforceable as a matter of domestic law without further legislation, citing previous cases where treaties were deemed self-executing. The dissent argued that the majority's emphasis on a treaty's text for determining self-executing nature could hinder the application of provisions in existing treaties and complicate negotiations for new ones. Justice Breyer listed 70 treaties with ICJ dispute settlement provisions similar to the Optional Protocol, suggesting that the majority's decision could call into question their domestic legal effect. The dissent proposed using practical, context-specific criteria to determine if a treaty provision is self-executing, with the subject matter being crucial. The dissent argued that relevant treaty provisions underlying the Avena judgment were self-executing and should be directly enforceable by U.S. courts. The Court also examined the legal effect of the President's Memorandum, which required the Texas state court to review and reconsider Medellin's conviction and sentence in line with the Avena judgment. The United States argued in an amicus brief that the President had the authority to implement the Avena judgment through relevant treaties and independent power. The Court recognized the President's unique role in foreign policy decisions and upheld the Memorandum to uphold interests like VCCR observance and foreign relations. The Court analyzed the President's action using the tripartite framework established by Justice Jackson's concurring opinion in Youngstown Sheet & Tube v. Sawyer, emphasizing that presidential authority is derived from an act of Congress or the Constitution. The President's authority is at its lowest when acting against Congress, relying only on constitutional powers. The government argued that the President had the authority to implement the treaty-based obligation of the Optional Protocol and U.N. Charter. This falls under the first category of the Youngstown framework, as the President's action was impliedly authorized by Congress through Senate approval of treaties. The Court disagreed with the government's argument that the President's action was authorized by Congress through Senate approval of treaties. The Court held that the responsibility to transform international obligations into domestic law falls to Congress, not the President. The President's Memorandum was found to be in conflict with the ratifying Senate's understanding of non-self-executing treaties. The Court disagreed with the government's argument that the President's Memorandum should be considered domestic law due to congressional acquiescence. The Court clarified that congressional acquiescence is only relevant in situations where the President acts without congressional authorization, which was not the case here. The Court emphasized that the President's attempt to enforce the Avena judgment went against the will of Congress. The Court rejected the government's argument that the President's Memorandum could be considered valid under his power to resolve international disputes, citing a lack of congressional acquiescence. It also noted that previous Supreme Court decisions on the President's authority to settle foreign claims were specific and not applicable in this case. The Court characterized the President's Memorandum as an unprecedented action that overstepped his authority to settle foreign claims, compelling state courts to reopen final criminal judgments. The Court concluded that the President's authority in settling foreign claims did not extend to support the current Presidential Memorandum. The Court rejected the argument that the President's Memorandum constituted binding law, emphasizing that the President can enforce non-self-executing treaty obligations through means consistent with the Constitution. Justice Stevens concurred that the Memorandum did not establish legally-binding rules. The dissenting justices believed the relevant treaties were self-executing and directly enforceable as domestic law, so they did not address whether the President's Memorandum preempted state procedural default rules."
