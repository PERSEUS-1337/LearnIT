    "content": "The Workplace Advancement Act may be cited as the official title. The Act includes findings related to workplace advancement. The Workplace Advancement Act includes findings that highlight the progress made by women in the workforce since the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Currently, 60 percent of women are primary earners in their households, and 47 percent are part of the workforce. According to the Department of Education, women now receive 57 percent of all college degrees, a 33 percent increase from 1970. They also hold the majority of positions in the 5 fastest-growing fields and are more likely to work in professional occupations. Despite this progress, surveys show concerns about gender-based pay discrimination, with an average of 2,400 complaints annually received by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over the last 15 years. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found no discrimination in most complaints, but there is still progress to be made. Factors like occupation, education, hours worked, and personal choices contribute to differences in total compensation. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON WAGE DISCRIMINATION. No employer shall discriminate based on sex by paying wages to employees of the opposite sex at a lower rate for equal work, except in certain circumstances like seniority or merit systems. An employer cannot pay employees of the opposite sex a lower wage for equal work, except in cases of seniority or merit systems. Employers violating this rule cannot reduce any employee's wage rate to comply. Employers must post notices about the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's provisions and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits unequal pay based on sex, with exceptions for seniority or merit systems. Employers must also provide information on filing complaints related to this act. SEC. 4. ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT OF EQUAL PAY ACT REQUIREMENTS. Section 15(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is amended to protect employees from retaliation for discussing or disclosing wage information to ensure equal pay for equal work. The text chunk states that information cannot be disclosed unless it is in response to a charge, complaint, investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action under section 6(d). It also clarifies that this paragraph does not limit the rights of an employee under any other law."
