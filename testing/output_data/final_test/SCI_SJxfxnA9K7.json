    "content": "We propose a novel method for incorporating conditional information into a generative adversarial network (GAN) for structured prediction tasks. This method fuses features from the generated and conditional information to improve the discriminator's ability to capture higher-order statistics. It simplifies the process compared to joint CNN-CRF models and shows improvement in various structured prediction tasks like image synthesis and semantic segmentation. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown impressive results in various learning tasks, but struggle with preserving high-dimensional structure in data. Structured prediction frameworks like CNN-CRF models have been used to address this issue by incorporating non-local dependencies. However, these models can become complex when trying to capture interactions beyond second-order statistics. Other approaches, such as task-specific perceptual losses, have also been explored to improve structured prediction tasks. Generative models, including CNN-based implicit generative models and generative adversarial networks (GANs), offer a way to represent complex dependencies in large datasets without requiring explicit parameterization of the probability distribution. GANs operate as a two-player minimax game where a generator transforms random input into a specific distribution, challenging a discriminator to differentiate between true and synthesized data. The discriminator is a key feature of adversarial networks. Conditional GANs (cGANs) incorporate conditional image information in the discriminator, improving training stability with spectral normalization and gradient penalty. The discriminator in cGANs discriminates between adversarial loss and fuses features of input and ground truth/generated images. Fusing input and ground truth/generated image features in conditional GANs improves training stability and eliminates the need for manually designing higher order loss functions. This approach has been extensively used for image-to-image translation tasks. Incorporating image conditional information into GANs can be done through various strategies, including class conditioning and structured data conditioning. In this work, a novel discriminator architecture is proposed for incorporating conditional information into a cGAN for structured prediction tasks. The approach aims to capture higher order non-local structural information from higher dimensional data without complex energy function modeling. The method proposed in this work aims to incorporate conditional information in cGANs for structured prediction tasks, allowing the discriminator to enforce higher-order consistency. It is simpler than alternative methods like CNN-CRFs. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated in tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation. Previous models for structured prediction involved hand-engineered features, but this approach focuses on capturing high-order statistics and structural information in the data. In 2015, BID15 showed that a fully convolutional approach to semantic segmentation could achieve state-of-the-art results without hand-engineered features. BID1 demonstrated that post-processing CNN results with a conditional Markov random field led to significant improvements. Recent work by BID0 has explored incorporating higher-order potentials into CNN-based models for semantic segmentation. Recent work has focused on developing methods to incorporate higher-order statistical information into CNN-based models for semantic segmentation. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been introduced for this purpose, consisting of a pair of models (G, D) where G models the source domain distribution and D evaluates the divergence between generative and true distributions. GAN training aims to reach a Nash equilibrium through iterative refinement of the generator and discriminator. Conditional GANs, or cGANs, are designed to incorporate conditional information and have shown promise for tasks like class conditional image synthesis and image-to-image translation. They offer advantages for structured prediction, leveraging non-local dependencies in image conditioning. The fusion discriminator is introduced to incorporate conditional information in a more motivated way for structured prediction tasks in Conditional GANs. It aims to address the issue of conditional data incorporation by providing a new methodology that is not solely based on concatenation to discriminator layers. The fusion discriminator in cGANs for structured prediction tasks incorporates conditional information through the discriminator, allowing it to significantly influence the generator. This approach involves defining the discriminator with continuous access to generated and real data, using an adversarial loss function to train the discriminator, and concatenating conditional image information to the input of the discriminator at some layer. The proposed fusion discriminator architecture in cGANs incorporates conditional information through two branches of convolutional neural networks, \u03c6(x) and \u03c8(y), to extract features from conditional and generated/real data, respectively. This fusion approach aims to preserve dependencies in the data structure for a high structural capacity adversarial framework. The fusion discriminator architecture in cGANs combines features from conditional and real/generated data using a fusion block. This block enhances feature maps by adding discontinuities from the conditional data, improving overall feature quality. The fusion discriminator architecture in cGANs combines features from conditional and real/generated data using a fusion block to enhance overall feature maps. This preserves representation from both x and y, which often have complementary features in tasks like depth estimation, semantic segmentation, and image synthesis. Theoretical motivation suggests that adding activations from corresponding layers in two networks with identical architectures results in a stronger signal passing forward through the combined network. The fusion discriminator in conditional GANs combines features from conditional and real/generated data to enhance overall feature maps. This fusion process strengthens signals at locations where useful information is found in both types of data, preserving activations and improving performance. The fusion discriminator in conditional GANs preserves a signal, even when x or y contain useful information for learning higher-level features and classification. Using Grad-CAM, the architecture shows a visually strong signal at important features for different tasks, providing evidence of structural preservation. The fusion discriminator in conditional GANs preserves structural information from input and output image pairs, classifying overlapping patches based on that information. Three sets of experiments were conducted on structured prediction problems using a U-Net based generator, including generating real images from semantic masks, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation. Spectral normalization was applied to all weights to demonstrate the structure-preserving abilities of the discriminator in image-to-image translation settings. The study focuses on using a fusion discriminator in image-to-image translation for generating realistic images from semantic labels. The experiment compares the performance of a generic fusion discriminator against a concatenated discriminator with a simple generator. The Cityscapes dataset was used with 2,975 training images and a test set of 500 images. Different discriminator configurations were tested, including a standard 4-layer concatenation discriminator, a combination with spectral normalization, and a VGG-16 concatenation. The study evaluates the effectiveness of a fusion discriminator in image-to-image translation by performing semantic segmentation on synthesized images. The goal is to compare the predicted segments with the input labels to assess the quality of the generated images. The experiment includes different discriminator configurations such as a 4-layer discriminator with spectral normalization and a VGG-16 concatenation discriminator. The evaluation metrics used include pixel-wise accuracy and overall intersection-over-union. The fusion discriminator in image-to-image translation outperforms the concatenated discriminator in semantic segmentation tasks. Results are close to the upper bound achieved by real images, showing its effectiveness in preserving image details. The current study focuses on the use of discriminators with high definition images, with representative images shown in FIG2. A comparative analysis of different types of discriminators is presented in Fig. 5, up to 550k iterations. Semantic segmentation is crucial for visual scene understanding, formulated as a dense labeling problem to predict category labels for individual pixels. Incorporating higher order statistics using CRFs has shown improved results compared to CNNs with pixel-wise loss. Incorporating higher order potentials improves semantic segmentation, making it ideal for evaluating GANs. The fusion discriminator preserves more spatial context compared to CNN-CRF setups, maintaining higher order details. Comparative analysis includes shallow and deep architectures with concatenation and fusion discriminators. An ablation study on spectral normalization effects was conducted. The U-Net generator was used for all experiments, trained for 950k iterations without spectral normalization. Depth estimation is a structured prediction task in computer vision, often using per-pixel and non-local losses like CNN-CRFs. State-of-the-art results have been achieved with a hierarchical chain of non-local losses. The possibility of incorporating higher order information with a simple adversarial loss and fusion discriminator was explored through experiments on the NYU v2 dataset. In structured prediction tasks like depth estimation, fusion discriminator in image conditioned GANs outperforms concatenation-based methods and pairwise CNN-CRF methods. The discriminator incorporates non-local information and features from both input and output images, improving the model's ability to capture higher-order statistics. This modification significantly enhances the general adversarial training setup. The paper presents a modification to the general adversarial framework for structured prediction tasks, emphasizing the importance of feeding paired information into the discriminator in image conditioned GAN problems. The generator minimizes loss while the discriminator maximizes it, with an additional L1 reconstruction loss. Network architectures are adapted from previous explanations, with specific convolutional layers and filters used. The model was built from scratch with weights initialized from a Gaussian distribution. Images were cropped, rescaled, and randomly jittered. The decoder architecture includes skip connections and uses Tanh activation. Leaky ReLUs are used in the encoder, while regular ReLUs are used in the decoder."
