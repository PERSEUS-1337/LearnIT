    "content": "The Act titled the \"Stop Endangering the Records of Veterans (SERVE) Act of 2006\" aims to protect the records of veterans. Congress finds that identity theft is a critical problem for consumers, with millions of individuals being subjected to theft of personal information each year. Recent thefts of computer hardware have made millions of veterans vulnerable to identity theft and fraud. The Department of Veterans Affairs reported multiple incidents of stolen personal records, affecting millions of veterans and their spouses. In August 2006, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs awarded a $3,700,000 contract to upgrade all Department computers with enhanced data security encryption systems to prevent identity theft and fraud for veterans. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs awarded a $3,700,000 contract to upgrade Department computers with enhanced data security encryption systems to protect veterans' records and prevent future losses of sensitive personal information. The Department of Veterans Affairs is enhancing information security by adding a new subchapter on information security to Chapter 57 of title 38, United States Code. The new subchapter on information security in Chapter 57 of title 38, United States Code defines 'sensitive personal information' as specific data about an individual and 'encrypt' as using software to protect electronic information from unauthorized access. The Secretary is required to physically secure and encrypt all sensitive personal information processed or maintained by the Department, as well as equipment containing such information. Contracts for functions requiring access to sensitive personal information must include security requirements. The contractor must encrypt or encode sensitive information and physically secure all processed information and equipment. They must reimburse the Secretary for any unauthorized disclosure. Violations result in a one-year debarment from contracting with the Department. Criminal penalties apply for unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information. The unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information processed or maintained by the Secretary or contractors will result in fines, imprisonment for up to one year, or both. This is outlined in the section on information security, which includes definitions, physical security requirements, encryption protocols, and penalties for violations. The implementation of criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information must be completed within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must conduct a study on the security of personal information held by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs within 180 days of the Act's enactment. A report with findings and recommendations must be submitted to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives."
