Congress aims to provide additional learning tools for individuals in economically-disadvantaged communities. Section 6003 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to update definitions, including the term 'poverty line' and 'voluntary public and private parental'. The term 'voluntary public and private parental choice program' refers to a program authorized by State law that allows low-income parents to choose the appropriate school for their children. SEC. 104. ALLOCATION TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. Subsection (a) of section 6102 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to allow State educational agencies to reserve up to 10% of funds for State programs, or up to 25% if the State has a voluntary parental choice program in place. The State educational agency can reserve up to 10% of funds for State programs, or up to 25% if there is a voluntary parental choice program. Any excess funds must be used for voluntary public and private parental choice programs. Local educational agencies in empowerment zones or enterprise communities receive funds not reserved by the State agency. SEC. 105. USES OF FUNDS. Section 6201(a)(1) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include establishing voluntary public and private parental choice programs. Section 6301(b) is also amended to include voluntary public and private parental choice programs. Voluntary public and private parental choice programs in designated empowerment zones or enterprise communities, limited to families below 185% of the poverty line, with scholarships not exceeding local per pupil expenditure. The voluntary public and private parental choice scholarship program ensures that participating private schools can set academic requirements uniformly. The scholarship amount is at least 60% of the local per pupil expenditure or private school tuition, whichever is lower. The scholarship program allows private schools to set academic requirements uniformly, without restrictions on the use of funds for religious purposes or removal of religious symbols. The schools must also comply with all State requirements for private school operation. The HELP Scholarships Amendments of 1997 allow for the use of State, local, and private funds in voluntary public and private parental choice programs, with priority given to students previously enrolled in public schools. SEC. 106 amends Part D of title VI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 by adding a new subsection and new sections for evaluation. This includes provisions for funds used in voluntary public and private parental choice programs. The Comptroller General of the United States will contract an evaluating agency to conduct an annual evaluation of programs established under section 6301(b)(10) and those that have applied for an education flexibility waiver under section 6304. The evaluating agency must transmit annual evaluation findings to the Comptroller General of the United States. Criteria for evaluating programs under section 6301(b)(10) will be established, focusing on program implementation, effects on participants, schools, and communities, parent involvement, and educational achievement comparison. The evaluation of educational achievement in the program area includes comparing students with and without parental choice scholarships. The Secretary will reserve funds for evaluation purposes based on the scale and scope of the programs. Title II of the education program includes a section on the Children's Education Tax Credit Act. This act allows for a credit for education expenses and specifies that funds used for parental choice programs are considered assistance to the student, not the school. The Secretary is not allowed to control the curriculum or administration of schools participating in these programs. SEC. 35. EDUCATION EXPENSES.
