    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Market Incentives for Biobased Products Act of 2007\". It includes findings related to biobased products. Congress finds significant potential for replacing petroleum-based products with farm-grown biomass, providing value-added opportunities for farmers and environmentally friendly options for consumers. The Federal Government can promote the biobased industry through procurement and a labeling program for biobased products to raise consumer awareness. This market development also encourages investment and employment opportunities in rural America by reducing petroleum use. By reducing petroleum use and increasing reliance on farm-grown raw materials, the Nation can decrease its need for imported petroleum.
