    "content": "The Worker Savings Account Act of 2008, also known as the Worker Savings Accounts, amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section 408B for worker savings accounts. The Worker Savings Account Act of 2008 introduces worker savings accounts, which are treated similarly to individual retirement plans under the Internal Revenue Code. Worker savings accounts are designated as such at the time of establishment and have separate rules from individual retirement plans. Contributions, including employer contributions, are governed by specific sections of the Code. The Worker Savings Account Act of 2008 establishes worker savings accounts, similar to individual retirement plans. Contributions to these accounts are subject to specific rules, including an increase in the amount contributed by employers for the taxable year. Additionally, contributions cannot be made after an individual begins receiving social security benefits. The Worker Savings Account Act of 2008 establishes worker savings accounts, similar to individual retirement plans. Contributions to these accounts are subject to specific rules, including an increase in the amount contributed by employers for the taxable year. Any amounts distributed from a worker savings account are included in gross income, unless it is a qualified unemployment distribution. The Worker Savings Account Act of 2008 establishes worker savings accounts with specific distribution rules. Disability distributions are exempt, and other distribution rules apply, including no minimum distribution requirement before death. The Worker Savings Account Act of 2008 exempts death benefits from certain distribution rules, and rules similar to section 223(f) apply to account beneficiaries. Rollover contributions must meet specific requirements. The Worker Savings Account Act of 2008 allows account holders to deposit received amounts into a worker savings account or eligible retirement plan within 60 days to benefit from certain exemptions and rollover contribution rules. The term 'account beneficiary' refers to the individual for whom a worker savings account is established. This provision does not apply if an individual received a non-taxable amount from a worker savings account within a year before receiving a taxable amount. The account beneficiary is the individual for whom the worker savings account is established. Inflation adjustments are made to the dollar amount in subsection (c)(1) for taxable years after 2009. Section 408B establishes worker savings accounts, with amendments effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2008. Additionally, a portion of the Saver's Credit is made refundable. Section 25B of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to increase the aggregate credits allowed to a taxpayer by the lesser of $1,000 or the credit attributable to qualified retirement savings contributions made to worker savings accounts. This credit is not considered part of the Saver's Credit and will reduce the taxpayer's overall tax liability. The credit allowed under Section 25B of the Internal Revenue Code is subject to limitations. The maximum credit for any taxable year is $5,000 minus the total credits claimed in prior years. Dollar amounts are adjusted for inflation for taxable years after 2009. The Internal Revenue Code allows for a cost-of-living adjustment for the taxable year based on the calendar year 2008. Any increase is rounded to the nearest multiple of $100. Additionally, a new section is added to allow for a refund payable to a worker savings account under Subchapter B of chapter 65. The Internal Revenue Code allows for a cost-of-living adjustment for the taxable year based on the calendar year 2008, rounded to the nearest multiple of $100. A new section, SEC. 6431, allows for a refund payment into a designated retirement account for credits attributable to an increase under section 25B(h). SEC. 6431 allows for a refund payment into a designated retirement account for credits attributable to an increase under section 25B(h). The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2008. No provision of this Act shall diminish an employer's obligation to pay State and Federal unemployment taxes or reduce the amount of unemployment compensation to which an individual is entitled."
