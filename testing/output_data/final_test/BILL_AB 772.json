    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 11107.1 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to require sellers in California to prepare a bill of sale for certain hazardous substances sold in face-to-face or will-call transactions. In California, sellers must prepare a bill of sale for hazardous substances sold in face-to-face or will-call transactions. The bill must include the date of sale, cost, method of payment, items purchased, quantities, purchaser identification, and seller's signature as a witness. Proper purchaser identification for hazardous substances in California includes a valid state-issued ID with a photo, residential address, vehicle license number, intended use of the substance, EPA certification or resale tax ID, and purchaser's signature. The seller must keep the original bill of sale with purchaser identification information for five years and provide it to law enforcement when requested. For non-face-to-face sales, the seller must maintain sales information for five years, including purchaser details, sale date, product description, cost, payment method, delivery details, and valid identification. The seller must provide valid identifying information upon request by law enforcement or the Attorney General. A manifest must be maintained for deliveries using a common carrier for five years. Any manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, or person in California buying items listed in Section 11107.1 must provide purchase details, retain records for three years, and present them to law enforcement upon request. A first violation is a misdemeanor, with subsequent convictions leading to jail time or fines up to $100,000. Section 11107.2 of the Health and Safety Code prohibits purchasing more than 400 milliliters of butane in a calendar month. No reimbursement is required for this act as it creates a new crime or infraction."
