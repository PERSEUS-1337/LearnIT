    "content": "Congress authorized the Department of Defense (DOD) to fund security and stabilization activities for the State Department and USAID from FY2006 to FY2010 using \"Section 1207\" authority. This authority allowed DOD to transfer up to $100 million for reconstruction and security activities in foreign countries. The authority was extended through FY2009 by subsequent legislation. The FY2009 Duncan Hunter NDAA provided special authority for up to $50 million to be spent under Section 1207 for Georgia, in addition to the up to $100 million authorized for other countries. Congress extended the $100 million transfer authority for one last time, through FY2010, in action on the FY2010 NDAA. Section 1207 authority was used to fund activities of the State Department's Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization and activities implemented by other agencies coordinated by S/CRS, including activities of USAID. These funds have supported activities in 14 countries and in two regions. Section 1207 was introduced to provide authorization and funding for interagency coordination projects at the request of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The authority required compliance with the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act. The Secretary of Defense had to notify congressional committees when transferring services, defense articles, or funds to the Secretary of State. Section 1207 authorized interagency coordination projects with notification to congressional committees. Funds were allocated from various sources, including DOD O&M funds and specific appropriations from Congress. In FY2006, $10 million was transferred to the State Department for assistance to Lebanon during the conflict. In FY2007, DOD transferred $99.7 million to the State Department for programs in seven countries and regions, including Colombia, Haiti, Nepal, Somalia, and Yemen. The projects funded were described as small focused activities with potential for significant impact if continued or expanded. Additionally, regional activities in Southeast Asia and the Trans-Sahara region were supported. In FY2008, DOD provided $100 million in transfers, with $50 million allocated for Georgia and $50 million for activities in six other countries. In FY2009, DOD transferred $143.3 million to the State Department for activities in Georgia and 11 other countries. FY2010 Section 1207 funding totaled $92.2 million for activities in eight countries. Section 1207 authority was established in FY2006 with funding up to $200 million per fiscal year. Section 1207 authority, established in FY2006 with funding up to $200 million per fiscal year, was described as a \"pilot project\" in the Senate version of the FY2008 NDAA. The authority was extended through FY2008, and Section 1210 of the FY2008 NDAA augmented the role played by the Secretary of State. The FY2008 NDAA expanded the Secretary of Defense's role in coordinating with the Secretary of State for reconstruction, security, or stabilization assistance to foreign countries. Congress extended the $100 million Section 1207 transfer authority through FY2009. DOD requested doubling the authorized funding to $200 million per year and extending the authority for five fiscal years. The FY2008 NDAA expanded the Secretary of Defense's role in coordinating with the Secretary of State for reconstruction, security, or stabilization assistance to foreign countries. Congress extended the $100 million Section 1207 transfer authority through FY2009. DOD requested doubling the authorized funding to $200 million per year and extending the authority for five fiscal years. The FY2009 NDAA would have doubled the authorized amount to $200 million and extended Section 1207 authority three years. Congress approved a special additional authority under Section 1207 to provide up to $50 million in assistance to Georgia in FY2009. In FY2010, Congress extended the authority for up to $100 million in Section 1207 funds through September 30, 2010. $97.09 million was allocated for Section 1207 spending from DSCA appropriations in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010. DOD did not request continued Section 1207 funding in its February 2010 defense budget request. The State Department's FY2011 Foreign Assistance budget requested $100 million for Complex Crises. The Department's FY2011 Foreign Assistance budget requested $100 million for a Complex Crises Fund, similar to Section 1207 Authority, established in 2009 by Congress. The fund was created to respond to emerging crises through support for reconstruction, security, or stabilization needs. The Obama Administration decision to request Section 1207-type funding under the Foreign Assistance account ended further discussion of Section 1207 authority. The first session of the 111th Congress allocated $50 million for the USAID Complex Crises Fund in response to the Obama Administration's FY2010 budget request. The Obama Administration requested $116 million in flexible funding for Stabilization and Reconstruction (S&R) purposes, with $40 million for a Stabilization Bridge Fund and $76 million for a Rapid Response fund. This new account provides greater flexibility to USAID to prevent or respond to complex crises overseas. Proponents argue for flexible funding for rapid response to unforeseen crises, citing the need for immediate assistance and the inefficiency of current funding mechanisms. Suggestions include a replenishable Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance (ERMA) model for conflict and crisis situations. Bills have been proposed to establish a conflict response fund, but none have been passed. The HELP Commission recommended the establishment of two rapid-response crisis funds in December 2007: one for humanitarian crises and the other for foreign security challenges. Funding for security and stabilization activities from the DOD budget served as a de facto response fund for small projects by State Department and USAID personnel from FY2006 to FY2010. Section 1207 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2006 authorized the Secretary of Defense to provide assistance for State Department initiatives. The Obama Administration requested $200 million in FY2010 for reconstruction and stabilization assistance to a foreign country, but Congress did not change the authorized level. Congress signaled unwillingness to extend the fund beyond FY2010, urging the administration to work towards fulfilling statutory requirements rapidly. The conferees recommend the administration work rapidly towards maintaining coordination between DOD and State Department. Defense appropriators expect DOD's Section 1207 funding to expire at the end of FY2010. They suggest establishing a Complex Crises Fund to meet emergent requirements without relying on DOD, but still advocate for DOD participation in planning small-scale security projects. The conferees recommended creating a Complex Crises Fund to replace DOD's Section 1207 funding for small-scale security projects. They urged USAID and the State Department to enhance crisis prevention and response capabilities to take over DOD's functions. The conferees recommended creating a Complex Crises Fund to replace DOD's Section 1207 funding for small-scale security projects. They specified that USAID and the Departments of State and Defense should consult on stabilization and security assistance. The FY2011 budget requested $100 million for the CCF to replace Section 1207 funding. There were initial concerns about the appropriate use of Section 1207 and funding State Department activities through the DOD budget. The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) expressed concerns about the limitations placed on Section 1207 authority by the Department of Defense, emphasizing that the original intent was to support the State Department in providing reconstruction, security, or stabilization assistance to foreign countries. SASC criticized the narrow interpretation of Section 1207 as primarily for civilian expertise, stating that it should also include early civilian resources to prevent crises. The Department of Defense (DOD) responded to the concerns raised by the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) regarding Section 1207 funding. DOD stated that the funding is for reconstruction, security, or stabilization assistance, to provide early civilian resources to avert crises that could require U.S. military intervention. The House Armed Services Committee (HASC) reaffirmed that the resources provided under this authority are intended to meet immediate, short-term needs. The Section 1207 legislation prohibits DOD from long-term funding to allow the State Department to fulfill its obligations. Some suggest that these activities should be funded through the State Department or USAID instead. The USIP report highlights the importance of DOD Section 1207 funding but recommends that Congress reconsider its future funding approach. The USIP report suggests that Congress should appropriate quick reaction funding to the State Department for stabilization and reconstruction efforts, restoring its traditional role in funding U.S. foreign assistance. Some believe that the State Department lacks capacity to handle the funding, leading to continued funding under the DOD. The FY2010 NDAA conferees expressed disappointment in the State Department's lack of capacity to handle funding transferred from the DOD. They recommended maintaining coordination between the two departments in the absence of this authority. The committee is concerned about the lack of progress in building capacity within the Department of State to fulfill its statutory requirements. They emphasize the temporary nature of the transfer authority and urge the Administration to develop internal capacity so that it is no longer needed. The Senate Armed Services Committee also views Section 1207 as temporary. Foreign operations appropriators support the creation of a USAID Complex Crises Fund and urge the State Department and USAID to enhance their capacity. The Senate Appropriations Committee urged the State Department and USAID to develop additional capacity to replace Section 1207 DOD funding with Complex Crisis funding. They emphasized the need for crisis prevention and response capabilities to be assumed by USAID and the State Department. Additionally, they specified continued consultation between USAID, State Department, and Defense Department on stabilization and security assistance. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended creating a larger fund in the State Department budget to replace Section 1207 DOD funding. They emphasized the need for coordination between DOD and the State Department in formulating and implementing security and stabilization assistance. Defense appropriators indicated that DOD funds for Section 1207-type activities were not expected in the future. The conferees recommended allocating $97.09 million from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency appropriation as a bridge fund for the Complex Crises Fund. This fund will allow USAID and the Department of State to address emergent requirements without relying on the Department of Defense. The Secretaries of Defense and State, along with the Director of USAID, were directed to maintain and strengthen the interagency process for future projects previously funded through section 1207."
