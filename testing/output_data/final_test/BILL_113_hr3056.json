    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Warriors' Peer-Outreach Pilot Program Act\" and establishes a pilot program to provide outreach and support services to veterans pursuing higher education under the Post 9/11 Educational Assistance Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will conduct a three-year pilot program at three different types of institutions of higher learning to provide outreach and support services for veterans using educational assistance under chapter 33 of title 38, United States Code. The pilot program requires a private, not-for-profit college to provide office space, IT equipment, and support services for veterans. The institution must also cooperate with the Secretary by providing necessary data for program evaluation. Priority for selection is given to institutions of higher learning. The pilot program prioritizes institutions of higher learning with existing peer outreach programs for veteran students and those located in states with large student veteran populations. The program provides peer-outreach and peer-support services to veterans of specific operations who are students at participating institutions. The pilot program aims to assist veterans who struggle to adjust to institutions of higher learning or require services not provided by the institution. It employs veterans using educational assistance under chapter 33 of title 38, United States Code, to support fellow veterans at the institution. The pilot program aims to assist veterans at institutions of higher learning by hiring veterans who have served in combat operations. It includes training for the employed veterans and developing measures to assess the effectiveness of the services provided. The pilot program for veterans at institutions of higher learning includes developing a follow-up online survey, tabulating individual meetings and referrals made by peers, and assessing the impact of the program. The pilot program for veterans at institutions of higher learning will last for three years, with a report due nine months after completion. The report will detail the program's implementation, operation, and effectiveness of peer-outreach services. The pilot program for veterans at institutions of higher learning will include reducing veterans' dropout rates, improving educational outcomes, providing behavioral health services, analyzing costs and benefits, and potential program extension recommendations by the Secretary."
