    "title": "SB 188",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. This act removes the sunset date in Section 12811.1 of the Public Utilities Code, allowing municipal utility districts to collect delinquent fees. It does not affect the protection for property owners under Section 12822.6, prohibiting collection from residential tenants in nonmaster-metered buildings. A district can require property owners to pay delinquent fees for services rendered to tenants, with the fees becoming a lien on the property. This lien has the force of a judgment lien and cannot be created on publicly owned property. A district can create a lien on a property for delinquent fees by filing a certificate with the county recorder. The lien attaches to the property owner's record and includes the amount owed, interest, penalties, and property description. The district must release the lien within 30 days of receiving full payment. A district can create a lien on a property for delinquent fees by filing a certificate with the county recorder. The delinquent fees, along with interest and penalties, can be collected on the tax roll like property taxes after a series of steps including a public hearing and filing a certificate. The general manager must file a report with the district board of directors detailing delinquent fees on each affected parcel of real property, along with interest and penalties. Notice of a public hearing must be given by publishing in a newspaper and mailing to the property owner at least 14 days before the hearing. At a public hearing, the board of directors considers objections to a report on delinquent fees, rates, and charges. They may adopt or revise these fees, with final determinations made on each affected parcel. The general manager must file the final report with the county auditor by August 10 each year. The county auditor then records delinquent fees, rates, and charges on the current assessment roll for each affected parcel of real property. The county tax collector includes these amounts on tax bills and collects the delinquent fees, rates, and charges. The county tax collector collects delinquent fees, tolls, rates, rentals, or charges on real property, along with interest and penalties, similar to property taxes. The district can recover delinquent fees, tolls, rates, rentals, or charges by recording a certificate with the county recorder, including interest and penalties. This process applies to services provided to a lessee, tenant, or subtenant. The district can recover delinquent fees by recording a certificate with the county recorder, constituting a lien on the property. The lien has the priority of a judgment lien and must be released within 30 days of payment. The district is prohibited from recovering delinquent fees from subsequent commercial tenants or property owners for nonpayment by a previous tenant. The district must pay recording fees and reimburse the county for expenses related to this process. The remedies in this section are cumulative and in addition to any other remedy provided by law. The district may pursue remedies alternatively or consecutively. This section does not apply to delinquent fees for electrical service. Section 12811.1 of the Public Utilities Code is repealed. No reimbursement is required by this act as local agencies have the authority to levy charges to pay for mandated services."
