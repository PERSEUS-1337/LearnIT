The Inspector General Act of 1978 is amended to authorize Inspector General agents to carry firearms and make arrests without a warrant while engaged in official duties. The Inspector General Act of 1978 is amended to allow Inspector General agents to carry firearms, make arrests without a warrant for felonies under US laws, and seek warrants for arrest, search, or seizure with probable cause. The Attorney General can authorize these powers if the Office of Inspector General is significantly hindered in its duties due to lack of such powers. The Inspector General Act of 1978 is amended to grant Inspector General offices of various government departments the authority to carry firearms, make warrantless arrests for felonies, and obtain warrants for arrest, search, or seizure with probable cause. This power can be authorized by the Attorney General if other law enforcement assistance is insufficient and internal safeguards are in place to ensure proper exercise of these powers. The Attorney General has the authority to exempt certain government agencies from the initial determination of eligibility requirement. Guidelines for law enforcement powers must be established and followed. The Attorney General can revoke or suspend powers granted to an Inspector General if requirements are not met. Any determinations made by the Attorney General are not subject to court review. The Offices of Inspector General must establish an external review process to ensure proper exercise of law enforcement powers. The review process will involve periodic reviews by another Office of Inspector General or by a designated entity. The Attorney General will be consulted and provided with a copy of the memorandum of understanding outlining the review process. The Offices of Inspector General must establish an external review process for law enforcement powers. Reviews will be conducted periodically by another Office of Inspector General or a designated entity. Results will be communicated in writing to the applicable Inspector General and the Attorney General. No limitations on law enforcement powers under other statutory authority. Initial guidelines will define \"memoranda of understanding\" between the Department of Justice and Inspector General offices. The Attorney General will establish guidelines for Inspector General offices within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. These guidelines will include operational and training requirements outlined in memoranda of understanding. The memoranda of understanding currently in effect will remain until new guidelines are established. Subsection (a) will take effect 180 days after the Act's enactment, while subsection (b) will be effective immediately."
