    "content": "The \"Equity in Fertility Coverage Act of 2005\" is introduced to ensure fairness in prescription drug coverage for fertility treatments under group health plans. This Act aims to amend the Public Health Service Act by adding a new section, SEC. 2707, to address equity in fertility coverage. The \"Equity in Fertility Coverage Act of 2005\" requires group health plans covering impotency medications like Viagra to also cover fertility treatments. Plans can still limit drug coverage and impose cost-sharing as long as it aligns with the Act. Compliance with notice requirements is mandatory. The Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to include new requirements for plans. Section 2723(c) of the Act is also updated. Additionally, ERISA is amended to add a new section to Subpart B of part 7. \"SEC. 714. Equity in fertility coverage.\" Group health plans and health insurance issuers that cover impotency medications like Viagra must also cover fertility treatments. Plans can restrict covered drugs or impose limits on benefits and cost-sharing as long as they comply with the coverage requirement. The section also mandates that these requirements be communicated as a material modification in the plan's terms. The text describes amendments to various sections of the Act related to health plans covering impotency medications and fertility treatments. The changes include ensuring notice of plan requirements and updating the table of contents. Equity in fertility coverage is addressed in an amendment to the Public Health Service Act, specifically in section 2753. The provisions of section 2707 apply to health insurance coverage in the individual market, with notice requirements similar to group health plans. Section 2762(b)(2) is amended to include sections 2751 and 2753. Additionally, section 8902 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to address FEHBP. The amendments made by subsections (a), (b), and (c) of the Public Health Service Act apply to group health plans, health insurance coverage in the individual market, and contracts starting on or after January 1, 2006. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 is also amended for coordinated regulations. The amendments made by this subtitle and section 401 apply to certain provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Public Health Service Act."
