The Act \"Defending Internet Freedom Act of 2014\" stipulates that the Assistant Secretary must submit a certification to congressional committees 60 days before a specified date. If the certification is not submitted, the Assistant Secretary cannot relinquish NTIA responsibilities for Internet domain name functions. If an option to extend the IANA functions contract exists, it must be exercised, otherwise, a new contract meeting specified requirements must be sought. The certification required for relinquishing NTIA responsibilities with regards to Internet domain name functions ensures that control is not held by a governmental body, and ICANN's bylaws are amended to prevent government influence. ICANN upholds freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association, with a standard at least as protective as the First Amendment. A supermajority vote by at least four-fifths of directors is required for bylaw changes. ICANN's bylaws require a supermajority vote for changes, including fees and director removal. Directors have term limits and a transparent selection process linked to key stakeholders in the Internet community. ICANN will have an independent process for resolving disputes with external parties related to its operations. Measures have been adopted to increase transparency in ICANN deliberations and decisions, including public access to board meetings and materials. ICANN will establish policies for public disclosure of records and information, ensuring access similar to the Freedom of Information Act. A private nonprofit corporation called the IANA Consortium, funded and managed by domain registries, will be created separate from ICANN. The IANA Consortium, not ICANN, will handle certain responsibilities. The IANA Consortium, separate from ICANN, will manage the content of root zones and oversee the editing of root zone files by a qualified entity. ICANN will establish an Internet Freedom Panel composed of representatives from the Internet community. The Internet Freedom Panel, composed of representatives from the Internet community, will have the power to review and veto changes to the domain name system proposed by ICANN that threaten freedom of expression, openness, stability, security, and other commitments. The veto decision will be final and cannot be overridden by any ICANN director or officer. ICANN will implement policy decisions unless vetoed by the Internet Freedom Panel. ICANN remains subject to US law and jurisdiction. The US Government will own .gov and .mil domains, and A and B root servers will be in the US. ICANN must conduct and release an audit of its operations. An annual audit of ICANN and the IANA Consortium will be conducted by an internationally recognized auditing firm, with costs covered by ICANN and the Consortium. Neither entity can impose unrelated conditions on registrars or registries, ensuring alignment with ICANN's core mission. The establishment of a joint office of inspector general for ICANN and the IANA Consortium, funded by both entities, with the Inspector General appointed by ICANN's board for a fixed term. The Inspector General will have full access to financial documents and activities of both organizations, and their reports will be publicly available without approval or editing. During the IANA functions contract, specific dates are outlined for giving notice of intent to extend the contract through option periods. Additionally, requirements for a new contract for the performance of IANA are specified. Requirements for a new contract for the performance of IANA functions include being between NTIA and ICANN or another private, nonprofit entity. The contract must provide assurances listed in subsection (b), with adjustments if the contract is with an entity other than ICANN. Definitions for this section are also provided. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The term \"Assistant Secretary\" refers to a specific position within the Department of Commerce. The terms \"base period of performance\" and \"first option period\" are defined in relation to the IANA functions contract. Beginning on October 1, 2015, and ending on September 30, 2017, the IANA Consortium, a private nonprofit corporation, was established to oversee the IANA functions, which are the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority functions. The IANA functions contract, currently held by ICANN, requires them to perform these functions. ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, is overseen by the NTIA, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. Additionally, an Internet Freedom Panel was established as part of this framework. The terms defined in this section include NTIA as the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, second option period as the period for the IANA functions contract from October 1, 2017, to September 30, 2019, and State as each State, the District of Columbia, territories, and federally recognized Indian tribes."
