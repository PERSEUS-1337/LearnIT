    "content": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers various programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty programs, federal contracting opportunities, disaster recovery loans, and entrepreneurial education. It also administers the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program, aimed at stimulating the national economy and providing capital for small businesses. The SBIC program was created to address a gap in the capital markets for long-term funding for growth-oriented small businesses, providing equity financing to businesses for expansion and modernization without incurring debt. The SBIC program was established to provide long-term funding to small businesses for growth and modernization without incurring debt. The program partners with privately owned SBICs licensed by the SBA to facilitate the flow of capital to small businesses. As of December 31, 2018, there were 305 licensed SBICs participating in the program, with the SBA providing $2.52 billion in leverage to SBICs in FY2018. In recent years, the SBIC program has seen increases in leverage provided by the SBA to SBICs through legislative acts. Some argue for further expansion to stimulate economic activity and job creation, while others express concerns about potential losses and increased federal deficit. Some Members and small business advocates propose targeting additional assistance to startup and early stage small businesses to promote economic growth and job creation. Legislation such as the Small Business Investment Enhancement and Tax Relief Act aimed to establish a separate SBIC program for early stage small businesses. The Obama Administration's Startup America Initiative also included a $1 billion early stage SBIC initiative in 2012. Early stage SBICs are required to invest at least 50% in early stage small businesses. SBICs must allocate 50% of investments to early stage small businesses that have never had positive cash flow. The SBA halted new applicants for the early stage SBIC initiative in 2017 and withdrew a proposed rule in 2018 due to lack of interest and support. This report examines SBIC program structure, eligibility requirements, and investment activity. The report discusses the SBA's various SBIC programs, legislative changes, and the two types of SBICs - regular and specialized. The Small Business Administration's SBIC program provides financing to small business entrepreneurs facing social or economic disadvantages. Section 301(d) was repealed in 1997, halting new SSBIC licenses. Existing SSBICs were allowed to continue in the program, with SBICs and SSBICs generally following the same eligibility requirements. Different types of regular SBICs exist, including debenture SBICs, impact investment SBICs, and early stage SBICs. Participating securities SBICs receive leverage through the issuance of redeemable, preferred, equity-type securities. SBICs can be organized as corporations, limited partnerships, or limited liability companies. Ownership of SBICs varies, with some owned by local investors and others wholly owned by commercial banks. Qualified management is a primary criterion for SBIC licensure. The SBA reviews and approves a prospective SBIC's management team based on their professional capabilities and character. They look for at least two principals with investment experience, a track record of superior returns, strong deal flow, a cohesive team with complementary skills, and the ability to manage cash flows. Applying for a SBIC debenture license is a multi-step process. Applying for a SBIC debenture license involves submitting the SBA Management Assessment Questionnaire and a $10,000 licensing fee. The questionnaire covers the fund's legal name, investment strategy, management team's experience, decision-making process, and fund economics. The SBA Management Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ) covers details such as compensation, capitalization, governance structure, and financial forecast for the fund. The Program Development Office reviews the MAQ, assesses the proposal, conducts due diligence, and makes a recommendation to the Investment Committee for review. The Investment Committee, after evaluating the management team through the MAQ and SBA's Program Development Office, invites them for an in-person interview at SBA's headquarters in Washington, DC. If approved, the company receives a \"Green Light\" letter to proceed to the final licensing phase, where they have 18 months to raise private capital with SBA's guidance. Final licensing is granted upon acceptance of a complete licensing application. The SBIC licensing process involves submitting updated forms and raising private capital, with a final licensing fee of $20,000. It typically takes six to eight months from submission to license issuance. New applications for certain programs are no longer accepted. SBIC program eligibility and application details for small businesses are provided in the Appendix. Initially, debenture SBICs needed a minimum private capital investment of $300,000. Debenture SBICs now require a private capital investment of at least $5 million. The SBA may license an applicant with regulatory capital of $3 million under certain conditions. 30% of a debenture SBIC's capital must come from three unaffiliated individuals. No more than 33% of a SBIC's capital may come from state or local government entities. P.L. 102-366 authorized the SBA to guarantee SBIC investments. In 1992, the Small Business Equity Enhancement Act authorized the SBA to guarantee participating securities issued by SBICs. The SBIC Participating Securities Program was established in 1994 to support equity investments in startup and early-stage small businesses. The program was discontinued in 2004 due to projected losses. The SBIC Participating Securities Program was discontinued in 2004 due to a projected loss of $2.7 billion from investments in technology startups and small businesses. The SBA no longer issues new commitments for participating securities, but existing SBICs are allowed to continue operations with special compliance rules. Some Members have shown interest in revising or creating a new program to assist startup and early-stage small businesses. As of December 31, 2018, there were 25 participating securities SBICs in the program with $18.0 million at risk. Participating securities SBICs must have at least $10 million in regulatory capital, but the SBA can allow less if financially viable. 30% of capital must come from unaffiliated individuals, and no more than 33% can come from state or local government. The SBA announced a $1 billion impact investment SBIC initiative on April 7, 2011, with specific requirements for investing in underserved markets and communities. Impact investment SBICs must have a minimum private capital investment of $5 million and can receive up to $80 million in leverage. The SBA increased the maximum leverage available to impact investment SBICs to $150 million in 2013. Nine impact investment SBICs were licensed, managing over $905 million in assets and investing in 81 small businesses by 2018. In FY2018, they invested $106.8 million in 35 small businesses. The SBA stopped accepting new applications for licensed impact investment SBICs in 2017. The SBA established a $1 billion early stage SBIC initiative in 2012, with up to $150 million in leverage in FY2012 and up to $200 million per fiscal year thereafter. The SBA is no longer accepting new applicants for this initiative. The SBA's early stage SBIC initiative in 2012 focused on financing early stage small businesses with new regulatory provisions to reduce default risk and improve recovery prospects. Early stage SBICs are required to raise more regulatory capital, have special distribution rules, and receive less leverage compared to other types of SBICs. The SBA's early stage SBIC initiative in 2012 aimed to finance early stage small businesses with reduced default risk and improved recovery prospects. Early stage SBICs have lower leverage (up to 100% of regulatory capital, $50 million maximum) compared to other SBIC types. The SBA issued Green Light letters to six venture capital funds in October 2012, inviting them to apply for a license as early stage SBICs. Five of the 63 investment funds that applied to become licensed early stage SBICs were granted licenses. These five SBICs raised $251.3 million in private capital, received $138.4 million in SBA-guaranteed leverage, had $43.7 million in outstanding commitments, and invested $267.5 million in 82 small businesses. In FY2018, they invested $47.1 million in 36 small businesses. The SBA proposed changes to the program to attract more qualified fund managers and indicated its intention to continue the initiative beyond its initial five-year term. The SBA proposed changes to the early stage SBIC initiative, including withdrawing a proposed rule in 2018. Different types of SBICs have varying capital requirements, leverage amounts, investment nature, repayment requirements, and profit participation. SBICs provide equity capital to small businesses through various means. SBICs provide equity capital to small businesses through various means, such as investing in small business equity securities, making loans with a maturity of no more than 20 years, purchasing convertible debt securities, and providing guarantees for monetary obligations. SBICs are restricted from providing financing to associates, controlling small businesses permanently, or making investments without SBA approval. SBICs are prohibited from investing in certain types of businesses, such as farmland, unimproved land, or real estate businesses. They are also restricted from providing funds to businesses that primarily provide funds to others or engage in debt obligations. The Small Business Administration (SBA) regulates interest rates and fees for Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs) providing loans, debt securities, and equity financing to small businesses. In 1999, the SBA introduced the low and moderate income investments (LMI) initiative to encourage SBICs to invest in businesses in underserved areas. This initiative offers incentives for investing in businesses with a significant presence in low-to-moderate income areas. LMI debentures are available in two maturities, 5 years and 10 years, with a stub period between issuance and March 1 or September 1. They are issued at a discount, reducing proceeds by interest costs, SBA fees, and a 2% leverage fee. This defers interest payments and annual fees for SBICs investing in LMI Zones. In FY2018, SBICs made 609 investments in small businesses located in a LMI Zone, totaling nearly $1.03 billion\u2014about 18.6% of the total amount invested. Energy Saving Debentures, authorized by P.L. 110-140, are structured similarly to LMI debentures with no interest payments or SBA annual charge for the first five years. The SBA provides financial assistance to SBICs through a conditional commitment to reserve leverage for future use. SBICs draw down the leverage as they make financial commitments, with the SBA accepting draw applications twice a month. Approved draws result in a payment voucher issued to the SBIC, allowing for daily fund withdrawals. A debenture is executed with each draw, held by a bank agent until it can be pooled and sold. The SBA provides interim funding to SBICs until debentures can be pooled and sold to the public every six months. The debentures are purchased and pooled by an entity called the Investment Trust, guaranteed by the SBA, securitized, and sold as trust certificates to investors in the public market. The SBA operates the SBIC program on a zero-subsidy basis, charging fees to recoup expenses in case of defaults. A licensed debenture SBIC can apply for financial assistance of up to 300% of its private capital, although traditionally approved for a maximum of 200%. Debenture SBICs can obtain leverage up to $175 million per SBIC and $350 million for two or more licenses. They use SBA-guaranteed debenture participation trust certificates with a term of up to 15 years, but recent offerings have a 10-year term. Payments include interest, SBA's annual charge, and principal at maturity. Prepayment is allowed in full, not in part. The SBA-guaranteed debenture must be prepaid in whole on a semiannual payment date. The interest rate is determined by market conditions and the 10-year Treasury securities rate. LMI debentures are available for 5 or 10 years. Investors are more likely to purchase debenture participation trust certificates due to the SBA guarantee, accepting lower interest rates. This enhances access to venture capital and reduces the cost of raising financial resources for SBICs. The SBA focuses on investing in mid- and later-stage small businesses with positive cash flow to make semiannual payments on debentures and SBA charges. Small businesses seek capital for expansion. Participating securities SBICs can leverage up to 200% of their private capital. Leverage is obtained by issuing SBA-guaranteed participating securities, with a maximum limit of $175 million per SBIC and $350 million for multiple licenses under common control. SBICs leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed participating securities, which are pooled and sold as certificates to investors. Recent public offerings had a 10-year term, totaling nearly $10.3 billion from 35 offerings. The final certificate, worth $332 million, was offered in February 2009 with quarterly payments to investors. The SBA-guaranteed participating securities SBICs make quarterly payments to investors from dividends, interest, or returns on principal. The SBA may step in to make payments if the SBIC is unable to, especially in the early years when startups may not be profitable. Investors are guaranteed reimbursement by the SBIC over the life of the security. Investors are more likely to purchase SBIC participating securities certificates due to the SBA guarantee, accepting lower payment rates. Participating securities SBICs focus on long-term growth rather than immediate cash flow, with the SBA guaranteeing quarterly payments to investors. As of December 31, 2018, the SBA had a guarantee on an outstanding unpaid principal balance of $11.3 billion. The SBA had guarantees on $11.3 billion in SBIC debentures, $18.0 million in SBIC participating securities, and $56.7 million in other financings as of December 31, 2018. The Impact Investment SBIC Initiative targets underserved markets and communities. InvestMichigan! Mezzanine Fund was the first impact investment SBIC licensee. Licensed impact investment SBICs can apply for leverage up to 300% of their private capital, limited to $175 million. The SBA established the Early Stage Innovation SBIC Initiative in 2012 to provide leverage of up to 100% of private capital, limited to $50 million for early stage SBICs. These SBICs obtain leverage through SBA-guaranteed debentures and have an expedited application review process. Early stage SBICs can obtain leverage through SBA-guaranteed debentures with terms of up to 10 years. There are two forms of early stage debentures: standard and discounted. Quarterly payments are required for interest and the SBA's annual charge. Additionally, early stage SBICs must maintain a reserve to cover these payments. Early stage SBICs can obtain leverage through SBA-guaranteed debentures with terms of up to 10 years. There are two forms of early stage debentures: standard and discounted. Standard debentures require quarterly payments, while discounted debentures are issued at a discount and eliminate the need for early stage SBICs to make interest payments for the first five years. Early stage SBICs can obtain leverage through SBA-guaranteed debentures with terms of up to 10 years. There are two forms of early stage debentures: standard and discounted. Standard debentures require quarterly payments, while discounted debentures are issued at a discount and eliminate the need for early stage SBICs to make interest payments for the first five years. Early stage discounted debentures do not require interest payments or payments on the SBA's annual charge for five years, making them suitable for investments in small businesses without positive cash flow. SBICs must file annual financial reports with the SBA and undergo annual on-site regulatory checks. SBICs must provide annual financial reports and undergo on-site regulatory checks by a SBA-approved accountant. They must also submit portfolio financing reports and valuations within specific timeframes, report material changes quarterly, and disclose various documents to the SBA. As of December 31, 2018, there were 305 licensed SBICs in operation. In 2018, there were 305 licensed SBICs in operation, including debenture SBICs, participating securities SBICs, bank-owned SBICs, and SSBICs. The number of debenture SBICs has increased, but the total number of licensed SBICs has remained stable due to reductions in participating securities SBICs and SSBICs. The SBA aims to issue more new debenture SBIC licenses for program growth. SBICs invest in various industries, regions, and investment stages, with some specializing in specific fields or stages. In 2018, SBICs invested approximately $97.6 billion in 181,185 financings to small businesses. The SBA had guarantees on outstanding balances totaling $11.3 billion in SBIC debentures. Including private investment, the SBIC program had invested or committed about $30.3 billion in small businesses by December 2018. In FY2018, SBICs made 2,711 financings with an average amount of $2,029,730. In FY2018, SBIC funds were used for acquiring existing businesses, operating capital, refinancing debt, new construction, research, machinery, marketing, and other purposes. Total SBIC financing declined during the recession but has generally increased since FY2011. The SBA committed to guarantee $2.52 billion in SBIC investments, with an additional $2.98 billion from private capital, totaling $5.50 billion for 1,151 small businesses. SBA leverage as a share of total financing has also increased in recent years. The SBA's leverage commitments have increased in recent years, accounting for a significant percentage of total financing. Private venture capital firms have also seen an increase in investments over the years. Urban Institute analyzed debenture SBIC investments from 1997 to 2005, comparing them to private-sector venture capital investments in second and third stage business loans. They found that SBIC investments accounted for over 62% of all venture capital financings in the US during that period, but only 8% of total dollars invested due to smaller average investment amounts. In FY2018, SBICs made 130 financings totaling $132.4 million to minority-owned and -controlled businesses. In FY2018, SBICs made 130 financings totaling $132.4 million to minority-owned and -controlled small businesses, as well as financings to women-owned and veteran-owned small businesses. Research on private venture capital investment in minority-owned or women-owned small businesses is limited, making it challenging to compare SBIC program investments to the private sector. The SBA acknowledged low representation of women and minorities in the SBIC program in 2007. The SBA has tried to increase women and minority representation in the SBIC program by reaching out to venture capital firms and trade organizations. Despite these efforts, the Small Business Investor Alliance criticized the SBA's licensing process for not attracting funds led by women and minorities. The Act of 2009 aimed to encourage SBIC investments in women-owned and disadvantaged small businesses by increasing leverage for SBICs investing in these businesses. In FY2018, SBICs provided financing to small businesses in various states, with California, Texas, and New York receiving the most financing. The 2008 Urban Institute analysis compared debenture SBIC financing to private venture capital funds from 1997 to 2005. California and Massachusetts received the largest share of private venture capital funds, while New York and California received the largest share of debenture SBIC investments. Top 10 states accounted for 84% of total private venture capital investments. In 2018, private venture capital funds accounted for 84% of total investments, with California, New York, Massachusetts, and Texas receiving the largest shares. This distribution contrasts with SBIC investments, which were more evenly spread across the nation. In FY2018, California, New York, Texas, and Illinois accounted for 41.9% of total SBIC investments. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 aimed to increase leverage for SBICs and promote investment in smaller enterprises. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 defined smaller enterprises for SBIC investments and encouraged investments in low-income areas. The Obama Administration recommended increasing the SBIC program's annual authorization to $4 billion and expanding SBA leverage for licensees. The SBA increased the multiple licenses/family of funds limit to $350 million from $225 million. They also established the Early Stage Innovation SBIC Initiative with a $1 billion limit to encourage investments in early stage small businesses. Several bills have been introduced to expand the SBIC program further. Some Members and small business advocates propose legislation for a \"permanent\" SBIC program targeting assistance to startup and early stage small businesses. This is seen as filling an investment gap left by the SBA's focus on mid- and later-stage businesses. Legislation has been introduced to create a new SBA program focusing on the needs of startup and early stage small businesses. During the 111th Congress, the House passed H.R. 5297, the Small Business Jobs and Credit Act of 2010, which included a $1 billion Small Business Early Stage Investment Program. The program aimed to provide equity investment financing of up to $100 million to participating investment companies, with a focus on investing in early stage small businesses with annual sales revenues below $15 million. The program emphasized venture capital investments in startup companies in nine targeted industries. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, signed into law by President Obama, did not include a Small Business Early Stage Investment Program. Instead, it authorized a three-year Intermediary Lending Pilot Program providing direct loans to nonprofit lending intermediaries. The program funded for two years with 36 lenders participating. In 2012, the SBA established the early stage SBIC initiative to encourage investments in early stage small businesses. During the 113th Congress, legislation was introduced to establish a separate SBIC program for early stage small businesses. Advocates argue that the SBA's elimination of the SBIC participating securities program has created a gap in capital access for early stage small businesses. Representative Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez highlighted the importance of this legislation during congressional consideration. During congressional consideration of H.R. 5297, it was noted that small businesses are increasingly turning to equity investment due to stricter credit standards and decreased access to venture capital. The termination of the Small Business Investment Company Participating Securities program has left many entrepreneurs without a source of financing for their business plans. Opponents of efforts to encourage capital investment in startup and early stage small businesses argue that it could add unnecessary risk or costs to taxpayers. The Small Business Early Stage Investment Program faced criticism for being untested and potentially promoting risky investments. The Small Business Investor Alliance believes the SBIC program is underused and suggests increasing financing levels by improving licensing procedures and allowing more SBIC regulatory capital from state or local sources. The SBIC program saw changes during the 111th Congress, with an increase in the percentage of SBIC regulatory capital allowed from state or local government entities to 45% from 33%. This was part of efforts to encourage greater use of the program for small business financing and investment. The SBIC program's regulatory capital allowed from state or local government entities was increased to 45% from 33%. Additionally, the program's limits for multiple licenses/family of funds and funds under common control were raised, along with the authorization level to $5.5 billion from $3.0 billion in FY2011. The Obama Administration recommended increasing the SBIC program's annual authorization to $4 billion from $3 billion as part of the Startup America Initiative. During the 112th Congress, legislation was proposed to increase the maximum amount of SBA leverage available to SBIC licensees under common control to $350 million from $225 million. H.R. 3219 aimed to boost SBIC program utilization by raising the maximum leverage for single licensed SBICs to $200 million if managers have experience in managing SBIC companies. S. 2136 sought to increase the maximum leverage permitted under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to encourage greater program use. The INVEST in America Act of 2012, proposed under title III of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, aimed to increase the maximum amount of outstanding SBA leverage available to SBIC licensees under common control to $350 million from $225 million. It also sought to raise the SBIC program's authorization level to $4 billion from $3 billion. This amendment was offered as part of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, which was later passed by the Senate. The Senate passed H.R. 3606 with amendments, increasing the SBIC program's authorization level to $4 billion from $3 billion. President Obama signed the bill into law. Other proposed acts aimed to further increase the program's authorization amount and adjust leverage limits. During the 113th and 114th Congress, legislation increased the SBIC program's authorization amount to $4 billion and raised the multiple licenses/family of funds limit to $350 million from $225 million. The Small Business Investment Opportunity Act of 2017 increased the maximum leverage for individual SBICs to $175 million from $150 million. The goal of the SBIC program is to improve capital access for small businesses by increasing the number of funds licensed and the amount of leverage issued. The Small Business Investment Opportunity Act of 2017 increased the maximum leverage for individual SBICs to $175 million from $150 million. Additionally, legislation such as ARRA and P.L. 113-76 have increased leverage limits for SBICs, with P.L. 113-76 authorizing the SBA to provide up to $4 billion in leverage to SBICs. Advocates argue for increasing SBIC program leverage limits to $175 million to fill a gap in SBA capital access programs. Concerns exist about taxpayer risk with expanded SBIC program targeting startup and early stage businesses. Some Members of Congress suggest providing additional resources for small businesses to acquire necessary capital. Advocates propose increasing SBIC program leverage limits to $175 million to address SBA capital access gaps. Additional resources are suggested to help small businesses acquire necessary capital for operations and job creation. Senator Snowe's amendment aims to raise SBIC debt guarantees from $3 billion to $4 billion, with bipartisan support and no controversy. The bipartisan SBIC provisions in this amendment aim to increase capital access for small businesses like Apple and FedEx, creating jobs and economic growth. This legislation ensures entrepreneurs have the resources needed for success, urging Congress to approve the amendment for America's job creators. Capital-starved startup small businesses are crucial in leading the Nation out of the economic downturn. Private investment funds struggle to support transactions below $5 million, but SBICs are working to fill that gap. Some are concerned about the potential risk of an expanded SBIC program increasing the federal deficit. Representative Sam Graves suggests reducing business taxes and exercising fiscal restraint to assist small businesses, promote economic growth, and create jobs. In FY2013, the House Small Business Committee supported increasing the SBIC program's authorization to $4 billion. However, they opposed funding for certain SBIC initiatives due to concerns about potential losses. Representative Graves emphasized the financial soundness of the debenture SBIC program, stating that no changes are needed as it operates without federal funds. The SBA budget fully supports the SBIC program operating on a zero subsidy basis. The program level is recommended to be raised from $3 billion to $4 billion, with some of the additional funds allocated for new initiatives. The Committee opposes funding for new variations in the Debenture SBIC Program and emphasizes protecting the existing program. The House Committee on Small Business opposes funding for new variations in the Debenture SBIC Program and recommends modifications to ensure the program operates at zero subsidy without fee increases. Congressional debate focuses on small businesses' access to capital, program risk, and potential impacts of proposed changes. The SBIC program's risk, potential impact on the federal deficit, and small business eligibility requirements are key points of debate. Empirical analysis of economic data can inform discussions on small businesses' access to capital and the program's risk. Businesses must meet SBA's size standards to participate in the program. The SBIC program's alternative size standard, effective since July 14, 2014, requires tangible net worth not exceeding $19.5 million and average net income after taxes not exceeding $6.5 million for the past two fiscal years. Companies must also set aside a percentage of financing for smaller businesses. The Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program requires companies to invest a percentage of their financing in smaller enterprises. The program sets criteria for what qualifies as a smaller enterprise, including net worth and income thresholds. Additionally, SBICs licensed before February 17, 2009, have specific requirements for investing in smaller enterprises based on their SBA leverage commitments. SBICs have restrictions on investments, such as not investing in other SBICs, finance companies, unimproved real estate, or businesses with less than 51% of assets in the US. They also cannot fund businesses contrary to public interest or for foreign operations. Small business owners can find active SBICs through the SBA directory for financing. The SBA directory provides contact information for licensed SBICs, sorted by state, along with details on financing size range, capital type, funding stage preference, industry preference, geographic preference, and firm focus. Small business owners present a business plan to the chosen SBIC, addressing operations, management, financial condition, and funding requirements. A typical business plan includes information such as the business name, location, organization type, product description, history, customer base, and technical attributes. The business plan should include detailed information about the products, facilities, customer base, marketing survey, distribution system, competitive conditions, pricing policies, management personnel, financial statements, projections, and funding requested. The business plan should include detailed information about products, facilities, customer base, marketing survey, distribution system, competitive conditions, pricing policies, management personnel, financial statements, projections, and funding requested. Small business owners are advised to seek a personal referral to increase the likelihood of their business plan being carefully considered by SBIC fund managers. SBICs conduct thorough studies before making final financing decisions, which could take several weeks or longer."
