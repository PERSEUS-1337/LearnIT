The \"Keep Students in School Act of 2016\" authorizes the Secretary of Education to establish a grant program for local educational agencies. Grants are awarded for a 5-year period and cannot be renewed. Agencies must submit an application to use funds for attendance programs at elementary and secondary schools. The \"Keep Students in School Act of 2016\" allows schools to collect attendance electronically, share data with the local educational agency and other schools, and use the data for intervention strategies. It also funds after-school programs, recreational activities, and a teacher training program. The teacher training and development program focuses on racial inequality and poverty. Policies include making zero tolerance policies more compatible with student retention, establishing a student absence policy, and collaborating on youth violence prevention. Youth violence prevention and support for parents of at-risk children are key focuses. Collaboration with local agencies and social workers is emphasized. Providing resources, school counseling services, and access to support are highlighted. Additionally, establishing or expanding a mentoring program is recommended. Licensed social workers are required for elementary and high schools. Community volunteers must meet with at-risk children for at least 5 hours per week to provide homework assistance and encourage attendance. The Secretary will offer technical assistance to local educational agencies that receive grants to achieve the goals of the program. Additionally, a task force will be established to address the challenges faced by disadvantaged youth. The Secretary will establish a task force by December 31, 2017, to develop a work plan addressing hardships faced by disadvantaged youth in school, including home, economic, and school environment factors. The task force established by the Secretary will address hardships faced by disadvantaged youth in school, including overcrowded classrooms, discriminatory attitudes, hostility from other students, lack of flexibility for cultural or learning needs, inconsistent truancy procedures, personal hardships like learning difficulties, drug abuse, and mental health issues. The task force will coordinate interagency efforts, assess Federal programs' effectiveness, and develop a work plan to improve programs by eliminating ineffective ones. The task force aims to improve programs for disadvantaged youth by eliminating ineffective ones, redirecting resources, and consolidating successful efforts. Positive youth development practices will be incorporated into the work plan. Reports, including an assessment and work plan, will be submitted to Congress within 3 years of the task force's establishment. The task force will submit a final report to Congress within 3 years, detailing the results of implementing the work plan and providing recommendations for practices to help disadvantaged youth in schools.
