    "content": "Americans have a tradition, rooted in England and developed in the early years of the nation, that rebels against military involvement in civilian affairs. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of the Army and Air Force for civil law enforcement, except when authorized by Congress in extraordinary circumstances. Balancing the rule and exceptions of this tradition is crucial to prevent unchecked rebellions or tragedies like the Boston Massacre. Recent concerns include the potential overwhelm of civil authorities by natural disasters, civil disturbances, drug trafficking, and terrorism. The Magna Carta and subsequent legislation established the Anglo-American tradition against military involvement in civilian affairs, emphasizing due process of law. Lord Coke and Parliament members later reaffirmed these principles. In response to King Charles I's use of martial law in peacetime, Parliament passed the Petition of Right of 1628, outlawing quartering troops and martial law commissions. This led to colonial unrest when British troops were quartered in Boston, seen as a violation of English law. The circumstances surrounding the question in the colonies differed from the Petition of Right in England. Troops were stationed in the colonies for protection against the French and Indians, with military governorships in other territories. However, there was no military usurpation of judicial functions, as colonists were subject to civilian justice. Soldiers who used excessive force were tried in civilian courts, as seen in the trials of soldiers involved in the Boston Massacre. The Declaration of Independence listed grievances against Great Britain for keeping standing armies without consent, rendering the military independent of civil power, and quartering troops among civilians. The Articles of Confederation limited the size of peacetime armed forces to only what was necessary for defense. The Constitution emphasized civilian control over the military, with the President as Commander in Chief and Congress empowered to raise armies and maintain a navy. The Bill of Rights protected against quartering troops in private homes and affirmed the right to bear arms for a well-regulated militia. The Constitution allows Congress to call out the militia for various purposes. Presidents have used this authority for riot control and enforcing federal law. The President's power to use state militia to suppress insurrections is similar to the sheriff's authority to call upon the posse comitatus. The President's power to call out the militia for law enforcement purposes is similar to the sheriff's authority to summon the posse comitatus. Congress has specifically authorized the use of the posse comitatus in some cases, such as under the Fugitive Slave Act. In 1850, the Fugitive Slave Act allowed federal marshals to request assistance from police and state militia to prevent abolitionists from rescuing a fugitive slave. A federal marshal in Chicago did so in 1851 and filed a claim for reimbursement of funds paid to the responders. Attorney General Caleb Cushing's response addressed the broader principle of military members assisting in law enforcement under the Act. In 1854, Attorney General Cushing declared that members of the military were part of the posse comitatus, obligated to obey commands of civil law enforcement authorities. This opinion justified the use of federal troops in conflicts like pro and anti-slavery disputes. After partisan involvement in the conflict between pro and anti-slavery forces in Kansas, Congress reacted by forbidding the use of military forces to enforce territorial law in Kansas. The use of federal troops to execute laws continued after the Civil War, particularly in former Confederate states. By 1877, Republican state governments in the South relied on the presence of the military, potentially influencing the outcome of the Hayes-Tilden presidential election. The Democratic majority passed an Army appropriation bill prohibiting the use of the Army to support Republican state governments in the South. The Senate, controlled by Republicans, rejected the provision, leading to a session ending without the bill's passage. A special session later appropriated money for the Army without restrictions. The House included a posse comitatus section in the next Army appropriations bill, which has remained largely unchanged since, with some exceptions authorized by Congress. The Posse Comitatus Act raises constitutional questions regarding the extent to which it aligns with constitutional requirements and limits the powers of the President and Congress. Lord Coke and his colleagues found a prohibition against martial law in the Magna Carta, which serves as the basis for constitutional due process clauses. The Declaration of Independence condemns the imposition of martial law as a violation of fundamental liberties and a reason for breaking ties with Great Britain. The Second, Third, and Fifth Amendments reflect a constitutional principle against the use of armed forces to address civilian issues, supported by judicial reluctance towards military tribunals. The Supreme Court has shown reluctance to recognize military tribunals' authority over civilians, with possible anti-martial law principles in certain cases. However, the constitutional boundaries of the Third and Second Amendments remain unclear, and courts have avoided delving into the constitutional underpinnings of the Posse Comitatus Act. Without more judicial guidance, traditional reservations persist. Without clear judicial guidance, traditional reservations about military involvement in civilian law only become constitutionally imperative when they violate explicit constitutional guarantees like the right to jury trial or freedom from unreasonable searches. Congress' authority to adjust the Posse Comitatus Act involves balancing Congressional and Presidential powers, with conflicts arising from the President's duty to faithfully execute laws and command the armed forces. The Presidency holds extensive responsibilities and broad prerogatives, including protection against invasion and domestic violence as guaranteed by the Constitution. The President can exercise powers without explicit authorization, such as appointing a marshal to protect a Supreme Court justice in an emergency. The President must also defend against invasion and threats to interstate commerce or mail transportation. The President has the authority to protect against invasion and threats to interstate commerce or mail transportation by calling upon the army and militia if necessary. Congress also shares power over laws and armed forces with the President, giving them the authority to establish, maintain, and regulate the armed forces. The President has the authority, along with Congress, to establish, maintain, and regulate the armed forces. The Supreme Court has clarified the coordination of Presidential and Congressional powers regarding the use of the military to enforce civilian law. The President's power under the guarantee clause of Article IV is provisional until Congress acts, and the President cannot always use armed forces for a domestic emergency if Congress has not approved. The Posse Comitatus Act does not always limit the exercise of the President's constitutional powers. It does not apply in cases expressly authorized by the Constitution or by an act of Congress. The Act does not prohibit the use of the military to execute the law in certain circumstances. The Posse Comitatus Act originally included a constitutional exception allowing the use of the military to execute the law in certain instances. The compromise reached in Congress upheld the differing views on the President's powers to use the armed forces. Older commentaries suggest that the word \"expressly\" in the Act should be ignored to avoid constitutional issues. The Posse Comitatus Act includes a constitutional exception for using the military in certain instances, such as sudden emergencies and protection of federal property. Congress can authorize the military to execute the law in three ways, giving them civilian law enforcement authority or establishing general rules. The question of whether Congress can restrict the President's powers in this area remains unanswered by the courts. The Posse Comitatus Act allows for the military to have civilian law enforcement authority in certain situations, with Congress authorizing this through various means. The Act has vested the Coast Guard with broad law enforcement responsibilities and enacted specific statutes for calling out the armed forces in times of insurrection. Additionally, general legislation permits the armed forces to share information and equipment with civilian law enforcement agencies. The question of how explicit a statutory exception must be remains unresolved. The Posse Comitatus Act allows for military involvement in civilian law enforcement under specific circumstances authorized by Congress. Some argue that statutes authorizing assistance from federal agencies qualify as exceptions, even if they do not mention the military. The use of military force in civilian affairs is considered extraordinary and should not be presumed. In 1981, Congress enacted general law enforcement exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act prohibitions to address issues arising from the Wounded Knee cases in South Dakota. The cases involved an armed crowd looting a trading post, leading to federal involvement by FBI agents, U.S. marshals, and Bureau of Indian Affairs police. The 1981 legislation addressed issues from the Wounded Knee cases, involving federal criminal charges for obstructing law enforcement during a civil disturbance. Military assistance at Wounded Knee affected the prosecution's case. The legislation granted authority and restrictions on military assistance to police, including sharing information and equipment. The cases raised questions about military sharing information with civilian law enforcement under Section 371. Section 371 of the 1981 legislation permits the armed forces to share information acquired during military operations and encourages planning activities for incidental civilian benefits. It also allows the use of military undercover agents and intelligence collection related to civilian activities with a military purpose nexus. Section 373 permits military personnel to train civilian police on equipment operation and maintenance, providing expert advice regardless of equipment origin. Congress clarifies that \"expert advice\" does not imply active military participation in civilian police activities. The 1981 legislation allows the Defense Department to provide civilian police with military equipment and training, including expert advice on equipment operation and maintenance. This does not constitute active military participation in civilian police activities. The 1981 legislation allows the Defense Department to provide civilian police with military equipment and training, including expert advice on equipment operation and maintenance. This authority is subject to limitations to ensure it does not undermine US military capability, require reimbursement from civilian beneficiaries, and prevent the use of armed forces for civilian law enforcement purposes. The regulations in section 375 of the Code of Federal Regulations and a Defense Department Directive prohibit the use of military personnel for certain activities. This includes interdiction, search and seizure, arrest, surveillance, and pursuit of individuals. While these provisions have been removed from the CFR, the Directive remains in effect, allowing the armed forces to perform military responsibilities beyond the reach of the Posse Comitatus Act. The Posse Comitatus Act and its supplements do not limit the Army from performing military duties that incidentally benefit civilian law enforcement. Courts and commentators believe that as long as the primary purpose is military, assisting law enforcement is permissible. The Posse Comitatus Act does not restrict the military from maintaining order on military installations. Courts have ruled that military personnel can assist civilian law enforcement in certain situations without violating the Act, such as turning over armed felons, drunk drivers, or stolen firearms found on military bases. Additionally, military personnel can arrest civilians for crimes committed on military facilities or assist civilian police investigations on base. The military can assist civilian police investigations on military facilities, with the DoD Directive allowing military law enforcement to investigate off-base conduct of military personnel. The Act limits prosecution to \"willful\" misuse of the Army or Air Force, with varying interpretations of the military purpose doctrine in cooperative police activities off-base. The compromise from the conference on the Act limits prosecution to \"willful\" violations of the Army or Air Force use, but the exact meaning of this limitation is unclear. The language of the Act is broad and could potentially restrict the military from implementing any state or federal law, raising questions about its scope and application. Existing case law and commentary suggest that violations of the Posse Comitatus Act occur when the armed forces perform tasks typically designated for civilian government agencies. This often arises when the military assists civilian police, which was the primary concern that led to the Act's passage. Members of Congress cited instances where the Army acted as a police force in labor disputes, tax collection, executing warrants, and maintaining order at polling stations. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the military from performing tasks typically designated for civilian government agencies, such as assisting civilian police. Courts use tests to determine violations, developed from incidents at Wounded Knee. The tests focus on whether civilian law enforcement made direct use of military investigators, if military activities pervaded civilian officials' actions, or if military power was used in a regulatory manner. Most cases applying these tests found violations. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits military involvement in civilian law enforcement, with tests used to determine violations. Most cases found that military assistance to civilian law enforcement did not violate the Act. The Act applies to the Army and Air Force but not the Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or National Guard. The original amendment aimed to restrict all branches from executing the law, but was limited to the Army to avoid challenges. The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to the Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard, but they are subject to similar restrictions through administrative and legislative supplements. The Coast Guard, originally formed from civilian agencies, is now a branch of the armed forces under the Department of Transportation. The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to the Coast Guard while part of the Navy, but it is subject to the orders of the Secretary of the Navy and authorized to perform law enforcement functions. The Act is silent on what constitutes \"part\" of the Army or Air Force for proscription. The Posse Comitatus Act does not clearly define the coverage of the National Guard, Civil Air Patrol, or civilian employees of the armed forces. The Act predates the National Guard but considers it part of the Army or Air Force when in federal service. When not in federal service, historical reflection suggests it may still be covered by the Act. The Posse Comitatus Act's reference to \"posse comitatus or otherwise\" is a response to the assertion that troops could be used to execute the law as long as they were acting as citizens and not soldiers. The National Guard, as a creature of both state and federal law, is not covered by the Act when not in federal service. The DoD directive only applies to National Guard members in federal service. Historical perspective suggests uncertainty on whether the Act extends to soldiers. The Posse Comitatus Act was passed in response to cases where military members were used based on civic obligations. Some cases suggest that soldiers assisting civilian law enforcement in a manner any citizen would be permitted is not a violation of the Act. Recent decisions focus on the nature of the assistance provided. Some commentators have questioned whether civilian employees of the armed forces should be subject to the Posse Comitatus Act, but most consider them part of the armed forces. The Defense Department Directive includes civilian employees under the Act's policy restrictions if they are under the direct command of a military officer. The Act likely only applies within the United States and its territories unless Congress specifies otherwise. The Posse Comitatus Act likely only applies within the United States and its territories unless Congress specifies otherwise for civilian employees of the armed forces. Congress did not express extraterritorial application for the Act, which was enacted in response to problems within the US and its territories. The first court to address extraterritorial application was in occupied territory overseas. Subsequent decisions either declined to resolve or ignored the issue. The Posse Comitatus Act's authority and restrictions in 10 U.S.C. 371-381 are intended to apply both in the United States and beyond its borders. The regulations implementing 10 U.S.C. 375 address assistance to law enforcement officials within the country, without explicitly stating the ban's scope. Overseas assistance to foreign law enforcement officials is governed by the Mansfield Amendment, 22 U.S.C. 2291(c). The Mansfield Amendment, 22 U.S.C. 2291(c), acts as an overseas version of the Posse Comitatus Act for drug enforcement purposes. The Posse Comitatus Act has rarely been prosecuted but has been used to challenge court jurisdiction, suppress evidence, and defend against civil liability. Violations of the Act are often alleged by defendants to exclude related testimony or evidence. The case law on this issue began with United States v. Walden, where the use of Marines as undercover agents was questioned in an investigation of firearms offenses. The court found that the use of three Marines as undercover agents in an investigation of firearms offenses violated Navy regulations, but declined to exclude evidence obtained by the Marines. The court determined that there was no deliberate intent to violate the regulations or the Posse Comitatus Act. It noted the lack of enforcement mechanisms in the regulation and the Act only provided for criminal prosecution. The court considered the use of Marines as aberrational and unlikely to be repeated, but warned of consequences for future widespread violations. The court warned of consequences for future violations, including the possibility of adopting an exclusionary rule as a deterrent. Some recent cases have required the suppression of evidence from military undercover operations targeting civilian drug dealing without a connection to military activities. The first criminal defendants to invoke the Posse Comitatus Act were unsuccessful in claiming military transport. The Posse Comitatus Act was unsuccessfully invoked by criminal defendants who were transported back to the United States for trial, claiming it violated the Act and undermined the jurisdiction of American courts. Courts have ruled that dismissal is not an appropriate remedy for Posse Comitatus Act violations, even in cases where defendants were returned from countries under American military rule. Defendants have found the Posse Comitatus Act helpful in prosecutions where the government must establish the lawfulness of its conduct. Violations of the Act have been used as a defense in obstructing law enforcement cases. A violation of the Act may constitute an unreasonable search and seizure, leading to a Bivens cause of action against federal officers. However, a violation of the Act also provides the government with a defense against claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act. The Posse Comitatus Act is rarely raised in civil cases, but it has a significant impact on military compliance. The armed forces have a longstanding practice of avoiding involvement in civilian affairs contrary to the Act.
