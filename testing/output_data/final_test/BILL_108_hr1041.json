    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Distributed Power Hybrid Energy Act\". The Congress finds that renewable energy resources can diversify the nation's energy portfolio with minimal environmental impact. Distributed power hybrid systems can enhance the cost-effectiveness of utilizing renewable resources by reducing intermittency. These systems can also benefit consumers by shielding them from energy price volatility and improving supply reliability. The Congress aims to increase energy supply reliability, minimize costs of power outages, expand energy reserve, reduce environmental impacts, and address local power and economic development needs. To achieve these benefits, market barriers to distributed power hybrid systems adoption must be removed. The Congress aims to remove market barriers to distributed power hybrid systems adoption by providing tools for assessing renewable energy resources, developing technological foundations, and implementing policy frameworks like net metering. Components for these systems are available or under development in existing programs. The current lack of coherent efforts to integrate components into distributed power hybrid systems that maximize benefits to consumers in a safe manner is a significant issue. The lack of coherent efforts to integrate components into distributed power hybrid systems is a significant issue. SEC. 3 defines key terms. The Act defines key terms related to distributed power hybrid systems, including the definition of distributed power hybrid system and distributed power source. The Act defines key terms related to distributed power hybrid systems, including biomass, geothermal, and cogeneration systems. The Act defines key terms related to distributed power hybrid systems, including biomass, geothermal, and cogeneration systems. SEC. 4. STRATEGY. The Secretary of Energy must develop and present a strategy to Congress within a year of this Act's enactment. The strategy will outline opportunities, barriers, technology gaps, and system integration tools needed for distributed power hybrid systems. This includes tools for planning, designing, building, and operating these systems efficiently and cleanly. The strategy for distributed power hybrid systems includes developing software, sensors, controls, and hardware, conducting field tests and demonstrations, creating design tools, and collecting data on grid operations and interconnection requirements. The Secretary of Energy will implement the strategy for distributed power hybrid systems, integrating activities with the Department's Office of Distributed Energy Resources. The Secretary of Energy will provide Congress with annual reports on the use of distributed power hybrid systems in the US and research issues. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $5,000,000 for 2004, $10,000,000 for 2005, $20,000,000 for 2006 and 2007, and $5,000,000 for 2008."
