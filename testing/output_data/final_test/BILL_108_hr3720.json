The Congress finds that a significant percentage of high school seniors in 2001 had used illicit drugs and alcohol, with a notable increase in MDMA (ecstasy) use among 12th graders. This substance abuse poses risks to the health and safety of schoolchildren. Illicit drugs and alcohol pose health risks to students, impacting their ability to learn. Marijuana and ecstasy can harm brain cells, leading to disruptive behavior in the classroom. Smoking cigarettes or using drugs reduces students' desire to learn.

The random drug-testing program ensures detailed information for parents, allows them to opt-out, and includes a clear policy prohibiting drug use at school. The drug-free school program includes drug and alcohol abuse prevention training, student access to assistance programs, and continuing education. It also ensures privacy protection for student drug test results and participation in treatment programs.
