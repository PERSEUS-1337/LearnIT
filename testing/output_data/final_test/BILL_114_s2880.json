    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Therapeutic Fraud Prevention Act of 2016\". Congress finds that being LGBTQ+ is not a disorder or deficiency, and professionals have determined that conversion therapy is ineffective and carries risks. Conversion therapy is not only ineffective but also dangerous to mental and physical health, leading to depression, self-harm, low self-esteem, family rejection, and suicide. It is important to protect LGBTQ+ individuals and their families from being defrauded by those offering this harmful therapy. SEC. 3. UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES RELATED TO CONVERSION THERAPY. It is illegal to provide conversion therapy for monetary compensation or advertise it claiming to change sexual orientation or gender identity, reduce same-gender attractions, or suggest it is harmless. Violations are enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. The Federal Trade Commission enforces penalties for violations related to conversion therapy, treating them as unfair or deceptive acts under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Commission may issue regulations to enforce penalties for violations related to conversion therapy. States' attorneys general can bring civil actions on behalf of residents if they believe their interests are affected by such violations. States' attorneys general must notify the Federal Trade Commission before initiating a civil action, including a copy of the complaint to be filed. States' attorneys general must notify the Federal Trade Commission before initiating a civil action, including providing a copy of the complaint. The Commission has the authority to intervene in the civil action and be heard on all matters, as well as file petitions for appeal. Additionally, the attorney general must notify the Commission immediately upon instituting the civil action. (3) Investigatory powers allow state attorney generals to conduct investigations, administer oaths, and compel witnesses or evidence. (4) If the Federal Trade Commission takes action on a violation, state attorney generals cannot bring a civil action against the same defendant during the proceedings. (5) Venue and service of process details are also specified. The Commission can take action, and venue and service of process details are specified for any action brought under paragraph (1). In addition to civil actions brought by attorneys general, other state officials authorized by the State may also bring civil actions under the same requirements and limitations. This does not prohibit authorized state officials from initiating or continuing proceedings in a State court for violations of state laws. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines conversion therapy as practices seeking to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity for monetary compensation, excluding assistance with gender transition or providing acceptance and support. The Act defines conversion therapy as practices seeking to change sexual orientation or gender identity for compensation, excluding assistance with gender transition or providing support. Gender identity refers to an individual's gender-related characteristics regardless of designated sex at birth, while sexual orientation includes homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality. SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act and its application will not be affected."
