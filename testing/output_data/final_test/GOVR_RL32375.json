    "content": "The Bush Administration has negotiated multiple free trade agreements, including the USAFTA, CAFTA, and agreements with Jordan, Singapore, Chile, the Dominican Republic, and Morocco. The strategy of \"competitive liberalization\" aims to use access to U.S. markets to encourage trading partners to lower trade barriers. The USAFTA is seen as a way to deepen economic ties beyond bilateral relationships. The USAFTA builds on the U.S.-Singapore FTA to establish a strong economic presence in the Asia-Pacific region. The United States and Australia share similar economic and trade goals, supporting trade liberalization in agriculture and services. Both countries are pursuing market access through regional and bilateral free trade agreements. The economic relationship between the United States and Australia is based on increasing trade and investment flows. The USAFTA is expected to facilitate these flows, with the U.S. consistently realizing trade surpluses with Australia. Major U.S. exports to Australia include aircraft, vehicles, and machinery, while imports consist of meats and beverages. In 2003, the United States and Australia conducted a moderate amount of trade in services. U.S. exports of services to Australia totaled $5.9 billion, with a surplus of $2.7 billion. U.S. residents received $6.3 billion in income from investments in Australia, while Australian residents received $2.1 billion from investments in the United States. In 2003, the United States had a current account trade surplus with Australia of $13.0 billion. The U.S. foreign direct investment in Australia totaled $36.3 billion through 2002, with half of it in manufacturing and mining. U.S. investments in Australia are smaller compared to other industrialized countries like the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The United States is the largest source of foreign direct investment in Australia, with Australian FDI in the US increasing sharply. Australian Prime Minister John Howard proposed an FTA with the US in 2001, which was initially given lower priority by the Bush Administration but eventually progressed in 2002. Negotiations between the US and Australia for a Free Trade Agreement began in November 2002, with difficulties arising over agriculture and other issues causing delays. Despite the challenges, the negotiations were completed in less time than expected, with tariffs on manufactured goods already low. The average applied Australian MFN tariff is 4.3%, and the average tariff on agriculture imports is 1.2%. Negotiations between the US and Australia for a Free Trade Agreement were challenging, especially regarding trade in agricultural goods. Both countries made concessions in sensitive areas to reach an agreement. Australia agreed not to liberalize trade in sugar and to only gradually open dairy and beef markets, while the US conceded on preserving Australia's pharmaceutical subsidy program and maintaining export monopolies for wheat, barley, and rice. Australia also gained the right to restrict foreign content in television programs and advertising, as well as preserve its sanitary and phytosanitary regime. The US-Australia Free Trade Agreement (USAFTA) aims to substantially reduce trade barriers in manufactured goods and agricultural products, excluding sugar. It also includes provisions for trade in services, foreign investment, e-commerce, intellectual property rights, and government procurement. Chapter 2 of the agreement focuses on bilateral trade in goods, with both countries committing to mutual access and protection of rights. The USAFTA will result in immediate duty-free treatment for 99% of U.S. exports of manufactured goods to Australia. Australian duties on the remaining 1% will be reduced and eventually eliminated. 97% of Australian exports of manufactured goods to the United States will be duty-free. Tariffs on all manufactured goods trade between the United States and Australia will be eliminated by 2015. The USAFTA will eliminate tariffs on trade between the United States and Australia, with a focus on duty-free access for various exports from both countries. Key items include autos, auto parts, chemicals, plastics, construction equipment, electrical equipment, furniture, information technology products, medical equipment, machinery, paper, metals, minerals, seafood, and more. Australia emphasized the removal of tariffs on light commercial vehicles and canned tuna. The USAFTA agreement between the United States and Australia includes provisions for the exchange of goods for repair, commercial samples, and business activities. It establishes a Committee on Trade in Goods to address trade issues such as tariffs, non-tariff barriers, rules of origin, and customs administration. Exceptions to the \"national treatment\" principle allow for restrictions on exports and imports of certain products for both countries. Rules of origin under the USAFTA determine which goods qualify for preferential treatment based on being wholly obtained or produced in Australia or the United States, or produced from materials originating from either country. The final product must undergo sufficient processing in a FTA country to qualify, with specific tariff classification changes listed in Annex 5-A of the agreement. The USAFTA includes rules of origin criteria for determining preferential treatment of goods, with specific tariff classification changes listed in Annex 5-A. A regional value content test is used for some products, where the value of inputs from Australia or the United States must meet a certain percentage of the final product's total value. Safeguard measures are provided for trade in goods between the two countries, with special measures for textiles, apparel, and specific agricultural products. During the transition period of the USAFTA, importing countries can adjust duties on products if increased imports cause serious harm to domestic industries. Safeguard measures can be applied for up to two years, with a possible extension for another two years after investigation. The USAFTA allows safeguard measures to be applied for up to two years, with a possible extension for another two years if serious injury conditions persist. The Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme subsidizes approved drugs, prioritizing the cheapest brand. The US criticizes Australia's method for not considering newer, innovative drugs. The USAFTA criticized Australia for not considering newer, innovative drugs in their Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. During negotiations, the United States pushed for more transparency in drug selection procedures and the inclusion of innovative drugs in subsidies. Australia agreed to establish review procedures and a Medicines Working Group with the US to address healthcare policy issues. Australia and the United States agreed to strengthen cooperation for quicker availability of innovative drugs to their nationals. Australia agreed to provide opportunities for U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers to consult with officials, respond to reports, appear before hearings, and obtain reasons for final determinations regarding PBS approval for subsidies. Australia also committed to expediting the process and providing reimbursement opportunities. The PBS was a controversial issue in the negotiations between Australia and the U.S., highlighting differences in healthcare systems. Concerns were raised in Congress about Chapter 17.9.4 of the agreement and its impact on reimportation of U.S.-brand pharmaceuticals. The provision in the trade agreement addresses concerns about reimportation of U.S. patented drugs and whether it limits the U.S. Congress from passing laws to permit it. USTR Zoellick argues that the provision does not grant new legal rights to patent holders and cannot prevent Congress from changing U.S. law. However, the issue may arise as the U.S. negotiates FTAs with other trading partners. The Congress is considering implementing legislation for bilateral FTA agreements, with agricultural issues being a major challenge. The United States and Australia, both major agricultural exporting countries, share similar positions in multilateral negotiations to reduce trade barriers. Under the USAFTA, U.S. tariffs on around 20% of agriculture imports from Australia will be eliminated. Under the USAFTA, U.S. tariffs on 20% of agriculture imports from Australia will be eliminated immediately. Tariffs on beef imports will be phased out when U.S. exports reach 2003 levels or three years after the agreement starts. Dairy product tariffs will be increased and phased out over 18 years, with immediate elimination for within-quota imports. Dairy quotas will apply to Australian exports of certain products. Under the USAFTA, U.S. tariffs on Australian agriculture imports will be eliminated immediately, including certain cheeses, butter, milk, cream, ice-cream products, and whole milk powder. Quotas on Australian peanuts, tobacco, cotton, and avocados will also be phased out. Duties on Australian wines will be eliminated over 11 years. The U.S. refused to change the sugar quota, but Australia will maintain single-desk arrangements for wheat, rice, barley, and sugar. The USAFTA will eliminate restrictions on private entities exporting agricultural products, with special provisions for U.S. imports of Australian beef and horticulture products. Tariffs on Australian imports of U.S. agricultural products will be removed immediately, benefiting U.S. exports of various food products and alcoholic beverages. The USAFTA aims to resolve disputes over sanitary and phytosanitary measures affecting U.S. exports to Australia. Textiles and apparel make up a small portion of bilateral trade between the two countries. The USAFTA includes special safeguard measures to address surges in textile and apparel imports between the U.S. and Australia. If either country determines that these imports are causing serious harm to domestic industries, a higher duty can be applied as a trade remedy. Compensation for the safeguard measure must be in the form of concessions on textile and apparel, unless agreed otherwise. The USAFTA includes rules of origin for textiles and apparel, applying the \"yarn forward\" principle. Apparel must be produced from fabrics made in either the United States or Australia, with exceptions outlined in Annex 4-A. Tariffs on textiles and apparel will be eliminated more gradually than on other manufactured goods. The USAFTA will make 100% of U.S. imports of non-textile and apparel manufactured goods from Australia duty-free immediately. However, only 7% of U.S. imports of textiles and apparel from Australia will become duty-free immediately, with 86% becoming duty-free after 10 years. The agreement covers various aspects of service transactions between the two countries, mirroring obligations in the WTO. The USAFTA requires the United States and Australia to provide non-discriminatory treatment to services from each other's territory, prohibiting restrictions on service providers, transactions, operations, and employment. Exceptions are listed in chapter 10, similar to the GATS. The USAFTA, like the GATS, allows exceptions to national treatment, MFN, market access, and local presence restrictions. Exceptions are specified in Annex I and Annex II, with Annex I measures being non-restrictive and \"bound,\" while Annex II measures can be more restrictive and are not \"bound.\" The agreement follows a \"negative list\" approach, covering all service sectors except those listed in the annexes, unlike the GATS which only covers identified sectors. The USAFTA's coverage is more comprehensive in U.S.-Australian bilateral services trade. Australia uses non-conforming measures to preserve local content requirements in audiovisual and broadcasting media. Restrictions on foreign content in programming and advertising on television are in place. The United States wanted these restrictions changed for more foreign access, but Australia insisted on preserving them to protect Australian culture. Australia also reserves the right to impose new requirements on multi-channel broadcast television programs. The USAFTA includes new requirements for multi-channel broadcast television programs, subscription television expenditure, and tax preferences for Australian film and television productions. The agreement also allows Australia to maintain existing co-production arrangements and create new ones. The United States listed exceptions to certain measures, such as preserving restrictions under the Merchant Marine Act of 1920. The agreement obligates both countries to ensure transparency in authorizing the supply of services. The USAFTA requires transparency in authorizing services, timely handling of applications, informing applicants of application status, and ensuring eligibility requirements do not create unnecessary trade barriers. It also addresses government-imposed qualifying requirements for professional service providers, maintaining market openness in express delivery services, and preventing monopoly postal service revenues from giving a competitive advantage. The USAFTA (Chapter 13) focuses on bilateral trade and investment in financial services, defining them to include insurance, banking, and related services. The agreement outlines obligations such as national treatment, MFN treatment, and prohibiting limits on financial institutions and service transactions. It also prohibits requirements for senior management or board of directors based on nationality. The USAFTA (Chapter 13) focuses on bilateral trade and investment in financial services, including insurance and banking. It prohibits nationality-based requirements for senior management or board of directors. The agreement allows exceptions for non-conforming measures and specifies obligations for financial service providers from the United States and Australia. The USAFTA (Chapter 12) establishes a Financial Services Committee to integrate the financial sectors of the US and Australia. It ensures nondiscriminatory access to public telecommunications services for enterprises from both countries. The USAFTA (Chapter 15) opens up procurement markets to suppliers from both countries, modeled on the WTO Government Procurement Agreement. It ensures fair competition and access to telecommunications services for enterprises in the FTA-partner countries. The USAFTA (Chapter 15) allows goods and services providers from signatory countries to bid on contracts on an equal basis, waiving \"buy national\" requirements. Both the GPA and USAFTA require transparency and timeliness in tendering bids to ensure non-discrimination in government procurement markets. The USAFTA (Chapter 11) covers foreign investment activities between the United States and Australia, including direct and portfolio investments. It requires non-discriminatory treatment, most-favored-nation and national treatment for investments, and prohibits governments from imposing performance requirements on foreign investments. The USAFTA prohibits governments from imposing performance requirements on foreign investments, including hiring individuals of a specific nationality in senior management positions. It allows governments to require a majority of the board of directors to be nationals or residents of their territory as long as it doesn't affect the foreign investor's control. The agreement also limits expropriation of assets and allows for exemptions in Annexes I and II. Australia maintains the right to screen foreign investments, subjecting them to government approval. U.S. investors have successfully operated in Australia despite concerns about the process not aligning with the principle of \"national treatment.\" The United States has exceptions to preserve programs for minority-owned businesses. USTR Zoellick aimed to reduce trade-distorting investment measures, while Australia found changing the process challenging. In a compromise, the United States allowed Australia to maintain its practices. In a compromise, the United States allowed Australia to maintain its screening process for foreign investments. Australia agreed to increase the threshold value for U.S. acquisitions in established entities to $A800 million and keep it at $A50 million for sensitive sectors. The U.S. insisted on a special investor-state dispute mechanism under the USAFTA, while Australia argued it was unnecessary due to similar legal traditions. The USAFTA includes provisions for labor and environment issues, which are similar due to the modern and industrialized economies of both countries. The agreement allows for an investor-state dispute mechanism if circumstances change. The USAFTA includes provisions for labor and environment issues, aiming to enforce laws related to internationally recognized labor principles and rights. It also commits Australia and the United States to prevent government standards from hindering trade and work towards mutual recognition of technical regulations. Additionally, a separate chapter is dedicated to electronic commerce. The USAFTA includes a chapter on electronic commerce (e-commerce), prohibiting customs duties on digital products. Digital products are defined broadly and must receive non-discriminatory treatment. Exceptions are outlined in the foreign investment and services chapters. Under the USAFTA (Chapter 17), the United States and Australia reaffirm their obligations to international treaties on intellectual property rights, including the WTO Agreement on TRIPS. The agreement commits both countries to ratify WIPO treaties on Performances and Phonograms and Copyrights. Key provisions include protecting copyrights for programs transmitted via encrypted satellite signals and patent holders' rights, with flexibility to exclude certain methods from patentability. The USAFTA (Chapter 21) includes provisions to protect trademarks, extend copyright duration, and prevent cybersquatting. It establishes a Joint Committee to resolve disputes and review the agreement annually. The USAFTA includes provisions to protect trademarks, extend copyright duration, and prevent cybersquatting. It establishes a Joint Committee to resolve disputes and review the agreement annually. The Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations (ACTPN) provides private sector advice to the President on trade agreements, with the majority endorsing the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The majority of the ACTPN endorsed the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement, but expressed concerns about unresolved issues in Australia's SPS regime, the lack of an investor-state dispute provision, and the adequacy of environmental provisions. The ACTPN endorsed the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement, with concerns about Australia's environmental protection record. Labor representative James P. Hoffa Jr. dissented, citing inadequate labor laws in Australia. Agricultural negotiations were challenging, with mixed reactions from producers. U.S. sugar producers were relieved about no sugar import liberalization, while wheat exporters opposed the agreement. U.S. wheat exporters oppose the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement due to Australia's single-desk monopoly on wheat exports. Pork producers are waiting for a final risk assessment on U.S. pork for import into Australia. Beef producers have mixed reactions, disappointed by limited market access for U.S. beef exporters but pleased with gradual opening of the U.S. market to Australian exporters over 18 years. The American Farm Bureau supports the agreement pending resolution of SPS issues. U.S. manufacturers strongly support immediate congressional approval of the USAFTA. U.S. manufacturers strongly support the USAFTA, calling for immediate congressional approval. The agreement was signed by United States Trade Representative Robert Zoellick and Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile on May 18, 2004, in Washington. The President must submit a list of U.S. laws to be changed to comply with the agreement within 60 days of signing. Congress then has 90 legislative days to act on the agreement. The House and Senate Committees have specific timeframes to review and report on the USAFTA agreement. Trade promotion authority limits debate time and allows for a yea or nay vote without amendments. Committees approved implementing legislation with some amendments required for USTR approval. The USTR needed approval from the Ways and Means and Finance Committees to waive a safeguard measure against Australian beef imports. The legislation was reported out unfavorably by the Senate Finance Committee, but the House Ways and Means Committee approved the implementing bill. The full House and Senate also approved the measure, leading to President Bush signing the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act on August 3, 2004. The Australian parliament approved implementing legislation on August 13, 2004 with amendments from the opposition Labour Party. Pharmaceutical companies holding drug patents must certify legal actions in good faith to block generic drugs. Violations result in monetary penalties. USTR must certify amendments comply with the FTA before it goes into effect. Diplomatic notes were exchanged on November 17, 2004. The USAFTA entered into force on January 1, 2005 after Australia assured the United States that implementing legislation would be changed to address U.S. concerns. The agreement will impact the U.S.-Australia economic relationship and trade policy. Tariffs on most goods were already low, so the removal of tariffs and restrictions is not expected to cause major shifts in trade patterns. The United States International Trade Commission predicts the largest percentage increases in U.S. exports to Australia will be in coal, oil, gas, textiles, apparel, leather products, and processed food. The USAFTA, implemented in 2005, will impact the U.S.-Australia economic relationship. The agreement will lead to increases in U.S. exports to Australia in machinery, equipment, and vehicles, while U.S. imports from Australia will see growth in textile, apparel, meat, and processed food products. The net welfare benefit for U.S. consumers is estimated to increase significantly. The agreement aims to address trade irritants between the two countries, such as U.S. restrictions on beef and dairy products. The U.S.-Australia trade agreement addresses various trade irritants, including restrictions on beef and dairy products. Both sides agreed to loosen some restrictions while establishing mechanisms for further discussion on others. However, certain issues like U.S. import controls on sugar remained unchanged. The agreement may impact U.S. trade policy and strategy, building on the use of FTAs as a tool for trade liberalization. The USAFTA may set precedents for future FTAs, with potential impacts on trade policy. Observers suggest that certain provisions, like Australia's transparency in the Pharmaceutical Benefits System, could serve as a model. Exclusion of U.S. sugar import restrictions may influence other trading partners in future agreements. The USAFTA may set precedents for future FTAs, with potential impacts on trade policy. Observers suggest that certain provisions, like Australia's transparency in the Pharmaceutical Benefits System, could serve as a model. UnitedStates may encourage import-sensitive industries to push for exclusion in future trade agreements."
