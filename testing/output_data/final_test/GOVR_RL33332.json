    "content": "Several provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act, including amendments to FISA and ECPA, were set to expire in 2005. The IRTPA of 2004 also had provisions scheduled to sunset. Reauthorization Acts were passed by the House and Senate to make 14 of the 16 provisions permanent. The PATRIOT Reauthorization Acts, H.R. 3199 and S. 1389, made 14 of the 16 expiring USA PATRIOT Act sections permanent and extended the sunset on certain sections. The bills differed in the new sunset date, with H.R. 3199 offering a ten-year extension to December 31, 2015. The House agreed to the compromise report on December 14, 2005, but the Senate raised concerns about civil liberties safeguards. The Senate rejected a motion to invoke cloture on the conference report for the USA PATRIOT Act, leading to a postponement of its expiration until March 10, 2006. The Senate passed the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006, which included three civil liberties safeguards. This paved the way for the Senate to approve the conference report on March 2, with the House passing the bill on March 7. The House passed S. 2271 and H.R. 3199, signed into law by the President on March 9. This report summarizes the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, making permanent most expiring sections with added civil liberties safeguards. It also discusses modifications made by the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006. The USA PATRIOT Act made permanent 14 sections, including provisions for wiretapping in certain investigations and sharing of intelligence information. Section 102(a) repealed the sunset date for 16 sections initially set for December 31, 2005. The USA PATRIOT Act made permanent 14 sections, including provisions for wiretapping in certain investigations and sharing of intelligence information. Key sections include law enforcement sharing of court-ordered wiretap-generated foreign intelligence information, technical exceptions for foreign intelligence pen register/trap & trace device use, and law enforcement access to computer trespassers' communications within the intruded system. The USA PATRIOT Act includes provisions for wiretapping and sharing intelligence information, with key sections addressing court-ordered wiretap-generated foreign intelligence information, technical exceptions for foreign intelligence pen register/trap & trace device use, and law enforcement access to computer trespassers' communications within the intruded system. The Act also includes provisions for the removal of the \"wall\" between criminal catchers and spy catchers, nationwide service of court orders to communication providers, civil liability for certain ECPA or FISA violations, civil immunity for assisting in executing a FISA order, and a sunset date of December 31, 2009 for certain sections. Additionally, the Act makes changes to the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, postponing the expiration of a section defining an \"agent of a foreign power\" until December 31, 2009. The USA PATRIOT Act includes provisions for wiretapping and sharing intelligence information, with key sections addressing court-ordered wiretap-generated foreign intelligence information. The Act also makes permanent section 6603 of IRTPA, amending federal law regarding material support of terrorists and terrorist organizations. This includes expanding extraterritorial jurisdiction reach and adding a more explicit knowledge requirement. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded the list of federal crimes of terrorism and added them to the predicate offenses for material support for designated terrorist organizations. It also allowed the FBI to access tangible items in foreign intelligence, international terrorism, and clandestine intelligence cases through FISA court orders. The USA PATRIOT Act includes provisions to prevent abuses of section 215 authority, such as increased oversight, procedural protections, and a judicial review process. The Attorney General is required to submit an annual report to Congress on the use of section 215 authority, detailing the number of applications, orders granted or denied, and other relevant information. The USA PATRIOT Act includes provisions for oversight and reporting on the use of section 215 authority, including the number of orders granted, modified, or denied for various types of sensitive information. The Act also mandates an audit by the Inspector General to assess the effectiveness and potential abuses of section 215 authority for the years 2002-2006. The USA PATRIOT Act mandates oversight and reporting on the use of section 215 authority for sensitive information. An audit by the Inspector General is required for the years 2002-2006, with specific reporting deadlines for different calendar years. Additionally, high-level officials must personally approve applications for certain sensitive records under section 215. The USA PATRIOT Act includes provisions for oversight and minimization standards for the use of section 215 authority to obtain sensitive records. The Attorney General is required to establish specific procedures to limit retention and regulate dissemination of information concerning U.S. persons. Federal authorities must adhere to these minimization procedures and may only use or disclose information for lawful purposes. Additionally, the Act clarifies that privileged information retains its privileged status. The USA PATRIOT Act includes oversight and minimization standards for section 215 authority. The Act clarifies that privileged information remains privileged. It amends the application process for 215 orders to require a \"statement of facts\" demonstrating relevance to authorized investigations related to terrorism or espionage. Certain tangible items are deemed \"presumptively relevant\" if they pertain to a foreign power or agent. The FISA court judge approves applications for a 215 order if they comply with statutory requirements. The order must describe the items sought, provide a reasonable time for assembly, and include nondisclosure requirements. It is limited to items subject to a grand jury subpoena or U.S. court order. The ex parte order under Section 106(f) of the Act allows for judicial review of 215 orders, with the FISA Court of Review and U.S. Supreme Court having jurisdiction over appeals. If a judge affirms a 215 order, the recipient must comply with it. The Chief Justice of the United States, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence, is directed to establish security measures for maintaining the record of the 215 order judicial review proceedings. A section 215 order is accompanied by a nondisclosure requirement that prohibits the recipient from disclosing to any other person that the FBI has sought the tangible things described in the order. The Act expands the exceptions to the \"gag order,\" allowing disclosure to an attorney for legal advice and other persons approved by the FBI. The recipient is not required to inform the FBI of consulting with an attorney. The USA PATRIOT Act allows recipients of Section 215 orders to consult with an attorney without informing the FBI. However, if requested by the FBI Director, the recipient must disclose the identity of the attorney. Concerns were raised about this provision potentially hindering individuals' right to seek legal counsel. In response, the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006 amended FISA to exempt the disclosure of the attorney's name sought for legal advice regarding the Section 215 order. The USA PATRIOT Act allows recipients of Section 215 orders to consult with an attorney without informing the FBI. The Act does not grant the right to petition the FISA court to modify or quash the nondisclosure requirement imposed in connection with the production order. The USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006 established a judicial review procedure for challenging section 215 nondisclosure orders. The FISA court allows recipients of production orders to petition for modification or removal of the nondisclosure requirement. The judge can deny frivolous petitions within 72 hours, but will review non-frivolous petitions promptly and may modify the order if national security is not at risk. The FISA court allows recipients of production orders to petition for modification or removal of the nondisclosure requirement if it may endanger national security or interfere with diplomatic relations. The judge must treat government certification as conclusive unless made in bad faith. If the judge grants a petition to quash the requirement, the order is stayed pending review by the FISA Court of Review. If the petition is denied, the recipient is precluded from disclosing information. The FISA Court of Review has jurisdiction to review a FISA judge's decision on a 215 order, including the nondisclosure requirement. Five federal statutes authorize federal intelligence investigators to request customer business records from various institutions. Unlike a section 215 order, a national security letter (NSL) is used for certain types of information. A national security letter (NSL) does not require prior approval from a judge like a section 215 order, but it is more limited in scope. NSLs cannot access content information but can request phone numbers or email addresses. A federal court in New York found that FBI practices regarding NSLs violate the Fourth and First Amendments due to lack of judicial review and permanent gag orders. The Act addresses constitutional issues with NSL gag orders by allowing judicial review and the ability for recipients to challenge or modify the nondisclosure requirement. Recipients can petition a federal court to modify or quash a NSL request if compliance is deemed unreasonable, oppressive, or unlawful. Section 115 of the Act allows the government to enforce NSLs through court action, with penalties for non-compliance. Court proceedings must be closed to prevent unauthorized disclosure, and service providers are prohibited from disclosing FBI access to information. The FBI can disclose information obtained through a National Security Letter (NSL) if it is certified that disclosure may endanger individuals or national security, interfere with diplomatic relations, or hinder investigations. Recipients can disclose to those needed to comply with the NSL or to obtain legal advice. The FBI can request the identity of the person to whom disclosure will be made under a National Security Letter (NSL) to prevent disclosure to individuals with ties to hostile foreign entities. The USA PATRIOT Act Amendment Act of 2006 exempted attorneys' identities from this disclosure requirement. The USA PATRIOT Act Amendment Act of 2006 exempts attorneys' identities from disclosure requirements under NSLs. Failure to comply with NSL nondisclosure directives can result in imprisonment. The USA PATRIOT Act Amendment Act of 2006 introduced a felony charge for disclosing information to an unauthorized person, with a right to challenge gag orders attached to NSL requests. Section 115 allows recipients to petition the court to modify or set aside gag orders within one year of the NSL request, based on national security concerns or interference with investigations. The USA PATRIOT Act Amendment Act of 2006 introduced a felony charge for disclosing information to an unauthorized person, with a right to challenge gag orders attached to NSL requests. Section 115 allows recipients to petition the court to modify or set aside gag orders within one year of the NSL request, based on national security concerns or interference with investigations. If a high-ranking government official certifies that disclosure may endanger national security or diplomatic relations, the court must treat the certification as conclusive unless made in bad faith. If the petition is filed one year after the NSL issuance, the official must either terminate the gag order or re-certify within 90 days. The court may modify or quash a gag order if disclosure does not endanger national security, interfere with investigations, diplomatic relations, or endanger anyone's safety. If high-ranking officials certify that disclosure poses risks, the court must treat it as conclusive unless made in bad faith. If a petition to modify the nondisclosure requirement is denied, the recipient cannot file another petition. The National Security Letter (NSL) recipient is restricted from filing another petition challenging the nondisclosure requirement for one year. Critics argue that the judicial review process is not meaningful due to the \"conclusive presumption\" provision, which limits the recipient's ability to challenge gag orders. Some Members of Congress have raised concerns about First Amendment and due process rights, while others defend the provision as necessary to prevent the disclosure of sensitive information. The FBI, not individual district judges, are responsible for determining if the disclosure of classified information would harm national security. Section 5 of the USA PATRIOT Act addresses privacy protections for library patrons in relation to National Security Letters (NSLs). Section 5 of the USA PATRIOT Act clarifies that libraries, including those offering Internet access, are not considered electronic communication service providers under 18 U.S.C. 2709, exempting them from National Security Letters. Libraries offering Internet access are exempt from National Security Letters under the USA PATRIOT Act. However, if a library provides electronic communication services, it may still be subject to NSLs. To be considered a provider, a library must independently operate the means of digital communication. A local county library likely has a service contract with an ISP, so simply providing Internet access to patrons may not qualify them as a provider. The library offering Internet access may not be considered a communications service provider under the USA PATRIOT Act. NSL provisions require reports to Congressional committees and semiannual reports on NSL requests made under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The Attorney General must submit an annual report to Congress detailing the number of requests made under NSL statutes, which must be unclassified for public scrutiny. The Inspector General of the Department of Justice is directed to conduct an audit on the effectiveness and use of NSLs, including any improper use, for submission to relevant committees. Additionally, a feasibility study on applying minimization procedures to NSLs to protect the constitutional rights of U.S. persons must be submitted to specific committees. The feasibility study for applying minimization procedures to NSLs must be submitted to the House and Senate Judiciary and Intelligence Committees by February 1, 2007, or upon completion of the audit of NSL use for calendar years 2003 and 2004. Unlike criminal wiretap orders, a FISA wiretap can be issued based on probable cause to believe the target is a foreign power. Section 206 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows roving wiretaps for foreign intelligence investigations. Section 206 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows law enforcement to use a single wiretap order to cover any communications device the target uses. It permits the assistance of third parties for multipoint wiretaps when the target tries to avoid identification. Section 206 of the USA PATRIOT Act temporarily authorizes FISA orders that do not need to specifically identify the communications carriers or others involved. It amends the FISA roving surveillance authority to require a specific target description if the target's identity is unknown, ensuring the FISA court has specific facts to justify surveillance. The USA PATRIOT Act amends the FISA roving surveillance authority to require specific target descriptions if the target's identity is unknown. The government must notify the FISA court of any changes in the nature and location of surveillance within 10 days, including details of new facilities, justification for surveillance, proposed minimization procedures, and the total number of electronic surveillances conducted. Congressional oversight is enhanced by adding the Senate Judiciary Committee. The USA PATRIOT Act amends FISA surveillance authority to include the Senate Judiciary Committee in receiving semi-annual reports. It also requires a description of roving electronic surveillance applications. The Department of Justice defends delayed notification search warrants as necessary in limited circumstances to prevent harm or evidence tampering. The USA PATRIOT Act allows for delayed notice search warrants in limited circumstances to prevent harm or evidence tampering, giving law enforcement time to coordinate arrests and identify criminal associates. This statutory authority created under Section 213 addresses the issue of providing contemporaneous notice during searches or seizures. Section 213 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows for delayed notice search warrants in any criminal investigation, not just terrorism cases. The warrant can be delayed if there is reasonable cause to believe that immediate notice may have adverse consequences. The warrant must prohibit the seizure of certain items unless there is a reasonable necessity. This provision addresses concerns about the timeframe for delaying notification of a search warrant. Section 114 of the Act sets a 30-day limit for delayed notification of a search warrant, with possible 90-day extensions if justified. Some Members of Congress prefer a 7-day notice period. The 30-day delay was a compromise between the House and Senate versions of the Act. The provision also removes \"unduly delaying a trial\" as a justification for delayed notification. Section 114 of the Act allows for delayed notification of search warrants for up to 30 days, with possible 90-day extensions if justified. Critics argue that the provision of \"seriously jeopardizing an investigation\" is overly broad and could be abused by law enforcement. However, Justice Department officials defend this provision, stating that a federal judge must approve the delayed notice based on circumstances indicating a threat to an ongoing investigation. Additionally, oversight is enhanced by requiring judges to notify the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts within 30 days of the warrant's expiration or denial. Section 212 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows for delayed notification of search warrants, with requirements for reporting to Congress on the use of such warrants. Electronic communications service providers can disclose stored electronic communications in emergency situations involving risk of death or serious injury. The USA PATRIOT Act allows for delayed notification of search warrants and requires reporting to Congress on their use. Service providers can disclose customer records to governmental entities in emergencies involving serious physical injury or danger of death. The Attorney General must report annually on voluntary emergency disclosures of electronic communications to the Department of Justice. The Act extends the duration of FISA electronic surveillance and removes the immediacy requirement for customer records provision. The USA PATRIOT Act extends the duration of FISA electronic surveillance and physical search orders against foreign agents, including lone wolf terrorists. Initial orders can last up to 120 days, with renewals up to one year. The Act also extends the time for FISA pen registers and trap and trace surveillance devices from 90 days to one year for foreign intelligence information not concerning U.S. persons. Congressional oversight is enhanced by requiring the Attorney General to report on physical searches semi-annually to the Senate. The Attorney General is required to report on physical searches semi-annually to the Senate Judiciary Committee, House and Senate Intelligence committees, and House Judiciary Committee. The report must include statistical information on the number of emergency physical search orders authorized or denied. Law enforcement officials can obtain court orders for pen registers or trap and trace devices for criminal investigations. The FBI has various legal authorities to obtain customer information for criminal and foreign intelligence investigations, including court orders under different statutes such as 18 U.S.C. 3122, 3123, 2703, 2709, 50 U.S.C. 1841-1846, and the USA PATRIOT Act. The FISA court can also direct service providers to supply customer information related to the use of pen registers or trap and trace devices. The FBI can order service providers to supply customer information for investigations, which includes details like customer name, address, phone number, service length, and types of services used. This information is more extensive than what is available under 18 U.S.C. 2709 but less than a FISA section 215 order. The FBI can order service providers to supply extensive customer information for investigations, including customer name, address, phone number, service length, types of services used, payment mechanisms, and communication records. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence noted that under Section 215 of the bill, service providers can be required to supply subscriber information for numbers or email addresses captured by devices, addressing a discrepancy in authority compared to criminal pen register orders. Critics question the necessity of the amendment since similar information can already be obtained through national security letters or FISA business records. The Act amends FISA oversight reporting requirements for the use of pen register and trap and trace authority every six months. Crimes designated as federal crimes of terrorism trigger the application of other federal laws. Additional offenses added to the definition of federal crimes of terrorism include receiving military-type training from a foreign terrorist organization and drug trafficking in support of terrorism. The Act expands the list of crimes for which law enforcement can seek wiretap orders to include offenses related to biological weapons, violence at international airports, nuclear threats, and terrorism. The Act includes provisions for committing violence overseas, harboring terrorists, assault on flight crew members, certain weapons offenses on aircraft, aggravated identity theft, \"smurfing\" money laundering technique, and criminal violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Section 110 merges laws outlawing train wrecking and attacks on mass transportation into a new law intended to provide uniform offense elements and penalties for attacks on all transportation systems. Additionally, the Act criminalizes the planning of terrorist attacks and other acts of violence against railroads and mass transportation systems. The new criminal statute under 18 U.S.C. 1992 enhances penalties for attacks on transportation systems, including passenger vessels. Punishment includes imprisonment for up to 20 years, or life if the offense results in death. Aggravated offenses can result in imprisonment for any term of years, life, or the death penalty. Confiscation of property derived from certain drug offenses committed in violation of foreign law is also permitted under federal law. The Act allows for the confiscation of property related to terrorist offenses and offenses involving weapons technology. It also amends the definition of terrorism for asset forfeiture purposes under the USA PATRIOT Act. The USA PATRIOT Act allows for the confiscation of property related to terrorist offenses, including acts of domestic or international terrorism defined in 18 U.S.C. 2331. Critics raise concerns about potential confiscation of property from political action organizations involved in violent demonstrations. The USA PATRIOT Act allows for the confiscation of property related to domestic or international terrorism defined in 18 U.S.C. 2331. Section 120 of the Act replaces the generic definition of terrorism with a specific definition, amending 18 U.S.C. 981(a)(1)(G) to allow for the confiscation of property of those planning or engaged in acts of terrorism against the United States or its citizens. The confiscated proceeds are used for law enforcement purposes. The USA PATRIOT Act allows for the confiscation of property related to domestic or international terrorism under 18 U.S.C. 2331. Section 120 of the Act specifies the definition of terrorism and allows for the confiscation of property from individuals involved in terrorist activities. Confiscated proceeds are used for law enforcement purposes. Additionally, victims of federal crimes are entitled to restitution under various sections of the Act. Section 109(d) requires the FISA court to publish its rules and procedures for transparency. The USA PATRIOT Act allows for the confiscation of property related to terrorism. Section 121 of the Act amends federal law on contraband cigarettes, lowering the threshold to 10,000 cigarettes. This change was prompted by terrorists using cigarette smuggling for financing. The USA PATRIOT Act amended federal law on contraband cigarettes, reducing the threshold to 10,000 cigarettes. It also includes provisions for contraband smokeless tobacco. The Act establishes federal penalties for violators and drug trafficking offenses with severe consequences based on the type and quantity of drugs involved. The USA PATRIOT Act amended federal law on contraband cigarettes, reducing the threshold to 10,000 cigarettes and includes provisions for contraband smokeless tobacco. Providing material support for terrorist activities is a federal crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Drug trafficking for the benefit of a foreign terrorist organization or a person engaged in terrorism is outlawed under the Act, with violators facing imprisonment for not less than twice the minimum penalty for drug trafficking. The USA PATRIOT Act amended federal law on contraband cigarettes, reducing the threshold to 10,000 cigarettes and includes provisions for contraband smokeless tobacco. Providing material support for terrorist activities is a federal crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison. The Act also prohibits attempts and conspiracies to violate certain sections, with penalties of imprisonment for not more than 20 years. Section 123 of the USA PATRIOT Act makes it a federal crime to interfere with aircraft operators, with penalties of up to 20 years in prison. FISA prohibits certain information collection techniques in foreign intelligence investigations. Section 124 expresses Congress's stance against criminal investigations of Americans based solely on certain criteria. Section 125 of the USA PATRIOT Act grants immunity to donors of fire equipment to volunteer fire organizations. Section 126 requires the Attorney General to report to Congress on the use of \"pattern-based\" data mining technologies. Title II of the Act makes adjustments to federal death penalty law related to air piracy cases, federal capital drug cases, terrorism offenses, and appointment of counsel in capital cases. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the U.S. Supreme Court deemed capital punishment procedures unconstitutional. Congress established revised procedures for the death penalty in air piracy cases in 1974. In 1994, Congress made adjustments to allow the death penalty for federal capital offenses, replacing the air piracy procedures. A court ruled that the new procedures couldn't be retroactively applied to air piracy cases between 1974 and 1994. Section 211 of the Act added a provision to address this issue. The amendment to the 1994 legislation allows for the application of federal capital punishment procedures, consideration of mitigating and aggravating factors, and includes a definition of \"especially heinous, cruel, or depraved.\" It applies to a small group of individuals responsible for murders during hijackings in the mid-1980s who would otherwise be eligible for parole within 10 years. The Act amends federal laws related to sentencing for terrorism crimes and capital drug cases, removing certain requirements and aligning procedures. It eliminates the need for a foreseeable risk of injury in terrorism convictions and streamlines death penalty procedures for capital drug cases. The Act eliminates specific drug case procedures and consolidates procedures for Federal death penalty prosecutions. It transfers provisions for indigent counsel from title 21 to title 18 of the United States Code. Title III of the Act creates more severe criminal penalties. Title III of the Act increases criminal penalties for criminal and terrorist activities at U.S. seaports and vessels. The Maritime Transportation Security Act mandates security plans for vessels and facilities, including secure area control. It also requires transportation security cards for access regulation. The Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act amended provisions to apply state criminal laws and sanctions for trespassing in secure areas. The federal crime of using fraud or false pretenses to enter federal property, a vessel, or aircraft of the United States is punishable by imprisonment for up to five years if committed with intent to commit a felony. Making a false statement to federal officials or possessing fake government identification for fraud is also punishable by imprisonment. Additionally, trespassing in secure areas is covered by specific criminal laws and sanctions. Unlawful entry to property with intent to commit a crime is punishable under state laws. Section 302 of the Act expands penalties for violations in protected areas, including seaports, from imprisonment up to 5 years to up to 10 years for felonies. Unauthorized access to seaports is a concern addressed by the amendments. Unauthorized access to seaports is a serious concern due to the potential theft of cargo and terrorist infiltration. It is crucial to establish proper security measures. Critics argue that the law only addresses access achieved through fraud, questioning the need for harsh penalties for other forms of trespassing in restricted areas. Various federal laws prohibit obstructing maritime inspections and establish a new federal crime for failing to comply with boarding or providing false information. Punishable by up to five years in prison, the law also prohibits violence against maritime navigation and destruction of property within maritime jurisdiction. The Act creates new federal crimes related to maritime offenses, including placing dangerous substances in navigable waters and tampering with navigational aids. Sanctions include imprisonment for any term of years or for life, or the death penalty if death results. The new federal crimes related to maritime offenses include placing dangerous substances in navigable waters and tampering with navigational aids. Sanctions may seem stiff, but the Coast Guard maintains over 50,000 navigational aids on more than 25,000 miles of waterways, making them inviting targets for terrorists. The Act also establishes federal terrorism-related transportation offenses for transporting dangerous materials and terrorists. It is a federal crime to possess biological agents, chemical weapons, atomic weapons, and nuclear material, punishable by imprisonment. It is also a federal crime to commit any federal crime of terrorism or provide material support for terrorist activities. Additionally, transporting explosives or dangerous materials with the intent to harm individuals or property is prohibited under federal law. The new federal offense prohibits transporting explosives, biological agents, chemical weapons, or nuclear material for use in terrorism. Punishable by imprisonment or death if death results. Harboring terrorists or providing material support for terrorism is also a crime. Section 305 of the new federal offense creates 18 U.S.C. 2284, punishable by imprisonment for transporting an individual for terrorism. It does not have an exception for official activities. The section forbids transporting terrorists, but likely would not prevent extradition or prisoner transfer. Chapter 111 of title 18 of the United States Code outlaws violence against vessels within U.S. jurisdiction. The Code prohibits the use of fire, explosives, or violence in certain circumstances to protect shipping. It includes sections condemning such actions against property used in interstate or foreign commerce, destruction of property within the maritime jurisdiction of the United States, and arson within maritime jurisdiction. Hoaxes related to these violations can result in imprisonment for up to five years, or up to 20 years for serious injury, and potentially life imprisonment or death if death results. Section 306 of the Act introduces a new chapter 111A, with two substantive sections prohibiting hoaxes and destruction of vessels or maritime property. The new legislation introduces four sections, two substantive and two procedural, addressing hoaxes and destruction of vessels or maritime facilities. It harmonizes maritime provisions with existing criminal sanctions for aircraft offenses. The new destruction offense mirrors provisions for aircraft but includes exceptions for lawful operations. The new legislation introduces four sections addressing hoaxes and destruction of vessels or maritime facilities, harmonizing maritime provisions with existing criminal sanctions for aircraft offenses. It tightens penalties for attacks on conveyances carrying hazardous materials and modifies sentencing escalator for death results. The substantive prohibitions of the new section 2291 differ from those of 18 U.S.C. 2280 concerning violence against maritime navigation. Section 2291 has a narrower jurisdiction compared to section 2280, which is treaty-based. Violations of section 2291 are only considered federal crimes under specific conditions within the United States or involving U.S. nationals or vessels. Section 2291, like section 2280, has exceptions for misdemeanor offenses and labor disputes. Section 2292 introduces a hoax offense with a civil penalty of up to $5000. The Act sets a civil penalty of up to $5000 for hoaxes related to violations of section 2291 or chapter 111. Knowingly committing misconduct can result in imprisonment for up to five years. Jurisdiction over the offense is determined by the subject of the hoax. Section 307 expands criminal provisions, particularly in maritime commerce, with penalties of up to 10 years for theft from shipments in interstate or foreign commerce. The Act sets penalties for hoaxes related to violations of section 2291 or chapter 111, with imprisonment for up to five years. Section 307 expands criminal provisions in maritime commerce, increasing penalties for theft from shipments in interstate or foreign commerce. Theft of property valued at $1000 or less carries a penalty of imprisonment for not more than three years. Theft from trailers, cargo containers, freight stations, and warehouses, as well as theft of goods awaiting transshipment, are covered under the Act. Interstate or foreign transportation of stolen vehicles, aircraft, or vessels is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years. The Act increases penalties for theft from shipments in interstate or foreign commerce, including theft of property valued at $1000 or less. It also addresses the interstate or foreign transportation of stolen vehicles, aircraft, or vessels, with penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment. Stowing away on a vessel or aircraft is a federal crime, with offenders facing imprisonment for up to one year, which can be increased to five years under Section 308 of the Act. The Act imposes severe penalties for federal crimes, including serious injury or death resulting from intent, bribery of federal officials, and terrorism-related offenses. Offenders can face imprisonment for up to 15, 20, or more years, depending on the crime committed. The Act imposes severe penalties for federal crimes, including terrorism-related offenses. Offenders face imprisonment for up to 15 years for terrorism, up to 20 years for smuggling into the United States, and up to 10 years for smuggling goods out of the United States. Federal forfeiture and custom laws allow for the confiscation of proceeds from money laundering activities related to smuggling offenses. This includes goods smuggled into or out of the U.S., with penalties of up to 15 years for terrorism, 20 years for smuggling into the U.S., and 10 years for smuggling goods out of the country. The Act strengthens penalties for money laundering, including financing terrorism, and allows for pre-trial asset freezes in certain civil forfeiture cases. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act grants the President the authority to impose economic restrictions in response to external threats. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act grants the President authority to impose economic restrictions in response to external threats, including blocking assets and prohibiting transactions with individuals involved in terrorism, narcotics trafficking, and weapons proliferation. The Act increases penalties for violations of presidential orders under IEEPA, including imprisonment and civil penalties. The federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) law imposes severe penalties for acquiring or operating an enterprise through the commission of crimes. Money laundering statutes prohibit using funds from criminal activities in financial transactions to conceal their origin. Transactions involving over $10,000 derived from criminal activities are also condemned. RICO and money laundering offenses lead to property confiscation, with RICO requiring owner conviction. Operating an unlicensed money transmission business or transmitting funds for criminal activities is a federal crime. The Act includes illegal money transmissions as a RICO predicate offense, adding it to the money laundering predicate offense list. The House-passed Reauthorization Act included a provision on employing aliens in the RICO list, but it was not included in the final Act. A grammatical change related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was made, which was already addressed in a previous Act. The Act also made amendments concerning money laundering investigative jurisdiction within the Department of Homeland Security. Procedures for coordination and distribution of forfeited property among investigative agencies are necessary. Property of individuals and entities involved in international terrorism against the US can be confiscated. Criminal forfeiture occurs upon conviction, while civil forfeiture is done through a civil proceeding. Criminal forfeiture is punitive, civil forfeiture is remedial. Criminal forfeiture is punitive; civil forfeiture is remedial. A convicted defendant may surrender substitute assets if the property subject to criminal forfeiture is overseas. Civil forfeiture can be pursued when forfeitable property is held overseas in a financial institution with a correspondent account in the US. The US Constitution prohibits corruption of blood or forfeiture of estate except during the life of the person attainted. Forfeiture of estate is the confiscation of property solely because it belongs to the defendant, without a direct link to the crime. While historically limited to cases of treason, due process may extend this ban to other crimes. Federal law typically requires a connection between the property and the crime triggering forfeiture. Subparagraph 981(a)(1)(G) allows confiscation of property from individuals involved in terrorism against the US. Section 404 of the Act authorizes the federal government to confiscate property of individuals or entities involved in international terrorism without a direct link to the crime. It allows forfeiture of assets both domestically and abroad, with a requirement that an act in furtherance of terrorism must have occurred within the jurisdiction of the United States. The specific jurisdiction referred to is unclear. The proposal under consideration extends the reach of the Act to include money laundering offenses related to terrorist activities, particularly focusing on alternative remittance systems like \"hawalas\" used by terrorists to move and launder large sums of money globally. \"Hawala networks, used by terrorists for money laundering globally, are efficient and provide anonymity. The US requires all money transmitters to register as money service businesses to combat these networks. There is uncertainty regarding the 'proceeds element' in money laundering schemes involving multiple transactions.\" The curr_chunk discusses a money laundering scheme involving parallel transactions to obscure the origin of funds, particularly in the Black Market Peso Exchange and \"hawala\" network. Section 406 of the Act corrects errors in existing law related to money laundering statutes. The curr_chunk addresses corrections and updates to existing laws related to money laundering, including changes to references in the USA PATRIOT Act and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act. It also discusses the forfeiture procedure and pre-trial restraining orders in criminal and civil forfeiture cases. The curr_chunk discusses federal laws related to money laundering, including forfeiture cases and penalties for destroying commercial motor vehicles or energy facilities. It also mentions the consequences for conspiring to commit federal crimes. The curr_chunk discusses federal laws related to money laundering, including penalties for conspiring to commit federal crimes and the forfeiture of property associated with money laundering. It also mentions the maximum penalties for conspiracy to commit offenses under the USA PATRIOT Act. The curr_chunk discusses federal laws related to money laundering, including penalties for receiving military training from a foreign terrorist organization. It also addresses the classification of federal crimes of terrorism as RICO predicate offenses and money laundering predicate offenses. The Act includes amendments to various sections of the U.S. Code, with unclear reasons for duplication and inclusion of certain amendments. The curr_chunk discusses an amendment related to uniform procedures for criminal forfeitures, which aims to make a default procedure exclusive. The amendment addresses the inclusion of forfeitures in indictments or information in connection with violations of an Act of Congress. The amendment addresses the inclusion of forfeitures in indictments or information in connection with violations of an Act of Congress, with the court ordering forfeiture of property upon conviction. The amendment allows for the inclusion of forfeitures in indictments or information for violations of an Act of Congress, with property forfeiture ordered upon conviction. Section 2461(c) originally allowed confiscation under criminal forfeiture procedures when civil forfeiture was authorized but criminal forfeiture was not available. The Act eliminates the distinction between civil and criminal forfeiture, allowing for property forfeiture upon conviction. There is uncertainty regarding the availability of pre-trial freeze orders in cases of section 2461(c) \"gap filler.\" The language of conviction remains, but the role of 21 U.S.C. 853 may suggest a different outcome. The procedures of section 853 come into play after conviction. The Act eliminates the distinction between civil and criminal forfeiture, allowing for property forfeiture upon conviction. The procedures set forth in section 413 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 853) apply to all stages of a criminal forfeiture proceeding. Title V of the Act contains miscellaneous provisions added in conference, some of which may be of special interest. United States Attorneys and Assistant United States Attorneys must live within the district for which they are appointed, except in certain cases. The Attorney General has the authority to supervise and direct litigation for the United States, including marshaling and directing Department of Justice personnel. The Act allows for waivers of residency requirements for U.S. Attorneys and Assistant U.S. Attorneys assigned additional duties outside their appointed districts. The Attorney General can temporarily fill vacancies in the office of United States Attorney. The Act repeals the district court's authority to make temporary appointments if a replacement is not confirmed within 120 days, allowing the Attorney General's temporary designee to serve until the vacancy is filled. The Secretary of Homeland Security is added to the line of presidential succession, and the President now appoints the Director of BATFE with Senate approval. The President appoints marshals in federal judicial districts with Senate approval, with no statutory qualifications. The Act outlines minimum qualifications for marshals, which some view as infringing on the President's nomination power granted by the Constitution. Most offices in question are created by statute, allowing Congress to set qualifications for appointments. The Act outlines minimum qualifications for marshals appointed by the President with Senate approval, in line with Congress's authority to establish offices and set eligibility rules. The Supreme Court has noted that Congress has the power to determine functions, jurisdiction, and qualifications for appointees, except as provided by the Constitution. The Act sets minimum qualifications for marshals appointed by the President with Senate approval, raising questions about the intention behind these requirements compared to other key positions within the Department of Justice. The Act sets minimum qualifications for marshals appointed by the President with Senate approval, raising questions about the intention behind these requirements compared to other key positions within the Department of Justice. Section 506 of the Act creates a new National Security Division within the Department of Justice, headed by a new Assistant Attorney General, comprising prosecutors from the DOJ's Criminal Division's Counterespionage and Counterterrorism sections and attorneys from the DOJ's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review. The Commission recommended placing national security elements under a new Assistant Attorney General for National Security to improve the organizational scheme. Critics argue that curtailing the independence of the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review could lead to adverse impacts and further delays in the FISA application process. The FISA Court's conclusion that the OIPR has lost its independence as a gatekeeper may lead to closer scrutiny of applications and potential delays. The President agreed with the Commission's recommendation to appoint a new Assistant Attorney General for National Security. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 also includes similar provisions for oversight of sensitive investigative authority. The President appointed a new Assistant Attorney General for National Security, with responsibilities including serving as head of the DOJ National Security Division, consulting with the DNI before recommending a nominee, authorizing FISA-related duties, approving wiretap orders, and admitting witnesses into the protection program. The AAG must provide briefings on Division cases involving classified information. The Assistant Attorney General for National Security has various responsibilities, including advising the Attorney General on espionage charging documents, approving undercover operations, and consulting on emergency law enforcement assistance. The National Security Division, headed by the AAG, consists of various sections and entities designated by the Attorney General. Division employees are prohibited from engaging in political activities. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has a 20-day referral period for AAG nominees. Federal law allows expedited habeas corpus procedures for state death row inmates in qualifying states. Few states have opted in due to requirements for competent counsel in postconviction proceedings. The Act allows for expedited capital procedures for state death row inmates in qualifying states. Critics suggest an amendment in section 507, allowing the Attorney General to determine state qualification with retroactive effect and review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Opponents raise separation of powers concerns and question who is better suited to determine adequacy of defense counsel for capital defendants. States can opt-in based on the Attorney General's determination. The Act allows for expedited capital procedures for state death row inmates in qualifying states. It establishes criteria for opting into expedited procedures, including appointment of counsel, waiver of counsel, retention of counsel, or determination of non-indigence. The Act amends subsection 2261(d) to remove a restriction on attorneys who represented the prisoner during state appellate process. It introduces a de novo standard of review for the Attorney General's determination before the D.C. Circuit. The expedited time deadline for U.S. district court action on a habeas petition is extended from 6 to 15 days. The Act extends the expedited time deadline for U.S. district court action on a habeas petition from 6 to 15 months, with a maximum stay of 90 days after the appointment of counsel. This overrules the McFarland v. Scott case, allowing for assistance of counsel in filing the petition. The Act adds provisions related to Secret Service protection, including federal crimes for trespassing, disorderly conduct, blocking passage, committing violence, or conspiring to do so in areas designated for Secret Service protection. The Act includes federal crimes for obstructing Secret Service officers in their duties, punishable by up to one year in prison and/or a $1,000 fine. It also increases penalties for offenses in designated areas, with potential imprisonment up to 10 years for significant bodily injury or use of a deadly weapon. The Act introduces federal crimes with varying fines and imprisonment terms, including for obstructing Secret Service officers and entering restricted areas during special events of national significance. Organizations face double the fines compared to individuals. The Act introduces federal crimes for obstructing Secret Service officers and entering restricted areas during special events of national significance, with no clear definition provided for such events. This raises questions about the constitutional basis for these criminal prohibitions. The Constitution grants Congress specific legislative authority for treason, piracy, and offenses against the law of nations. However, every law enacted by Congress must be based on its enumerated powers. It is unclear which of Congress's powers support the creation of trespassing offenses in restricted areas during special events. The First Amendment may pose challenges when significant access restrictions are imposed on public areas during special events of national significance, even if Congress has the power to enact laws for the District of Columbia. Events impacting interstate or foreign commerce fall within Congress's regulatory authority. Interpretative regulations limiting the First Amendment's application to areas within Congress's legislative authority may be constitutionally valid. Repealing subsection 1752 could still imply regulatory authority. Section 603 of the Act includes special event tickets under the statute prohibiting misuse of government-issued identification documents. Section 1028 outlines unauthorized possession or trafficking in identification documents. The Act amends laws regarding possession or trafficking in identification documents under specific jurisdictional circumstances, including documents issued by federal entities or used to defraud the United States. It adds special event sponsors' documents to the protected class and expands the definition of \"identification document\" to include special event documents. The Act amends laws related to possession or trafficking in identification documents under specific jurisdictional circumstances, including documents issued by federal entities or used to defraud the United States. It adds special event sponsors' documents to the protected class and expands the definition of \"identification document\" to include special event documents. The third amendment raises questions about Congress's authority to prohibit unlawful possession or trafficking in special event identification documents. The PROTECT Act authorizes officers and agents of the Secret Service to provide investigative and forensic services in missing and exploited children cases. This legislation raises questions about Congress's authority to prohibit possession or trafficking in special event identification documents. The PROTECT Act authorizes the Secret Service to provide investigative and forensic services for missing and exploited children cases. Section 604 of the Act changes the authority of the Secret Service to reflect this. Section 605 organizes the Uniformed Division under title 18 of the United States Code. This is unique as most federal law enforcement agencies do not have their authority in title 18. The PROTECT Act authorizes the Secret Service to provide investigative and forensic services for missing and exploited children cases. Section 604 of the Act changes the authority of the Secret Service to reflect this. Section 605 organizes the Uniformed Division under title 18 of the United States Code, with additional protective duties listed.

It also grants members of the Division the authority to carry firearms, make arrests, and perform other duties authorized by law. Additionally, the Act allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to contract out protection for foreign missions and officials outside of the District of Columbia. The PROTECT Act authorizes the Secret Service to provide protection for presidential and vice presidential candidates, visiting heads of state, and special events of national significance. It grants members the authority to carry firearms, make arrests, and perform other duties authorized by law. The Act allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to contract out protection for foreign missions and officials outside of the District of Columbia. Additionally, the Act repeals certain sections and declares the Secret Service a distinct entity within the Department of Homeland Security. Major presidential and vice presidential candidates are entitled to Secret Service protection. The Secret Service's electronic crime task forces include federal and state law enforcement members, academia, and industry representatives who share information on computer security. Advisory committees are established by statute, the President, or an executive agency to provide advice and recommendations to federal agencies. Groups consisting solely of US officers or employees are not considered advisory committees under the Federal Advisory Commission Act. The candidates protection advisory committee and electronic crimes task forces may not be considered advisory committees under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Section 608 of the Act exempts these task forces from the provisions of the Act. Title VII of the Act addresses regulation of methamphetamine precursor chemicals. Title VII of the Act focuses on regulating methamphetamine precursor chemicals like ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine (EPP), increasing penalties for methamphetamine offenses, and implementing environmentally-related regulations.

Violations can result in penalties up to $25,000. The Attorney General has the authority to regulate EPP imports and exports, including increasing import quotas and requiring chain of distribution information from importers. Compliance with international trade obligations is ensured through consultation with the U.S. Trade Representative.

The conferees felt that Lachowski \"undermined the ability of the Federal government to seek cleanup costs from methamphetamine traffickers who are convicted only of methamphetamine possession.\" The Attorney General may make grants to state, local, and tribal governments for the operation of drug courts, with guidelines for mandatory drug testing and sanctions for test failures. Appropriations for FY2006 of $70 million are authorized for these programs. The Act includes provisions for a drug court program for low-level, non-violent federal offenders and creates three methamphetamine-related grant programs.
