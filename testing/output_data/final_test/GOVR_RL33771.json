    "content": "At the end of 2007, an estimated 33.2 million people were living with HIV/AIDS, with 2.5 million newly infected and 2.1 million deaths that year. Over 2 million were children, and 290,000 deaths were under 15 years old. 1,000 children worldwide were newly infected with HIV each day in 2007 due to limited access to prevention drugs. Only 9% of pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries were offered services to prevent HIV transmission to their newborns. In 2005, tuberculosis (TB) killed 1.6 million people, including 195,000 with HIV/AIDS. 8.8 million contracted TB, mostly in Africa and Asia. 84% of cases were in 22 countries, with half in Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Philippines. Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa had the most cases, with Africa having the highest per capita rate. Malaria causes over 1 million deaths annually, with 85-90% in Africa, mostly children. HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria are preventable. HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria are preventable diseases with catastrophic impacts, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Co-infection of TB/HIV is a significant burden in the region, with high mortality rates. Treatment of TB or HIV in co-infected patients has positive effects on halting the advancement of both diseases. Co-infection of TB/HIV has significant impacts on disease progression. HIV replication increases during active TB but returns to baseline post-TB therapy. ARV treatment can slow latent TB progression. Malaria can enhance HIV replication and transmission rates. Studies show a link between acute malaria and increased HIV viral load, which decreases with malaria treatment. HIV-positive pregnant women are more susceptible to malaria. Malaria-HIV co-infection increases risks of maternal and infant mortality. Co-infected pregnant women with HIV and malaria have a higher risk of transmitting HIV to their children. Drug resistance complicates efforts to control TB and malaria, with WHO reporting an increase in treatment-resistant TB cases, including Extensive Drug Resistant TB (XDR-TB) resistant to multiple drugs. The Global Task Force convened by WHO reviewed data on XDR-TB incidence and developed an emergency action plan to contain the deadly strain. Experts are concerned about the rise in malarial deaths in sub-Saharan Africa due to treatment resistance, with chloroquine becoming ineffective. Newer treatments for malaria, such as artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), are more effective but expensive at $2 per treatment course. President Bill Clinton requested $100 million from Congress for the LIFE Initiative to expand global HIV/AIDS efforts, targeting funds at 13 countries with high new HIV infections. In FY2000, Congress allocated significant funding for global HIV/AIDS programs, surpassing President Clinton's LIFE Initiative request. This included $189.3 million to USAID and $46.7 million to the CDC's Global AIDS Program. Congress further expanded appropriations in FY2001 to various departments and made the first U.S. Global Fund contribution. The LIFE Initiative raised congressional awareness about global HIV/AIDS epidemic implications, increased U.S. spending, and enhanced receptivity to President Bush's Emergency AIDS Plan. U.S. officials argued HIV/AIDS threatened economic growth, political stability, and civil society, making it a trade, security, and development issue. President Bush requested $500 million for the International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative in FY2002 to prevent HIV transmission from mothers to infants in Africa and the Caribbean. Congress provided up to $100 million. President Bush proposed the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) during his State of the Union Address in 2003, aiming to combat HIV/AIDS with $15 billion over five years. Congress allocated funds for Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) programs through the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative (GHAI) after the LIFE Initiative expired in 2004. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) was proposed by President Bush in 2003 with the aim of combating HIV/AIDS with $15 billion over five years. Congress allocated funds for global TB programs, international HIV/AIDS research, and bilateral HIV/AIDS programs in various countries, including U.S. Global Fund contributions. Congress consistently allocated more funds than requested by the Administration, exceeding the President's five-year spending proposal for PEPFAR by nearly $5 billion from FY2004 through FY2008. Between FY2004 and FY2008, $18.3 billion was appropriated for global HIV/AIDS programs and the Global Fund, with Congress providing $6.3 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts, exceeding the President's request by $570 million. PEPFAR aimed to support care for 10 million HIV-affected people, prevent 7 million new HIV infections, and provide ARVs to 2 million people. As of September 30, 2007, PEPFAR-participating U.S. agencies have supported PMTCT services during over 10 million pregnancies, with over 827,000 receiving ARVs. PEPFAR programs, led by OGAC at the U.S. Department of State, have provided PMTCT services during over 10 million pregnancies, with over 827,000 receiving ARV treatment, preventing an estimated 157,000 new HIV infections. Additionally, ARV medication has been purchased and distributed for 1.44 million people, including 1.35 million in Focus Countries and 86,000 children. Care has been provided for over 6.6 million people in Focus Countries, including 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children, along with HIV counseling and testing services for over 33 million people. U.S. agencies and departments also implement international HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs not funded through PEPFAR. Since FY2007, global malaria funds have been provided through the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI), launched by President Bush in June 2005 to increase support for U.S. international malaria programs. The Administration has requested that all support for bilateral malaria efforts be provided to USAID as the coordinating agency for the initiative. The Administration shifted leadership for bilateral malaria programs to USAID in FY2005, separating malaria spending from HIV/AIDS and TB requests in annual reports to Congress. There is debate about including malaria in PEPFAR spending estimates, but U.S. spending on international malaria activities is included. In the first two fiscal years of PEPFAR implementation, spending on HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria was reported to Congress. Various U.S. departments implement PEPFAR programs, with OGAC coordinating most global HIV/AIDS spending. USAID, HHS, DOD, and CDC receive significant appropriations for international HIV/AIDS efforts. The Administration shifted leadership for malaria programs to USAID in FY2005. U.S. spending on international malaria activities is included in PEPFAR estimates. In FY2003, the Leadership Act authorized the creation of OGAC to coordinate global HIV/AIDS spending by U.S. agencies in 15 Focus Countries. OGAC transfers funds received from Congress to implementing departments and agencies. Funds appropriated to OGAC from FY2004 to FY2008 are illustrated in Figure 1. In FY2004 through FY2008, Congress provided increasing appropriations to the Global Health and Child Survival program, reaching a total of $10.6 billion. USAID implements global HIV/AIDS programs in 50 countries and additional 48 countries through regional programs. The LIFE Initiative expands global HIV/AIDS programs to 48 additional countries through regional programs. It focuses on strengthening primary health care systems, providing training and commodities to reduce HIV transmission, supporting people infected with HIV/AIDS, and reducing high-risk behaviors. USAID was previously the sole agency funded by Congress for bilateral HIV/AIDS programs, receiving $189.3 million in FY2000 and $318.0 million in FY2001, with an additional $100.0 million for the Global Fund. In FY2002, USAID received $474.0 million for HIV/AIDS projects, including $100 million for the PMTCT Initiative and an additional $50.0 million for the Global Fund. In FY2003, Congress increased funding to $523.8 million for HIV/AIDS projects, with $99.3 million for the PMTCT Initiative and $248.4 million for the Global Fund. In FY2004, USAID's bilateral programs received $555.5 million, while GHAI for the 15 Focus Countries got $488.1 million. In FY2005 and FY2006, GHAI funding increased to $1,373.5 million and $1,777.0 million, respectively, while support for USAID's bilateral programs decreased. In FY2007, appropriations to USAID bilateral HIV/AIDS programs fell to $345.9 million, but nearly reached FY2006 levels in FY2008 with Congress providing $371.1 million; the President requested $346.3 million. Overall obligations to USAID for global HIV/AIDS efforts have increased despite declining appropriations for USAID's HIV/AIDS programs since FY2004. OGAC transfers funds to implementing agencies and departments for HIV/AIDS programs. Most funds appropriated to USAID are spent on global HIV/AIDS programs in non-Focus Countries. In FY2004, OGAC transferred $230.0 million to USAID for HIV/AIDS projects, increasing USAID's total funding to $785.0 million for HIV/AIDS efforts. Subsequently, transfers to USAID continued to rise in the following fiscal years, reaching $1,552.0 million in FY2007. Additionally, various HHS agencies, including the CDC's Global AIDS Program, are involved in PEPFAR activities in multiple countries. The Global AIDS Program (GAP) operates in 25 countries and regional programs in Asia, the Caribbean, Central America, and Southern Africa. CDC initiated international HIV/AIDS programs in FY2000 under the LIFE Initiative, sending medical experts to assist with HIV/AIDS-related activities. GAP aims to prevent HIV infection, improve treatment and care for those living with HIV, and build healthcare capacity. Specific activities include HIV lab tests, ARV drug therapy, PMTCT, counseling and testing, blood transfusion services, injection safety programs, and infrastructure building. In FY2000, Congress allocated $34.8 million for CDC's global HIV/AIDS programs, with additional funding for prevention and research. Funding increased to $143.7 million in FY2002, and remained steady in FY2003 at $142.6 million for GAP programs. However, funding dropped slightly in FY2004 to $124.9 million for GAP and $142.0 million for the PMTCT Initiative. In FY2005, Congress stopped funding the PMTCT Initiative, but funds are now included in GHAI appropriations with OGAC transferring funds to CDC for PMTCT activities. GAP funding slightly decreased in FY2005 and FY2006, but increased in FY2007. Despite declining appropriations to CDC GAP since FY2004, total provisions have increased when OGAC transfers are included. NIH has been involved in international HIV prevention efforts since 1984. NIH has been involved in global HIV research since 1984, conducting research in 90 countries. Efforts include developing an HIV vaccine, prevention methods, STD prevention, behavior change promotion, mother-to-child transmission prevention, therapeutics for co-infection, and treatment in resource-poor settings. OAR's international HIV/AIDS research spending is determined by field research activities, not PEPFAR priorities. International HIV/AIDS research spending is driven by research activities conducted in the field. NIH staff explain that its program spending fluctuations represent the funding phases of multi-year grants that support the research activities. OAR directs most of its funds to U.S.-based investigators who conduct HIV/AIDS research in collaboration with international scientists. In FY2007, OAR provided an estimated $372.0 million in grants for global AIDS research activities and anticipates providing $363.6 million in FY2008. HRSA helps PEPFAR Focus Countries develop HIV care and treatment plans through training conducted by International Training and Education Centers on HIV (I-TECH). I-TECH was established in 2002 by HRSA and CDC to share lessons learned from U.S. domestic AIDS education efforts. It offers technical assistance on HIV/AIDS program expansion in resource-poor countries, focusing on training programs, health education materials, and HIV awareness messages. The Bush Administration expressed skepticism about the use of generic ARV medication and required drugs purchased with PEPFAR funds to pass FDA inspection. They believed WHO's prequalification process was not sufficient. The U.S. position on generic ARV medications in PEPFAR programs was influenced by Randall Tobias, the then-Global AIDS Coordinator appointed by President Bush in 2003. Despite concerns about Tobias's ties to the pharmaceutical industry, the Bush Administration defended his appointment citing his private sector experience. Debate over the use of generic ARVs in PEPFAR programs persisted even after the FDA approved the first generic ARV in December 2004. Critics argued that the FDA's expedited review process was unnecessary and caused delays in drug distribution. The FDA's expedited review process for generic ARVs in PEPFAR programs was necessary to ensure safety and quality. Over 50 generic versions of patented ARVs have been approved. The Department of Defense also participates in HIV prevention efforts through the LIFE initiative, assisting foreign militaries with HIV/AIDS-specific policies and programs. The Department of Defense implements and evaluates HIV prevention programs, assists foreign countries with military-specific interventions, and collaborates with other government programs and allies. Funding for DOD's HIV prevention efforts varied from $10.0 million in FY2001 to $7.0 million in FY2003, with additional appropriations in subsequent years. In FY2005, DOD received $7.5 million for HIV prevention, followed by $5.2 million in FY2006. FY2007 Defense Appropriations did not allocate funds for DOD's HIV/AIDS programs, but OGAC transferred funds. In FY2008, Congress provided $8.0 million for DOD's HIV/AIDS prevention efforts. OGAC significantly boosted DOD's global HIV prevention spending through transfers in FY2004 ($14.0 million), FY2005 ($33.0 million), FY2006 ($49.0 million), and FY2007 ($70.0 million). DOL implements HIV/AIDS workplace programs through ILAB, focusing on developing prevention and education programs. ILAB initiated HIV prevention programs under former President Clinton's LIFE Initiative, receiving $10 million in FY2001 for global HIV/AIDS efforts. Congress maintained funding for DOL HIV-prevention programs at $10 million from FY2001 to FY2004. The FY2004 Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations directed ILAB to transfer funds to the International Labor Organization. In FY2005, appropriations to ILAB HIV programs fell to $1.9 million; conference report language included the statement that funds were to be transferred to the ILO. Congress did not provide any funds to DOL for HIV-in-the-workplace programs in FY2006. The Administration did not request funds for DOL HIV programs in FY2007 or FY2008. OGAC transferred funds to the department from FY2005 to FY2007. Some speculate that the decline in congressional support for DOL's HIV-in-the-workplace programs was due to the Bush Administration's opposition to ILAB's technical assistance programs. Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao has tried to minimize ILAB's activities since FY2002, focusing on core labor standards and combating child labor abuses. She criticized ILAB for straying from its mission by engaging in activities like combating HIV/AIDS and spending too much on overhead. The Peace Corps utilizes volunteers to support HIV/AIDS initiatives in 77 countries, with 20% of volunteers involved in health projects globally. Over 800,000 people have benefited from Peace Corps HIV/AIDS training. Funding for international HIV/AIDS activities has not been provided by Congress since the launch of PEPFAR. OGAC has transferred increasing amounts of money to Peace Corps for HIV/AIDS efforts from 2004 to 2007. The Department of Commerce provides support to PEPFAR for public-private partnerships. The U.S. Census Bureau supports PEPFAR by assisting with data management and analysis, estimating infections averted, and mapping country-level activities. Congressional debate on reauthorizing PEPFAR has begun, with proposed changes to the authorizing legislation. Some analysts highlight health infrastructure challenges and worker shortages in many countries. The U.S. Census Bureau supports PEPFAR by assisting with data management and analysis, estimating infections averted, and mapping country-level activities. Congressional debate on reauthorizing PEPFAR has begun, with proposed changes to the authorizing legislation. Health infrastructure challenges and worker shortages in many countries need to be addressed to effectively combat the global spread of HIV/AIDS. President Bush requested $30 billion to extend PEPFAR for five more years, aiming to support treatment for 2.5 million people, prevent 12 million new infections, and care for 12 million people, including 5 million orphans and vulnerable children. In August 2007, Senator Richard Lugar introduced the HIV/AIDS Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2007 (S. 1966) to authorize $30 billion for FY2009 through FY2013. Some advocates want Congress to provide more than the $30 billion requested by the President. Senator Joseph Biden urged Congress to provide $50 billion for a five-year PEPFAR reauthorization. Representative Tom Lantos supports increasing funding for PEPFAR dramatically. The House Foreign Affairs Committee plans to consider reauthorization of the PEPFAR initiative in 2008. Debate may include setting spending limits for U.S. contributions to the Global Fund, with some arguing for the 33% limit to represent annual U.S. contributions while others see it as a ceiling. Concerns exist about whether U.S. contributions to the Fund impact bilateral HIV/AIDS programs. At an FY2005 Senate Appropriations Committee hearing, the Administration proposed $1 billion for the Global Fund over five years. Congress consistently provided more than requested, appropriating $3 billion from FY2004 to FY2008. In FY2008, Congress allocated $840.3 million to the Fund, the largest U.S. contribution to date. Some experts argue that spending requirements for HIV prevention activities are insufficient. Some health experts criticize the allocation of PEPFAR funds, particularly the emphasis on abstinence-until-marriage programs. P.L. 108-25 outlines that 55% of funds are for HIV treatment, 15% for palliative care, 20% for prevention (with 33% for abstinence programs), and 10% for children affected by HIV/AIDS. Opponents question the 33% allocation for abstinence programs, citing a 2006 GAO report. The April 2006 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report criticized PEPFAR's spending requirements, stating that it limited flexibility in prevention spending. The report found that between FY2004 and FY2006, OGAC increased prevention spending by almost 55% to meet the 33% proviso. Additionally, OGAC mandated that half of prevention funds be spent on sexual transmission prevention and two-thirds on abstinence/faithfulness (AB) activities. Congress is considering legislation to uphold, modify, or eliminate the abstinence-until-marriage spending requirement. In the 110th Congress, legislation has been enacted to require the Administration to follow Congress's funding guidelines for prevention activities in FY2008, despite the 33% spending requirement for abstinence-until-marriage activities. Bills like the HIV/AIDS Assistance Reauthorization Act (S. 1966) aim to increase the portion of prevention funds for abstinence-until-marriage and fidelity activities to 50%. Other bills, such as the Protection Against Transmission of HIV for Women and Youth Act of 2007 (H.R. 1713 and S. 2415) and the HIV Prevention Act of 2007 (S. 1553), seek to eliminate the 33% spending requirement, which some experts find troubling due to its lack of consideration for gender dynamics in highly affected countries like Africa. Research shows that married girls and women in Africa are more susceptible to contracting HIV compared to their single counterparts. In response to the higher HIV infection rates among married girls and women compared to their single counterparts in countries like Kenya and Zambia, legislation has been introduced to address gender inequities in HIV prevention. The Protection Against Transmission of HIV for Women and Youth Act of 2007 (H.R. 1713 and S. 2415) aims to reduce gender disparities in HIV infection rates by requiring the President to develop a comprehensive global HIV prevention strategy that targets vulnerabilities of both married and unmarried women and girls. Disparities in HIV infection rates are a concern, with advocates arguing that too much funding goes to abstinence-only programs, limiting funds for other prevention strategies. Health experts push for more spending on preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission. UNAIDS reports that 1,800 children worldwide are infected with HIV daily, mostly newborns. Over 85% of infected children are in sub-Saharan Africa, but transmission rates are rising in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In 2005, less than 8% of pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries had access to HIV prevention services. The Global Pediatric HIV/AIDS Prevention and Treatment Act of 2007 aims to ensure 80% of pregnant women in Focus Countries have access to prevention services by 2013. PEPFAR aims to ensure 80% of pregnant women in Focus Countries receive HIV counseling and testing by 2013. Advocates suggest expanding condom guidelines, while critics argue current policies are limited. Some experts urge including married women in condom distribution strategies. Supporters defend the broad definition of \"high risk\" individuals. Experts are pushing for legislation similar to the HIV Prevention Act of 2007 to include married and young people as \"high risk\" individuals. Integrating family planning into HIV/AIDS programs is seen as cost-effective, with family planning services potentially preventing more HIV-positive births than ARVs. Various bills, such as the Ensuring Access to Contraceptives Act and the Focus on Family Worldwide Act of 2007, aim to combine family planning and HIV/AIDS activities to address the global HIV/AIDS crisis affecting millions of children and infants. In 2007, an estimated 290,000 children died from HIV/AIDS worldwide. Without treatment, 50% of HIV-positive children die before age two and 75% before age five. Advocates urge increased funding for pediatric HIV/AIDS treatment. The Global Pediatric HIV/AIDS Prevention and Treatment Act of 2007 aims to ensure children make up at least 15% of those receiving treatment by 2013. Vietnam was selected as a Focus Country due to concerns of an HIV/AIDS explosion. In 2007, Vietnam was chosen as a Focus Country for HIV/AIDS assistance due to concerns of an HIV/AIDS explosion, despite having 130,000 infected people. U.S. officials recognized Vietnam's commitment to fighting the disease by spending $36 per person for HIV/AIDS care. Some argued India, with 5.3 million HIV-positive people, should have been chosen, but the White House cited existing aid to India as a factor. In January 2007, U.S. Representative Barbara Lee introduced H.R. 175 to provide assistance for combating HIV/AIDS in India, advocating for other countries with rapidly spreading virus to be included in GHAI. HIV/AIDS advocates urge Congress to increase support in areas like Eastern Europe and Central Asia, where HIV prevalence has significantly increased. Legislation has been introduced to boost support in India and the Caribbean as well. In February 2007, Representative Luis Fortuno introduced H.R. 848 to authorize assistance to combat HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean region. The average HIV/AIDS prevalence rate for the Caribbean is 1%, with most cases in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Global AIDS Coordinator Ambassador Mark Dybul emphasized the importance of building health infrastructure and strengthening health systems for efficient PEPFAR programs. In FY2006, OGAC allocated $44.8 million to policy analysis and system strengthening, including quality assurance, financial management, health networks, infrastructure, and commodity distribution. GAO criticized some aspects of PEPFAR's health system strengthening efforts, noting that strategies to increase healthcare workers in Africa may not be cost-effective. The African Health Capacity Investment Act of 2007 aims to improve healthcare capacity in Africa through training, incentives for health worker retention, and other related activities. The African Health Capacity Investment Act of 2007 aims to improve healthcare capacity in Africa by providing incentives for health worker retention and establishing off-site HIV/AIDS testing and treatment facilities. The bill also requires the President to develop a strategy to coordinate health-related strategies with other donors. Additionally, the United States Commitment to Global Child Survival Act of 2007 authorizes funds to integrate activities related to PMTCT, HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment, malaria, TB, and family planning. The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that there were 854 million undernourished people in the world, with the majority in Asia, India, and China. Malnutrition is a significant issue in Asia, India, China, and Africa, with one in three people in Africa being undernourished. Poor nutrition in HIV-positive individuals weakens the immune response to the virus, leading to more frequent illnesses and faster progression to AIDS. Malnutrition also increases the risk of HIV transmission from mother to child and can reduce the effectiveness of anti-retroviral medication. Studies show that HIV patients require more energy and protein than non-infected adults. Patients who are malnourished when starting ARV therapy are at higher risk of death and side-effects, leading to treatment discontinuation. HIV/AIDS advocates are pushing for nutritional support integration in PEPFAR programs, while OGAC supports limited therapeutic feeding for specific groups. The Administration states that addressing food insecurity comprehensively is beyond the scope of the Emergency Plan. At an April 2007 House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, Global AIDS Coordinator Mark Dybul testified that OGAC had contributed funds to the World Food Program. The United States provides a significant portion of WFP's resources. In FY2008, Congress directed OGAC to allocate at least $100 million of PEPFAR funds to address food security. In December 2007, Representative Donald Payne introduced the Global HIV/AIDS Food Security and Nutrition Support Act of 2007 (H.R. 4914) to integrate food security and nutrition activities into HIV/AIDS efforts. Some HIV/AIDS advocates oppose congressional spending requirements, which could limit the exploration of emerging technologies like microbicides. Health experts are optimistic about the development of microbicides, urging Congress to increase support for research. Legislation such as The Microbicide Development Act (H.R. 1420 and S. 823) has been introduced to support microbicide research. The bills H.R. 1420 and S. 823 amend the Public Health Service Act to expedite federal microbicide research and development. They mandate the establishment of a unit within the Division of AIDS for this purpose. Additionally, the bills require the development of a program at USAID to support microbicide products. Some researchers suggest expanding support for HIV/AIDS vaccine research, arguing it should be a key part of U.S. international assistance. Senator Richard Lugar introduced the Vaccines for the Future Act of 2007 (S. 569) to accelerate the development of vaccines for diseases like HIV/AIDS. The bill aims to support research, development, and manufacturing incentives through public-private partnerships and tax credits for researchers and manufacturers. Appendix B lists the participating agencies and departments in U.S. Global HIV/AIDS Initiatives: LIFE and PEPFAR."
