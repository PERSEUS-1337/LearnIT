    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Occupational Safety and Health Amendments of 1995\". Employee participation is addressed in the Act. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 is amended to include a new subsection (c) that allows for the establishment of employee participation committees to address safety and health concerns in the workplace. These committees do not have the authority to negotiate or enter into collective bargaining agreements with employers. The amendment specifies that employee participation committees addressing safety and health concerns in the workplace are not considered labor organizations or representatives under specific labor acts. SEC. 3. RISK ASSESSMENT IN STANDARDS MAKING. In amending the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, priority for establishing standards relating to toxic materials or harmful physical agents is determined based on the number of exposed workers, potential impairment severity, and likelihood of impairment. Additionally, in promulgating final regulations or standards, the Secretary must conduct risk assessments and publish them in the Federal Register. The Secretary must publish in the Federal Register an estimate of risks to employee health and safety, the impact on human health and the environment, and costs of implementing regulations. Additionally, a comparative analysis of risks and a certification based on scientific evaluation are required. The Secretary must certify that regulations are based on the best available scientific data, will advance the purpose of protecting employee health and safety or the environment, and will produce benefits that justify the costs. If unable to certify, the Secretary must take alternative actions. The Secretary must notify Congress and publish reasons if unable to certify regulations based on scientific data. No cause of action is granted to any person. SEC. 4. CONSULTATION SERVICES. Section 21(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 is amended to allow the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with States for consultation services on safe working conditions. States with approved plans under section 18 can participate if they do not have federally funded consultation provisions. The Secretary will reimburse participating States for 90% of the costs incurred. The Secretary can enter into cooperative agreements with States for consultation services on safe working conditions. States will be reimbursed for 90% of the costs incurred, including training and out-of-State travel expenses for State staff. Reimbursement is limited to costs for consultation services and specified expenses. SEC. 5. REDUCED PENALTIES FOR NONSERIOUS VIOLATIONS. Amends the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to reduce civil penalties for nonserious violations. Limits penalties to not more than $25 for certain violations and restricts penalties to one instance of violation per regulation. SEC. 6. WARNINGS IN LIEU OF CITATIONS. Section 9 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act is amended to allow the Secretary to issue citations to employers for violations. Citations must describe the violation and provide a reasonable time for correction. In some cases, a warning may be issued instead of a citation. The Secretary can issue a warning instead of a citation for violations that are not related to employee safety or when the employer promptly corrects the violation. The Act does not prevent the Secretary from providing technical assistance to employers to fix violations found during inspections."
