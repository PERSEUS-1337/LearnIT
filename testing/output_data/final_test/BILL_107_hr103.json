    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tribal Sovereignty Protection Act\". The Congress findings include the impact of a California Supreme Court decision on tribal gaming rights, the economic benefits of Indian gaming in California, and the forced signing of gaming compacts by 61 California tribes with Governor Gray Davis. Governor Gray Davis acted in bad faith by conditioning gaming compacts on tribes signing labor agreements, potentially allowing labor unions on tribal lands. The United States Constitution recognizes tribes as sovereign entities with the right to self-govern. The National Labor Relations Board exempts tribally-owned businesses on Indian lands from the National Labor Relations Act. Labor agreements were forced on California tribes. The labor agreements imposed on California tribes establish jurisdiction in State court, forcing tribes to relinquish sovereignty and constitutional rights to save their enterprises. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act aims to promote tribal economic development and shield tribes from organized crime in gaming operations. Labor agreements, unique to California, could undermine Tribal-State compacts. The National Gambling Impact Study Commission report recommends that Indian tribes in California enter into labor agreements that could lead to unionization of casino employees. If tribes do not comply, Congress may enforce labor organizing rights on them, potentially undermining tribal sovereignty. Labor agreements in California could jeopardize Tribal-State compacts and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act's objectives. Amending the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to protect tribal sovereignty and prevent forced unionization of casino employees by the State or Federal Government. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON LABOR AGREEMENTS AS PART OF TRIBAL-STATE COMPACTS. Section 11(d)(3) of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act is amended to prohibit any Tribal-State compact from including labor terms or conditions for employees of tribally owned businesses on Indian lands. Any such provision will be null and void. The Tribal-State compact will remain in force even if a provision related to labor terms for employees of tribally owned businesses on Indian lands is deemed null and void."
