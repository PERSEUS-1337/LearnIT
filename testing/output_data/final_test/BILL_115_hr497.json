EXCHANGE OF LAND; EQUALIZATION OF VALUE. SEC. 3. Exchange Authorized under certain conditions, allowing the Conservation District to convey land to the United States in exchange for Federal land, with equalization of values required. The Conservation District can convey all rights to non-Federal land and equalize values through in-kind transfers for an exchange with the United States. An equalization payment may be necessary to balance the fair market values of the exchanged properties. The Conservation District may need to make an equalization payment to the United States if the credited value of the non-Federal exchange parcel is not sufficient to offset the entire amount. If the payment is not made, the exchange will not proceed. The value of land for exchange will be determined by independent appraisers following national standards. No additional equalization payment is required if the non-Federal land value exceeds the Federal land and credited value. Title to the land for exchange must be acceptable to the Secretary and Conservation District. The Secretary will finalize a map and legal descriptions of the land, correcting any minor errors. Costs of conveyance must be paid by the Conservation District. The applicable law for land exchange must be acceptable to the Secretary and Conservation District.
