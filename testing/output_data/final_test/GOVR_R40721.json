    "content": "The FY2010 Agriculture appropriations bill (P.L. 111-80) was enacted on October 21, 2009, with $121.1 billion in total funding, a 12% increase from FY2009. Mandatory appropriations are $97.8 billion (+11%), while discretionary funding is $23.3 billion (+13%). The largest increases in funding are for domestic and foreign nutrition assistance. Important policy issues resolved include dairy financial assistance and imports of poultry from China. The Agriculture appropriations bill (P.L. 111-80) includes $350 million for dairy farmer assistance and allows poultry imports from China under specified conditions. It provides funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Drug Administration, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The Senate handles CFTC appropriations through the Financial Services appropriations subcommittee. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, specifically their Subcommittee on Agriculture, oversee the appropriations bill. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has diverse responsibilities beyond farm programs, with a budget authority of $114.6 billion for FY2009. The USDA's budget authority for FY2009 was $114.6 billion, with food and nutrition programs receiving the largest share at $76 billion (66%). The second-largest area was farm and foreign agricultural services with $21 billion (18%). Other areas included natural resource and environmental programs (8%), rural development (3%), research and education programs (2%), marketing and regulatory programs (2%), and food safety (1%). Two-thirds of the budget for natural resources programs, primarily allocated to the Forest Service, amounting to about $7 billion. The Forest Service, unlike other USDA agencies, is funded through the Interior appropriations bill and comprises one-third of USDA's personnel with nearly 34,000 staff years in FY2009. Comparing USDA's organization and budget data to the Agriculture appropriations bill can be challenging due to differing program definitions and spending allocations. USDA's mission areas include agricultural research, marketing, regulatory programs, and food safety. Funding types (mandatory vs. discretionary) are important, with conservation programs being discretionary. The Agriculture appropriations subcommittees also oversee funding for the FDA. The FDA and CFTC receive about 2% of funding from the Agriculture and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Jurisdiction over CFTC appropriations differs between the House and Senate, with placement alternating between Agriculture and Financial Services subcommittees in recent years. The FDA and CFTC are included in the Agriculture appropriations bill due to their historical connection to agricultural markets, but the number of non-agricultural issues they handle has increased. Despite this, agriculture and food issues remain important for both agencies. FDA deals with medical and drug issues, while food safety responsibilities are shared with USDA. CFTC's market for financial futures contracts has grown, but volatility in agricultural commodity markets has also been a focus. Volatility in agricultural commodity markets has been a recent focus at CFTC and in Congress. Discretionary and mandatory spending are treated differently in the budget process. Discretionary spending is controlled annually through appropriations acts, while mandatory programs have eligibility requirements written into authorizing laws. Congress controls spending on mandatory programs through authorizing committees, not appropriations. Approximately 19%-20% of the Agriculture appropriations bill is for these programs. Approximately 19%-20% of the Agriculture appropriations bill is for discretionary programs, while 80%-81% is classified as mandatory. Major discretionary programs include conservation, rural development, research, education, agricultural credit, WIC, international food aid, meat and poultry inspection, and food marketing. Mandatory spending is primarily for food and nutrition programs like SNAP and child nutrition, farm commodity support, crop insurance, and agricultural conservation and trade programs. Mandatory spending in agriculture includes programs like farm commodity support, crop insurance, and conservation programs. Funding for these programs is set by formulas in the 2008 farm bill, with some receiving annual appropriations based on projected spending needs. The Commodity Credit Corporation operates on a line of credit with the Treasury and may receive supplemental appropriations if needed. The Commodity Credit Corporation operates on a line of credit with the Treasury and may receive supplemental appropriations if needed. Budget authority, outlays, and program levels are important terms to understand federal spending discussions. Budget authority is the money Congress allows agencies to spend, outlays are actual money spent, and program levels determine funding limits. The Commodity Credit Corporation operates on a line of credit with the Treasury and may receive supplemental appropriations if needed. Budget authority, outlays, and program levels are important terms in federal spending discussions. Program levels reflect agency activities and may exceed budget authority due to user fees, loans, transfers, or carryover funds. The FY2010 Agriculture appropriations bill (P.L. 111-80) was enacted on October 21, 2009, after passing the House and Senate. The FY2010 Agriculture appropriations bill (P.L. 111-80) was enacted on October 21, 2009 by a vote of 76-22, marking a return to regular order for passing the bill. The bill was last enacted separately in FY2006, and it is the earliest enactment since FY1999. The House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee marked up the bill on June 11, 2009. The FY2010 Agriculture appropriations bill was marked up by the Subcommittee on June 11, 2009, reported by the full Appropriations Committee, and passed by the House on July 9, 2009. The Administration supported the bill but had concerns about a provision on poultry imports from China. A conference agreement was reached on September 30, 2009, and passed by the House on October 7, 2009. The Senate also reported its version of the bill on July 7, 2008. The Agriculture appropriations bill (S. 1406, S.Rept. 111-39) was expedited through the full committee by polling it out of subcommittee. The bill passed the full Senate on August 4, 2009, as an amendment to H.R. 2997, with 18 amendments adopted. Most amendments did not change dollar amounts, except for a dairy price support provision that required a waiver to exceed the budget cap. The Administration supported the bill but had concerns about poultry import restrictions. The Senate bill, passed on October 8, 2009, included provisions on poultry imports from China, allowing imports under specified conditions. Another key difference between the House and Senate bills was $350 million in the Senate bill for dairy financial assistance. The Senate bill included $350 million for dairy financial assistance, which was not in the House bill. P.L. 111-80 allocated $350 million for dairy support, with $60 million for purchasing dairy products and $290 million for direct payments. The Administration requested $123.9 billion for Agriculture appropriations in FY2010, 14% higher than FY2009. The enacted FY2010 Agriculture appropriation was $121.1 billion, a 12% increase. The FY2010 Agriculture appropriation, P.L. 111-80, contains $121.1 billion, which is 12% more than FY2009. Mandatory appropriations in P.L. 111-80 are $97.8 billion, with increases for domestic nutrition assistance, farm commodity programs, and crop insurance. Demand for nutrition assistance programs has risen during the recession. The FY2010 Agriculture appropriation, P.L. 111-80, contains $121.1 billion, which is 12% more than FY2009. Discretionary appropriations in P.L. 111-80 are $23.3 billion, $2.7 billion more than FY2009. Farm commodity program outlays are expected to rise due to falling commodity prices triggering more government payments. The largest discretionary increases are for nutrition assistance. The FY2010 Agriculture appropriation, P.L. 111-80, increased funding for various programs including agricultural, FDA, rural development, conservation, and CFTC. The enacted appropriation exceeded the House and Senate amounts for several programs. The tables in the report provide more transparency this year, including previously unlisted funds such as Section 32 funds now under the Agricultural Marketing Service. The FY2010 Agriculture appropriation, P.L. 111-80, increased funding for various programs including agricultural, FDA, rural development, conservation, and CFTC. The enacted appropriation exceeded the House and Senate amounts for several programs. Tables in the report provide transparency, listing funds such as Section 32 funds now under the Agricultural Marketing Service. The new approach in the FY2010 bills is more straightforward, with summaries comparing FY2009 to House-passed, Senate-passed, and enacted totals. Agriculture appropriations have increased steadily over the past decade, with total mandatory and discretionary funding growing at a 5% average annualized rate since FY2000. Domestic nutrition programs make up the largest portion of spending in the agriculture appropriations bill. Total budget authority is divided between mandatory and discretionary spending, with a focus on comparing funding types and purposes. Total nutrition program spending in the agriculture appropriations bill has been increasing steadily, with a 9% average annual growth rate since FY2000. This growth is driven by a rise in the share going to domestic nutrition programs, which now make up 68% of the total in FY2010. The increase in nutrition program spending outpaces the -1% average annual change in other USDA spending categories. However, factors like economic conditions and benefit formulas also influence the growth of nutrition programs, making it somewhat outside the control of appropriations committees. Total nutrition program spending in the agriculture appropriations bill has been steadily increasing, driven by domestic nutrition programs like SNAP and child nutrition. Mandatory spending on domestic nutrition programs has grown at a 9% average rate per year, while discretionary programs have increased at a 6% rate per year since FY2000. Since FY2000, spending on non-nutrition programs in the Agriculture appropriations bill has shown more variability, with mandatory spending experiencing a -3% average annual change primarily due to farm commodity programs. Over the 5-year and 15-year periods ending in FY2010, there was an average +1% growth per year, while a 20% 1-year growth indicates the component's dependency on external factors. Total non-nutrition \"other\" spending has been divided into mandatory and discretionary categories, with discretionary spending growing at a slower rate compared to domestic nutrition spending. The non-nutrition discretionary spending in Agriculture appropriations has grown at increasing rates over the past 15 years, with an average growth rate of 3% per year. Total Agriculture appropriations have experienced positive \"real\" growth above the rate of inflation, increasing at an average annual 2% real rate over the past 10 years. The Agriculture bill's share of the federal budget has declined from 4.4% in FY1995 to 3.5% in FY2010. Nutrition programs have seen a higher increase compared to non-nutrition programs. As a percentage of GDP, Agriculture appropriations have remained steady at about 0.75% over the past 10 years. Nutrition programs have been rising as a percentage of GDP since FY2000, while non-nutrition agricultural programs have been declining. On a per capita basis, inflation-adjusted total Agriculture appropriations have risen slightly over the past 10 to 15 years. Appropriators have placed limitations on mandatory spending authorized in the farm bill in recent years. Funding for mandatory programs is usually assumed and not part of the annual appropriations process. The 2008 farm bill increased mandatory funds for agriculture programs, leading to tension between appropriators and authorizers over funding. The creation of the Commodity Credit Corporation in the 1930s established a mandatory funding system to address unpredictable funding issues for farm commodity programs. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) was created in the 1930s to address unpredictable funding issues for farm commodity programs. In recent years, tension has arisen between appropriators and authorizers over funding, particularly with the use of mandatory funds for programs that were traditionally discretionary. This has raised questions about the justification for modern mandatory spending on programs that are not highly variable. Appropriator-placed limits on mandatory programs have affected conservation, rural development, bioenergy, and research programs, but not farm commodity or nutrition assistance programs. Appropriators use appropriations language to put limits on mandatory programs without changing the authorizing law. These provisions typically appear in Title VII of the Agriculture appropriations bill. For FY2010, the enacted appropriation includes $511 million in reductions. The FY2010 enacted appropriation bill includes $511 million in reductions from three mandatory programs, following the Senate's approach. This reduction is larger than the House bill due to the inclusion of a fruit and vegetable program. The Administration had proposed even greater reductions totaling $582 million from nine mandatory programs. These reductions are comparable to those in FY2009 but not as large as during the 2002 farm bill period. Appropriators had consistently limited various mandatory programs in the 2002 farm bill, leading to reductions or eliminations during budget reconciliation in FY2005. The 2008 farm bill introduced new mandatory programs, giving appropriators more opportunities to limit funding. Congress implemented earmark disclosure rules in 2007, requiring transparency in appropriations acts. Earmarks specified in conference reports may not carry the same legal weight as those in the law itself. In FY2008, earmarks in appropriations acts were treated differently - some were in the law text, some in report language, and others in report language without reference in the act. President Bush's Executive Order 13457 instructed agencies not to honor earmarks unless in the law text. Congress disclosed 462 earmarks for Agriculture in FY2010, down by 59 from FY2009. In FY2010, there were 462 earmarks for Agriculture and Related Agencies, totaling $355.4 million. This is a decrease of 59 earmarks from FY2009 (-11%) and 161 earmarks from FY2008 (-26%). The three main USDA agencies accounted for nearly 90% of these earmarks. The number and value of earmarks have been declining since FY2008. The median project size was $422,500. The Agriculture appropriations bill funds most of the USDA, except for the Forest Service. The USDA consists of about 30 internal agencies and offices with 100,000 employees, including 34,000 in the Forest Service. Four agencies focus on research, education, and economics: The Agricultural Research Service conducts research, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture distributes funds to colleges, and the Economic Research Service provides economic analysis. The Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) provide economic analysis and collect agricultural statistics. The 2008 farm bill led to changes in the REE mission area, establishing the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) and the Research, Education, and Extension Office (REEO) to coordinate activities. Future budget requests for the REE mission area will be consolidated into a single line item. The 2008 farm bill includes mandatory funds for various grant programs, such as the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) administered by NIFA. USDA funding for agriculture research has remained relatively flat from 1970 to 2000 when adjusted for inflation. Supplemental funds for anti-terrorism activities accounted for budget increases from FY2001 to FY2003, but funding levels have since decreased. ARS received supplemental funding for buildings and facilities in FY2009. In FY2009, ARS received supplemental funding for buildings and facilities. ARS and NIFA account for most of the research budget, with appropriations generally tracking each other. Efforts to increase competitive grants in the REE mission area have involved tapping into available funds from USDA's budget and other sources. However, the use of mandatory funds for this purpose has been restricted in the annual Agriculture appropriations act. Despite this, appropriations conferees have provided more discretionary funds for ongoing REE programs in certain years. The enacted FY2010 appropriation provides $1.25 billion for USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS), a 5% increase from FY2009 levels. Research priorities include childhood obesity prevention, bioenergy feedstocks, climate change, and world hunger reduction. The enacted FY2010 appropriation for USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) includes increases for research on human nutrition, animal disease, environmental stewardship, colony collapse disorder, Ug99-resistant wheat varieties, grain research, and U.S. seed collections. It does not support transferring the Office of Pest Management Policy. Funding for construction of the DHS facility at Kansas State University continues to be blocked by the Department of Homeland Security appropriations process. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) replaced CSREES in 2009 and will be the primary extramural funding agency for food and agricultural research at USDA. NIFA's mission is to advance research, extension, and higher education in food, agriculture, and related sciences. NIFA will administer grants for research and extension, receiving a $1.34 billion appropriation, a 10% increase from FY2009. Funding for all major activities, including research, education, and extension, has increased. The Administration's request for research and education activities was lower than FY2009 levels due to the removal of special and federally administered grants. The House and Senate bills allocated funds for earmarked grant programs, with a significant increase in funding for competitive grants, specifically the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI). The enacted appropriation mirrors the proposals for modest increases in research and education activities for formula fund programs. It includes $215 million for the Hatch Act formula fund program and $29 million for the McIntire-Stennis formula fund program. The farm bill authorizes $700 million annually for a new competitive grant program in agriculture. The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) received $262.5 million in funding, a 30% increase from the previous year. AFRI replaced two other grant programs and received more funding than the House proposal but less than the Senate proposal. Extension activities were allocated $494.9 million for FY2010. The enacted appropriation for extension activities in FY2010 is $494.9 million, an increase of $20.6 million (4%) from FY2009 levels. This includes $297.5 million for Smith-Lever formula funds and $101.3 million for competitive programs. Additionally, $82.5 million is allocated for USDA's Economic Research Service, a $3 million increase from FY2009. The enacted appropriation for the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) in FY2010 is $161.8 million, an increase of $10.3 million from FY2009. This amount is equal to the Administration's request and includes funds for the restoration of the Agricultural Chemical Use program and analysis of bio-energy production. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) under USDA is responsible for protecting U.S. agriculture from pests and diseases, facilitating agricultural trade, and administering the Animal Welfare Act. Key responsibilities include addressing avian influenza, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, invasive plant pests, and a national animal identification program. The enacted appropriation for APHIS in FY2010 is $909.7 million, including $905.0 million for salaries and expenses. This is more than the House-passed bill but less than the Senate-passed bill. Funding is also allocated for specific programs such as congressionally designated projects, a National Animal Identification System program, and controlling outbreaks of diseases. The enacted appropriation for APHIS in FY2010 is $909.7 million, including funding for specific programs such as pest and disease exclusion, plant and animal health monitoring, pest and disease management, animal care, scientific and technical services, and management initiatives. Matching state funds are required to be at least 40% for certain programs, with limitations on aircraft operations and building repairs. The FY2010 appropriation for APHIS is $909.7 million, with funding for pest and disease exclusion, health monitoring, animal care, scientific services, and management initiatives. Appropriators expect the Secretary of Agriculture to use funds for pest and disease eradication activities. The appropriation includes $5.3 million for a National Animal Identification System, $9.1 million less than FY2009. The FY2010 appropriation for APHIS is $909.7 million, with funding for pest and disease exclusion, health monitoring, animal care, scientific services, and management initiatives. The appropriation includes $5.3 million for a National Animal Identification System (NAIS), $9.1 million less than FY2009. The conference report expresses concern about the slow progress in registering animal premises for NAIS, stating that higher participation levels are needed for successful implementation. If significant progress is not made, funding for the program may be eliminated. The FY2010 appropriation for APHIS is $909.7 million, with funding for various programs including a National Animal Identification System (NAIS) at $14.5 million. The Administration proposed increasing NAIS funding to $14.6 million in FY2010, but the House-passed bill eliminated all funding and the Senate bill only provided half. An amendment reduced the Senate's funding to $7.3 million. The EPP account for pest and disease management is funded at $158.8 million for FY2010, compared to the Administration's request of $143.8 million and FY2009 level of $133.7 million. The enacted appropriation for the EPP account in FY2010 is $158.8 million, with allocations for various plant problems including citrus health, Asian long-horned beetle, glassy-winged sharpshooter, and others. Additionally, $16.8 million is designated for bovine tuberculosis, with $2.0 million for indemnity and depopulation. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is responsible for promoting U.S. agricultural products. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) promotes U.S. agricultural products through user fees and reimbursements, totaling about $140 million. AMS receives funding through appropriations mechanisms, with $91.1 million allocated for FY2010. Additionally, $6.7 million is provided for the National Organic Program, and $1.3 million is allocated for payments to states. The enacted appropriation for the National Organic Program is $6.7 million. Payments to states total $1.3 million under the Federal-State Marketing Improvement Program. The Section 32 program is funded by a permanent appropriation of 30% of the previous calendar year's customs receipts. The enacted appropriation for Section 32 activities is $1,300 million, primarily used for commodity purchases for school lunch and domestic programs, support farm prices, and provide disaster assistance. Rescissions of Section 32 carryover funds are used for budgetary savings, with a rescission of $52.5 million in unobligated balances from FY2009. The 2008 farm bill sets new annual caps on Section 32 funds for various activities, including purchasing surplus agricultural commodities. The cap for FY2010 is $1.199 billion, unchanged from the enacted appropriation. In contrast, the FY2009 cap was reduced from $1.173 billion to $1.072 billion, freeing up $101 million in Section 32 funds. Additionally, $199 million of Section 32 funds must be used in FY2010 to purchase fruits, vegetables, and nuts. In FY2010, $199 million of Section 32 funds were allocated to purchase fruits, vegetables, and nuts for domestic food assistance programs. The Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) received a funding increase to $42 million for salaries and expenses, with a focus on strengthening compliance and enforcement activities. The enacted FY2010 appropriation provides $42 million for the Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA), supported by user fees totaling approximately $42.5 million annually. The Administration proposed additional user fees to offset some agency activities, but this was not included in the conference report. The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) received new budget authority of $1.019 billion, a $48 million increase over the previous year. The final bill for FY2010 includes a $48 million increase in budget authority for the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). Existing user fees are expected to total around $150 million, with an additional $4 million proposed for new user fees. $3 million is designated for the Humane Animal Tracking System, and a minimum of 140 full-time staff positions are required for inspections under the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act. The final bill for FY2010 includes a $48 million increase in budget authority for the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). The House and Senate bills differed on the issue of permitting poultry products to be imported from China. The final measure prohibits the use of funds to implement a rule allowing poultry products processed in China to be imported into the United States, unless specified preconditions are met. The final bill for FY2010 includes a $48 million increase in budget authority for the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). The final measure prohibits the import of poultry products processed in China unless specific conditions are met, including audits of inspection systems and facilities, increased reinspections at U.S. ports, and information sharing with other importing countries. USDA must provide regular reports to Congress on these measures. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees require regular reports from USDA on auditing and reviewing the Chinese food safety system to ensure it meets US standards. The reports also include information on port of entry reinspections for Chinese poultry imports and any agreements between FSIS and the Chinese government. Food safety advocates support the ban on Chinese poultry imports due to concerns about inadequate food safety protections in China. The 2006 rule on Chinese poultry imports was rushed into approval without proper safety evaluation. Opponents argue that a ban would harm U.S. trade commitments and lead to retaliation by China. USDA's Farm Service Agency administers farm subsidy and loan programs, as well as conservation programs. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) administers farm subsidy, loan, and conservation programs in cooperation with other agencies. Administrative funds for FSA programs are consolidated into one account, with direct appropriations for salaries and expenses. Transfers from other USDA agencies support FSA activities like farm commodity programs and export credit guarantees. The FY2010 enacted appropriation for FSA salaries and expenses is $1.575 billion, a 6% increase from FY2009. The FY2010 enacted appropriation for FSA salaries and expenses is $1.575 billion, a 6% increase from FY2009. The increase is for information technology improvements and routine pay cost adjustments. The bills do not contain language prohibiting closure of FSA county offices. The enacted appropriation includes funding for FSA's computer infrastructure, with additional appropriations needed for modernization after FY2010. The FY2010 enacted appropriation for FSA includes funding for information technology improvements and routine pay cost adjustments. Reports are required on the progress of improvements to FSA's computer system, which has been plagued by malfunctions jeopardizing services to farmers. Additional appropriations will be needed for modernization after FY2010. The 2008 farm bill's new ACRE program and income limits are straining the outdated FSA computer system. Despite some funding for upgrades, computer problems persist. USDA's stabilization and modernization plan aims to improve the current system and transition to a new Web-based system called MIDAS. A GAO report in May 2008 highlights the need for modernization. The USDA Farm Service Agency is addressing technical issues with their outdated computer system through funding for stabilization and modernization. They provide direct farm loans and guarantee repayment for farmers. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) provides loans for farm real estate, operating expenses, and disaster recovery, some at subsidized interest rates. An annual appropriation covers the federal cost of direct and guaranteed loans, known as loan subsidy. The FY2010 appropriation exceeds loan authority and budget authority due to increased demand for farm loans after the global financial crisis. The FY2010 appropriation provides $141 million in budget authority to support $5.084 billion of loan authority, with an increase in loan authority of $1.66 billion compared to FY2009. This increase is mainly due to new conservation loan programs and Indian highly-fractured land loans. The FY2010 appropriation includes a significant increase in loan authority, with a focus on various farm loan programs to meet the rising demand caused by the global financial crisis. Increases include a 194% rise in direct farm ownership program funding, 21% for guaranteed farm ownership loans, 74% for direct farm operating loans, and 47% for guaranteed unsubsidized farm operating loans. Additionally, there is a 37% reduction in guaranteed interest assistance operating loans due to lower demand in the current low-interest rate environment. In FY2009, USDA increased loan authority for farm loans through supplemental appropriations and transfers, doubling direct loan programs and raising guaranteed unsubsidized operating loans by 20%. By September 2009, 93% of the loan authority was utilized. The Administration requested $5 million for the Individual Development Accounts program for beginning farmers, but no funding was provided. Additional financial assistance was given to the dairy sector due to low returns in 2009. The enacted appropriation provides $350 million to the dairy sector, with $290 million for income payments to farmers and $60 million for dairy product purchases for food banks. The Secretary of Agriculture is expected to make additional payments promptly. Funding allocation among producers is not specified. The Milk Income Loss Contract program limits payment quantity to 2.985 million pounds of annual production. The additional income payments will supplement over $700 million in direct payments made in fiscal 2009. The USDA provided additional dairy appropriation in 2009 through the MILC program, including a temporary increase in price support for cheese and nonfat dry milk. The Senate-passed bill included an amendment for an extra $350 million for dairy farmer financial assistance, which was controversial as emergency funding. The funding was adopted by voice vote after a procedural vote to waive budget rules. The House-passed bill did not have a similar provision, and the enacted appropriation did not have the emergency designation. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funds mandatory subsidy payments for farmers and is part of the annual discretionary allocation for the Agriculture bill. It can borrow up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury to finance programs like farm commodity subsidies. CCC also covers conservation, trade, and rural development programs. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funds mandatory subsidy payments for farmers, covering conservation, trade, and rural development programs. Emergency supplemental spending is also paid from the CCC for farm disaster payments, market loss payments, and disease eradication efforts. The CCC can borrow from the Treasury but must eventually repay the funds. Its borrowing authority is replenished through congressional appropriations to prevent depletion of its $30 billion debt limit. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) receives appropriations for mandatory subsidy payments to farmers, which fluctuate based on economic conditions. Funding needs are hard to estimate, leading to mandatory programs. Outlays in FY2010 are projected to be $10.8 billion, lower than FY2009 but higher than FY2008. CCC's borrowing authority is used to fund outlays initially, with reimbursement through separate appropriations. The FY2010 enacted appropriation for the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is estimated to be $13.9 billion, up from an average of $12.3 billion in FY2008-09 but down from $23 billion in FY2007. The federal crop insurance program is administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency (RMA) and offers free catastrophic insurance to producers with the option to purchase additional coverage at a subsidized rate. The federal crop insurance program, administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency (RMA), offers free catastrophic insurance to producers with the option to purchase additional coverage at a subsidized rate. The annual Agriculture appropriations bill provides funding for the program, including premium subsidies and indemnity payments. The enacted appropriation for the RMA is $80.3 million, with no directive for additional staff as proposed in the House-passed bill. The enacted appropriation for the Risk Management Agency (RMA) allows tapping mandatory money under the Federal Crop Insurance Act for improving the agency's information management system. $7.5 billion is provided for the Federal Crop Insurance Fund, with the estimated amount higher in FY2010 due to high crop prices. More than half of recent crop insurance policies sold have been revenue products. The enacted FY2010 appropriation provides increased funding for discretionary Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) programs, rejecting many of the Administration's proposed reductions. It provides $1.009 billion total for FY2010 discretionary conservation programs, with most of the increase in appropriations for Conservation Operations (CO). The enacted FY2010 appropriation provides $887.6 million for Conservation Operations (CO), with $50.7 million for the Resource Conservation and Development (RC&D) program funded separately. $37.4 million is designated for congressionally earmarked projects. The enacted FY2010 appropriation maintains funding for discretionary programs like Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations and Resource Conservation and Development. $30 million is allocated for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations, with $22.1 million directed to congressionally designated projects. The Watershed Rehabilitation Program funding is reduced to $40.2 million as proposed by the Administration. The FY2010 appropriation for mandatory conservation programs administered by NRCS and FSA, funded by the CCC, rejects most proposed reductions by the Administration. Funding for EQIP is limited to $1.18 billion, a reduction of $270 million from the authorized level in the 2008 farm bill. Funding for CRP remains unchanged. The FY2010 appropriation for USDA's conservation programs, including the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and the Watershed Rehabilitation Program, remained stable at around $1.9 billion. The three agencies responsible for USDA's rural development mission area are the Rural Housing Service (RHS), Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS), and Rural Utilities Service (RUS). The USDA's Rural Development mission area administers various programs such as the Empowerment Zones Initiative and Rural Economic Area Partnerships. Federal assistance for these programs mainly consists of loans and grants, with a budget authority of $2.98 billion for FY2010. Loan subsidy covers interest rate reductions and projected loan losses, with a loan authority of $24.4 billion. This represents a $246 million increase in budget authority from FY2009. The USDA's Rural Development mission area received increased budget authority and loan authority in FY2010 compared to FY2009.

The Section 502 program also received supplemental funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to support additional loans. The Section 521 rental assistance program is a significant portion of the RHS budget, exceeding the budget authority for the Section 502 loan program. In FY2010, rental assistance appropriation increased to $969 million, a 9% rise from FY2009. Funding for multifamily housing revitalization increased by 56%, rural housing assistance grants by 10%, and mutual and self-help housing grants by 8%. Farm labor housing grants and loan subsidies each saw an 8% increase over FY2009, with a 26% increase in associated loan authority. The rural community facilities account received $55 million in budget authority and supported $501 million in loans, a 14% decrease from FY2009 in budget authority but the same loan authority. The budget authority for direct community facility loans decreased due to a decrease in loan subsidy. However, loan authority for the program will remain the same because of low interest rates. Rural community facilities will receive $20 million in grants, $295 million in direct loans, and $206 million in guaranteed loans, the same as the regular FY2009 appropriation. Economic Impact Initiative grants will receive $13.9 million, a 39% increase over FY2009, to support essential community facilities in high-unemployment communities.

The Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) also saw a significant funding increase, with $39.3 million allocated for energy audits, loans, and grants. Additionally, Rural Cooperative Development Grants received triple the funding compared to FY2009, with a notable increase in Value-Added Product Grants. The FY2010 appropriations for the Rural Business Program Account increased, with support for cooperative development grants and grants to assist minority producers doubling. The Rural Microenterprise Investment Program received $5.0 million for creating equity capital in rural areas. The Biorefinery Assistance Program had proposed funding but was unlikely to begin awarding funds until summer 2010. The Biorefinery Assistance Program, which supports the development of advanced biofuels, receives no funding in the FY2010 appropriation. The Senate and Administration recommended $17.3 million, but there was no appropriation for the program in FY2009.

Puerto Rico's grant is expected to increase by $130 million, and American Samoa will receive an extra $500,000. The Department of Defense appropriations act appropriates unlimited funding for emergency requirements under the Food and Nutrition Act and $400 million for state administrative expenses related to SNAP. The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act cover various programs and activities, including School Lunch and Breakfast programs, CACFP, Summer Food Service program, Special Milk program, food safety education initiatives, and technical assistance for providers. Funding for these efforts comes from child nutrition appropriations, mandatory permanent appropriations, and other sources.

Extension of expiring legislative/funding authorities in child nutrition programs was scheduled for 2009. The Child Nutrition Act reauthorization was postponed until 2010, leading to extensions of expiring authorities through September 2010. The NSLA mandates a specific per-lunch commodity assistance value, set at 19.5 cents for the 2009-2010 school year. These entitlement commodities are provided to schools under this mandate. The law mandates that 12% of school lunch support be in federally provided commodities. If the value of entitlement commodities falls below 12%, the Department must fill the gap with additional commodities using appropriated funds or bonus commodities. Bonus commodities are surplus food items donated by USDA. The USDA's authority to use bonus commodities to meet the 12% threshold for school lunch support was set to expire in 2009, leading to a projected shortfall of $150 million for FY2010. However, the enacted FY2010 Agriculture appropriation extended this authority through FY2010 to address the fiscal impact. The FY2010 Agriculture appropriation extends authority to count bonus commodities towards the 12% threshold, creating a budget \"savings\" of $150 million. Schools can use various approaches to meet federal nutrition standards for meals, including nutrient standard menu planning. Regulations originally required \"weighted averaging\" based on student menu choices, but this has been waived since 1998. The NSLA has waived the requirement for weighted averaging since 1998, with the waiver extended through September 30, 2010. States are mandated to audit food safety inspections in schools and report to USDA, with audits of state reports also required.

Priority is given to recipients who have not previously received aid under the 2009 ARRA equipment assistance program. Section 749(k) of the FY2010 law provides $8 million for competitive grants to state agencies administering the Child and Adult Care Food Program to improve the health and nutrition status of children in child care settings. Section 733 of the final FY2010 Agriculture appropriation allows state WIC agencies to exceed regulatory maximums on the amount of reconstituted liquid concentrate infant formula given to WIC participants.

Additionally, food commodities for child nutrition programs are financed through permanent appropriations under Section 32. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable program, funded by the 2008 farm bill, provides fresh produce to elementary schools nationwide. However, delays in funding allocation have affected the availability of funds for the program in FY2009 and FY2010. The FY2009 and FY2010 Agriculture appropriations acts allocate annual spending for the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable program by fiscal year. The Food Service Management Institute receives $4 million annually, and the Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition program gets $21 million per year from mandatory funding.

The FDA received $2.357 billion in direct appropriation for FY2010, with an additional $922 million in user fees, totaling $3.279 billion. The increase in user fees is mainly due to support for a new Center for Tobacco Products. Both House and Senate recommend increased funding for food and medical product safety, including more inspections. Priority attention is suggested for products related to neuroblastoma, with a proposed standard of identity for honey to prevent misbranding. Other increases include research in biomarkers, data collection on foodborne illnesses, and research on screening tests for bloodborne diseases.
