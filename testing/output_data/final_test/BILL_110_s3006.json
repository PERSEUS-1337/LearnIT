The President is limited in the amount of discretionary budget authority that can be proposed for rescission. The President can propose rescinding up to 25 percent of the appropriated amount for a program, project, or activity in a fiscal year. This limitation only applies to authorized programs. Procedures for expedited consideration require the introduction of a draft bill or joint resolution within two days of receiving the special message.
