    "content": "The Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) funding for FY2010 is being considered by the 111th Congress, with a request of $96.8 million from the Obama Administration. The program was renewed for five years in 2008 and questions have been raised about its management and effectiveness. The Congress may need to review past concerns before making a decision. The House passed the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 2010 and 2011 (H.R. 2410) on June 10, 2009, authorizing the expansion of GPOI programs to train 75,000 international peacekeepers by 2010. The initiative was launched in 2004 with a $660 million budget to address the shortage of trained peacekeepers worldwide. State Department officials are confident in achieving the goal by early 2010. The Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) aims to train international peacekeepers in semi-stable environments. The program, launched in 2004 with a $660 million budget, has trained over 54,000 military troops and 3,350 police forces. State Department officials plan to shift focus to building foreign nations' peacekeeping capabilities. In 2009, GPOI funded the training of over 54,000 military troops and 3,350 police personnel for peacekeeping missions. As of January 30, 2009, 46,115 troops from 21 countries were deployed to 18 peacekeeping operations. GPOI also supported the training of police trainers at the Center of Excellence for Stability Police Units in Italy and provided funds for various peacekeeping institutions worldwide. GPOI has contributed $65.4 million for equipment and troop transport to seven missions, deploying 46,115 troops from 21 countries to 18 peacekeeping operations and 1 election observer mission as of January 30, 2009. Funding for GPOI totaled $374.46 million through FY2008 and $105.95 million for FY2009, with an additional $3.0 million from INCLE funding. The Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) has provided $106.2 million for peacekeeping operations, training 57,595 peacekeepers and trainers as of January 31, 2009. The United States previously supported peacekeeping capacity-building through programs like ACOTA and EIPC, which are now part of GPOI. ACOTA still focuses on Africa and is managed by the State Department's Africa Bureau. GPOI is overseen by the State Department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. The Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) was developed by the Department of Defense (DOD) in collaboration with the State Department to enhance peacekeeping efforts worldwide. The program aims to expand and improve peacekeeping training, increase participation in peacekeeping operations, and encourage more countries to contribute troops. Policymakers hope that by providing peacekeeping training, more countries will be willing to take on lead roles in peacekeeping missions. The GPOI budget is part of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Peacekeeping account, which funds activities under Section 551 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. President Bush emphasized the need for permanent crisis response capabilities in a 2004 U.N. General Assembly address. Bush emphasized the need for permanent crisis response capabilities in a 2004 U.N. General Assembly address, stating the world must create capabilities to respond to future crises. This led to the formulation of the ACRI training program in 1996 and the current search for new strategies to prevent conflicts. The Bush Administration set three major GPOI goals: training 75,000 troops worldwide in peacekeeping skills by 2010, supporting Italy in establishing a center to train international constabulary forces, and fostering an international deployment and logistics support system for peacekeepers. Through GPOI, the State Department promotes information exchange among G-8 countries. Through GPOI, the State Department facilitates information exchange among G-8 donors on peace operations training in Africa. Meetings serve as a coordination \"clearinghouse,\" with various countries hosting meetings from 2004 to 2009. Additionally, GPOI supports a Global Clearinghouse for peacekeeping capabilities worldwide, with meetings held in 2007 and 2008. Efforts to enhance peacekeeping skills in African military forces are crucial for managing conflicts in Africa. By the mid-1990s, developed nations were the main peacekeepers, but the focus shifted to Africa due to concerns about sustainability and commitment. By the end of 2004, African nations provided a significant portion of military personnel for U.N. peacekeeping operations, highlighting their increasing contribution to global peacekeeping efforts. By the end of 2004, African nations significantly increased their military contribution to U.N. peacekeeping operations, with five of the top ten African contributors receiving training under the ACRI/ACOTA program. African contributions to the U.N. international civilian police pool remained stable over the years. Additionally, African militaries participate in regional peacekeeping operations under ECOWAS and the African Union, with missions deployed to various countries including Liberia, Guinea Bissau, Sierra Leone, the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Sudan, Somalia, Burundi, and Sudan. The African Union deployed peacekeepers to Burundi in 2003 and Sudan in 2004, which later became U.N. operations. Efforts are being made to establish an African stand-by peacekeeping force by 2010. The United States aims to enhance the command structures of ECOWAS and the AU under GPOI. Specialized police units with military skills are needed for handling hostile situations, known as \"stability police\" or gendarme forces. The United States provided field and staff training to develop military capabilities for peacekeeping in African nations through programs like ACRI and ACOTA. Training was given to 16,000 troops from 10 African countries, along with non-lethal equipment such as communications packages, uniforms, and medical equipment. Private contractors, including retired military personnel and reservists, conducted most of the training under ACRI and GPOI, with U.S. military officers providing mentoring. Funding for ACRI totaled $83.6 million over six fiscal years, while ACOTA received $8 million in FY2003 and $15 million in FY2004. Additional support for training foreign militaries was provided through the EIPC program. The EIPC program, part of the GPOI initiative, provided support for classroom training of foreign militaries by designing country-specific peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance programs. Funding for EIPC totaled $31.5 million through FY2004, with a focus on Africa. In FY2005, most peacekeeper trainees were from Africa. In FY2005, the GPOI program trained 12,080 African troops from 13 partners, including pre-deployment training for five battalions from Senegal. Training in Africa is conducted under the ACOTA program implemented by the State Department's Africa Bureau. The 12 other ACOTA partners trained using FY2005 funds were Benin, Botswana, ECOWAS, Gabon, Ghana, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, and Zambia. GPOI's Africa ACOTA program has 24 partners, including countries like Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Ethiopia, and more. Assistance is also provided to the African Union and ECOWAS. Training has been provided for 55,263 peacekeepers, with a focus on deployment. Since FY2005, GPOI has trained over 12,000 peacekeepers from partner countries, with many deployed to UN or other peace operations. GPOI also supports peace operations training centers in Sub-Saharan Africa and initiated a program to extend training to regions outside of Africa in 2005. The GPOI program has expanded to 31 partner countries outside of Africa, with the largest number in Asia/South Asia and the Pacific Islands. The Latin American program began in Central America, where GPOI funds were used to train and equip soldiers and establish a peacekeeping training center in Guatemala. Central American countries were able to form a battalion of about 600 troops through this support. The GPOI program includes 11 Western Hemisphere partner countries: Belize, Bolivia, Chile, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. Some peacekeepers and trainers from these countries received GPOI training. GPOI supports eight peace operations training centers in the Western Hemisphere, with major peacekeeping exercises run by the U.S. Southern Command. The PKO of the Americas will be held in multiple phases in 2009, with events in March, May, June, or July. In Asia, countries like Bangladesh, Malaysia, Mongolia, and Thailand received train-and-equip assistance. GPOI funds were used to establish a communications network called the Peace Support Operations Collaboration Center (PSOCC) in Mongolia. There are 14 partner countries in good standing in the region, including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, and others. India chose not to join GPOI as a partner but has participated in training events. Fiji is a partner country but currently under sanctions. GPOI has trained over 3,287 peacekeepers and trainers from various countries in Asia and Europe using its funds. Training centers are supported in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Mongolia, and Thailand. In Europe, Albania, Bosnia-Hercegovina, and Ukraine were among the first countries to receive support. Currently, GPOI has six partner countries in greater Europe. GPOI has provided training and support to peacekeepers and peacekeeping trainers from various countries in Europe, including Albania, Bosnia, Ukraine, and others. Deployment equipment has been provided to SEEBRIG, a multinational brigade in South East Europe. Jordan is the only Middle Eastern partner country, with plans to add Morocco in the future. The Bush Administration launched the Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) in 2004 to increase multilateral efforts for peacekeeping capacity, focusing on Africa. The G8 Summit in 2002 adopted an Africa Action Plan, leading to the Joint Africa/G8 Plan in 2003 and the Action Plan on Africa peacekeeping in 2004. Jordan and Morocco are GPOI partner countries. At Sea Island, GA, G8 leaders adopted a third Africa peacekeeping action plan: Action Plan on Expanding Global Capability for Peace Support Operations. European and other countries provide assistance to African peacekeeping, with France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the European Union playing key roles in training programs and support for peacekeeping centers in Africa. Italy also supports international peacekeeping capacity building efforts through its Center of Excellence for Stability Police Units (CoESPU). Italy's Center of Excellence for Stability Police Units (CoESPU) was established in March 2005 to train peacekeeping personnel. The facility is mainly staffed by Italian carabinieri, with support from the United States. CoESPU aims to train 3,000 personnel in Vicenza and an additional 4,000 in their home countries by 2010. The United States is the primary foreign supporter of CoESPU, with plans to increase staffing with military personnel, civilians, or contractors. The United States has contributed $10 million for the operation and training programs of Italy's Center of Excellence for Stability Police Units (CoESPU) through FY2009, covering about one-third of the school's costs. Other countries like Canada, France, and Russia have also provided instructors for certain courses at CoESPU, which offers high-level training courses for staff officers in international organizations, international law, military arts, tactical doctrine, and peace support operations. The Center of Excellence for Stability Police Units (CoESPU) offers high-level training courses for staff officers in international organizations, covering topics such as international law, military arts, tactical doctrine, and peace support operations. Additionally, CoESPU provides a course for junior officers and senior non-commissioned officers, focusing on practical training in checkpoint procedures, VIP security, high-risk arrests, border control, riot control, election security, and police self-defense techniques. Graduates from various countries have participated in these courses. CoESPU offers high-level training courses for staff officers in international organizations, focusing on developing lessons-learned and doctrine writing capabilities for Stability Police Units. The United Nations is spearheading the development of SPU doctrine, with CoESPU supporting this initiative. Funding for GPOI totaled $374.46 million from FY2005 through FY2008. In FY2005, funding for GPOI was split between the Department of State and the DOD budgets. For FY2006 and FY2007, there were fluctuations in funding amounts, with some discontent expressed by House and Senate actions. The State Department's FY2007 GPOI obligations totaled $81 million. In FY2007, Congress fully funded the Bush Administration's budget request for $92.5 million in GPOI funding. For FY2009, the State Department allocated $105.95 million from PKO funds and an additional $3 million from INCLE funding. The Bush Administration's FY2009 budget request called for $106.2 million in PKO funds for GPOI. The Obama Administration has requested $96.8 million for the Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) in FY2010. The funds will focus on strengthening partner country capabilities to train their own peacekeeping units, developing indigenous peacekeeping trainer cadres, and supporting peacekeeping training centers. The United States will continue to provide lift and sustainment to peacekeeping troops worldwide and evaluate GPOI effectiveness. Funding for GPOI is requested under the State Department Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) account. The House passed legislation authorizing the Secretary of State to expand GPOI programs and activities under the State Department Peacekeeping Operations account. The United States has a vital interest in ensuring the success of U.N. peacekeeping operations due to threats to national security and economic interests, as well as the human suffering caused by conflicts. The House passed legislation authorizing the Secretary of State to expand GPOI programs and activities under the State Department Peacekeeping Operations account. This includes enhancing regional organizations' peacekeeping capacity, helping partner nations develop self-sufficiency in peacekeeping capabilities, and financing helicopter refurbishment for U.N. peacekeeping operations. The House Foreign Affairs Committee directs the Secretary of State to prioritize helicopter refurbishment for peacekeeping operations in Darfur, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Chad. The bill aims to address critical shortages in air assets by refurbishing at least three helicopters by the end of FY2011. Additional funding from other countries is sought to address the shortfall of over 50 helicopters hindering peacekeeping operations. The House Foreign Affairs Committee prioritizes helicopter refurbishment for peacekeeping operations in Darfur, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Chad. The bill authorizes necessary funds for refurbishment in FY2010 and FY2011, with an estimated cost of $195 million for three helicopters by the end of 2011. The State Department has taken steps to strengthen Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) in response to congressional concerns. The Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) involved producing a strategic plan, facilitating procedures for planning and implementation, and implementing an evaluation program. In 2008, Congress requested the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to investigate GPOI's performance and management issues, including concerns about training quality, deployment capabilities, and the use of contractors. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) doubted GPOI's ability to train 75,000 peacekeepers by 2010 based on available information. However, GPOI officials claim they will reach this goal by early 2010 and plan to extend activities beyond 2010 to develop long-term peacekeeping skills and infrastructure in Africa. The GAO recommended improving human rights vetting, program management, and training content for GPOI. They suggested developing a monitoring system for vetting activities and securing funding for a database to track vetting cases. Congress should monitor progress on these recommendations. The GAO recommended improvements for the GPOI program, including better accountability for nonlethal training equipment delivery to partner countries. The State Department is implementing new procedures to address this issue, with the ACOTA program also making changes to improve logistics processes. Additionally, the State Department is working on better accounting procedures for commercially acquired equipment. The State Department and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency have developed new procedures to account for training equipment provided through the Foreign Military Sales system. The GAO recommended that the Secretary of State develop a training program for GPOI in consultation with DOD to establish program-wide criteria for evaluating training quality and measuring trainee proficiency. Detica, a GPOI contractor, is collaborating with key stakeholders to develop essential tasks and training standards for peace operations. GAO recommended State Department work with DOD to help Italy staff key positions at CoESPU for better evaluation. GPOI may use funds to provide additional staff at CoESPU for evaluation, monitoring, and alumni database development. The GPOI is working with key stakeholders to develop tasks and training standards for peace operations. U.S. Embassy staff are assisting in administering a survey on CoESPU graduates' training activities and deployments. A report is expected by mid-2009 on monitoring progress."
