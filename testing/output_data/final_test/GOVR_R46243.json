    "content": "In the past, Congress has regularly extended temporary tax provisions known as \"tax extenders.\" There are 33 provisions set to expire at the end of 2020, including six related to individual income tax. These provisions were extended through 2020 in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (P.L. 116-94). The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (P.L. 116-94) extended several provisions including housing-related deductions for mortgage insurance premiums and canceled mortgage debt income, as well as the above-the-line deduction for qualified tuition expenses. Additionally, individual provisions that expired in 2019 and 2018 were also extended through 2020. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 extended various provisions, including housing-related deductions and above-the-line deduction for qualified tuition expenses. It also extended individual provisions that expired in 2019 and 2018, such as the health coverage tax credit and medical expense deduction AGI floor. Additionally, it reinstated and expanded a provision for exclusion from income of certain state and local tax rebates and reimbursement for volunteer firefighters and emergency medical responders. The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019 extended various tax provisions, including the exclusion for volunteer firefighters and emergency medical respondents. Congress has a history of extending expired provisions through tax extenders legislation. The estimated cost of extending temporary individual tax provisions from the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 is provided in Table 1. Provisions were extended for three years, with some retroactively. The health care tax credit was extended for one year, and the provision for volunteer firefighters and emergency medical responders is effective for 2020. Canceled mortgage debt income is included in a taxpayer's gross income when mortgage debt is forgiven. Canceled mortgage debt income, also known as forgiven mortgage debt, occurs during a short sale when a homeowner sells a house for less than the mortgage amount. The lender forgives the remaining debt, which is reported to the IRS using Form 1099-C. The forgiven debt is considered taxable income, as it represents an increase in purchasing power for the individual. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 temporarily excluded qualified canceled mortgage debt income associated with a primary residence from taxation, regardless of how the debt was reduced. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 allowed taxpayers to exclude canceled mortgage debt from gross income, even if they did not qualify for existing exceptions. The provision has been regularly extended and was most recently extended through December 31, 2020. Supporters argue that the extension minimizes hardship for distressed households and supports the housing market and economy, while opponents believe it may make debt forgiveness more attractive for homeowners. Extending the provision for debt forgiveness under the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 may make homeowners less responsible about debt obligations. Some view the exclusion as unfair, as benefits depend on negotiation, tax bracket, and homeownership post-cancellation. Homeowners traditionally deduct mortgage interest and property taxes, with the option to deduct qualifying mortgage insurance premiums since 2007. The mortgage insurance premium deduction was extended through December 31, 2020, in the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019. Taxpayers may be less likely to claim this deduction due to changes in the 2017 tax revision. The deduction of mortgage insurance premiums helps promote homeownership and the recovery of the housing market post-recession. Homeownership offers benefits like higher property values, lower crime, and greater financial security. However, it's unclear if this deduction affects the homeownership rate due to high transaction costs being the primary barrier to home purchases. The deduction for mortgage insurance premiums may allow buyers to borrow more, but it is unclear if it is still needed to assist in the housing market's recovery. Home prices have generally increased since the Great Recession, and housing inventory is slightly below historical levels, indicating a stronger market. The deduction for mortgage insurance premiums may lead to a misallocation of resources in the housing industry. The provision allows taxpayers to deduct up to $4,000 for qualified tuition and related expenses for postsecondary education. This deduction is not restricted to itemizers and covers tuition payments and enrollment fees. Room and board expenses are generally not eligible for this deduction. The deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses for postsecondary education is not restricted to itemizers and covers tuition payments and enrollment fees. The amount that can be claimed for the deduction is generally reduced by any tax-free assistance, and the maximum deduction depends on income level. Taxpayers can deduct up to $4,000 if their income is $65,000 or less ($130,000 or less if married filing jointly); or $2,000 if their income is between $65,000 and $80,000 ($130,000 and $160,000 if married filing jointly). The above-the-line deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses has income limits of $80,000 ($160,000 for married joint filers) and is not adjusted for inflation. It was enacted temporarily in 2001 and extended multiple times, most recently through December 31, 2020. Some propose consolidating education tax benefits into a single credit to simplify the process for taxpayers. Consolidating education tax benefits into a single credit simplifies the process for taxpayers. Taxpayers can choose the tuition and fees deduction or education tax credits for the same student. The permanent tax credits include the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) for undergraduate education and the Lifetime Learning Credit. The AOTC is limited to the first four years of postsecondary education, while the Lifetime Learning Credit is not restricted by years. These credits are more advantageous for most taxpayers compared to the deduction, except for higher-income individuals. The credits phase out at lower income levels than the deduction, making them more beneficial. The maximum amount of deductible expenses limits the tax benefit's impact on individuals attending schools with high tuitions and fees. The income limits are not adjusted for inflation, potentially reducing the availability of the deduction over time. The distribution of the deduction shows that it benefits taxpayers in the income range where the Lifetime Learning Credit phases out, but confusion about education benefits may lead to suboptimal choices. The health coverage tax credit (HCTC) reduces the cost of qualified health insurance for eligible individuals. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) reduces the cost of qualified health insurance for eligible individuals by providing a refundable tax credit for 72.5% of the premiums paid. Eligibility criteria include being an eligible TAA recipient or PBGC pension recipient, and not having access to certain other specified coverage. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) allows eligible taxpayers with qualified health insurance to claim the tax credit when filing tax returns or as advance payments on a monthly basis. The credit was originally authorized by the Trade Act of 2002 and has been extended and modified multiple times through legislation. The HCTC was extended through December 31, 2020, and is not available for months beginning on or after January 1, 2021. Individuals can deduct unreimbursed medical expenses above a specific income threshold if they itemize their deductions. The deduction floor was increased from 7.5% to 10% of adjusted gross income for taxpayers under 65 starting in 2013. Taxpayers 65 or older could still claim the deduction under the lower 7.5% floor for tax years 2013 through 2016. The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019 extends the 7.5% floor for all taxpayers through 2020, with the floor scheduled to increase to 10% of AGI for all taxpayers after 2020. Expenses eligible for the deduction include health insurance premiums and medical expenses for the taxpayer, spouse, and eligible dependents. The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019 extends the 7.5% floor for all taxpayers through 2020, with the floor scheduled to increase to 10% of AGI for all taxpayers after 2020. Eligible expenses for the medical expense deduction include health insurance premiums, medical expenses, prescription drugs, transportation, and lodging for medical care. Taxpayers of all ages may be less likely to claim the deduction due to other provisions in the 2017 tax revision. The 2017 tax revision reduced the number of itemizers, with provisions like a higher standard deduction and a cap on state and local tax deductions. The AGI floor for medical expenses deduction limits high-income individuals from claiming it. Medical expenses alone may not be enough to justify itemizing unless combined with other deductions. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 provided benefits for emergency response organization members. The provision for income benefits for members of qualified voluntary emergency response organizations was reinstated in 2020 under the SECURE Act, allowing for forgiveness or rebate of state and local taxes up to $50 a month. This provision, originally enacted in 2007, had expired in 2010 but was reinstated with an increased amount. The provision for income benefits for members of qualified voluntary emergency response organizations was reinstated in 2020 under the SECURE Act, allowing forgiveness or rebate of state and local taxes up to $50 a month. The reinstated provision is expected to have a wider scope due to the reduction in the number of itemizers as a result of the 2017 tax act."
