This credit allows for a 10 percent credit on qualified wages paid to qualified conversion employees.

Employees' means an employee of a qualified employer who had been employed in a defense-related business and is now employed in a nondefense-related business during the taxable year. If a qualified conversion employee works in both types of businesses, only wages from the nondefense-related business are considered. The defense conversion investment credit is available to qualified employers engaged in a qualified business, with the credit being a percentage of the qualified conversion investment made during the taxable year. The applicable percentage is 7 percent for all taxable years. The applicable percentage for the defense conversion investment credit is 7 percent for taxable years ending after December 31, 1992, and before December 31, 1994, and 5 percent for years ending after December 31, 1994, and before December 31, 1999.

If a qualified business increases its number of employees by 4 percent or more over the average of the previous 3 years, it can claim an incremental employment incentive. However, if the average employment in any of the following 3 years falls below this qualifying increase level, the business will have to recapture the benefit. The qualified business must increase its tax liability for the year if there is a disqualifying decrease in the credit claimed. The term 'qualified conversion investment' refers to costs incurred for acquiring assets by the business. The term 'intangible assets' includes intangible property defined in section 936(h)(3)(B), excluding direct production costs of property held for sale. The term 'qualified business' refers to a corporation, partnership, or sole proprietorship existing before January 1, 1993, that had a significant portion of its gross receipts or costs from defense-related businesses in the 5 years prior to that date. The tax code defines a 'defense-related business' as an activity related to developing or producing property for military purposes, while a 'nondefense-related business' involves property not intended for military use. The tax code allows for accelerated depreciation of excess defense conversion property, which is property that has been modified or equipped for military purposes and uses assets and employees previously employed in a defense-related business. The tax code allows for accelerated depreciation of qualifying excess defense conversion property, which includes property owned or leased by the taxpayer and previously used for defense purposes. The tax code allows for accelerated depreciation of excess defense conversion property owned or leased by the taxpayer, which is not being used in a defense-related business. Deductions claimed for such property that is later found not to qualify will be recaptured at 150 percent of the claimed deductions. The amendments made by this section regarding excess defense conversion property deductions will take effect on July 31, 1993."
