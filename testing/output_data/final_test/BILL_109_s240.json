    "content": "The \"Small Business Military Reservist Tax Credit Act\" allows for a credit for income differential for the employment of activated military reservists and replacement personnel under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Small Business Military Reservist Tax Credit Act provides a tax credit for small business employers and self-employed individuals who employ qualified employees and replacement employees. The credit is equal to 50% of the qualified employee's average daily qualified compensation. The Small Business Military Reservist Tax Credit Act provides a tax credit equal to 50% of the average daily qualified compensation of qualified employees, excluding military pay and allowances, or $30,000. The employment credit for qualified employees is the sum of individual credits. Average daily qualified compensation is calculated by dividing the qualified compensation by 365 days minus the days the employee participates. The term 'average daily military pay and allowances' is the amount paid to a qualified employee during the taxable year for participating in qualified reserve component duty, divided by the total number of days the employee participates. Qualified compensation for a qualified employee participating in reserve component duty includes contingent compensation deductible under section 162(a)(1) if the employee were present to receive it. Qualified compensation for a qualified employee participating in reserve component duty includes contingent compensation deductible under section 162(a)(1) if the employee were present to receive it, which includes compensation not characterized as vacation, holiday, sick leave, or nonspecific leave, and group health plan costs. The term 'qualified employee' refers to an individual who has been employed by the taxpayer for 91 days before participating in reserve component duty and is a member of the Ready Reserve of a reserve component of the US Armed Forces. The employment credit for a qualified replacement employee is 50% of the lesser of certain amounts. The employment credit for a qualified replacement employee is 50% of the lesser of the individual's qualified compensation or $12,000. Qualified compensation refers to contingent compensation for work presence. The employment credit for a qualified replacement employee is 50% of the individual's qualified compensation or $12,000. Qualified compensation includes contingent compensation for work presence, deductible from the taxpayer's gross income under section 162(a)(1). A qualified replacement employee is hired to replace a qualified employee or self-employed taxpayer. The self-employment credit is 50% of the self-employed taxpayer's average daily income minus military pay while on qualified reserve duty. The self-employment credit is calculated based on the taxpayer's average daily self-employment income during qualified reserve duty, excluding military pay. The credit amount is either the taxpayer's actual self-employment income during duty days or $30,000, whichever is lower. The taxpayer's self-employment credit is determined by their average daily self-employment income during qualified reserve duty, excluding military pay. The credit is calculated based on the amount paid for insurance as medical care divided by the difference between 365 and the number of days the taxpayer participates in reserve duty. The term 'average daily military pay and allowances' refers to the amount paid to the taxpayer for military duty divided by the number of duty days. The term 'qualified self-employed taxpayer' refers to a taxpayer with net earnings from self-employment who is a member of the Ready Reserve of a reserve component of the US Armed Forces. This credit is in addition to any deduction for compensation paid to qualified employees or replacement employees.

The credit is subject to limitations and coordination with other credits. The disallowance of the tax credit for failure to comply with employment or reemployment rights of reserve components of the armed forces includes no credit for a taxpayer under certain conditions for up to three taxable years.
