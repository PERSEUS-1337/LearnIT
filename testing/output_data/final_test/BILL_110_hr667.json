    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Early Pest Detection and Surveillance Improvement Act\" and provides support for commodity inspection efforts to prevent the introduction or spread of pests. The \"Early Pest Detection and Surveillance Improvement Act\" defines key terms such as department of agriculture, early pest detection and surveillance, pest, and Secretary of Agriculture. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. The term \"State\" includes several states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Palau, and the US Virgin Islands. The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to enter into cooperative agreements with departments of agriculture for early pest detection surveillance activities. The Department of Agriculture conducts pest detection surveillance activities as per guidelines set by the Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey. States can inspect and surveil plant shipments within and between states. To enter a cooperative agreement, a state agriculture department must submit an application to the Secretary, who will outline requirements for fund usage auditing and criteria for pest detection activities. The cooperative agreement for pest detection and surveillance activities is based on knowledge, experience, and capabilities. It includes identifying pathways of pest introductions and determining support levels for early detection activities. The Secretary consults with relevant organizations, and each state department of agriculture receives a base funding of $250,000 annually under the agreement. The Secretary distributes $250,000 annually to each state department of agriculture for pest detection and surveillance activities. If funds are insufficient, amounts are adjusted to ensure equal distribution. Additional funds are allocated to high-risk sentinel States based on factors like international entry points and geographic location conducive to agricultural pests. The State's location is conducive to agricultural pest and disease establishment, leading to an emergency declaration under the Plant Protection Act. Funds are allocated for pest detection and surveillance activities to prevent pest introduction or facilitate eradication. The Department of Agriculture of a State is prohibited from using funds for subagreements with political subdivisions related to pest and disease surveillance. Funds provided are for implementation purposes with limited administrative costs. They are meant to supplement existing funds for early pest detection and surveillance, not replace them. Reporting is required within 180 days. The Department of Agriculture must report on early pest detection activities within 180 days. Receiving funds under this section will not affect PILT payments. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2008 through 2012, with a limit on administrative costs."
