    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Securing Communications of Utilities from Terrorist Threats\" or the \"SCOUTS Act\". The policy is outlined in Section 2. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with sector-specific agencies, may work with critical infrastructure owners and operators to enhance cybersecurity, manage risk, and strengthen the security and resilience of critical infrastructure against terrorist attacks. The objectives include reducing vulnerabilities, minimizing consequences, identifying terrorism threats, and expediting response and recovery efforts. Investigation is conducted to determine the best ways to engage owners and operators. The Secretary, with sector-specific agencies, investigates engaging them in a cybersecurity information sharing program. Voluntary opportunities are provided for agencies and infrastructure owners to share cybersecurity challenges and needs with the Department of Homeland Security. The Comptroller General will report to Congress on critical infrastructure owners' views on voluntary cybersecurity incident reporting. The Secretary will establish terrorism prevention policy to work with international partners to enhance security of domestic and foreign critical infrastructure. SEC. 3. STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES. The Secretary will facilitate efficient information exchange for Federal agencies during terrorist incidents by identifying data requirements, system interoperability, and alternate capabilities. The Secretary of Homeland Security will implement an integration and analysis function for critical infrastructure protection from terrorism events. Homeland Security will establish an integration and analysis function for critical infrastructure to analyze terrorism incidents, threats, and emerging risks. This function will involve data sharing capabilities with Fusion Centers to determine their role in reporting cybersecurity threats and incidents related to critical infrastructure. Fusion Centers will also work with the National Protection and Programs Directorate and the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center to report possible cybersecurity incidents. Establish an emerging threat hotline and secure online sector-specific cybersecurity incident reporting portal for Fusion Centers to report availability of critical infrastructure, categorize and prioritize cybersecurity intake risk information, and maintain a Federal agency directory of designated offices or individuals. Establish a voluntary incident access portal for critical infrastructure owners and operators to report cybersecurity incidents and gather feedback on the information received for potential improvements. The government should report to Congress every 2 years on critical infrastructure owners' participation in cybersecurity programs. They should also implement a system to assess vulnerability and consequence information to evaluate cybersecurity impacts on critical assets and manage risks. The government should assess staffing needs for cybersecurity critical infrastructure protection with Fusion Centers, determine agency staffing requirements, research terrorist incident correlations with infrastructure damage, anticipate impacts of cyber telecommunications failures, and recommend security measures. The government should recommend security and resilience measures for critical infrastructure before, during, and after a terrorism event. They should also evaluate interdependencies and impacts of electric grid failures, support post-terrorism incident management, and prevent collapse of telecommunication capability in affected areas. Additionally, they should assist the Department of Homeland Security in maintaining a real-time situational awareness capability for critical infrastructure. The government should provide actionable information on imminent terrorist threats, trends, and incidents affecting critical infrastructure. The curr_chunk is a section titled \"SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\" \"Definitions under this Act include critical infrastructure, resilience, and sector-specific agency, crucial for national security and preparedness.\" The term \"agency\" refers to a Federal department or agency designated as a Sector-Specific Agency by Presidential Policy Directive 21 for Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience. \"Security\" involves reducing the risk to critical infrastructure through physical or cyber defense measures against intrusions, attacks, or the effects of terrorist actions."
