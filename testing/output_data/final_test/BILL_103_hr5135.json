    "content": "The Employee Benefit Plan Security and Protection Act of 1994 may be cited as the Act. It clarifies the scope of fiduciary duties under ERISA. The Employee Benefit Plan Security and Protection Act of 1994 clarifies fiduciary duties under ERISA, including the requirement for fiduciaries to choose between alternative investments based on economic advantage for plan participants. The fiduciary duties under ERISA require investment decisions for plan assets to be made based on the economic interest of participants and beneficiaries. Fiduciaries should not consider external benefits when making investment decisions, but they are not in violation if such benefits are incidental. External benefits refer to advantages that benefit individuals other than plan participants or beneficiaries. The ERISA prohibits the establishment of investment lists or guarantees by the government to meet plan requirements. Additionally, funds authorized for this purpose cannot be used for such activities. The ERISA prohibits government agencies or entities from subsidizing specific investments to meet plan requirements. It also states that unrelated matters cannot be considered when determining a fiduciary's duties with respect to a plan. SEC. 3.
