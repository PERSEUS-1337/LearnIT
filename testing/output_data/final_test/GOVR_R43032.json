    "content": "President Obama made recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board in 2012, leading to a Supreme Court case in 2014. The case examined the President's authority under the Recess Appointments Clause for these appointments. The report discusses the Court's decision in Noel Canning and its implications for the NLRB. The U.S. Constitution outlines the roles of the President and the Senate in appointing government officials. The Constitution outlines specific roles for the President and the Senate in appointing government officials. The Appointments Clause establishes the main method of appointment, requiring the President to nominate and the Senate to confirm certain officials. The Constitution also allows for recess appointments during Senate breaks. The Recess Appointments Clause allows the President to temporarily fill vacancies during Senate recesses, ensuring government operation when the Senate is not in session. This power has been used for both administrative continuity and political reasons, leading to controversy. The President's use of recess appointment power has sparked political and legal controversy due to evolving interpretations. Key questions include the definition of \"the Recess\" and when vacancies must occur for the President to make appointments. Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Noel Canning, only a few courts analyzed the Recess Appointments Clause. The prevailing view is that the President can make recess appointments during Senate recesses to any vacancy, regardless of when it occurred. President Obama made recess appointments to the NLRB in 2011 to prevent membership from dropping below the required quorum. The appointments of Flynn, Block, and Griffin Jr. highlighted tensions in the appointments process. The Senate did not act on NLRB nominations, leading to a recess appointment by President Obama on January 4, 2012, during pro forma sessions. The NLRB issued a decision against Noel Canning Corporation for violating the NLRA by not reducing a collective bargaining agreement to writing. The D.C. Circuit ruled that three NLRB members were invalidly appointed, leading to the decision being challenged. The appointments were deemed constitutionally invalid, as recess appointments can only be made during an inter-session recess. The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the D.C. Circuit, ruling that three recess appointments to the NLRB were constitutionally invalid due to the Senate being in an intra-session recess of only three days. The Supreme Court affirmed the D.C. Circuit's ruling that recess appointments to the NLRB were invalid due to the Senate being in a short intra-session recess. This decision called into question the validity of the Board's actions during a 19-month period. The Supreme Court's decision on recess appointments to the NLRB has raised concerns about the validity of the Board's actions over a 19-month period. The NLRB has taken steps to address this, including setting aside orders in pending cases and ratifying past administrative decisions. The approach to handling remaining decisions is likely to mirror actions taken in a similar situation in 2010. The Supreme Court's decision in New Process Steel, L.P. v. National Labor Relations Board invalidated decisions made during a 27-month period when the Board operated with only two members instead of the required three. Following the Supreme Court's ruling in New Process Steel, the NLRB planned to reconsider 96 cases pending before federal courts. A three-member panel, including the original decision-makers, reviewed and issued new decisions on these cases by March 2013. Most remaining two-member cases were closed by the Board's processes. The NLRB closed nearly all remaining two-member cases without review. Employers may have chosen not to challenge decisions due to the panel composition. The Board is handling cases decided between January 4, 2012, and August 5, 2013, similarly to post-New Process Steel cases. The NLRB set aside orders in 43 cases and filed motions with federal courts of appeals for further action. The NLRB is reconsidering cases held in abeyance after Noel Canning. A three-member panel reviews each case, adopting the judge's recommended order in each instance. The Board is acting on cases pending on appeal. The NLRB is reconsidering cases pending on appeal and has ratified past administrative, personnel, and procurement actions to validate actions taken between January 4, 2012, and August 5, 2013. The doctrine of ratification allows the Board to approve prior actions to remove any doubts about their validity. The NLRB ratified past actions to validate actions taken between January 4, 2012, and August 5, 2013, following a reconsideration of cases pending on appeal. This ratification aims to remove doubts about the validity of previous administrative, personnel, and procurement actions. The NLRB's 2010 ratification has not been challenged, suggesting that recent ratifications may also be uncontroversial. The Noel Canning decision required the NLRB to revisit actions from January 2012 to August 2013, allowing reconsideration of decisions involving improperly appointed members. In a case before the Supreme Court's 2014 decision, the Third Circuit vacated a Board order due to an improper appointment. The Third Circuit found that NLRB member Craig Becker's appointment during an intra-session recess was invalid, leading to a panel with only two members, which lacked jurisdiction according to the NLRA and New Process Steel. This decision aligns with the D.C. Circuit's ruling in Noel Canning regarding the Recess Appointments Clause. The Third Circuit found that the NLRB panel lacked jurisdiction due to an invalid appointment, similar to the Noel Canning decision. The NLRB sought a rehearing of New Vista, which was granted on August 11, 2014."
