    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"DNA Identification Act of 1993\" and pertains to DNA identification. The DNA Identification Act of 1993 aims to enhance DNA analysis capabilities for law enforcement identification purposes through funding programs. This includes developing or improving forensic laboratories for DNA analysis. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended to require certification for grants used to develop or improve DNA analysis capabilities in forensic laboratories. The certification includes meeting current quality assurance standards for DNA analysis and restricting access to DNA samples for law enforcement purposes only. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended to require certification for grants used to develop or improve DNA analysis capabilities in forensic laboratories. The certification includes restricting access to DNA samples for law enforcement purposes only and ensuring regular proficiency testing for laboratories and analysts performing DNA analyses. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended to require certification for grants used to develop or improve DNA analysis capabilities in forensic laboratories. This includes ensuring regular proficiency testing for laboratories and analysts performing DNA analyses, with authorization of appropriations for grants to the States for DNA analysis. The Director of the FBI appoints an advisory board on DNA quality assurance methods. The advisory board appointed by the Director of the FBI includes scientists from forensic laboratories, geneticists, and a representative from NIST. They develop and revise standards for quality assurance in DNA analysis. The FBI Director issues standards based on their recommendations. The standards for quality assurance in DNA analysis specify criteria for proficiency tests and grading performance of forensic laboratories. The guidelines from the technical working group on DNA analysis methods are considered the Director's standards until recommendations are made by the advisory board. The advisory board appointed for administrative purposes shall be considered an advisory board to the Director of the FBI. The board will cease to exist 5 years after initial appointments unless extended by the Director. The FBI Director may establish an index for exchanging DNA identification information. The FBI Director may establish an index for DNA identification records of convicted persons, DNA samples from crime scenes, and unidentified human remains. The index will include information based on publicly available standards for DNA analysis. DNA samples and analyses must be prepared by labs and analysts undergoing regular proficiency testing. These records are maintained by criminal justice agencies with strict rules for disclosure only to law enforcement or defendants for defense purposes. The exchange of records for identification research and protocol development purposes is subject to cancellation if quality control and privacy requirements are not met. Personnel at the Federal Bureau of Investigation performing DNA analyses must undergo regular external proficiency testing. The Director of the FBI must arrange for periodic blind external tests to determine the proficiency of DNA analysis at their laboratory. This includes submitting reports to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees for 5 years after the enactment of the Act. The FBI must conduct periodic blind external tests to assess DNA analysis proficiency at their lab and report the results to Congress annually. Privacy standards restrict the disclosure of DNA test results for law enforcement purposes, allowing disclosure only to criminal justice agencies or for criminal defense purposes with access to samples and analyses. Test results can be disclosed for population statistics if personally identifiable information is removed. Results may be disclosed for a population statistics database, identification research, and protocol development, or quality control purposes. Criminal penalties include fines up to $100,000 for unauthorized disclosure or obtaining of DNA information from a Federal law enforcement agency database. Federal law enforcement agencies face fines up to $100,000 for unauthorized database creation or maintenance. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is authorized $2,000,000 annually for specific tasks from 1994 to 1998."
