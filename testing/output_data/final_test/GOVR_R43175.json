    "content": "The psychological health of active duty servicemembers, particularly the links between deployments and mental health concerns like PTSD, is a significant concern for Congress. Research shows that mental health issues are not unique to the military, with a high percentage of Americans experiencing diagnosable mental disorders. The Department of Defense and individual military services have various mental health programs in place to address these issues. The Defense Suicide Prevention Office was established in 2012 to provide suicide prevention services for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. This report discusses the prevalence of psychological health concerns in the Armed Forces, mental health screening and treatments, DOD responses, recommendations from key reports, congressional actions, and current issues. It also delves into specific mental health issues such as PTSD, alcohol and drug use disorders, depressive disorders, traumatic brain injury, and suicide. Note that this report does not cover veteran mental health issues. Mental health disorders have significant impacts on servicemember health care utilization, disability, and attrition from service. In 2011, mental disorders accounted for more hospitalizations of servicemembers than any other illness and more outpatient care than all illnesses except musculoskeletal injuries and routine medical care. Between 2001 and 2011, the rate of mental health diagnoses among active duty servicemembers increased approximately 65%. A total of 936,283 servicemembers have been diagnosed with at least one mental disorder over this time period. Between 2000 and 2011, nearly 49% of servicemembers were diagnosed with multiple mental disorders. The most common diagnoses were adjustment disorders, depression, anxiety disorders (excluding PTSD), alcohol abuse/dependence, and substance abuse/dependence. PTSD diagnoses increased by approximately 650% during this time period. Between 2000 and 2011, there was a significant increase in PTSD diagnoses among servicemembers, with the Army and Marine Corps having the highest rates of PTSD, major depression, alcohol dependence, and substance dependence. Hospitalizations for mental health disorders also increased, driven by PTSD, depression, and substance abuse. The Army was the most affected by hospitalizations for mental disorders, followed by the Marine Corps. TBI was considered a signature injury of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2001, approximately 255,852 TBIs have been reported among servicemembers, with common causes including vehicle crashes, falls, sports, and military training. Incidences of mild TBI rose sharply between 2005 and 2007, and diagnoses in deployed settings nearly doubled between 2010 and 2011. Suicide has been the second-leading cause of death for active duty servicemembers since 2010. In 2010, suicide became the second-leading cause of death for active duty servicemembers, following war injuries. Researchers suggest that servicemember suicides are often impulsive acts triggered by stressors like relationship, financial, or legal problems. The number of suicides among active duty forces increased from 200 in 1998 to 349 in 2012. The incidence rate of deaths by suicide for active duty servicemembers was around 14 per 100,000 person years between 1998 and 2011, with a significant rise in the Army and Marine Corps. Army and Marine personnel saw a nearly doubled incidence of suicide between 2005 and 2009, while it remained stable for Navy and Air Force personnel. In 2011, the suicide rate for Army personnel was approximately 23 per 100,000. The suicide rates for Army, Navy, and Marine Corps personnel in 2011 were approximately 23, 15, and 13 per 100,000, respectively. Despite an overall increase in suicide rates in the Armed Forces from 1998 to 2011, active duty servicemembers still have lower rates compared to civilians. Factors contributing to lower suicide rates include full-time employment, a sense of belonging, and universal access to healthcare. Military screening processes disqualify individuals with certain behavioral and psychological conditions. Since 2009, the military has used the Supplemental Health Screening Questionnaire to assess recruits for past psychiatric, psychological, or behavioral issues and substance abuse. Any condition that does not meet the Accession Medical Standard is considered disqualifying for military service. The Department of Defense Instruction 6130.03 outlines disqualifying medical standards for military service, which can be waived on a case by case basis. In fiscal year 2009, 11,845 accessions received medical waivers, including 1,178 for mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, personality disorder, and PTSD. Physical examination during accession evaluation may lead to further assessment for psychological issues based on findings like self-harm or inappropriate tattoos. The Department of Defense allows waivers for disqualifying medical standards for military service on a case by case basis. In fiscal year 2009, 11,845 accessions received medical waivers, including 1,178 for mental health conditions. Servicemembers undergo annual physical examinations to identify health changes that could affect their ability to perform. Psychological evaluations are conducted if there is reasonable suspicion of psychological or behavioral health issues that may impact service compatibility. Ongoing studies are assessing the impact of prior psychological issues on successful military service, with additional screening tools being piloted. Servicemembers deployed in connection with a contingency operation must undergo face-to-face mental health assessments at four separate times to assess their ability to perform military duties. Certain conditions, such as psychotic and bipolar disorders, may limit deployability. Servicemembers on active duty are covered by DOD's TRICARE Prime health insurance program, which provides free healthcare without copayments, deductibles, or premiums. They receive most healthcare in military treatment facilities but may be referred to private providers for specialty care. Prior authorization is required for nonemergency inpatient behavioral health care services. TRICARE covers psychiatric emergencies without prior authorization but requires authorization for continued stay. Telemental Health program offers secure audio-visual conferencing for mental health care. TRICARE excludes services not deemed safe and effective by reliable evidence and treatments not medically proven. Unauthorized providers and non-covered conditions are also excluded from coverage. Authorized mental health care providers under TRICARE include psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and psychiatric nurse practitioners. The DOD Supplemental Health Care Program can cover certain services not typically included in TRICARE, such as cognitive therapy for TBI patients. Active duty servicemembers may receive treatment from military, federal civilian, or contractor mental health providers, and may also be referred to private providers in some cases. The Defense Health Program has increased personnel to address concerns about servicemembers' access to mental health care. Legislation mandated an increase in military and civilian mental health personnel, with officer end strength growing and a budget increase for embedded behavioral health teams in the Army. The Defense Health Program has increased personnel to provide behavioral health care to servicemembers in close proximity to their unit areas. Treatment decisions are made following clinical practice guidelines developed jointly by DOD and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA/DOD Evidence-Based Practice Guideline Work Group advises on the use of clinical evidence to improve health across the VHA and Military Health System. The Evidence-Based Practice Guideline Work Group (EBPWG) advises on clinical evidence to improve health in the VHA and Military Health System. It was chartered in 2004 and continues to refine guidelines and develop new ones. Concerns exist about servicemembers underreporting mental health conditions due to stigma, leading DOD to issue instructions to promote a culture of support for seeking mental health care and substance abuse education. The Department of Defense promotes a culture of support for seeking mental health care and substance abuse education services. Healthcare providers are not to notify a Service member's commander when they seek mental health care. Efforts to reduce stigma have led to greater rates of mental health diagnoses. Between FY2007 and FY2012, the costs of providing mental disorder treatments to military personnel nearly doubled, increasing from about $468 million to about $994 million. Over 30% of individuals screening positive for mental disorders report fear of harm to their career as a barrier to seeking mental health services. Many servicemembers seek treatment through the military health care system. In FY2012, the military medical system spent nearly $1 billion on mental disorder treatment costs for active duty and activated Guard and Reserve members. Over half of these costs, about $567 million, were for outpatient active duty mental health treatments. Approximately 63% of mental disorder treatment costs were for outpatient treatment, 31% for in-patient treatment, and 7% for pharmacy costs. Active duty servicemembers accounted for 89% of military health care spending on mental disorder treatment between FY2007 and FY2012, totaling approximately $4 billion. In FY2012, the military health system spent $461 million on mental health care for activated Guard and Reserve members. Deactivated Guard and Reserve members may be eligible for TRICARE Reserve Select or Continued Health Care Benefit Program. Programs are in place to promote psychological resilience among servicemembers. The military has programs in place to promote psychological resilience among servicemembers, but a RAND study found little evidence that these programs effectively build resilience. The Department of Defense has established a Defense Suicide Prevention Office to coordinate suicide prevention efforts, including a Suicide Prevention and Risk Reduction Committee, the Real Warriors Campaign, the Department of Defense Suicide Event Report, and annual suicide-prevention conferences. The Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury (DCOE) was established in 2007 to focus on prevention, outreach, and care for servicemembers with psychological health conditions, including TBI. The DCOE serves as the principal integrator and authority on psychological health and traumatic brain injury knowledge and standards for the Department of Defense. The Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury (DCOE) oversees three centers: the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, the Deployment Health Clinical Center, and the National Center for Telehealth and Technology. Responsibility for DCOE is transitioning to the Army's Medical Research and Materiel Command. A key project in 2013 is assessing the impact of mental health programs in the military. Various reports, including one from the Institute of Medicine, have provided recommendations for legislation and oversight. The IOM report provided seven recommendations for further research and service in areas such as history, diagnostic criteria, and neurobiology of PTSD. It highlighted a higher prevalence of PTSD among servicemembers compared to the general population. The DOD and VA have been actively involved in PTSD prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment, but further evaluation is needed. DOD supports various PTSD prevention programs to enhance servicemembers' resiliency. PTSD prevention programs focus on building resiliency and preparing servicemembers for potential traumatic events in combat zones. Screening measures are crucial for identifying those in need of treatment, with recommendations for comprehensive assessments and diagnosis. The VA/DOD guidelines offer specific suggestions for treating PTSD symptoms, with ongoing development of additional treatment methods. Co-occurring psychiatric and medical conditions are common among OEF/OIF/OND veterans, with recommendations for evidence-based PTSD treatment. The IOM recommends evidence-based PTSD models for OEF/OIF/OND veterans with comorbid conditions. DOD generally agrees with the recommendations. The RAND study \"The War Within\" provides 14 recommendations to prevent suicide in the military. Section 733 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act required the Secretary of Defense to establish a Task Force to address related matters. The DOD Task Force on the Prevention of Suicide by Members of the Armed Forces was established in August 2009, with 49 findings and 76 recommendations. The Task Force focused on Organization and Leadership, Wellness Enhancement and Training, Access to Quality Care, and Surveillance and Research. In July 2010, the Department of the Army issued a separate report on Health Promotion, Risk Reduction, and Suicide Prevention. The Army Report identified gaps in identifying and mitigating high-risk behavior among soldiers due to operational tempo focusing on deployment. Recommendations were made to Army Headquarters, Medical Command, and Unit Commanders, with HQDA recommendations being most suitable for congressional action. DOD has deployed teams to evaluate soldiers' psychological health in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2003, with the most recent report being the sixth Mental Health Advisory Team. The sixth Mental Health Advisory Team (MHAT VI) worked in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2009, making recommendations for funding research on concussive and traumatic brain injuries. Executive Order 13625 aimed to improve mental health services for veterans and service members. Executive Order 13625 aims to improve mental health services for veterans and service members by establishing an interagency task force and increasing mental health care staffing within the Department of Veterans Affairs. It also calls for a National Research Action Plan to address the lack of understanding of PTSD, other mental health conditions, and Traumatic Brain Injury. The National Research Action Plan, established under Executive Order 13625, aims to develop biomarkers for early diagnosis and treatment effectiveness, improve diagnostic criteria for TBI, enhance understanding of PTSD mechanisms, foster new treatments, improve data sharing, utilize electronic health records, and support collaborative research for suicide prevention. The National Research Action Plan focuses on developing biomarkers for early diagnosis and treatment effectiveness, improving diagnostic criteria for TBI, enhancing understanding of PTSD mechanisms, fostering new treatments, improving data sharing, utilizing electronic health records, and supporting collaborative research for suicide prevention. The Departments of Defense and Health and Human Services engage in a comprehensive longitudinal mental health study with an emphasis on PTSD, TBI, and related injuries to develop better prevention, diagnosis, and treatment options. Agencies aim to enroll at least 100,000 service members by December 31, 2012, and include a plan for long term follow up with enrollees through a coordinated effort with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Funding for research in these areas is allocated through the Congressionally-Directed Research Program. The Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs' Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury (PH/TBI) Research Program was established in 2007 with funding for research on PTSD and TBI. Various laws have been enacted to address military mental health, including provisions for suicide prevention. Numerous laws have been enacted to address military mental health issues, including provisions for screening, additional providers, reporting, and research. Congress has shown interest in psychological health issues among active duty forces, but areas for oversight remain, such as understanding the brain manifestations of conditions like PTSD. Further research is needed to identify biomarkers, brain imaging, and effective pharmacologic agents for therapy. Congress may need to monitor research efforts for significant findings in mental health strategies and consider gaps in research on causes, biomarkers, and treatments. Screening measures for mental health and TBI are crucial for identifying servicemembers and veterans in need of treatment. Oversight is necessary to ensure referrals to trained professionals for comprehensive assessments and evidence-based treatment, especially for comorbid conditions in OEF/OIF/OND veterans. Congress may wish to consider monitoring the efficacy of treatment for comorbid conditions and ensuring optimal access to mental health care providers. Additionally, Congress should examine the effectiveness of DOD initiatives in providing evidence-based treatments for PTSD, depression, and substance use disorder. Congress may wish to examine the effectiveness of DOD initiatives in encouraging servicemembers to seek mental health care and reducing stigma. They should also evaluate the appropriateness of DOD's response to suicide prevention strategies, such as training primary care physicians and restricting access to lethal means. Additionally, Congress should monitor the quality of care and training for PTSD, TBI, depression, and substance abuse provided by DOD and VA providers. The agency is working to improve awareness and reduce stigma for those seeking care for TBI, PTSD, and related injuries. Congress may need to evaluate research efforts and consider additional oversight on resource allocation and efficacy of entities like the DCOE. DOD's spending on mental health care has increased due to more servicemembers seeking treatment, prompting Congress to examine the role of mental health care in the Defense Health Program. The Defense Health Program has seen increased spending on mental health care to address issues like PTSD and TBI among active duty forces. Congress may need to assess the long-term costs and implications of these programs, including the impact on servicemembers and their families. The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center provides data on servicemembers' diagnoses of mental health conditions during active duty. However, these data may underestimate the true incidence and prevalence of mental health disorders among active duty forces. The data provided by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center may underestimate the true incidence and prevalence of mental health disorders among active duty servicemembers. The database used does not capture Reserve and Guard members seeking mental health treatment after deactivation, and medical encounters in deployed settings or shipboard are not routinely included for analysis. The data on diagnoses of selected mental disorders among active duty servicemembers may not fully capture the true incidence and prevalence. Incidence cases were defined as hospitalizations or outpatient visits with specific diagnostic codes. Each servicemember was counted only once for each disorder, but individuals may have multiple diagnoses. The total number of diagnoses does not reflect the actual number of servicemembers diagnosed. The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center uses a different methodology for diagnosing mental disorders among active duty servicemembers. Data caveats may apply to other studies as well. PTSD diagnosis criteria require experiencing a traumatic event and reacting with intense horror. Individuals with PTSD must have experienced a traumatic event that threatened their physical integrity or that of others, reacting with intense horror, fear, or helplessness. Symptoms must persist for more than one month and include reexperiencing the trauma, avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, and hyperarousal. Acute PTSD lasts 1-3 months, while chronic PTSD extends beyond three months. In 2010, 5,959 cases of PTSD were diagnosed in active duty servicemembers, with higher rates in the Army and Marine Corps compared to the Air Force and Navy. Chronic PTSD lasts beyond three months, and delayed-onset PTSD occurs at least six months after the trauma. Prevalence estimates of PTSD in the Armed Forces vary depending on assessment methodologies and population characteristics. Screening tools and reported symptoms show higher rates than clinical diagnoses. Studies suggest 10%-18% of combat troops in Iraq or Afghanistan have probable PTSD. Post-deployment health assessments found that probable PTSD prevalence among active duty servicemembers increased from 11.8% to 16.7% between assessments. For reservists and National Guard members, rates rose from 12.7% to 24.5% by the second assessment. Risk factors for PTSD included Guard or Reserve status, female gender, Hispanic ethnicity, lengthy deployments, and extensive combat exposure. A telephone survey of deployed personnel found approximately 14% with symptoms indicative of probable PTSD. Between January 1, 2001, and December 3, 2012, a total of 103,792 PTSD cases have been diagnosed in servicemembers deployed for at least 30 days in support of OEF, OIF, or OND. The number of diagnoses is higher among deployed servicemembers than non-deployed servicemembers. Approximately 2,453,036 servicemembers have ever deployed to OEF, OIF, and/or OND. Studies have linked PTSD diagnoses with factors common in the deployment experience, such as combat exposure. Factors such as combat exposure, length and number of deployments, perceived threat of danger, and physical injuries are linked to higher PTSD risk in servicemembers deployed to OEF, OIF, or OND. Preparedness for combat and unit cohesion can mitigate this risk. Army and Marine Corps servicemembers have higher rates of PTSD compared to Navy and Air Force, possibly due to greater exposure to combat-related factors. Between 2001 and 2012, 80% of PTSD cases among previously deployed servicemembers were diagnosed in active component servicemembers, with 13% in National Guard members and 7% in Reserve component members. Post-deployment stressors like economic and relationship difficulties are also PTSD risk factors for OIF-deployed troops. The DSM-IV-TR categorizes alcohol and substance use disorders, including substance-related disorders, substance use disorders (e.g., alcohol abuse), and substance-induced disorders (e.g., intoxication). Alcohol-related diagnoses and medical encounters in the active duty forces have increased since 2001, with the sharpest increases since 2007. Between 2001 and 2010, 190,302 servicemembers had at least one medical encounter where they received an acute alcohol diagnosis of dependence or abuse. Each diagnosis is specific to the substance, so an individual may have multiple diagnoses of abuse or dependence\u2014one for each substance. Between 2001 and 2010, 190,302 servicemembers had at least one medical encounter with acute alcohol diagnoses, with approximately 21% being recurrent cases. However, over 90% of these cases likely represent treatment encounters rather than actual recurrent cases. Additionally, over 141,000 active duty servicemembers had medical encounters related to alcohol abuse or dependence during the same time period. In a 2008 survey, 47% of servicemembers self-reported as binge drinkers and 5% reported possible dependence. Drug abuse disorders accounted for 4% of mental disorders diagnosed among active duty forces between 2000 and 2011. Substance abuse disorders accounted for 4% of mental disorders diagnosed among active duty forces, with a total of 73,623 diagnoses. The rate of drug disorder diagnoses increased between 2000 and 2009, potentially linked to deployment. Incidence rates of cannabis and cocaine use declined, while rates of opioid and \"mixed/other\" substance abuse rose sharply, reflecting a potential increase in prescription drug misuse. Substance abuse disorder diagnoses decreased with age, time in service, rank, and number of combat deployments. Rates of substance abuse diagnoses were 1.8 times higher among younger servicemembers compared to older ones. Substance abuse rates were highest in the Army and Marine Corps, with junior enlisted servicemembers having significantly higher rates compared to officers. A 2008 health survey showed a decrease in illegal drug use but an increase in prescription drug misuse, particularly pain medication. Self-reported drug misuse may be linked to improved survey design, increased deployments, and diagnoses of pain disorders, PTSD, and other mental disorders. Depression, formally known as major depressive disorder, is characterized by low mood, low self-esteem, and loss of interest in enjoyable activities. Major depressive disorder is a common mental disorder in the United States, affecting 16% of adults across their lifetimes. Among U.S. Army personnel, the prevalence of major depression was 1.3%. The prevalence of major depressive disorder for never-deployed troops was 5.7%, while currently deployed servicemembers had a prevalence of 12%. Limitation of the analysis included potential underrepresentation of high-risk servicemembers. The prevalence of major depressive disorder among U.S. Army personnel rose from 4.4% in 2007 to 5.1% in 2010. The incidence rate of new diagnoses also increased before declining in 2010. Limited data is available on the rates of major depressive disorder among individual services. The incidence rate of major depressive disorder is highest among the Army, peaking at 28.8 per 1,000 per year in 2009. Adjustment disorder is a psychological response to stressors, including life events like divorce or unemployment. Diagnosis includes stressors, symptoms, lack of alternative explanation, and timing. Symptoms may be chronic, and diagnosis requires clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning. Adjustment disorder is a residual category for cases that do not fit specific symptoms. Adjustment disorder is a residual category for cases that do not meet criteria for another mental disorder. Diagnosis considers timing of symptoms relative to stressors, appearing within three months and resolving within six months. Rates of adjustment disorder diagnoses increased by 98% between 2000 and 2011, accounting for 26% of mental disorders among active duty forces. V codes in the DSM-IV-TR are used to record clinically significant circumstances that are not diagnosable mental disorders. These codes identify conditions other than disease or injury and may influence present or future care. They include problems in relationships, maltreatment, life circumstances, and other factors. Between 2000 and 2011, over 425,000 active duty servicemembers sought help for mental health issues related to life circumstances, partner relationships, and mental, behavioral, or substance use difficulties. Incidence rates of DSM \"V codes\" have declined overall by approximately 30%, but there was a sharp increase between 2004 and 2005. The numbers of DSM \"V codes\" connected to mental, behavioral, and substance abuse issues increased by approximately 120% during this period. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines TBI as an injury to the head resulting in decreased consciousness, amnesia, skull fracture, or neurological abnormalities. Neurologists classify the severity of TBI as mild. TBI is classified as mild, moderate, severe, or penetrating, with penetrating TBIs being open head injuries. It is a common injury from wars and non-deployed settings, with causes including crashes, falls, sports, and military training. Symptoms of mild TBI include headache, dizziness, weakness, and sensitivity to light. Symptoms of mild TBI include headache, dizziness, weakness, sensitivity to light or sound, cognitive difficulties, and psychological symptoms. Approximately 85%-90% of servicemembers with combat-related mild TBI recover without lasting issues. Symptoms of moderate or severe TBI include confusion, disorientation, loss of consciousness, and memory loss. Early recognition and evacuation to a specialized neurological care facility are crucial for combat-related moderate or severe TBI. MRI or CT results may be normal or abnormal. Since 2001, servicemembers have experienced over 255,000 TBIs, with incidents of mild TBI rising sharply between 2005 and 2007. Diagnoses of TBI in deployed settings nearly doubled between 2010 and 2011, reflecting a greater focus on identifying and treating TBIs among deployed servicemembers. The July 2010 \"Policy Guidance for the Management of Concussion/Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in the Deployed Setting\" outlines TBI screening requirements for servicemembers exposed to concussive events or physical injury. Screening is necessary for those near blasts, falls, or vehicle crashes. Challenges in TBI screening include reliance on self-reports and co-occurring conditions. The Concussion Management Algorithm was updated in 2012 for acute screening. Between 2000 and 2011, approximately 175,290 active component servicemembers had at least one TBI diagnosis, with Army servicemembers experiencing the greatest number of TBIs of each type. Rest for 24 hours is mandated for all exposed servicemembers, regardless of concussion test results. The Army and Marines Corps have seen a higher increase in TBIs compared to the Navy and Air Force. Records of injury causes were unavailable for over 60% of TBI diagnoses. Between 2008 and 2011, 74% of TBIs were caused by accidents such as motor vehicle accidents, falls, or being struck by an object. Assaults and battle injuries each accounted for 11% of TBIs with recorded causes. In combat theatres, most TBIs were attributed to combat injuries or gun/explosive accidents. Studies show TBI survivors are at higher risk for depression, anxiety disorders, and PTSD. The study on TBI and psychiatric illnesses found that the risk of psychiatric illness increases with the severity of TBI. There is also a possible link between TBI and suicide, aggression, PTSD, dementia, and other behavioral outcomes. The 2008 Institute of Medicine report highlighted associations between TBI and various mental health issues and poor psychosocial functioning. Studies have shown a connection between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and an increased risk of developing dementia. A 2010 study of 280,000 veterans at the San Francisco VA Medical Center revealed that 15% of veterans with TBI developed dementia, compared to 7% without TBI. The 2008 Institute of Medicine meta-analysis concluded that there is evidence linking moderate or severe TBI to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, with limited evidence for mild TBI. Suicide has become the second-leading cause of death for active duty servicemembers since 2010, with researchers suggesting impulsive acts triggered by various stressors as a common factor. Between 1998 and 2011, suicides among active duty forces increased, with rates peaking in 2009 and declining slightly in subsequent years. The suicide rate remains lower than in comparable civilian populations, attributed to factors like full-time employment and \"healthy-worker\" effects. Between 1998 and 2011, the incidence of suicide in active duty forces was lower than in comparable civilian populations, attributed to factors like full-time employment and \"healthy-worker\" effects. Researchers estimated that if the Armed Forces had the same suicide rates as civilians, there would have been 23% more deaths among male servicemembers. The Army had higher rates of suicide compared to other services during this period. Between 1998 and 2011, the Army had the highest number of servicemember deaths by suicide, accounting for 46% of all suicides. Suicide rates increased significantly in the Army and Marine Corps between 2000 and 2011, while remaining relatively stable in the Navy and Air Force. In 2011, the suicide rate for Army personnel was approximately 23 per 100,000, compared to 15 per 100,000 for the Navy and Marine Corps, and 13 per 100,000 for the Air Force. Servicemembers who died by suicide in 2011 were more likely to be male, junior enlisted, under 25, and non-Hispanic. The suicide trends among active duty forces in 2011 were similar to those in 2010 and 2009. Male, junior enlisted, under 25, and non-Hispanic white servicemembers were more likely to die by suicide. The suicide rate for divorced servicemembers was 55% higher than for married servicemembers. Deaths by suicide in the active duty forces only include those that occurred during military service, excluding inactivated National Guard and Reserve members or post-service suicides. Between 1998 and 2011, firearms were the most common method of suicide among active duty servicemembers, accounting for 62% of male suicides and 42% of female suicides. Non-military firearms were used in 49% of suicides in 2011, with hanging being the second most common method at 20%. In 2011, drug overdoses were the most common method of suicide attempts, accounting for nearly 60% of non-fatal attempted suicides. Prescription drugs were involved in 64% of these attempts. Alcohol was used in 31% of suicide attempts, while firearms were used in 4%. Between 1998 and 2011, nearly half of active duty deaths by suicide involved personal weapons. DOD officials are working on a suicide prevention campaign to address firearm access for potentially suicidal servicemembers. In 2011, 301 servicemembers died by suicide. 55% had no known behavioral health disorder, 20% had mood disorders, with depression being the most common at 11%. PTSD was the most common anxiety disorder at 6%. 25% had a history of substance abuse, while 16% received treatment. 40% received outpatient behavioral health care, 17% within the month prior to suicide. 15% had inpatient treatment, and 26% had a history of psychotropic medication use, mainly antidepressants. In 2011, 915 active duty servicemembers attempted suicide. 64% had a known history of a behavioral health disorder, with mood disorders being the most common at 34%, followed by anxiety disorders at 25%. 47% had been deployed, and 15% had direct combat experience. 26% had a history of psychotropic medication use, mainly antidepressants. The curr_chunk discusses the various factors associated with suicide among Army and Marine personnel, including diagnoses of anxiety disorders, substance abuse history, psychotropic medication use, outpatient behavioral health services, relationship failures, job loss, and combat experience. The reasons for the higher suicide rates in these groups remain unclear. Medical researchers have not definitively confirmed a direct link between ground combat tours and servicemember suicides. The prolonged war effort may be contributing to higher rates of mental disorders and subsequently, higher suicide rates among servicemembers. Concerns have been raised by Members of Congress, military leaders, and health providers about the impact of increased deployments and shorter dwell times on the mental health of U.S. servicemembers. Studies on deployed servicemembers have yielded varying conclusions regarding the relationship between deployments and mental health issues such as PTSD, depression, anxiety, and stress. Some studies show higher rates of mental health problems among repeat deployers compared to first-time deployers, while others find little evidence of such differences. Studies have shown varying conclusions on the impact of repeated deployments on mental health. While some suggest higher rates of mental health issues among repeat deployers, others find little evidence of such differences. Servicemembers who deploy repeatedly may be more resilient and gain additional knowledge and skills in combat environments, increasing their psychological resilience. Rates of anxiety disorders and PTSD diagnoses tend to rise after the first, second, and third deployments before falling sharply for the fourth and fifth deployments. A follow-up study on mental health diagnoses after combat found that among male servicemembers, PTSD, adjustment reactions, anxiety disorders, and depressive disorders were more common after second, third, and fourth deployments. Alcohol/drug disorders, suicidal ideation, and psychosocial problems were more prevalent after the first deployment. Among female servicemembers, PTSD diagnoses increased following multiple deployments, along with other mental disorders like depressive disorders, alcohol/drug disorders, suicidal ideation, adjustment reactions, anxiety disorders, and psychosocial problems. After repeated deployments, rates of PTSD and anxiety-related disorders increased, while other mental disorders showed higher diagnosis rates after the first deployment. Quickened deployment cycles and shorter \"dwell\" time between deployments are cited as risk factors for increased stress and mental disorders among deployed servicemembers. The study by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center found that longer dwell times between deployments were associated with higher percentages of deployed servicemembers diagnosed with mental disorders. Personal circumstances can greatly influence the effects of transition and readjustment periods. Servicemembers with medical conditions from recent deployments may have long dwell times and be at higher risk of recurrent conditions. Health care occupation servicemembers had the highest rates of PTSD diagnoses and other anxiety disorders. Health care occupation servicemembers have higher rates of PTSD and other anxiety disorders compared to combat-specific occupations, possibly due to consistent exposure to traumatic injuries. They also likely utilize mental health care more frequently. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 addressed military mental health issues. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 addressed military mental health issues, including establishing oversight for suicide prevention programs and training for National Guard and Reserve members. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 addressed military mental health issues, including oversight for suicide prevention programs and training for National Guard and Reserve members. Section 582 of the Act required the development of a comprehensive policy on suicide prevention among servicemembers, while Section 583 mandated a study of resilience programs in the Army. Section 703 amended post-deployment mental health assessments for servicemembers to align with other health assessments.
