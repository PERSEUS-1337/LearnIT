    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 4030 of the Penal Code is amended to establish a statewide policy strictly limiting strip and body cavity searches to protect the constitutional rights of detained persons in California. The amended Section 4030 of the Penal Code in California strictly limits strip and body cavity searches for prearraignment detainees arrested for minor offenses or minors detained prior to a hearing. The definition of \"body cavity\" is specified to include only certain areas, and a \"physical body cavity search\" is defined as intrusion for the purpose of discovering concealed objects. The Penal Code in California restricts strip and body cavity searches for prearraignment detainees arrested for minor offenses or minors detained before a hearing. Strip search involves visual inspection of underclothing, breasts, buttocks, or genitalia, while body cavity search is visual inspection of a body cavity. Patdown searches, metal detector searches, body scanners, and clothing searches are allowed to find concealed weapons and contraband substances before placing the person in a booking cell. Pregnant women should be avoided from being scanned with a body scanner. A person arrested for a misdemeanor or infraction in California cannot be strip searched or visually body cavity searched before being placed in jail, unless there is reasonable suspicion of concealing a weapon or contraband. Authorization from a supervising officer is required for such searches. The authorization from a supervising officer must include specific facts and circumstances for a strip search or body cavity search in California. A person arrested for a misdemeanor or infraction not involving weapons, drugs, or violence must not be placed in the general jail population unless certain conditions are met. This includes not being cited and released, not being released on their own recognizance, and not being able to post bail within a reasonable time. A person arrested for a misdemeanor or infraction not involving weapons, drugs, or violence must not be housed in the general jail population unless unable to post bail within a reasonable time. Emergency placement in the general population requires written authorization and does not preempt the individual's rights to release on citation, recognizance, or bail. (g) A person arrested for a misdemeanor or infraction offense shall not undergo a physical body cavity search without a search warrant issued by a magistrate. The authorization and search warrant must be documented in the agency's records and made available to the person searched upon request. Details of the search, including the date, time, location, and results, must also be recorded and provided to the person searched. (i) During strip searches or body cavity searches, certain restrictions apply to ensure the person being searched is treated respectfully.\n(j) Physical body cavity searches must be conducted hygienically by authorized medical personnel.\n(k) Same-sex individuals should conduct or be present during strip searches or body scans, except for medical personnel. Strip, visual, and physical body cavity searches must be conducted in a private area. Unauthorized conduct of these searches is a misdemeanor. Legal rights for damages or relief are not limited by this section. Any person harmed by a violation of this section can sue for damages, including punitive damages, equitable relief, and attorney's fees."
