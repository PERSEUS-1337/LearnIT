This includes limitations on security assistance to the government of Egypt. The \"Egypt Accountability and Democracy Promotion Act\" imposes limitations on US assistance to Egypt under the Arms Export Control Act. 10% of the assistance will be withheld if the Secretary of State does not make a certification within 30 days, 50% if no certification is made within a further 30 days, and 100% if no certification is made within a total of 120 days. The Secretary of State must provide a certification to the congressional committees if unable to make the required certification regarding Egypt's government and terrorism influence, leading to withholding of funds. The Government of Egypt must meet certain criteria to receive certification from the Secretary of State, including not having any ties to terrorist organizations, protecting political, economic, and religious freedoms, fully implementing the Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty, and taking verifiable actions. The Government of Egypt is actively working to detect and destroy smuggling networks and tunnels to Gaza, as well as cracking down on extremist groups in the Sinai Peninsula. The Secretary of State must provide recertifications every 90 days to ensure these requirements are being met. The Secretary of State can waive limitations on withholding funds for Egypt if it is in the national security interests of the United States. Interest earned from funds for Egypt can be transferred to an interest-bearing account.

U.S.C. 2763 funds shall be transferred to assistance for the Middle East Partnership Initiative for democracy and governance programs in Egypt. A report on U.S. strategic objectives for security assistance to Egypt must be submitted within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The report must include details on US security assistance to Egypt for strategic planning, training, equipment provision, and facility construction. It should also cover vetting and monitoring systems for defense articles and training, as well as actions taken by Egypt to implement the Egypt-Israel peace treaty, combat smuggling networks, and address extremist activities in the Sinai Peninsula. The report on US security assistance to Egypt must include recommendations to combat incitement to violence, protect religious and democratic freedoms, and maximize effectiveness of security assistance. Additionally, the Comptroller General of the United States is required to submit a report to congressional committees within 120 days of the initial report submission. The appropriate congressional committees must review and comment on the report on US security assistance to Egypt and provide recommendations for additional actions if necessary. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate. SEC. 4 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 imposes limitations on economic assistance to Egypt, stating that no assistance can be provided to the Government of Egypt without a valid certification. In the absence of this certification, funds are reallocated to democracy and governance programs in Egypt, supporting organizations promoting human rights, good governance, and civil society. SEC. 5 defines the \"Government of Egypt\" as any person, agent, or official affiliated with or representing the Government of Egypt."
