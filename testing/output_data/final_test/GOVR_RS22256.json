    "content": "The origins of affirmative action law can be traced back to the 1960s when the Warren and Burger Courts addressed racial segregation in public schools. Judicial rulings during this time imposed an affirmative duty on school boards to desegregate dual-school systems and eliminate state-enforced segregation. This led to a two-decade era of massive desegregation, with federal orders requiring significant changes in school attendance patterns and student transportation. School districts sought compliance with constitutional requirements to end federal intervention, and the Supreme Court eventually responded to these issues. The Supreme Court responded to school districts' efforts to comply with desegregation requirements by allowing them to gain release from federal intervention if they have eliminated past discrimination in good faith for a reasonable period of time. This led to the approval of laws authorizing race-conscious strategies to promote minority opportunity in various sectors. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 serves as the basis for affirmative action in employment and education for employers with 15 or more employees. Employers with 15 or more employees are subject to equal employment opportunity regulations under Title VII of the 1964 act, which allows for affirmative action remedies to address discrimination. Federal regulations also require schools and colleges to take affirmative action to overcome past discrimination under Title VI. Title VI requires schools and colleges to take affirmative action to overcome past discrimination and encourage affirmative action to address conditions that limited participation based on race, color, or national origin. Executive Order 11246 mandates employers with 50 or more employees and federal contracts over $50,000 to submit affirmative action plans with minority and female hiring goals. Affirmative action planning by federal departments and agencies includes goals and timetables for contractors to commit good-faith efforts. Race and gender considerations, such as numerical goals, aim to eliminate underrepresentation of minorities and females in agency employment. Federal contract set-asides and minority subcontracting goals support small disadvantaged businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Minority group members and women are presumed disadvantaged, while non-minority contractors must prove eligibility. Goals for minority groups, women, and other disadvantaged individuals are routinely included in federal programs. Currently, federal departments and agencies must work towards a government-wide procurement goal of at least 5% for minority and female contractors, with additional set-asides for small disadvantaged firms in transportation projects. The Supreme Court has approved the use of race- or gender-conscious selection criteria by private employers to address racial imbalance or discrimination in job categories. The Supreme Court required proof of remedial justification for affirmative action based on past discrimination and workplace effects. Racial preferences in employment must be justified by evidence of underrepresentation of minorities or women. Consideration of race or gender as a plus factor in employment decisions is acceptable if it does not harm non-minority employees' legitimate expectations. The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke ruling in 1978 sparked a constitutional debate on state-sponsored affirmative action. The decision emphasized the need for flexibility, temporary measures, and narrow tailoring to avoid rigid quotas. The case revealed a lack of consensus among Justices, with different opinions on the legality of special admissions programs based on race. The Bakke ruling in 1978 highlighted the debate on affirmative action, emphasizing flexibility and narrow tailoring to avoid quotas. Justice Powell supported considering race as a factor for student diversity but rejected using racial classifications in admissions. He believed diversity furthered academic freedom and was a permissible goal for universities. The Supreme Court in Bakke affirmed the admission of Bakke but overturned the ban on considering race in admissions. The ruling emphasized that race could be a factor for diversity but rejected quotas based solely on race. This decision influenced later cases, such as Grutter v. Bollinger, where the Court upheld the University of Michigan Law School's use of race in admissions for educational benefits. In Grutter v. Bollinger, the Supreme Court upheld the University of Michigan Law School's consideration of race in admissions to achieve a diverse student body. The Court found the law school's individualized, holistic review process constitutional, unlike the undergraduate program that awarded automatic racial bonus points without considering individual backgrounds. In Grutter v. Bollinger, the Supreme Court upheld the University of Michigan Law School's consideration of race in admissions to achieve a diverse student body. The decision enshrined the compelling interest in promoting racial diversity in higher education. The Court later addressed the use of race in maintaining diversity in elementary and secondary schools in Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, where the school plans were struck down for violating the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Roberts led a plurality of four Justices in concluding that school plans in Seattle and Louisville were unconstitutional for not serving a compelling governmental interest. Justice Kennedy concurred in striking down the plans but disagreed with the implication that diversity in education is not a compelling interest. He stated that diversity can be a compelling educational goal, but the plans were not shown to promote diversity effectively. The Court's ruling suggests that race-conscious measures for diversity in public education remain constitutionally uncertain. In public education, promoting racial diversity is constitutionally permissible in theory, but the Court's stance on specific programs is unclear. Recent cases have revisited affirmative action in higher education. The Court has approved congressional racial preferences for federal projects but condemned similar actions by local governments. Contextual differences in government activities often influence judicial decisions on affirmative action. The legal landscape surrounding affirmative action in public employment, government contracting, public schools, and election redistricting has been marked by a lack of consensus among Justices. It wasn't until 1989 that a majority of Justices established the proper constitutional standard for reviewing race-based classifications. Prior disputes questioned whether affirmative action for racial minorities should be subject to strict scrutiny, an intermediate standard, or simple rationality. In City of Richmond, a 5 to 4 majority settled on strict scrutiny to invalidate a 30% set-aside of city contracts for minority-owned businesses because the program was not narrowly tailored to a \"compelling\" governmental interest. Racial balancing untailored to identifiable evidence of minority exclusion was impermissible. City of Richmond suggested that a more tolerant standard of racial line-drawing may apply to Congress. In Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, the Court applied strict scrutiny to a federal transportation program of financial incentives for prime contractors who subcontracted to firms owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, defined to prefer members of designated racial minorities. All racial classifications by government must be justified by a compelling governmental interest and narrowly tailored to that end. In Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, the Court acknowledged Congress's role in addressing discrimination and emphasized that racial preferences in federal law must be justified and narrowly drawn to pass constitutional muster. Lower federal courts have since had mixed rulings on government programs with minority contracting preferences. The Court has considered challenges involving racial preferences in education, such as affirmative action in higher education. In Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, the Court reaffirmed the constitutionality of promoting racial diversity in higher education but vacated and remanded UT's admissions program decision. The Court reaffirmed the validity of earlier precedents on affirmative action in higher education but criticized the lower court for applying an overly deferential form of strict scrutiny. The Court emphasized that universities must prove their admissions programs are narrowly tailored to meet diversity goals, with no workable race-neutral alternatives available. The Court vacated the appellate court's decision on affirmative action in higher education, emphasizing the need for a workable race-neutral alternative to promote diversity. The Fifth Circuit upheld UT's admissions plan, stating it was necessary for achieving diversity goals. The court found that UT's limited use of race in admissions was narrowly tailored to meet diversity goals, leading to the Supreme Court agreeing to review the ruling. The reason for the review is unclear, but it suggests some disagreement with the Fifth Circuit's decision. In a 2014 case, Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, the Court upheld Michigan's Proposal 2, which prohibited preferential treatment based on race in public education. This decision was based on the principle that individuals should not be disadvantaged in the political process due to race, as established in previous Supreme Court cases. The Court upheld Michigan's Proposal 2, which prohibited preferential treatment based on race in public education. The decision was based on the principle that the Equal Protection Clause is violated if a law has a racial focus or targets policies benefiting minorities, and reorders the political process to burden minority groups. Justice Kennedy distinguished the case from previous rulings, emphasizing the voters' right to decide on race-conscious preferences. The Supreme Court upheld Michigan's Proposal 2, which banned racial preferences in public education. Justice Kennedy and other Justices expressed concerns about judicial interference in the political process. The Court remains divided on the constitutionality of considering race in governmental actions. States are currently allowed to prohibit the use of racial preferences in public education and other areas if they choose to do so."
