    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Businesses Educating Students in Technology (BEST) Act\" and includes findings related to technology education. Congress finds that technological progress is crucial for sustaining economic growth, with estimates showing that innovation has driven half of the nation's economic growth in the past 50 years. The demand for jobs requiring technological expertise is increasing rapidly, with a projected need for 1.3 million new computer engineers, programmers, and systems analysts in the next decade. Additionally, there are currently over 350,000 unfilled information technology positions in the United States. The shortage of graduates with technology-based education and skills in the United States has led to partnerships between businesses and educational institutions to help students acquire necessary knowledge. Congress should incentivize these partnerships by providing tax credits to businesses involved. A tax credit will help students and businesses in technology-based industries by providing incentives to develop a highly-skilled workforce for the best paying jobs in the economy. SEC. 3. ALLOWANCE OF CREDIT FOR BUSINESS-PROVIDED STUDENT EDUCATION AND TRAINING. This section introduces a tax credit for businesses that provide student education and training, aimed at developing a highly-skilled workforce in technology-based industries. The business-provided student education and training credit allows a 40% credit on qualified expenditures, with a maximum limit of $100,000 per year. Qualified expenditures include payments for education and training services provided by the taxpayer's employees. The term 'qualified student education and training expenditure' excludes amounts funded by grants or contracts. 'Qualified student education and training services' refer to technology-based education and training for students. The tax credit allows for education and training of students in eligible institutions for employment skills related to the taxpayer's trade or business. Special rules include treating all persons under a single employer as a single taxpayer and allocating the credit among partners in partnerships. The tax credit for student education and training in eligible institutions is allocated among partners in partnerships as per regulations. No double benefits are allowed for the expenditure used to determine the credit. Conforming amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code to include the business-provided student education and training credit. The table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include the business-provided student education and training credit. The business-provided student education and training credit under Sec. 45D applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 1998."
