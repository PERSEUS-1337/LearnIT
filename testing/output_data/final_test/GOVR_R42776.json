    "content": "Former President George W. Bush proposed a $15 billion plan in 2003 to combat malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS globally through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Congress authorized the initiative through the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act in 2003 and reauthorized it in 2008. The Lantos-Hyde Act authorized $48 billion from FY2009 through FY2013 for fighting HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, including $5 billion for malaria programs, $4 billion for TB efforts, and $2 billion for the Global Fund in FY2009. Congress had never allocated such large sums for global health before. Prior to PEPFAR, Congress had only allocated $3.1 billion for global HIV/AIDS programs in the five years. The US spent over $18 billion on global HIV/AIDS initiatives in the first phase of PEPFAR (FY2004-FY2008) and nearly $26 billion from FY2009 through FY2012. Since its launch, Congress consistently provided more funding than requested for global HIV/AIDS programs, including contributions to the Global Fund. While initial spending exceeded the President's proposal, in later years, requests surpassed actual spending levels. Actual spending on global HIV/AIDS programs decreased in FY2011 and FY2012. It remains uncertain how much Congress will allocate in the future. During the second phase of PEPFAR (FY2009-FY2013), Congress debated the role of the Global Fund in global HIV/AIDS funding. Some are concerned about the increasing allocation of resources to the Global Fund, questioning if U.S. priorities can be maintained. Critics highlight mismanagement issues, while supporters argue the Global Fund complements U.S. efforts by leveraging contributions from other donors. The Global Fund, a key partner in the U.S. fight against global HIV/AIDS, is undergoing reforms prompted by U.S. concerns. Congressional appropriations for the Global Fund exceeded requested levels during the Bush and Obama Administrations. Presidents Bush and Obama had differing views on apportioning bilateral and multilateral HIV/AIDS funds, with Obama reserving up to 27% for the Global Fund. Despite this, both Presidents showed support for the Global Fund. President Bush and President Obama had differing views on funding levels for the Global Fund. President Obama made the highest ever pledge of $1.65 billion in FY2013, part of a three-year $4 billion commitment. Funding for global HIV/AIDS projects has increased, driven by budgetary increases in recipient countries, with a 15% growth in domestic public sources between 2010 and 2011, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2011, global spending on HIV/AIDS totaled $16.9 billion, with 41% of growth in sub-Saharan Africa. Lower- and middle-income countries, along with private entities, funded roughly half of this amount. The United States was the largest single donor, contributing 24% of the total spending. Congressional mandates for stronger country ownership may have led to increased spending by recipient countries. The Lantos-Hyde Act mandated partnership frameworks to enhance country ownership of HIV/AIDS plans. The U.S.-South Africa Partnership Framework aims to reduce PEPFAR aid gradually. South Africa has increased its HIV/AIDS budget significantly. OGAC has signed partnership frameworks with over 20 countries, signaling changes in funding for global HIV/AIDS programs. Global HIV/AIDS funding is changing, with traditional donors fluctuating and the Global Fund facing resource challenges. The 11th round of funding was canceled in 2011, with new grants not expected until 2014. BRICS countries like Brazil and Russia are increasing their role in HIV/AIDS assistance, with Brazil helping manufacture ARVs and Russia donating funds to neighboring countries. In 2011, Russia donated $13 million for fighting HIV/AIDS, primarily to border states, and contributed $88 million towards AIDS research from 2007 to 2010. India is offering generic ART to developing countries and accelerating technology transfer with African manufacturers. China is one of the top five donors for HIV/AIDS R&D, providing $18.3 million for AIDS vaccine research in 2011. South Africa increased investments in R&D, spending $10 million on related research in 2011. BRICS countries are taking control of their national HIV/AIDS programs, with South Africa boosting its budget to $1.25 billion in 2012. Brazil covers all ART provided through its national programs, and India committed to cover at least 90% of ART costs. India committed to cover at least 90% of all HIV/AIDS expenses related to Phase IV of its National AIDS Control Program (2012-2017). China paid for roughly 80% of national HIV/AIDS costs in 2011, increasing spending fourfold from $124 million in 2007 to $530 million in 2011. The international community has made significant advancements in the fight against HIV/AIDS, with over 8 million people in low- and middle-income countries receiving antiretroviral treatment by 2011. Progress has also been made in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS. Progress has been made in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS, with 57% of HIV-positive pregnant women receiving drugs in 2011. PEPFAR has played a crucial role in the global fight against HIV/AIDS, with the United States providing roughly half of all international assistance. Despite slight declines in funding in 2009 and 2010, global contributions for combating HIV/AIDS have remained strong. However, future support for PEPFAR and the global fight against HIV/AIDS may be affected by various issues, including the need for reauthorization. The Leadership Act and Lantos-Hyde Act authorized funding for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. Authorization for PEPFAR may expire in FY2013. Congress is divided on foreign aid issues, including family planning. Reauthorization in the 113th Congress is uncertain. If not extended, PEPFAR could be funded through annual appropriations. The Lantos-Hyde Act emphasized country ownership. U.S. funding levels for global HIV/AIDS programs are unclear. In 2011, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on HIV/AIDS, emphasizing country ownership and the need for increased global resources to fight the disease. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has expressed long-term commitment to PEPFAR, but concerns remain about declining support as recipient countries are urged to contribute more to national HIV/AIDS plans. Emerging economies like BRICS countries could help expand the pool of resources and reduce pressure on existing donors. In 2011, the UN General Assembly resolution urged member states to increase investments to eliminate HIV/AIDS and close the $6 billion funding gap. African countries were called to allocate 15% of their budgets to the health sector. Kenya heavily relies on donors, with 81% of its $709 million AIDS plan funded by development assistance. Concerns exist about the Global Fund's fundraising challenges and potential impact on HIV/AIDS programs. The Global Fund, a major donor for HIV/AIDS programs in low- and middle-income countries, faces challenges in scaling back operations. Despite insufficient capital for new grants in 2012, the United States has increased its support, with Congress appropriating $1.3 billion in FY2012 and requesting $1.65 billion in FY2013. However, concerns about transparency and fiscal malfeasance have led to restrictions on some contributions. Congress is debating the roles of the Global Fund and PEPFAR. Several low-income countries are considering alternative approaches to financing their national AIDS plans, such as implementing levies on individual and corporate income. Zimbabwe launched an AIDS levy collecting funds from various sources including key donors like PEPFAR and the Global Fund. Tanzania, Kenya, and Zambia are also exploring similar funding mechanisms. Several countries, including Rwanda and Uganda, have imposed levies on mobile phone use to fund national HIV/AIDS plans. UNITAID, a non-governmental organization, has partnered with countries to develop innovative funding mechanisms for the global fight against HIV/AIDS. This includes taxes on airline tickets, with roughly 70% of UNITAID's revenues coming from this air levy. Other proposals for funding global health and HIV/AIDS programs include taxing bonds and derivatives. H.R. 755, the Investing in Our Future Act of 2011, suggests a levy on currency transactions to support global health programs. The bill H.R. 755 aims to fund global health programs, including HIV/AIDS, through various mechanisms such as levies on currency transactions. The cost of treating HIV/AIDS may rise due to drug resistance and changes in intellectual property rights, but the World Health Organization reports relatively low resistance rates in low- and middle-income countries. The cost of anti-retroviral treatments has significantly decreased in developing countries, making global access to HIV/AIDS treatments more widespread. The use of generic treatments has contributed to lower per-patient spending on ART within PEPFAR programs. In FY2009, 90% of ARVs purchased in PEPFAR programs were generic formulations. Generic ARVs are mainly produced in Brazil and India. Some groups are concerned about trade agreements affecting the production of generic ARVs in low-income countries like Brazil and India. Questions about pricing of newer treatments have prompted Congress members to urge pharmaceutical companies to consider the economic impact. PEPFAR has increased access to ARV treatments globally, largely due to the use of generic formulations. In FY2009, around 90% of ARVs purchased in PEPFAR programs were generics, up from 15% in 2005. Per-patient spending on ART in PEPFAR decreased from over $1,100 in 2004 to about $335 in 2011. ARV purchases make up 40% of all HIV/AIDS treatment spending, with additional costs including staff salaries, supplies, and building expenses. Investment costs cover renovations, equipment, training, and buffer stock for a reliable supply chain."
