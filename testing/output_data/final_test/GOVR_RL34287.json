    "content": "Between 1990 and 2014, an average of 594,600 inmates were released annually from state and federal prisons. The Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated that nearly three-quarters of released prisoners will be rearrested within five years, with 6 in 10 being reconvicted. Reentry initiatives combining work training, counseling, and housing assistance have shown to reduce recidivism rates. Offender reentry programs aim to prepare ex-convicts to safely return to the community as law-abiding citizens, typically divided into three phases. Offender reentry programs aim to connect ex-offenders with immediate services upon release from prison and provide long-term support as they integrate into communities. These programs vary in range and methodology, with the most effective ones spanning all three phases. Understanding the release of ex-offenders into the community and analyzing the population in correctional facilities are crucial in addressing offender reentry. The correctional system includes jails and prisons, with jails being local lockups. The prison system includes jails for temporary detention of individuals awaiting trial and prisons for convicted individuals serving longer sentences. The number of inmates in correctional facilities peaked in 2008 at nearly 2.4 million but has since declined. In 2009, there was a decrease of 15,400 inmates, followed by further decreases in 2010, 2011, and 2012. The correctional population decreased from 2009 to 2014, with fluctuations in the number of inmates in both jails and prisons. In 2012, the overall population decreased due to fewer inmates in prisons, while the number in jails increased. However, in 2013, the number of inmates in prisons increased, offset by a decrease in jails. The trend reversed in 2014, with a decrease in prison inmates offset by an increase in jail inmates. The number of prison inmates decreased from 2009 to 2014, offset by an increase in jail inmates. The rate of decrease in incarceration has slowed in recent years. This has implications for offender reentry as most inmates will eventually return to the community. The release of prisoners into the community is explored, including the various mechanisms and statistics involved. Ex-offenders can be released into the community through different mechanisms such as probation, parole, or unconditional release from correctional facilities. Offenders on probation must adhere to conditions and check in with probation officers, with violations leading to further criminal sanctions, including incarceration. Ex-offenders can be released into the community through probation or parole. While parole was abolished at the federal level in 1987, some federal offenders sentenced before that date are still eligible for parole. Parole conditions may include drug testing and supervision by a parole officer, with violations leading to return to prison. Different kinds of parole exist: discretionary and mandatory. Discretionary parole is determined by parole boards, while mandatory parole is based on statutory language. Figure 2 displays the number of offenders on probation or parole from 2000 to 2014, showing that the majority are on probation. The total number of people on community supervision, mainly probation, peaked in 2007 and has been declining since. The decline is driven by a decrease in the number of people on probation, while the number of people on parole has been increasing since 2007. This increase in parole may be due to inmates from the 1990s and early 2000s being released. The relationship between prison and parole populations is significant as offenders in prison typically commit more serious crimes. Offenders in prison typically commit more serious crimes than those in jail or on probation. Parolees often face challenges reintegrating into the community after a period of incarceration. Recidivism, which includes rearrest, reconviction, or reincarceration, is commonly measured among ex-offenders. Studies often consider technical violations of parole or probation in recidivism statistics. Some studies focus on reincarceration with a new prison sentence for a more accurate recidivism measure. Studies have debated the definition of recidivism, with some arguing that any contact with the criminal justice system should count, while others believe it should only include the commission of a new crime resulting in a new sentence. The definition used significantly impacts the reported rate of recidivism, making it a challenging subject to study. The researchers rely on state or national-level data sets to study recidivism, matching records from different states to make definitive statements. The FBI's database is often consulted, but it may contain omissions that affect study results. The Bureau of Justice Statistics conducted a comprehensive national-level study on recidivism of inmates released in 1994. The Bureau of Justice Statistics conducted a comprehensive national-level study on recidivism of inmates released in 1994. In 2005, a new report examined recidivism rates for 404,638 prisoners released in 30 states over five years. 76.6% of prisoners were rearrested within five years, with 43.4% rearrested within the first year. The study on recidivism rates for prisoners released in 1994 showed that 28.5% of those not arrested in the first year were arrested for the first time in the second year. Property offenders had the highest rearrest rate at 82.1%, followed by drug offenders at 76.9%, public order offenders at 73.6%, and violent offenders at 71.3%. Regardless of the offense, most released offenders were likely to be rearrested within five years. Most released offenders, regardless of their offense, were likely to be rearrested within one year of being released. The likelihood of rearrest decreased the longer prisoners had been out of prison. Prisoners with longer criminal histories were more likely to be rearrested within five years, with 86.5% of those with 10 or more prior arrests being rearrested. Different definitions of recidivism can affect measured rates, with broader definitions like arrest producing higher rates. The U.S. Sentencing Commission released a study on the recidivism of federal offenders released in 2005. Approximately half of offenders were rearrested within eight years, with one-third being reconvicted and one-quarter imprisoned. Different definitions of recidivism can impact measured rates. The U.S. Sentencing Commission found that approximately one-third of federal offenders were reconvicted, with a median time to first rearrest of 21 months. Compared to state offenders, federal offenders had lower recidivism rates, with 44.9% being rearrested within five years. The U.S. Sentencing Commission found that 55.4% of state offenders and 26.0% of federal offenders were reconvicted within five years. Additionally, 28.2% of state offenders and 20.7% of federal offenders were reincarcerated. Federal offenders were most commonly rearrested for assault, public order offenses, and drug trafficking. Firearms offenders had the highest rearrest rate at 68.3%. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) data shows high recidivism rates for various offenses, with larceny, all other offenses, and fraud being the most common. However, the accuracy of these rates is compromised due to potential underreporting from local police agencies and courts. Misinformation or identity fraud by offenders can also lead to inaccuracies in the data, impacting the reliability of recidivism statistics. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) data shows high recidivism rates for various offenses, with larceny, all other offenses, and fraud being the most common. However, there is debate on what outcome measures should be included in recidivism statistics, such as whether any contact with the criminal justice system should be considered or only new convictions or sentences. The length of the follow-up period also affects recidivism rates, with rates continuing to climb as the follow-up period increases. Caution should be taken when interpreting recidivism statistics due to these factors. When evaluating programs using recidivism statistics, it's crucial to understand the definition of recidivism. Different outcomes like new convictions, sentences, or parole violations can impact the assessment of a program's success. Recidivism may have varying interpretations, making it challenging to draw definitive conclusions. Despite being the best available data, caution is advised when relying solely on recidivism statistics for policy efficacy assessments. Offender reentry is a complex issue involving various social and governmental networks and programs. Policies and programs for prisoners can differ between states and communities, influenced by factors like funding availability. The majority of prisoners will eventually be released into the community, making it important to consider the nature of their contact with the criminal justice system post-release. The federal government supports offender reentry through grant funding opportunities, but various factors can complicate the process in communities, such as different types of sentences, release mechanisms, programs in prisons, supervision intensity, family and community support, social services availability, local economy status, and employment opportunities for offenders. It is essential to understand what constitutes offender reentry before discussing reentry programs. Offender reentry is seen as a natural process following incarceration, involving activities and programs to prepare ex-convicts to safely return to the community as law-abiding citizens. This broad definition encompasses all activities that may impact a prisoner's reentry into society. Offender reentry involves activities and programs to prepare ex-convicts for a safe return to the community. The definition of reentry has been narrowed to focus on correctional programs for transition to the community and treatment programs linked to community services post-release. Offender reentry programs focus on managing the transition from detention to the community. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of effective programs in this field, with a focus on identifying what works through rigorous research and meta-analyses. The \"what works\" paradigm has been adapted to offender reentry, aiming to identify effective programs through a scoring system. The \"what works\" literature focuses on evaluating programs to determine their effectiveness by analyzing if they control for variables, address measurement errors, and calculate statistical power to detect program effects on outcome measures. This approach aims to identify effective offender reentry programs through rigorous research and meta-analyses. The \"what works\" model categorizes studies based on core criteria like sample size and crime rate. It identifies effective, promising, and ineffective reentry programs. The What Works in Reentry Clearinghouse, developed by NRRC and UI, provides access to research on program effectiveness. Studies must meet specific criteria to be included in the Clearinghouse. The Clearinghouse evaluates programs for reentry outcomes for prisoners based on specific criteria like methodological rigor and sample size. Post-release employment is crucial for successful transition back into society. Employment is crucial for ex-offenders to successfully reintegrate into society. Studies show that employment can help prevent recidivism, but the effectiveness of employment programs in reducing recidivism is mixed. The Clearinghouse reviewed five studies on job training and post-release employment services for prisoners, with only two showing a decrease in recidivism. One program helped with post-incarceration employment but did not impact recidivism. Work release programs also had mixed results. Research on work release programs and prison industries showed mixed results on their impact on recidivism. While some studies found that work release programs helped reduce recidivism or improve post-release employment, others did not. However, participation in prison industries was associated with lower levels of recidivism. Substance abuse treatment, especially in a therapeutic community setting, was found to be effective in reducing recidivism and substance abuse among program participants. Studies on TC substance abuse treatment indicated a positive effect on participants. Substance abuse treatment programs have a positive effect on recidivism and substance abuse. Aftercare can also promote positive outcomes, but results may be influenced by selection bias. Non-TC substance abuse programs show evidence of reducing recidivism. Educational programs in correctional facilities, such as ABE, GED, college, and vocational training, help prepare prisoners for the workforce. Post-secondary education has a strong impact on reducing recidivism. Research on post-secondary education and ABE programs shows a strong effect on reducing recidivism. GED programs had no significant impact on recidivism. Limited studies make it challenging to draw definitive conclusions on program effectiveness. Vocational education programs had mixed findings, with program quality playing a crucial role. Mental health issues among prisoners often co-occur with substance abuse or physical health problems. Prison-based mental health treatment programs can help reduce recidivism. The effectiveness of prison-based mental health treatment programs in reducing recidivism is supported by research. Programs focusing on continuity of care and cognitive well-being have shown significant reductions in recidivism among participants. Curriculum-based treatment programs, such as those incorporating cognitive-behavioral approaches and problem-solving skills, have also been found to positively impact recidivism rates. Acquiring housing post-release from prison poses challenges due to factors like affordability and availability. Obtaining housing post-release is complicated by factors like scarcity, legal barriers, and discrimination. Research on halfway houses' impact on recidivism is mixed, with some studies showing no effect while others suggest a reduction in recidivism, dependent on the participant's risk level and program quality. The Clearinghouse review highlights a lack of high-quality research on reentry program effectiveness. While TC-based substance abuse treatment has more studies, ABE, GED, and halfway house programs have limited research. It's challenging to determine a program's effectiveness due to location and population variations. Just because a program works in one place doesn't guarantee success elsewhere. Various factors can impact a program's effectiveness in different locations. The effectiveness of reentry programs can vary based on location and population differences. Implementing a program properly is crucial for its success, regardless of its underlying model. Policymakers can benefit from knowing which programs have worked in the past when allocating resources. Effective programs, whether focusing on vocational training, substance abuse prevention, mental health services, or housing, share common attributes. Reentry programs for ex-offenders typically start during institutional placement but continue in the community, lasting at least six months. They focus on high-risk individuals using cognitive-behavioral treatment techniques. Research suggests engaging in reentry services within the first year after release is crucial to reduce recidivism. Federal programs help fund activities for ex-offender reintegration into local communities. The Department of Justice offers grants for offender reentry programs, authorized by the Second Chance Act of 2007. These grants support state and local reentry courts, drug treatment diversion programs, substance abuse programs for prisoners, career training, and mentoring programs. Some programs may no longer receive funding, while others may not provide funding every fiscal year. The Second Chance Act reauthorized offender reentry programs and grants for state and local governments. The Department of Justice allocates funding for various programs, including correction, community corrections, and drug treatment programs, through the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program. The JAG program, RSAT program, and other federal funding sources support offender reentry programs at the state and local levels. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) is a key legislation that aids in workforce development. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) authorizes workforce development programs for adults and youth, including services for ex-offenders such as skills training and job placement. Funding for activities under DOL's Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program is authorized through WIOA appropriations, supporting the ex-offender population in obtaining or maintaining employment. The program combines the Prisoner Reentry Initiative (PRI) and the Responsible Reintegration of Youthful Offenders (RRYO) to provide competitive grants to faith-based and community organizations assisting recently released prisoners in finding work. The Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program, funded in FY2000, supports projects for young offenders and at-risk youth. It combines PRI and RRYO into a single funding stream. DOL offers incentives for companies to hire ex-offenders through tax credits and bonding programs. ED provides programs for states to support offender reentry programs focusing on education. The Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education provides grants to states for basic education for out-of-school adults, including services for criminal offenders to reduce recidivism. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act allows states to use funds for individuals in state institutions. The Juvenile Justice Reentry Education Program aims to improve reentry outcomes for justice-involved youths. The Department of Housing and Urban Development administers programs for housing assistance. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) offers various programs for housing assistance to ex-offenders, including direct rental assistance and grants for affordable housing. Certain federal programs like Public Housing and Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers provide rental subsidies for low-income families. Ex-offenders are generally eligible for these programs unless local policies restrict their access. HUD encourages administrators to allow ex-offenders to rejoin their families and communities through housing assistance programs. HUD's formula grant programs, like HOME Investment Partnerships and Community Development Block Grant, can be used by states and localities to develop affordable housing and provide housing-related supports. There are no federal restrictions on using these funds for ex-offenders. Homeless assistance programs, such as Homeless Assistance Grants and Emergency Solutions Grants, can also be utilized to meet the needs of ex-offenders, with local communities determining their specific use. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Agency (SAMHSA) supports offender reentry through its Offender Reentry Program (ORP), providing funding for substance abuse treatment and reentry services for adult offenders returning to their communities after incarceration. Grantees can use funding for post-release services and some services while inmates are incarcerated. The DOJ has established an interagency Reentry Council to coordinate federal reentry efforts and promote effective policies. The council aims to enhance information sharing, funding opportunities, and coordination among state and local agencies, as well as stakeholders in the offender reentry field. It includes representatives from various federal agencies to improve community safety, support successful reintegration of individuals returning from prison, and reduce incarceration costs. The interagency Reentry Council, established by the DOJ, includes representatives from various federal agencies to coordinate reentry efforts, promote effective policies, and support successful reintegration of individuals returning from prison. This council aims to reduce incarceration costs and enhance community safety by providing treatments and services to ex-offenders to reduce recidivism. Policymakers focus on funding programs to reduce recidivism, but defining recidivism is complex. A national study found that within five years of release, three-quarters of ex-offenders had legal contact, with half back in prison for new convictions or violations. Debate exists on whether technical violations should count as recidivism. While reducing recidivism is crucial, programs can also be evaluated based on other outcome measures. The best available research shows that programs focusing on vocational training, substance abuse prevention, mental health services, and housing can help ex-offenders reconnect with their communities and lower recidivism. Successful programs are intensive, start during institutional placement, and target high-risk offenders. However, a lack of rigorous research makes it challenging to determine the most effective programs. Policymakers may need to assess whether current federal grant programs are sufficient or if new programs should be created. The need for more regular national-level recidivism data, better coordination of federal programs for ex-offenders, increased evaluations of reentry programs, and funding for Second Chance Act programs are key considerations for policymakers."
