    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Paycheck Fairness Act\" and references amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. The Congress finds that women earn significantly lower pay than men for equal work, leading to wage depression for working families and hindering the optimal use of labor resources. The Congress finds that unequal pay for women hinders labor resources, burdens commerce, leads to unfair competition, and may violate workers' rights based on sex. Artificial barriers to wage discrimination based on sex persist despite laws like the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Removing these barriers would benefit the economy, reduce women's reliance on public assistance, promote family stability, and address past discrimination effects. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 aims to address past discrimination effects and ensure equal protection for workers based on sex in the private sector. Increased information and effective remedies will help women enforce their rights to equal pay for equal work. Certain employers have made strides in eradicating unfair pay disparities in the workplace, and their achievements should be recognized. SEC. 3. ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT OF EQUAL PAY REQUIREMENTS.
