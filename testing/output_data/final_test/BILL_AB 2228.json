    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature recognizes the importance of preventing blight in homes, neighborhoods, and public areas to maintain community quality of life and safety. Establishing standards and educational requirements for Certified Code Enforcement Officers helps local agencies select qualified individuals to enforce laws and codes, ensuring well-ordered communities. Public officers performing code enforcement functions require a unique skill set not typically found in traditional vocational offerings. The Legislature aims to protect human safety, property values, reduce crime, and regulate training for code enforcement officers to maintain community quality of life. Certified Code Enforcement Officers play a crucial role in enforcing laws and codes to ensure well-ordered communities. The Legislature intends for compliance with the measure to be voluntary, creating a program for Certified Code Enforcement Officers to meet education, training, and experience requirements. The goal is to establish a title for these officers to standardize and regulate their role in local agencies. The Code Enforcement Officer Standards Act establishes the California Association of Code Enforcement Officers and defines terms like \"Certified Code Enforcement Officer\" and \"Code enforcement officer.\" The board develops and maintains standards for CCEOs, including education, training, and certification. CCEOs do not have the power of arrest unless authorized by local regulations. They do not have access to criminal history information, but employees may access it with compelling need. Designation as a CCEO is not allowed if disqualified under specified criteria. Designation as a CCEO is not allowed if disqualified under specified criteria in Section 1029 of the Government Code. The board reviews applications from cities, counties, and educational institutions seeking to provide education for Certified Code Enforcement Officers (CCEOs). Approved applications demonstrating equivalent standards qualify as program providers, subject to ongoing review. Program providers must renew their application every 36 months to maintain approval. Successful completion allows individuals to become CCEOs. Approved program providers must renew their application every 36 months to maintain approval. Successful completion grants individuals CCEO status under the board's administrative rules. The board prioritizes the development of code enforcement officer professional standards and educational offerings for increased competence and ethical behavior. This takes precedence over other interests in licensing, certification, and disciplinary functions. The board's administrative rules establish training, qualifications, and experience requirements for the CCEO designation, covering areas such as land use laws, health codes, environmental regulations, and community engagement. Additional certifications may be designated to support the board's mission. The CCEO must hold a valid certificate issued by the CACEO, be a member in good standing, and comply with ongoing education and registration requirements. The board publishes a list of CCEOs on its website with details such as disciplinary status, active/inactive status, expiration date, and business address. Failure to maintain continuing education requirements will cause certification status to lapse, subject to redemption as per board rules. Lapsed certification will automatically convert to inactive CCEO status unless redeemed. The board annually sets fees related to administering the chapter, published on the CACEO website. The board maintains a register of registration applications. The applicant's information, employer details, application date, education/experience qualifications, board's action, certificate serial number, and other required information are needed for registration as a Certified Code Enforcement Officer in the state. Holding oneself out as a CCEO without a registration certificate is prohibited. The board will establish a process for reviewing applicants with certification from other agencies to potentially become a Certified Code Enforcement Officer (CCEO) in the state. Denials will come with written justifications and required steps for applicants. Recognition fees will be determined as outlined in Section 26212. The board will adopt administrative rules to investigate and process information regarding applicants or licensees providing false or incomplete information. Procedures will be in place to impose discipline or revoke certification for cause, with fair notice and hearing opportunities provided to the applicant or registrant. The board will issue orders after hearings based on factual findings that may lead to disciplinary actions against registrations or certifications. These orders are final and can be appealed according to specific procedures. This chapter does not conflict with certification and education requirements for construction inspectors, plans examiners, and building officials."
