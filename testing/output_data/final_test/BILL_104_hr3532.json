The Act, known as the \"Federal Employment Reduction Assistance Act of 1996,\" defines terms such as \"agency\" and \"employee\" for the purpose of the Act. An agency refers to an Executive agency, excluding specific entities like the Department of Defense. An employee is defined as someone employed by an agency for at least 12 months under an appointment without time limitation. The \"Federal Employment Reduction Assistance Act of 1996\" defines eligibility criteria for assistance, including employees eligible for disability retirement, those receiving notice of involuntary separation, and those completing additional service under the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994. Employees eligible for a voluntary separation incentive payment under the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 include those on transfer to another organization, with statutory reemployment rights, and those who have not repaid a previous incentive payment. SEC. 3. AGENCY PLANS; APPROVAL. The head of an agency may submit a plan to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget for voluntary separation incentives to reduce the number of employees for efficiency or budgetary reasons. The plan must detail the intended employment reductions and how they will enhance operations or meet budget goals, including the proposed time period and coverage for offering incentives to agency employees based on components or occupations. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget reviews and approves agency plans for voluntary separation incentives, making modifications as needed regarding the time period and coverage of incentives based on specified factors. SEC. 4. VOLUNTARY SEPARATION INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. Employees who voluntarily separate from their agency can receive a lump sum payment as a voluntary separation incentive. The payment amount is determined by the employee's entitlement under section 5595(c) of title 5, United States Code. Employees who voluntarily separate from their agency can receive a lump sum payment based on their entitlement under section 5595(c) of title 5, United States Code. The payment amount varies depending on the fiscal year of separation, ranging from $25,000 in fiscal year 1996 or 1997 to $10,000 in fiscal year 2000. This payment is not considered for other government benefits and does not affect the amount of severance pay an employee may receive. The severance pay an employee may receive is based on section 5595 of title 5, United States Code, and is paid from available appropriations or funds. SEC. 5. EFFECT OF SUBSEQUENT EMPLOYMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT. An individual who receives a voluntary separation incentive payment must repay the full amount if they accept employment with the US government within 5 years. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management can waive repayment if the individual has unique abilities and is the only qualified applicant for the position. If employment with the US government is in the legislative branch, the head of the entity may waive repayment if the individual has unique abilities. In the judicial branch, the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts may waive repayment. \"Employment\" includes any length or type of appointment, excluding uncompensated work or personal services contracts. SEC. 6. ADDITIONAL AGENCY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE RETIREMENT FUND. An agency must remit 15 percent of the final basic pay of employees who received a voluntary separation incentive to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. \"Final basic pay\" refers to the total basic pay for a year of service based on the employee's final rate of pay. SEC. 7. REDUCTION OF AGENCY EMPLOYMENT LEVELS. (a) Full-time equivalent employment in each agency will be reduced by one for each employee who receives a voluntary separation incentive payment. The Office of Management and Budget will monitor agencies to ensure compliance. The President will prevent functions with over 10 employees from being converted to contracts unless it benefits the Government. The President can waive subsections (a) and (c) of this section in cases of war, national emergency, or extraordinary emergencies threatening life, health, safety, property, or the environment. SEC. 8. REPORTS. Each agency approved for voluntary separation incentives must submit quarterly reports to the Office of Personnel Management, including the number of employees receiving incentives, average amount paid, and employee grade. The Office of Personnel Management must submit an annual report to Congress on the incentives provided in the previous fiscal year. The annual report to Congress on voluntary separation incentives must include the number of employees who received incentives, the average amount of incentives, and the average grade or pay level of the employees. It should also detail the number of waivers granted for repayment of incentives, including reasons for the waivers and the positions filled by employees who received waivers. The Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 is amended to change the deadline for reporting voluntary separation incentives from December 31st to March 31st. The report must include the number of employees who received incentives, the average amount, and the average grade or pay level. It should also cover the number of waivers granted for repayment of incentives and the positions filled by employees who received waivers.
