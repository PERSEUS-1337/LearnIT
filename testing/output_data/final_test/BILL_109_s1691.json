The Act \"Home School Non-Discrimination Act of 2005\" outlines key findings affirming parents' right to direct their children's education, highlighting the effectiveness of home education in academic success and socialization skills. Young people educated at home are proving to be competent citizens in postsecondary education and the workplace, contributing positively to education in the United States. Several laws regarding private home education need clarification on how they treat students educated at home according to State law, as the United States Constitution prohibits Federal control of homeschooling. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS: Congress recognizes private home education as a positive contribution to the United States and supports parents who choose this alternative education within the framework of the Constitution.\n\nSEC. 4. CLARIFICATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION ACT: Amendments clarify institutional and student eligibility under the Higher Education Act of 1965, ensuring compliance with secondary education standards. SEC. 5. CLARIFICATION OF ABSENCE OF CONSENT FOR INITIAL EVALUATION UNDER THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT.

The amendment clarifies that expenses for students privately educated at home under State law can be covered by a Coverdell Education Savings Account. This applies to home schools providing elementary or secondary education recognized as such under State law. Effective for taxable years after the enactment of the Act. Clarification of Section 444 of the General Education Provisions Act regarding publicly held records of students privately educated at home under State law. Section 444 of the General Education Provisions Act is amended to specify that for students in non-public education, including those educated at home or in private schools according to State law, directory information cannot be released without parental consent.

SEC. 8 amends the Higher Education Act to clarify eligibility for the Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship Program for students privately educated at home under State law. SEC. 9 clarifies the Fair Labor Standards Act as applied to these students.

Additionally, there is a provision for recruitment and enlistment of home-schooled students in the Armed Forces. The policy for recruitment and enlistment of home-schooled students in the Armed Forces must be prescribed by the Secretary concerned, with uniformity across all branches ensured by the Secretary of Defense. The policy should include identifying home-schooled graduates for recruitment, and providing Tier I status with no practical limit. Home-schooled graduates are exempt from the requirement of a secondary school diploma for enlistment in the Armed Forces. To be identified as a home-schooled graduate, they must score 50 or above on the Armed Forces Qualification Test and provide a signed notice of intent form that complies with state laws. Home-schooled graduates seeking to enlist in the Armed Forces must provide a home school certificate or diploma from a parent, guardian, or national curriculum provider.
