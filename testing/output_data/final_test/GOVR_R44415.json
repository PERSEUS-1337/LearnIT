    "content": "The Budget Control Act (BCA), signed into law in 2011, established limits on federal spending and mechanisms to adjust those limits for special priorities. One such mechanism, the disaster relief allowable adjustment, changed the approach to funding disaster relief efforts. This report examines the adjustment's performance over the first five years and discusses the future of disaster relief under the BCA for the next five years and beyond. The Budget Control Act (BCA) established limits on federal spending and introduced the disaster relief allowable adjustment. This adjustment allows for a limited amount of appropriations for disaster relief each year by adjusting the BCA's discretionary spending limits based on a 10-year rolling average of disaster relief appropriations. Unused adjustments can be carried over to the next fiscal year but expire if not used. The future of disaster relief under the BCA for the next five years and beyond relies on OMB calculations of past appropriations. The OMB report on disaster spending calculates adjustments based on a 10-year average of disaster relief appropriations, excluding the highest and lowest years. This includes funding for activities related to major disasters declared by the President. The calculation does not reflect total appropriations for disaster response, only funds specified for disaster relief. The OMB interprets the BCA as using annual congressional disaster relief designations for calculating allowable adjustments for disaster relief spending. Some major disaster costs are absorbed by federal agencies within their budgets. Congress designates costs of major disasters as either \"disaster relief\" or emergency funding. The OMB calculates disaster relief amounts from FY2001 to FY2011 and Congress designates disaster relief from FY2012 to FY2016. In FY2014, unused adjustment funds were carried over to FY2015. The calculation for FY2016 is based on ten years of disaster relief data from FY2006 to FY2015. The disaster relief provided in FY2005 and FY2006, largely due to hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, is aging out of the allowable adjustment calculations. Starting in FY2017, FY2008 will be excluded from the calculation as the high year. This will impact the allowable adjustment calculations. In FY2011, the allowable adjustment calculation is based on congressional designations of appropriations for disaster relief, shifting away from OMB's annual totals. The adjustment has primarily been used for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund but has also funded other departments. In FY2011, the allowable adjustment calculation is based on congressional designations of appropriations for disaster relief, shifting away from OMB's annual totals. The adjustment has primarily been used for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund but has also funded other departments. Funding in annual appropriations designated as disaster relief across various agencies is the broadest use of the designation since FY2012. Congress may consider changes to the disaster relief allowable adjustment as limitations on discretionary spending under the BCA expire in FY2021. Potential future scenarios for the size of the allowable adjustment can be assessed using OMB's methodology, with three models presented: Maximum Usage Scenario.

Congress may consider changes to the disaster relief allowable adjustment as limitations on discretionary spending under the BCA expire in FY2021. Potential future scenarios for the size of the allowable adjustment can be assessed using OMB's methodology, with three models presented: Maximum Usage Scenario. The Medium and Minimum Usage Scenarios are based on projections of DRF spending on major disasters, with appropriations designated accordingly. The allowable adjustment for disaster relief spending is projected to decline to $6.8 billion before increasing to nearly $7.5 billion in 2021. FEMA's projection from November 2015 anticipates the usage of the Disaster Relief Fund over the next five fiscal years, including estimates for existing disasters and future non-catastrophic major disasters. The projection for disaster relief spending shows a decline to $6.8 billion before increasing to nearly $7.5 billion in 2021. FEMA did not make annual projections due to the unpredictable nature of disasters. The projection for the total cost of major disasters over five years is based on dividing the total spending evenly among FY2018-FY2021. The DRF projection is used as a surrogate for all disaster relief spending in this scenario. The allowable adjustment declines through FY2018 but rebounds in FY2019 to almost $9.7 billion due to carryover effects. The projected future scenario for the allowable adjustment, based on a FEMA projection from November 2015, shows a decline in funding to just above $8.4 billion in FY2021. This projection serves as a lower bound of possible usage of the allowable adjustment, with the DRF projection being used as a surrogate for all disaster relief spending. The carryover from FY2017 has a significant impact on boosting the allowable adjustment in FY2018. The allowable adjustment for disaster relief funding is projected to decline in the future, with lower spending levels leading to a decrease in the projected allowable adjustment to around $9.6 billion in FY2021. The impact of carryover from previous years plays a significant role in boosting the allowable adjustment in the near term. The allowable adjustment for disaster relief funding is projected to decline in the future, with lower spending levels leading to a decrease in the projected allowable adjustment. The calculation now relies more on congressional designations of disaster relief appropriations rather than OMB's historical analysis. In FY2013, Congress provided $41.6 billion in supplemental disaster assistance after Hurricane Sandy, which was not included in the annual disaster relief calculation. The FY2013 supplemental disaster assistance provided after Hurricane Sandy was not included in the annual disaster relief total, leading to a lower projected allowable adjustment for disaster relief funding in the future. If OMB's methodology had been used, the funding would have been included, resulting in a significantly higher allowable adjustment for FY2014-FY2016. Including Sandy-related supplemental disaster assistance as emergency spending in the calculation extends the period for which years with over $20 billion in disaster relief are considered. Including Sandy-related supplemental disaster assistance in future allowable adjustment calculations would require a change in law. Options include retroactively designating the Hurricane Sandy funding as disaster spending or modifying how OMB calculates the adjustment. FY2013 becomes the new \"high year,\" making FY2005 disaster relief eligible for inclusion in the average for the first time and keeping FY2006 and FY2008 included in the calculation for more years than they would have otherwise. The allowable adjustment for disaster relief funding is impacted by higher spending over multiple years, such as the Gulf Coast hurricanes. The exclusion of high spending years from the calculation results in a significant reduction in the modified 10-year average, leading to increased funding for the Disaster Relief Fund. The Budget Control Act (BCA) increased funding for the Disaster Relief Fund through annual appropriations, removing the need for supplemental funding for major disasters. This change incentivized requesting and appropriating more budget authority for disaster relief on an annual basis. The allowable adjustment has mainly been used to fund the DRF in recent years. The FY2015 and FY2016 appropriations bills funded disaster accounts using the disaster relief designation, allowing federal agencies to respond to disasters without waiting for emergency funding. However, this may impact programs relying on supplemental appropriations. Hurricane Sandy was adequately funded through a $6.4 billion supplemental appropriation in FY2012 and a continuing resolution in FY2013. The Administration had immediate resources available for Hurricane Sandy response due to funding in FY2012 and FY2013. This allowed for a deliberate response, with supplemental appropriations requested six weeks after the storm. Other programs had to rely on transfers or wait for supplemental appropriations. According to OMB, appropriations must be designated by Congress as disaster relief to be included in the calculation of the 10-year rolling average for adjustments under the Stafford Act. Not all costs of major disasters receive the disaster relief designation, leading to the majority of disaster relief being designated as emergency appropriations. The definition of disaster relief in the BCA is limiting as it excludes some forms of federal disaster assistance by focusing on major disaster declarations. Emergency declarations and Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAG) are not included in the 10-year average of disaster relief spending funded through the DRF. Emergency declarations provide federal assistance for essential services during emergencies, while FMAGs offer assistance for fire control and mitigation. Spending levels for these are lower than major disaster declarations, with $155.60 billion spent on major disasters from FY1992-FY2015, averaging $6.48 billion per year. Some argue that emergency declarations and Fire Management Assistance Grants should be included in federal disaster relief calculations for a more precise assessment. Other programs, such as those under separate authorities like the Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Forest Service, could also be considered for inclusion. The U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Department of the Interior provide federal disaster assistance for wildfires, but these are not included in the annual calculation of allowable adjustments due to their lack of connection to a major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act. Including all instances of federal disaster relief in the calculation would require more comprehensive reporting, allowing for better congressional oversight and policy innovation. However, obtaining a complete financial picture of federal disaster assistance has historically been challenging. Disaster assistance is challenging due to difficulties in identifying federal entities providing aid, lack of transparency in reporting funding levels, and varying disaster definitions. Congress requires FEMA to report on the Disaster Relief Fund, but this requirement is not extended to other agencies, leading to limited data on federal funding for emergencies and disasters. Disaster definitions vary by statute, regulation, and program, leading to differing opinions on combining them for accurate federal expenditure measurement. Some argue this broadens the scope too much, including items like emergency preparedness and mitigation efforts, livestock losses, economic disasters, and search and rescue missions. There is a misconception that the allowable adjustment for disaster relief constrains Congress's spending on disaster assistance, which is not the case. House Republicans reformed the disaster funding process to have a separate dedicated fund based on historical disaster needs, with provisions for exceeding capacity. The Budget Control Act (BCA) sets constraints on adjusting discretionary spending limits for designated disaster relief. Despite limitations, emergency funds can be provided by Congress and the president for unforeseen events like disasters. After Hurricane Sandy, supplemental appropriations were mainly covered by emergency designations. Legislation in the 114th Congress addressed adjustments for disasters under the BCA. Legislation in the 114th Congress proposed changes to disaster spending under the Budget Control Act. One approach involved amending the BCA directly, while another used a \"work-around\" by amending the Stafford Act to create new definitions and spending authorities for disaster relief. This would allow federal agencies to request declarations for disaster impacts on federal lands and fund additional disaster response activities through the Disaster Relief Fund. The projected allowable adjustment for disaster relief funding may settle around $7.5-$9.5 billion, with potential changes based on future high-expense incidents. H.R. 2647 addresses funding for disaster-related costs in federal wildfire efforts, proposing modifications to the Stafford Act to provide a more sustainable funding avenue. The discretionary spending limits under the Budget Control Act may expire after FY2021, potentially affecting wildfire funding for federal agencies and supplemental disaster relief requests. Congress may need to decide on maintaining or modifying the allowable adjustment for disaster relief in the budget process. Various options, such as emergency spending or specific funding mechanisms, could be considered for funding outside discretionary spending levels.

Various options, such as emergency spending or specific funding mechanisms, could be considered for funding outside discretionary spending levels. One option for changing how the federal government pays for disaster relief is shifting costs to states and localities or providing borrowing authority to responding agencies. These changes would require legislative actions outside the budget process to implement."
