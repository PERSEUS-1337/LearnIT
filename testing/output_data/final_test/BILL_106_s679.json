On August 17, 1998, two US embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, were bombed by individuals linked to Osama bin Laden. The attacks killed 220 people, including 12 Americans, and injured over 4,000. Despite the devastation, embassy staff showed bravery by rescuing victims and restoring operations swiftly. Following the bombings linked to Osama bin Laden in 1998, threats were made against US diplomatic facilities. A review board chaired by Admiral William J. Crowe highlighted inadequate security measures. The United States has failed to allocate sufficient resources for security against terrorist attacks, leading to a lack of preventive measures. The Crowe panel identified institutional failures in recognizing threats posed by transnational terrorism and vehicular bombs. Responsibility for securing adequate resources is shared among various government entities, including Congress. Addressing vulnerabilities identified in the Crowe report is crucial for sustained security. Without addressing vulnerabilities identified in the Crowe report in a sustained and financially realistic manner, US diplomatic facilities remain at risk from terrorist attacks. The US must minimize risks for its employees in foreign service positions. SEC. 3. UNITED STATES DIPLOMATIC FACILITY DEFINED. The term \"United States diplomatic facility\" includes any embassy, chancery, legation, consulate, or office building used by a US diplomatic mission or consular post. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. The Secretary of State can use funds from the \"Embassy Construction and Security\" account for constructing or upgrading US diplomatic facilities to meet security requirements. Certification to Congress is required before any funds are used, ensuring compliance with security standards. Authorization of Appropriations under \"Embassy Construction and Security\" allows for $600,000,000 to be appropriated annually from 2000 to 2004 to the Department of State. The funds remain available until expended. SEC. 5. OBLIGATION OF FUNDS. The Secretary of State must submit a classified report to Congress identifying vulnerable US diplomatic facilities and prioritize rebuilding efforts for the top three tiers. Advanced notification to congressional committees is required before using funds for embassy construction and security. The Secretary of State must inform Congress of the intent to obligate or reprogram funds, as required by the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956. SEC. 6. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR UNITED STATES DIPLOMATIC FACILITIES. Security requirements for United States diplomatic facilities include threat assessments for large vehicular bombs and transnational terrorism in the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) of each mission. The \"Composite Threat List\" must address acts of international terrorism against diplomatic facilities based on various criteria. Site selection for new facilities is also a key consideration. Site selection for new United States diplomatic facilities abroad requires all agencies (except military installations) to be located on the same compound. The Secretary of State and relevant agency head can waive this requirement if security permits, with Congress notification. Newly constructed or acquired facilities must adhere to perimeter distance regulations. Each new US diplomatic facility must be at least 100 feet from the property perimeter. Crisis management training is required for State Department personnel to respond quickly to mass casualty incidents. Training is also provided to staff at diplomatic facilities abroad. The Foreign Emergency Support Team (FEST) of the Department of State receives support for training exercises, personnel deployment, medical relief, public affairs, engineering, and building safety. Additional support is provided for post-crisis environments with mass casualties and physical damage. The Secretary of State establishes rapid response procedures through a memorandum of understanding. The Secretary of State establishes rapid response procedures for mobilization of personnel and equipment in times of emergency at United States diplomatic facilities. All diplomatic missions must store emergency equipment and records off-site. The Secretary of State will review and revise security requirements to ensure compliance with the new standards. SEC. 7. CLOSURE OF VULNERABLE POSTS. The Secretary of State will review the findings of the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel and submit a report to Congress by January 1, 2000. The report will determine if any US diplomatic facility should be closed due to high vulnerability to terrorist attacks and if adequate security enhancements cannot be provided. Plans to provide secure premises for the US diplomatic mission will also be identified. The Secretary of State will review the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel's findings and submit a report to Congress by January 1, 2000. The report will assess the need to close vulnerable US diplomatic facilities and identify plans for secure premises for the US diplomatic mission, whether permanent or temporary. SEC. 8. The Secretary of State must report to Congress by January 1, 2000, on the role and function of each US diplomatic facility through 2010. The report will cover potential personnel and equipment reductions, cost-benefit analysis of maintaining secure facilities, reliance on regional facilities, and necessary upgrades. The State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 is amended to include a new section called \"SEC. 36A. THE OVERSEAS SERVICE STAR.\" The President, with the Secretary's recommendation, may award an overseas service star to Foreign Service or civilian employees injured while on official duty abroad after August 1, 1998. This includes injuries from terrorist acts, civil unrest, or criminal activities. The Secretary will identify and select eligible persons for an overseas service star, which may be awarded posthumously. The design of the award will be determined by the Secretary, and funding for expenses related to the award may come from appropriations. The overseas service star can be awarded to personnel of the US Government who incurred a wound, injury, or illness while employed. Funding for the award may come from appropriations, but no cash payments are allowed."
