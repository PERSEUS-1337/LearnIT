    "content": "The Act titled \"Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 2003\" provides entitlement to additional weeks of temporary extended unemployment compensation. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 2003 allows for an increase in entitlement to additional weeks of temporary extended unemployment compensation, with amendments to percentages and times specified in the original legislation. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 2003 is amended to extend the transition limitation to December 31, 2003, and make conforming amendments for augmented benefits. The Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002 is amended to increase benefits to 7 times the individual's average weekly benefit amount. The effective date for these amendments is for weeks of unemployment beginning on or after the date of enactment of this Act. Under the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002, the Secretary of Labor will consider amounts deposited into an individual's account as TEUC-X amounts to be the same as TEUC amounts. This applies to individuals who were eligible for temporary extended unemployment compensation before the enactment of this Act. Under the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002, individuals who exhausted their rights to compensation before the enactment of the Act are eligible for additional weeks of temporary extended unemployment compensation. This applies to current beneficiaries who were receiving temporary extended unemployment compensation before the Act was enacted. Under the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002, individuals who exhausted their rights to compensation before the enactment of the Act are eligible for temporary extended unemployment compensation for weeks after the Act's enactment. Any redetermination of eligibility for augmented amounts for individuals must be made prior to the date of enactment. Individuals in an extended benefit period under the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002 are eligible for augmented amounts if they exhausted their benefits before the Act's enactment. The determination for eligibility must be made prior to the date of enactment. The determination of eligibility for augmented benefits under the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002 is based on the date of enactment for some individuals and when their account is exhausted for others."
