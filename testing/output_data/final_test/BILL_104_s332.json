The findings by Congress highlight the excessive exposure of children to violence on television, with statistics showing high numbers of murders and acts of violence witnessed by American youth. Surveys indicate a widespread belief among the public that there is too much violence on TV and that it contributes to real-life violence. The media's portrayal of violence on television has been linked to an increase in aggressive behavior among children, as highlighted by various studies and reports. Recommendations have been made for producers to exercise greater restraint in creating programming for children. Parents should have the technology to block violent or objectionable TV content. Technology already exists for TV receivers to allow this. Establishment of Television Violence Rating Code and Requirement for Manufacture of TVs that Block Programs. This involves amending the Communications Act of 1934 to prescribe rules for rating violence in TV programming and for manufacturing TVs that can block violent content. SEC. 4 amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require TVs manufactured or imported in the US with screens 13 inches or larger to have circuitry enabling viewers to block channels, programs, and time slots, as well as block all programs with a common rating. SEC. 5 addresses the shipping or importing of these TVs. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to regulate the shipping, manufacturing, and importing of TVs with blocking technology. The rules require performance standards for blocking technology and apply to carriers transporting such apparatus without trading it. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to regulate TVs with blocking technology, ensuring they can receive rating signals conforming to Commission specifications. The Commission will take action to maintain blocking service as new video technology emerges. Section 330(d) is amended to include additional sections for compliance. SEC. 6. ELIMINATION OF VIOLENT PROGRAMMING ON TELEVISION DURING CERTAIN HOURS. Amendment to the Children's Television Act of 1990 prohibits violent programming on TV. The Commission must initiate a rule-making proceeding within 30 days to ban violent programming on commercial television and public telecommunications entities from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. This includes cable operators and excludes news-related content. The Commission must initiate a rule-making proceeding within 30 days to ban violent programming on commercial television and public telecommunications entities from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., including cable operators but excluding news-related content. The term \"violent programming\" is defined in section 397(12) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 397(12)). SEC. 7. BROADCAST ON TELEVISION AND CABLE OF EDUCATIONAL AND INFORMATIONAL PROGRAMMING FOR CHILDREN. In granting licenses for television broadcasting stations and cable services, the Commission must ensure compliance with standards for children's programming and serve the educational and informational needs of children. The Children's Television Act of 1990 requires cable operators to comply with standards for children's programming and serve the educational and informational needs of children in order to be awarded a franchise."
