    "content": "Inspired by the success of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in image domains, a novel hierarchical architecture for learning characteristic topological features from a single arbitrary input graph via GANs is introduced. The architecture, consisting of multiple GANs, preserves both local and global topological features and automatically partitions the input graph into representative stages for feature learning. Experiments demonstrate that this method produces subgraphs retaining a wide range of topological features, even in early reconstruction stages. The importance of identifying key structures in graph data for understanding social network formation and predicting future behavior is highlighted. Various graph analysis methods exist for analyzing network topology at different levels, influenced by network structure. Modularity-based community detection is effective for separate clusters, while edge-based methods are suited for dense networks. Different sampling methods like Random Walk and Forrest Fire are suitable for sampling paths in graphs. When it comes to graph generation, Watts-Strogatz (WS) and Barabsi-Albert (BA) graph models can simulate different network features. Real-world networks pose challenges for traditional graph analysis methods due to their multiple topological features and limited instances. Identifying key topological properties, such as local subgraph structures and global degree distribution, is crucial. GTI divides graphs into hierarchical layers to analyze local and global topological features using separate GANs for each layer. This approach allows GTI to automatically capture various topological features and reproduce the original graph through a series of reconstruction stages. The GTI method uses hierarchical layers and separate GANs to capture topological features and reconstruct the original graph through multiple stages. The focus is on quickly learning important features and comparing to graph sampling methods. The workflow includes GAN, Sum-up, and Stage Identification modules. The GTI method utilizes hierarchical layers and separate GANs to detect the hierarchical structure of the original graph and reconstruct it through multiple stages. The process involves modules such as Hierarchical Identification, Layer Partition, and Layer GAN to partition layers into subgraphs and learn features separately. The GTI method uses separate GANs to learn features for each layer of the graph. The Layer Regenerate Module regenerates subgraphs, while the All Layer Sum-up Module combines reconstructed layers and edges between subgraphs. The \"weight\" of each edge in the Regenerate Module represents its importance to the reconstruction stages of the original graph. The Stage Identification Module analyzes the weighted adjacency matrix of the Sum-up Module to extract stages for the graph reconstruction process. The generator is a deconvolutional neural network, while the discriminator is a CNN used to distinguish between real and generated adjacency matrices. BN (batch normalization) is utilized instead of max pooling for better feature map handling. In the context of graph reconstruction, max pooling selects the maximum value in the feature map, while BN synthesizes all available information. LR represents the leaky ReLU activation function, with k as the subgraph size and FC as the fully connected layer length. The stride for convolutional/deconvolutional layers is set to 2, and the same loss function and optimization strategy as DCGAN are adopted. The reconstructed adjacency matrix G combines input from all layers, while Gi represents the matrix for each layer. E denotes inter-subgraph edges identified by the Louvain method, and b is a bias term. To reconstruct the entire graph, hierarchical layers are summed along with E and bias term b. Equation 2 is used as the loss function to obtain weights and bias for each layer. These weights help divide the network into stages based on edge contributions. A \"cut-value\" concept is introduced to convert weights into a binary adjacency matrix. The concept of \"cut-value\" is introduced to convert weights into a binary adjacency matrix in order to reconstruct the original graph based on edge importance. Different reconstruction stages are defined based on unique weights, with the most important edges having the highest weight. Each stage includes edges with weights greater than or equal to the corresponding weight of that stage, providing insight on reconstructing the original graph. Synthetic and real networks are used to demonstrate that each stage preserves identifiable topological features during the reconstruction process. The importance of deep learning and graph topology analysis has led to a focus on using deep learning for graph analysis. Various supervised and semi-supervised learning methods, particularly CNNs, have shown promising results compared to traditional graph analysis methods. The theory and application of GANs have expanded greatly since their introduction. The theory and application of GANs have expanded greatly since their introduction. GANs have been used in various applications such as artwork synthesis, text classification, image-to-image translation, imitation of driver behavior, and identification of cancers. The GTI method leverages GANs for graph topology analysis, capturing both local and global topological features in an unsupervised manner. This method is the first of its kind and was tested on a Mac Book Pro with an Intel Core i7 2.5GHz processor and 16GB of 1600MHz RAM. The GTI method utilizes GANs for graph topology analysis, demonstrating scalability potential for larger systems. It uses synthetic datasets to showcase retention of specific properties and also applies the method to real-world datasets of varying sizes. The study utilizes synthetic graphs generated from various graph models like ER, BA, WS, and Kronecker, as well as real-world datasets from Stanford Network Analysis Project including Facebook, wiki-Vote, and P2P-Gnutella networks. The Facebook dataset consists of anonymized \"friends lists\" with node features, circles, and ego networks. GTI retains important local topological structure during each reconstruction stage using examples like Wiki-vote, P2P-Gnutella, and RoadNet networks. The reconstruction process of a BA network is demonstrated, showing denser networks with each additional stage. The reconstruction stages of RoadNet network show decreasing edge percentages, indicating fewer super hubs due to geographical constraints. The subgraphs retain key features like star structures and dominant cycle structures during reconstruction. The modularity of each stage in the original graph decreases linearly from 0.98 to 0.92, indicating GTI's focus on dense connections within local neighborhoods. GTI preserves local topological features and also examines degree distribution and cluster coefficients as global topological features. The degree distributions and cluster coefficient distributions of early stages in the datasets from TAB0 are similar to the original graphs, becoming more accurate as reconstruction progresses. GTI quickly learns the Poisson-like shape in degree distribution and the \"peak-like\" shape in the cluster coefficient distribution, even for the ER network. GTI quickly learns the cluster coefficient distribution shape in the ER model, which has no true underlying structure. Comparing GTI with other graph sampling algorithms, it generates representative subgraphs of the original graph. Performance is evaluated on BA and Facebook datasets, showing GTI's ability to retain topological structures. GTI outperforms other graph sampling methods in retaining topological features in subgraphs from BA and Facebook networks. It shows superior performance in preserving structure compared to Random Walk and Random Jump, especially in the presence of super hubs. The Facebook dataset, with dense clusters and sparse inter-cluster connections, further highlights GTI's effectiveness. The paper leveraged GANs to learn graph topological features across different graph types, demonstrating consistent ability to retain topological features. The method reconstructed input graphs well and preserved both local and global topological features. Our method reconstructs input graphs effectively, preserving local and global topological features. Future research directions include extending the model-agnostic approach to handle directed and weighted graphs with edge attributes."
