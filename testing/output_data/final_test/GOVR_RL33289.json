    "content": "Social Security benefits are based on workers' employment history, not current income. Children can receive benefits if a parent dies, becomes disabled, or retires. The child's benefit is typically 50% of the parent's primary insurance amount. Children of deceased workers may receive 75% of the parent's PIA. There is a maximum family benefit ranging from 150% to 188% of the parent's PIA. Children may receive Social Security benefits based on a deceased or retired worker's earnings record, including biological, legally adopted, and in some cases, stepchildren and grandchildren. Benefits can be received until age 18, or 19 if in high school, and indefinitely for disabled children. Children may also benefit economically by living with family members receiving benefits. In December 2012, 3.3 million children under 18 received Social Security benefits, with 37.2% being children of deceased workers, 52.9% children of disabled workers, and 8.9% dependent children of retired workers. The average monthly benefit for child beneficiaries was $525, with children of deceased workers receiving the highest average benefit of $793. In December 2012, children under 18 received Social Security benefits, totaling $1.712 billion annually. This amount exceeds federal spending on cash welfare for families with children under TANF. In FY2013, TANF expenditures were $8.7 billion, with $4.3 billion from federal funds. SSA data show the number and type of benefits but lack details on recipients' characteristics and the impact of Social Security on individuals and families. The analysis in this report utilizes U.S. Census Bureau Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) data from the 2008 panel, which interviews families every four months over a 64-month period. The SIPP collects detailed information on family composition, income, and program participation. The analysis focuses on SIPP data from April 2013, the latest month available. The report utilizes SIPP data from April 2013, showing 8.5 million children lived in families receiving Social Security, a significant increase from previous estimates. It is challenging to identify children's Social Security beneficiary status accurately. In April 2013, 3.2 million children in families receiving Social Security were likely child beneficiaries, while 1.9 million lived in families where parents received benefits. Another 3.4 million children lived in families where Social Security was received by someone other than a child or parent. Children living in families receiving Social Security may be indirectly affected by extended family members receiving benefits. Differences in poverty status are more apparent when Social Security is received on behalf of children or parents/guardians compared to when it is received by other family members. The overall poverty status of children in families receiving Social Security is similar to those not receiving it, but the direct impact of Social Security on children is not a targeted policy. The poverty status of children in families receiving Social Security is similar to those not receiving it. However, children of beneficiaries or parents/guardians receiving Social Security are more likely to be poor compared to those where extended family members receive benefits. The effect of Social Security on children's poverty status is analyzed by comparing poverty levels with and without Social Security income. Figures 3, 4, and 5 show the pre- and post-transfer poverty status of children in families receiving Social Security compared to those that do not. Social Security benefits significantly reduce child poverty, with nearly half of children in families receiving Social Security lifted above the poverty line. This effect is evident when comparing pre- and post-transfer poverty status, showing that Social Security plays a crucial role in alleviating financial hardship for millions of children. Social Security benefits reduce child poverty, lifting nearly half of children in families receiving them above the poverty line. This effect is limited to 8.5 million children in Social Security families, amounting to 11.6% of all children. Overall, 19.082 million children were estimated as poor in April 2013, but counting Social Security benefits reduced this number to 17.130 million, resulting in 23.5% of all children being considered poor\u2014a 2.7 percentage point, or 10.2% decline. Social Security benefits reduce child poverty, lifting nearly half of children in families above the poverty line. While the equalizing effect is attenuated at higher income levels, children in families receiving Social Security have lower poverty rates compared to those who do not receive benefits. Figures 4 and 5 highlight the distribution of children benefiting from Social Security, showing the impact on child poverty levels. Social Security benefits reduce child poverty rates significantly, with extended family members receiving the benefits in some cases. Pre-transfer poverty rates are higher for children in families where Social Security is received on behalf of children or by parents/guardians compared to those where it is received only by extended family members. Despite the reduction in poverty rates, children in families receiving Social Security still have higher poverty rates than those who do not receive benefits. Based on SIPP data, families with children received $6.053 billion in Social Security benefits in April 2013, with 44.1% going to families in poverty based on total cash income. Among families with child beneficiaries, $3.847 billion in Social Security benefits were reported, with nearly half going to children who would otherwise be considered poor. Social Security benefits totaling $6.053 billion were received by families with children in April 2013, with almost half going to families below the poverty line. This amount is more than five times the federal cash welfare spending under the TANF program. Social Security significantly reduces child poverty compared to TANF, as most TANF funds target families already in poverty. The estimates in the report are based on survey data and may be affected by respondent misreporting. The SIPP data used do not provide detailed information to accurately identify child beneficiaries. Estimates of pre-transfer child poverty status, excluding Social Security income, show the program's impact on poverty. It is challenging to identify child Social Security beneficiaries accurately using SIPP data. The program plays a significant role in reducing child poverty compared to TANF. In April 2013, about 8.5 million children under 18 lived in families receiving Social Security benefits, either for themselves or on behalf of another family member. It is difficult to accurately identify child beneficiaries in SIPP data, as some adults may include a child's portion of benefits as their own. This method may overstate the number of child beneficiaries. In April 2013, an estimated 3.175 million children were identified as potential Social Security child beneficiaries, with an additional 1.893 million children living with parents receiving Social Security benefits. In April 2013, 3.175 million children were identified as potential Social Security child beneficiaries, with an additional 1.893 million children living with parents receiving benefits. A total of 5.068 million children are considered child beneficiaries or children of parents receiving Social Security, while 3.430 million children live in families where Social Security is received by extended family or other family members. Social Security's impact on child poverty is more significant for children living with parents receiving benefits, while for children in families where Social Security is received by extended family or other members, its effect on child poverty is incidental."
