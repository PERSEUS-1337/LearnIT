    "content": "Following a presidential declaration of emergency or major disaster, FEMA provides three primary forms of assistance: Individual Assistance (IA), Public Assistance (PA), and Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA). IA aids individuals and households with housing, crisis counseling, disaster legal services, and more. PA offers grants to governments and nonprofits for emergency measures and infrastructure repair. HMA funds mitigation projects to reduce future disaster impacts. This report provides descriptions of Individual Assistance (IA) authorized under the Stafford Act. State, territorial, and tribal governments must request IA after a disaster. The governor or tribal chief executive must request a major disaster declaration for IA to be authorized. FEMA evaluates requests for Individual Assistance (IA) from state, territorial, or tribal governments based on factors to determine if federal assistance is needed. Updated IA factors were released in March 2019 and became effective on June 1, 2019. Different types of IA are available depending on the type of declaration requested by the governor or tribal chief executive. FEMA's IA program includes Mass Care and Emergency services. FEMA's IA program includes Mass Care and Emergency Assistance, Crisis Counseling Assistance, Disaster Unemployment Assistance, Disaster Legal Services, Disaster Case Management, and Individuals and Households Program. Mass Care and Emergency Assistance involves providing life-sustaining services to disaster survivors through various activities. The Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program provides grant funding for mental health support. The Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP) offers grant funding to local, state, territorial, and tribal governments, as well as NGOs, to provide community-based outreach and services like crisis counseling and coping skills development for disaster survivors. The program offers short- to intermediate-term assistance for mental and emotional health needs, with two programs providing support for different lengths of time: Immediate Services Program (up to 60 days) and Regular Services Program (up to nine months). Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) provides benefits to individuals affected by a major disaster who are ineligible for regular unemployment insurance. DUA may also offer re-employment assistance for up to 26 weeks. Disaster Legal Services (DLS) provide free legal aid to low-income individuals for issues related to the disaster, such as insurance claims, wills, home repairs, and FEMA appeals. Disaster Legal Services (DLS) offer free legal aid for issues like insurance claims, home repair contracts, and FEMA appeals. The Disaster Case Management (DCM) program pairs case managers with survivors to create recovery plans. The Individuals and Households Program (IHP) provides financial assistance for uninsured necessary expenses after a disaster. The Individuals and Households Program (IHP) offers Housing Assistance and Other Needs Assistance (ONA) to disaster survivors for up to 18 months. Housing Assistance includes Financial Housing Assistance and Direct Housing Assistance, with the federal cost share for FEMA housing assistance at 100%. Financial Housing Assistance is grant funding provided by FEMA directly to individuals or households for lodging expenses, rental assistance, home repair, and home replacement. There are limits on the amount of assistance available for each type of housing assistance. Direct Housing Assistance is housing provided to individuals or households by FEMA or the government, not subject to financial assistance limits. Multifamily Lease and Repair and Transportable Temporary Housing Units are options for temporary housing for disaster survivors. Direct Housing Assistance includes Temporary Housing Units (TTHUs), Direct Lease, Permanent Housing Construction (PHC), and Other Needs Assistance (ONA). TTHUs must meet specific requirements, while PHC is a last resort for home repair and new construction. ONA provides financial assistance for necessary expenses, with subcategories like SBA-Dependent ONA and Non-SBA-Dependent ONA, subject to assistance limits. ONA assistance is subject to limits and predetermined by FEMA and the government. The federal cost share is 75%, with SBA-Dependent ONA requiring applicants to first apply for an SBA disaster loan. Personal Property Assistance helps repair or replace items damaged in a disaster. Transportation, Moving and Storage Assistance, Group Flood Insurance Policy, Non-SBA-Dependent ONA, Funeral Assistance, and Medical and Dental Assistance are types of assistance provided by FEMA for individuals affected by disasters. These programs offer funding to repair or replace damaged property, relocate personal belongings, obtain flood insurance, and cover eligible expenses. Medical and Dental Assistance, Childcare Assistance, Miscellaneous Expenses, Critical Needs Assistance, and Clean and Removal Assistance are types of assistance provided by FEMA for individuals affected by disasters. These programs offer funding for eligible expenses such as medical and dental costs, childcare, reimbursement for purchased items, immediate needs, and floodwater contamination. The governor or tribal chief executive must request federal assistance for Individual Assistance (IA) after a disaster. This request must demonstrate the inability to effectively respond to the incident without federal help. The governor or tribal chief executive must request federal assistance for Individual Assistance (IA) after a disaster, demonstrating the need for federal help. FEMA evaluates the request based on specific factors and provides a recommendation to the President, who has the discretion to grant a declaration request. FEMA issued a final rule in 2019 revising the factors considered for IA requests. The factors for evaluating a governor's request for Individual Assistance (IA) were revised in 2019 to establish more objective criteria, clarify eligibility requirements, and expedite the declaration determination process. These factors became effective on June 1, 2019, and are used to assess the severity, magnitude, and impact of a disaster, as well as the capabilities of the affected jurisdictions. FEMA also provided guidance for state, territorial, and tribal governments when drafting IA declaration requests. \"FEMA considers all relevant information in declaration requests. Major disaster declarations are at the President's discretion, and IA factors do not limit this. Factors include State Fiscal Capacity and Resource Availability, evaluating resources for disaster response and recovery.\" The State Fiscal Capacity and Resource Availability factors in FEMA declaration requests consider variables like state GDP, per capita income, and resources from local and state governments for disaster response and recovery. States with high fiscal capacity may still need federal assistance in overwhelming disaster situations. The Uninsured Home and Personal Property Losses assessment considers the extent of damage and estimated cost of assistance based on FEMA-State Preliminary Damage Assessment data. Factors include the type of disaster, insurance coverage, concentration of damages, number of homes affected, cost of assistance, and homeownership rate of affected homes. The Disaster Impacted Population Profile evaluates recovery challenges by comparing demographics with national averages. Impact to Community Infrastructure assesses disruption to essential services like police, fire, and schools. Other relevant PDA data may show a need for federal assistance. Casualties, including missing, injured, or deceased individuals, indicate trauma levels and influence the type of assistance needed. Disaster Related Unemployment tracks those who lost work due to the disaster and do not qualify for standard unemployment insurance."
