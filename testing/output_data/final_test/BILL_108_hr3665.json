FINDINGS.\" The Congress finds that President Jimmy Carter and his wife, First Lady Rosalynn Carter, exemplify American service, volunteerism, and statesmanship. They have redefined the role of ex-President to promote peace and combat disease globally. Jimmy Carter, born in 1924, served in the U.S. Navy before his distinguished public service career. After serving in the Navy until 1953, including on the battleship USS Pomfret and the nuclear submarine Sea Wolf, Mr. Carter pursued graduate work in nuclear physics at Union College. He then returned to Plains, where he became a successful businessman and farmer. Mr. Carter also dedicated himself to local public service, holding various leadership positions in organizations such as the Sumter County School Board and the Crop Improvement Association. In response to the 1954 Supreme Court decision on school segregation, a White Citizens' Council movement was organized in Plains, but Mr. Carter refused to support it. Jimmy Carter served in the Georgia Senate and was elected Governor of Georgia in 1970. He became the 39th President of the United States in 1977. As First Lady, Rosalynn Carter focused on the performing arts and mental health programs. President Carter's domestic accomplishments during his term included a long-term energy program, civil-service system overhaul, creation of new Departments of Education and Energy, airline deregulation, and environmental efforts. Rosalynn Carter also served as the Honorary Chairperson of the President's Commission on Mental Health and as the President's personal emissary to Latin American countries. President Carter's foreign policy achievements included negotiating the Panama Canal treaties, the Camp David Accords between Israeli Premier Menahem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar el-Sadat, the SALT II treaty with the Soviet Union, and establishing diplomatic relations with China. After their time in office, President and Mrs. Carter founded the Carter Center in Atlanta, focusing on international peace, human rights, and conflict resolution. Since 1982, President and Mrs. Carter have been active volunteers, serving on the International Board of Advisors of Habitat for Humanity, a nonprofit organization that helps needy people renovate and build homes in the US and 44 other countries. Habitat for Humanity has built over 30,000 homes since its founding in 1976. Mrs. Carter also leads a program at the Carter Center to reduce stigma against mental illness and improve access to mental health care. President Carter received the Nobel Peace Prize in December 2002 for his efforts in finding peaceful solutions to conflicts, promoting democracy, human rights, and economic development. Currently, he teaches Sunday school, serves as a deacon at Maranatha Baptist Church, and is a distinguished professor at Emory University. Former President Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn Carter will be presented with gold medals by the Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate in recognition of their life work and service to the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury will strike the medals with suitable designs. Additionally, duplicate medals will be made. The Secretary may strike and sell duplicate bronze medals of the gold medals at a price covering costs. The medals are considered national medals. Funding for the medals will come from the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund, with proceeds from sales deposited back into the fund."
