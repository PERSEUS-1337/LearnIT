The Asbestos Injury Claims Resolution Fund would provide structured payments to claimants over a period of three to four years, funded by defendant and insurer participants. Lump-sum awards are not given, and claimants can still receive other compensation like disability or health insurance payments. The Asbestos Injury Claims Resolution Fund would involve defendant and insurer participants making mandatory payments totaling $57.5 billion over the fund's lifespan. Insurer participants would be required to contribute $46,025,000,000. Additional mandatory payments of up to $10 billion could be requested if necessary, following a notice and comment process.

If the Fund lacks resources after seven years, it would sunset, allowing claimants to pursue lawsuits again. If the Fund sunsets, claimants could file lawsuits again with tolling of statute of limitations.

The Asbestos Insurers Commission establishes payment obligations for insurer participants based on tort system liability.

The bill includes regulations to prohibit manufacturing, processing, or distributing asbestos-containing products. The Administrator can grant exemptions if no reasonable alternatives exist and if the use of asbestos-containing products will not pose an unreasonable risk to health or the environment.
