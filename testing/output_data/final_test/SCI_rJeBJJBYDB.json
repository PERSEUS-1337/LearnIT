This paper introduces Chart Auto-Encoder (CAE) to capture the manifold structure of data with multiple charts and transition functions. This approach aims to create local latent representations that reflect the intrinsic structure of the data. Chart Auto-Encoder (CAE) utilizes latent spaces in auto-encoding models to accurately approximate data and generate new realistic data. The effectiveness of CAE is demonstrated through experiments with synthetic and real-life data. Latent spaces capture essential information for dimension reduction, denoising, and generative modeling, even in models like generative adversarial networks. These spaces are often modeled as low-dimensional Euclidean spaces or bounded subsets with prior probability distributions. In differential geometry, the Manifold Hypothesis suggests that real-world data often lies on a low-dimensional manifold in a high-dimensional space. Representation learning involves mapping data to a low-dimensional latent space with properties like invertibility and continuity. However, not all manifolds can be homeomorphically mapped to Euclidean space. In representation learning, data is often on a low-dimensional manifold in a high-dimensional space. However, not all manifolds can be accurately mapped to Euclidean space, as shown in examples involving spheres and torus shapes. Increasing the latent space dimension beyond the intrinsic dimension may be necessary to capture the data structure accurately. In representation learning, data on a low-dimensional manifold may not be accurately mapped to Euclidean space. Increasing the latent space dimension may be necessary. A Chart Auto-Encoder (CAE) is proposed to learn a low-dimensional representation of data on a manifold using overlapping chart functions. This approach faithfully preserves the shape and topology of the data set. The neural network architecture proposed is the Chart Auto-Encoder (CAE), which aims to capture the structure of data on a manifold. To enhance autoencoders, a non-Euclidean latent space is introduced in a homeomorphic variational autoencoder (HVAC). This approach ensures a homeomorphic representation without the need for prior knowledge of the data set's topological class. The Chart Auto-Encoder (CAE) introduces a non-Euclidean latent space to capture data structure on a manifold. Understanding the topological class of the data set is challenging, and estimating the Lie group action on the latent space is complex. Recent works have explored autoencoders with spherical latent spaces for detecting cyclical features. Various dimension reduction techniques have been developed to explore the low-dimensional structure of manifolds. Various dimension reduction techniques have been developed to explore the low-dimensional structure of manifolds, such as Isomap and Laplacian Eigenmaps. Lei et al. (2019) consider a manifold point of view to explain Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) using optimal transport. Chen et al. (2019) extend the work of Shaham et al. (2018) to show the theoretical existence of neural networks that approximate functions supported on low-dimensional manifolds. The curr_chunk discusses a neural network architecture that approximates functions on low-dimensional manifolds by dividing them into charts and re-combining them. Existing methods only consider theoretical chart structures and assume knowledge of the manifold, while this new approach directly approximates the data manifold to address challenges in loss function and training methods. The curr_chunk discusses approximating data manifolds using charts and transition functions. It highlights the importance of understanding the topological and geometric structure of the manifold for tasks like classification and data generation in machine learning. In machine learning, the encoding and decoding process for a manifold involves constructing local parameterizations from the data manifold to the latent space. Multiple charts are used instead of a single one, and the parameterization is controlled by bounding its Lipschitz constant. This approach is illustrated with an example of finding a latent representation of data sampled from a 1-dimensional circle embedded in a 2-dimensional space. Parameterizing a 1-dimensional circle embedded in a 2-dimensional space involves using multiple charts with bounded Lipschitz constants. While a simple parameterization introduces discontinuity, a more complex function allows for representation learning with finite neural networks, maintaining topological and geometric information. The text discusses modeling the latent space with multiple charts glued by transition functions to reflect the intrinsic structure of the manifold. This approach allows for a more accurate approximation of data and the generation of realistic new data. Additionally, it enables the approximation of geometric information of the data manifold, leading to a better understanding of the manifold's geometry. The text introduces a new network architecture for learning a multi-chart latent space and its transition functions. An input data is encoded into an initial latent representation, which is then mapped to N different chart spaces. Each chart representation is decoded to approximate the input data, and a chart prediction module selects the best representation. This architecture enforces chart transitions without explicit computation. The initial encoder serves as a dimension reduction step to find a low-dimensional isometric embedding of the data. It maps from a high-dimensional space to a lower dimensional space, preserving the original topology and geometry information while reducing dimensionality. This encoding prepares the data for splitting into multi-chart latent spaces. The Chart Encoder step parameterizes the data manifold locally to a chart space, splitting it into a multi-chart latent space for computational efficiency in decoders. It uses a collection of networks to output local coordinates, creating a proposed multi-chart latent space model. The proposed multi-chart architecture aims to construct the correct latent space structure and understand the geometric structure of the data manifold. The decoupled encoding operations result in a larger model with more parameters, but the improvement in experiments is due to the correct latent space structure rather than the number of parameters. Increasing parameters in a VAE without increasing the latent dimension does not lead to good reconstruction and generation simultaneously. A latent space of insufficient dimension cannot cover a manifold, while one of excessive dimension generates points. The proposed multi-chart architecture focuses on constructing the correct latent space structure for understanding the data manifold's geometric structure. Each latent chart is paired with a decoder function to reconstruct input data. The chart selection module determines which chart to use for a given input, reducing computational costs. The output of the network depends on the application. The network's output depends on the application and training specifics. It produces an internal latent representation for an input, a reconstruction signal to check system fidelity, and confidence in the prediction. Various task-specific modeling options, loss functions, regularization, and pre-training schemes are explained to enhance training efficiency. The chart prediction module assigns inputs to one or more charts based on the data manifold's geometry. The chart prediction module assigns inputs to one or more charts based on the data manifold's geometry using a deep network called the chart predictor. This network can take x, z, and/or z \u03b1 as inputs to determine the number and size of charts needed for prediction. The proposed model involves two loss functions for reducing x by E, with different interpretations based on chart overlap. The Chart-Prediction Loss includes a decoderwise loss and log-likelihood term weighted by decoder-wise error. The second regime involves a partition of unity idea, representing points on the manifold as a combination of charts with confidence weights predicted by the chart. The proposed model uses a combination of charts with confidence weights predicted by the chart predictor as coefficients. A Partition of Unity Loss is used to eliminate unnecessary charts by enforcing strong regularization on decoder functions. Unused chart functions do not receive updates during training, and weights of unused decoders decay to zero. Mechanism is in place to automatically remove charts with low decoder weights.

A Partition of Unity Loss is used to eliminate unnecessary charts by enforcing strong regularization on decoder functions. Unused chart functions do not receive updates during training, and weights of unused decoders decay to zero. Mechanism is in place to automatically remove charts with low decoder weights. An additional regularization is introduced to stabilize the training of the network by balancing the size of parameterized charts and preventing a small number of charts from dominating the data manifold. The Lipschitz regularization is added to the decoders to control the max volume a chart can map onto. The Lipschitz constant of an encoder function is controlled by regularizing the spectral norm of its weights at each layer. This regularization is proposed for a K-layer network. The decoder functions for a K-layer network aim to prevent dominance of a single chart and promote smoothness. The model is initialized using furthest point sampling to select data points and assign them to decoders. The encoder is trained to place data points at the center of the chart space, and chart prediction probability is defined as a categorical distribution. Loss is calculated for pre-training the chart predictor. The pre-training network ensures consistent orientation of charts and decoders on the data manifold. The chart selection module is learned along with the model without prior data segmentation assumptions. During training, charts may move, change sizes, overlap, or disappear. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CAE on various geometric examples and the MINIST dataset. In the experiment, a four-chart CAE is applied to a data set sampled from the unit sphere. The loss function with and without Lipschitz regularization is used, and the charts successfully cover the unit sphere after training. The experiment involved using a four-chart CAE on a data set from the unit sphere. The charts covered the sphere well with balanced regularity. Lipschitz regularization was necessary for control. Another experiment on a double torus showed challenges with traditional auto-encoders for complex data. The data manifold had a local dimension of 2 but was not homeomorphic to a plane. Sampling the latent space and using the decoder showed limitations of traditional models. The experiment involved using a four-chart CAE on a data set from the unit sphere, showing successful coverage without introducing unfaithful points. Testing on a genus-3 surface with ten 2-dimensional charts also yielded positive results. The model uses a network to predict chart segmentation for parameterization. The model uses a network to predict chart segmentation, resulting in charts of varying sizes to handle objects with complex topology. Applying the 10-chart model on the MNIST dataset shows successful decoding results, with the chart selection module choosing the most faithful output. The proposed multi-chart auto-encoder provides faithful reconstruction for the training data, with each chart producing only a few digits in a balanced and regular way. The latent space can cover the MINST data manifold effectively, as shown in the morphing of a '2' to a '3' through interpolation. The proposed multi-chart auto-encoder achieves faithful reconstruction of training data by approximating the manifold closely without distributional assumptions. Various traditional models and CAEs are compared on different datasets, focusing on measures like reconstruction error, unfaithfulness, and coverage. The reconstruction error, unfaithfulness, and coverage are key metrics used to evaluate the fidelity of the model and the coverage of the training data by the encoder. High unfaithfulness scores indicate unrealistic data generation, while low coverage scores suggest mode collapse. These measurements are tested on four datasets, ranging from simple to complex: a sphere dataset, a genus-3 object dataset, the MNIST hand-written digits database, and the SVHN real-world image dataset. The evaluation metrics for the CAE models show consistent better performance compared to other models with simple latent spaces. The use of Lipschitz regularization in the model leads to improved coverage results. The introduction of chart-based parameterization allows for modeling manifold structured data with multiple-chart latent spaces and transition functions in autoencoders. The proposed chart-based parameterization of manifold-structured data in autoencoders allows for efficient representation of complex data structures. Geometric examples are used to analyze the behavior of the model, showing advantages over single-chart autoencoders. Real-life data sets like MNIST and SVHN demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, with potential for further analysis and applications in generative models like GANs. Future work will explore topology and geometry of real-world data using this architecture. The architecture of the networks used in the numerical experiments includes fully connected layers denoted as F C y, convolution layers denoted as Conv i,j,k.l, and the dimension of the latent space denoted as dim(U). Variational Auto-Encoders CAE 1, CAE 2, and CAE 3 were trained using the chart prediction loss function. The chart-based parameterization of manifolds in differential geometry involves the construction of chart transition functions for points on the manifold parameterized by multiple charts. The architecture of the networks used in the numerical experiments includes fully connected layers denoted as F C y, convolution layers denoted as Conv i,j,k.l, and the dimension of the latent space denoted as dim(U). Variational Auto-Encoders CAE 1, CAE 2, and CAE 3 were trained using the chart prediction loss function. The chart transition function \u03c6 \u03b1\u03b2 can be computed as \u03c6 \u22121 \u03b1 \u03c6 \u03b2 using neural networks. It is possible to re-encode the signal generated by the first decoder to define a chart transition. Each chart transition function can be modeled by the composition, and the estimation of chart transitions between overlapping charts is needed. The network architecture includes fully connected and convolution layers, with a latent space dimension. Variational Auto-Encoders were trained using a chart prediction loss function. The chart transition function can be computed using neural networks, without the need for explicit parameterization or additional terms in the loss function. Pre-training can orient the chart around a center point using PCA to define a local neighborhood embedding. This approach avoids the computationally expensive cyclic condition of re-encoding decoded signals for transition and reconstruction. The local neighborhood embedding coordinates are determined by a local scaling constant. The orientation of local charts can be initialized using this coordinate system with an additional regularization term. Convolution and pooling layers in the encoder network promote manifold structured representations by mapping data to simple manifolds through dimension reduction operations. Adding convolution and pooling layers to the encoder networks simplifies the underlying geometry for easier model estimation. The decoder measures fidelity of the output by assessing the faithfulness error, which evaluates how close decoded data from the latent space is to the original training data. Sampling the latent space and decoding can generate new data, but if the training set is dense, the newly generated data may not be realistic. It is crucial for a properly trained model to stay close to the underlying manifold. In this experiment, latent variables are selected by drawing samples from the latent space. Coverage measures how well the latent space captures the data set, with a coverage score close to one indicating a well-distributed manifold. The experiment involves training a model with four 1-dimensional charts to fit a circle and visualize the transition between charts. In this experiment, a model with four 2-dimensional charts is trained on data sampled on a sphere to visualize the transition between charts. The output of each chart using latent variable z i is shown, along with the transition zones and partition of unity function. The experiment aims to demonstrate the effect of the regularization scheme when using a neural network as the chart prediction module. The regularization scheme in a neural network for chart prediction is demonstrated in an experiment where charts are automatically removed after training. Geometric information is recovered by computing the length of geodesic curves on a sphere using latent representations. Sampling points along a path in the latent space, decoding them, and measuring the euclidean distance is shown in the experiment. In an experiment, different numbers of sampling points are used for five curves on a sphere, showing convergence of measurements along the geodesic path. This preliminary result demonstrates the potential of understanding geometric structure using multi-chart latent space. Another experiment on a double torus with a VAE shows that increasing parameters without increasing latent dimension does not improve reconstruction and generation simultaneously. The importance of latent space structure over the number of parameters is highlighted in this paper, emphasizing the need for a dimension that can cover the data manifold effectively for good reconstruction and generation."
