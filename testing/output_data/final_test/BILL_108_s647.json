The Department of Defense will cover the premiums for eligible reserve component members called to active duty for more than 30 days to continue their health benefits coverage. The title is eligible for payment of the applicable premium for continuation of qualified health benefits plan coverage under certain conditions. Qualified health benefits plan coverage for a member called to active duty must have been in force on the date of notification or the date of the call, and must have applied to the member and their dependents. The applicable premium for continuation of coverage is the amount payable by the member for their coverage and dependents. Benefits coverage continuation period for qualified health benefits plan coverage in the case of a member called to active duty begins on the date of the call or order and ends when the member's eligibility for transitional health care terminates, they become covered by another health plan, or they elect to terminate coverage. Extension of Period of COBRA Coverage: Any period of coverage under a COBRA continuation provision for a member shall be equal to the benefits coverage continuation period. Rules similar to section 4980B(f)(5)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall apply. Special Rule for Individual Health Insurance Coverage for a member of a reserve component described in subsection (b) enrolled in individual health insurance coverage. During the benefits coverage continuation period, a health insurance issuer cannot decline coverage, impose preexisting condition exclusions, or increase premium rates for a member of a reserve component enrolled in individual health insurance coverage when called to active duty. During the benefits coverage continuation period, a member's dependents are not eligible for TRICARE if the member is already receiving benefits under a qualified health benefits plan paid for by the Secretary concerned. The member can revoke their election under subsection (a), allowing their dependents to become eligible for TRICARE. The Secretary of Defense will prescribe regulations for implementing this section.
