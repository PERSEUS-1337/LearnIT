    "content": "DECONTAMINATION AND USE OF FORMER BOMBARDMENT AREA ON ISLAND OF CULEBRA. Congress found that Culebra Island, Puerto Rico, was used by the Navy for bombing exercises for over 70 years. In 1975, the Navy was required to close its operations on Culebra due to safety, health, and environmental concerns. Despite the closure, the cleanup of the area did not begin until later. The cleanup of former United States military sites in Culebra was authorized by Congress in 1986. In 2003, Puerto Rico requested the EPA to add Culebra and Vieques to the National Priorities List of hazardous sites. Vieques was added in 2005, but Culebra's listing decision was delayed. The Army Corps of Engineers has begun planning a comprehensive removal of unexploded ordnance on Culebra, with an estimated cost of $92.6 million. This is significantly less than the $253.1 million the Navy plans to spend on cleaning up Vieques. The disparity in funding between the two islands has raised concerns, despite similar conditions on both. The Army Corps of Engineers is planning to remove unexploded ordnance on Culebra, but certain hazardous areas like the Northwest Peninsula and Flamenco Beach are excluded from cleanup plans due to a 1974 Federal law. The Army Corps of Engineers plans to clean up unexploded ordnance on Culebra, but certain areas like the Northwest Peninsula and Flamenco Beach are excluded from the cleanup due to a 1974 Federal law. Section 2872 of H.R. 5658 in the 110th Congress aimed to repeal the prohibition in the 1974 statute, allowing the Army Corps of Engineers to address potential risks in the Northwest Peninsula and Flamenco Beach."
