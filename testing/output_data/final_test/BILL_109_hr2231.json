The Congress finds that breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American women, with approximately 3,000,000 women in the United States living with the disease. It is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the US and worldwide, with an estimated 269,730 new cases in 2005. Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for women in the United States between the ages of 20 and 59, and worldwide. A woman in the US has a 1 in 7 chance of developing invasive breast cancer in her lifetime. About 90% of women who develop breast cancer do not have a family history of the disease. The National Action Plan on Breast Cancer recognizes the importance of expanding efforts. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences has funded research centers to study environmental exposures that may predispose women to breast cancer. Research is focusing on mammary tissue in animals and young girls to understand life exposures to environmental factors. Early menarche, before age 12, increases breast cancer risk. The National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences collaborate on research centers to study environmental, nutritional, and social factors impacting menarche. Federal investment in environmental research for breast cancer prevention should be expanded. To understand the link between environmental factors and breast cancer, multi-generational studies are needed to examine the effects of chemicals and radiation on cancer development. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on research centers focusing on environmental factors related to breast cancer. The Director of the Institute will make grants for the establishment of up to 8 Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Centers of Excellence, based on recommendations from the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Panel. The Panel, established by the Secretary, will oversee the centers' multidisciplinary research on environmental factors linked to breast cancer. The Panel, appointed by the Secretary, consists of 9 members, including 6 physicians and health professionals from various disciplines and regions in the US, not affiliated with the government. They come from different practice or research settings. The Panel appointed by the Secretary consists of 9 members, including 6 physicians and health professionals from various disciplines and regions in the US, not affiliated with the government. They come from different practice or research settings. Three members are representatives of individuals who have had breast cancer and represent a constituency. Nonvoting, ex officio members may be appointed as determined appropriate by the Secretary. The Panel members select a chairperson from among themselves and meet at least once a year. The Panel oversees peer review process for grant awards, makes funding recommendations, and collaborates with community organizations. Each center must collaborate with local community groups, including those representing women with breast cancer. The Director coordinates centers and provides reports as needed. The Institute coordinates information among centers, requires collaboration among scientists and health professionals, and supports centers for up to 5 years, with possible extensions. The Director of the Institute oversees the review and extension of center operations, ensuring equitable geographical distribution. Centers must use innovative approaches to study unexplored areas related to the environment and breast cancer. $30,000,000 is authorized annually for fiscal years 2006 through 2011 for this purpose."
