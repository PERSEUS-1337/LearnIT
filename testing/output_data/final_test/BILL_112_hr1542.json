    "content": "The \"Supermarket Tax Credit for Underserved Areas Act\" provides tax incentives for the establishment of supermarkets in underserved areas, including increased rehabilitation credit, work opportunity tax credit, and credit for sales of locally grown fresh fruits and vegetables. The \"Increased Rehabilitation Credit\" under the \"Supermarket Tax Credit for Underserved Areas Act\" boosts the tax incentives for qualified rehabilitated buildings in underserved areas, specifically underserved area supermarkets. The credit increases from 10% to 12% in paragraph 1 and from 20% to 24% in paragraph 2 of section 47. This provision applies to buildings placed in service between December 31, 2011, and January 1, 2014. The \"Increased Work Opportunity Tax Credit\" provides a $1,000 increase in the limitation for individuals employed in new underserved area supermarkets. This applies to wages paid between December 31, 2011, and January 1, 2017. The underserved area supermarket fruit and vegetable credit is 15% of gross receipts from retail sales of locally grown fresh produce in new underserved area supermarkets. This credit applies to taxable years between December 31, 2012, and January 1, 2017. The term 'underserved area supermarket' refers to supermarkets located in underserved areas. A 'new underserved area supermarket' is one that starts operating after December 31, 2011, and was not a supermarket in the previous 3 years. A 'supermarket' is a building with retail space between 12,000 and 80,000 square feet, with at least 7% used for selling items. The term 'underserved area supermarket' defines supermarkets in underserved areas, meeting specific criteria such as retail space usage and annual sales thresholds. Underserved areas include designated enterprise communities, empowerment zones, and renewal communities. The text discusses an amendment to the general business credit section of the tax code to include a credit for underserved area supermarket fruit and vegetable. This credit is determined under section 1400V-3. \"Part IV. Tax Incentives for Supermarkets in Underserved Areas\" discusses a credit for underserved area supermarkets for fruits and vegetables under section 1400V-3."
