    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature states that information on violent deaths can help in understanding and preventing them. Violence in the US causes around 56,000 deaths annually, including suicide, homicide, and legal intervention deaths. The CDC reports a total cost of $47.2 billion for these deaths in work loss and medical treatment. The National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) was established in 2002 to collect data on violent deaths from various sources. The data helps inform decision-makers and program planners to identify prevention efforts and evaluate state-based programs. A national system will allow the CDC to provide information for every state to monitor trends and inform national efforts. The California Electronic Violent Death Reporting System (CEVDRS) is established to collect data on violent deaths from various sources, including death certificates, law enforcement reports, and coroner or medical examiner reports. The Department of Health shall post a summary and analysis of the collected data on its website. Local agencies may also be contracted to collect data within their jurisdiction. The Department of Health can contract local agencies to collect specified data on violent deaths. The data collected must be within the agencies' jurisdiction. A local agency can collect data on violent deaths for the California Electronic Violent Death Reporting System if resources are available. Law enforcement agencies may report data on violent deaths for public health surveillance purposes. Individual information remains confidential, and data elements are based on the CDC's National Violent Death Reporting System. The department can seek grants and accept private funds to implement the National Violent Death Reporting System. There are no restrictions on the data sources the department can collect for violent deaths, including public agency documents. \"Violent death\" refers to deaths caused by physical force, including homicide, suicide, legal intervention deaths, unintentional firearm deaths, and undetermined intent deaths."
