    "content": "The Act titled \"Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act of 1997\" declares its purpose and policy. The Congress declares that labor-management relationships are based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, and shared accountability. Dispute resolution procedures should be fair, simple, and swift to best serve the public interest. Labor-management cooperation in public safety agencies is crucial for a quality work environment. The Federal Government supports the use of collective bargaining for resolving issues between public safety employers and employees. Government facilities are available for conciliation, mediation, and voluntary arbitration to help reach agreements on pay, hours, and working conditions. Mediation and conciliation can help prevent disputes arising from collective bargaining agreements. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"Director\" as the head of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, and \"public safety officer\" as a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or emergency medical services personnel. Additionally, a \"firefighter\" is described as someone who primarily deals with fire control and extinguishment, maintenance of firefighting equipment, fire prevention, and communication. The term \"law enforcement officer\" refers to a member of a law enforcement agency with formal training and the power to make arrests. \"Emergency medical services personnel\" are individuals who provide out-of-hospital emergency medical care. A \"law enforcement agency\" is a public agency charged with preventing or investigating crimes. The terms \"management or supervisory employee\", \"employer\", and \"public safety employer\" refer to individuals or entities involved in law enforcement or emergency medical services. Public safety officers have the right to organize and bargain collectively. Public safety employees in a State are exempt from certain requirements if they grant the right to form a labor organization, require employers to recognize the organization chosen by the majority, allow bargaining over employment terms, and protect existing agreements. The proposed legislation aims to protect existing collective bargaining agreements, require fact-finding in case of disputes, allow voluntary arbitration, enforce rights through State courts, and prohibit strikes and lockouts. The Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service will determine if a State complies with these requirements within 180 days of the Act's enactment. After 180 days, an employer or labor organization can request the Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to determine if a State meets the requirements. If the State fails to meet the requirements, it will be subject to regulations and procedures outlined in section 5. \"Federal Mediation and Conciliation procedures outlined in section 5.\" The Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service will establish collective bargaining procedures for public safety employers and employees in non-exempt States. The regulations will incorporate rights and responsibilities from section 4 and utilize the services of the FMCS. Enforcement can be sought through State courts by public safety employers, employees, and labor organizations. SEC. 6 prohibits strikes and lockouts for public safety employers, employees, or labor organizations. SEC. 7 states that existing collective bargaining agreements will not be invalidated by the Act. SEC. 8 authorizes appropriations for implementing the provisions of the Act."
