    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The California Covenants Program, established under the administration of the Treasurer, is a prepaid college tuition program to help families save for undergraduate education at various institutions. The program issues tuition certificates in accordance with specific requirements. The tuition certificate, issued by the Treasurer under the California Covenants Program, covers a fixed percentage of tuition and mandatory fees for full-time undergraduate enrollment at eligible institutions. It includes annual tuition and fee increases of 7.5 percent or less. The Treasurer determines the cost of tuition certificates for participating institutions, with discretion to adjust based on various factors. Purchasers must specify a beneficiary who is under grade 11, and the certificate is valid for 30 years. The beneficiary must be a California resident or exempt from nonresident tuition when using the certificate. An individual can purchase tuition certificates between May 1 and June 30 of calendar years starting in 2018, with a minimum purchase of $300. These certificates can only be used for undergraduate tuition and mandatory fees at specific higher education institutions in California, excluding expenses like textbooks and living costs. The Treasurer, in collaboration with the Trustees of the California State University and the Regents of the University of California, may establish administrative guidelines for implementing tuition certificates. If the beneficiary cannot attend, the initial investment will be returned with interest, exempt from tax penalty. The California Covenants Program Fund is established to receive money from tuition certificate purchases and bond sales. The Treasurer can allocate funds to universities and colleges to pay for beneficiaries' tuition and fees. Bonds can be issued backed by tuition certificate revenues. The Director of Finance determines funds availability for program implementation each fiscal year and communicates it to the Treasurer. California State University, University of California, and independent higher education institutions must comply with the article. Article becomes effective on January 1, 2018. Gross income exclusion for taxable years starting January 1, 2018, is specified in Revenue and Taxation Code Section 17131.12. For taxable years starting January 1, 2018, gross income excludes moneys invested in the California Covenants Program and disbursements for educational purposes. Tax consequences do not apply if funds are returned. This act is an urgency statute to address concerns about rising costs of postsecondary education in the state and shall go into immediate effect."
