    "content": "The U.S. Constitution outlines the process of impeachment for federal officials, including the President, Vice President, judges, and civil officers. The House has the power to impeach by adopting articles of impeachment, while the Senate conducts the trial and decides on removal from office. Conviction and removal require a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate, while disqualification from future office only needs a majority vote. The House has developed procedures for impeachment, mostly used for federal judges but also for two Presidents and one Cabinet official. The Senate has removed eight officials, all federal judges. The summary of rules and procedures for impeaching federal officials is drawn from congressional sources and past proceedings. This report provides an overview and should not be cited as an authority on congressional proceedings. The impeachment process may be initiated through various actions, including investigations by congressional committees or the introduction of articles of impeachment. Consultation with the Parliamentarian of the House is advised for guidance on rules and precedents. For more information on impeachment, refer to CRS Report R44260, Impeachment and Removal by Jared P. Cole and Todd Garvey. The impeachment process is initiated through a resolution authorizing an inquiry, followed by investigation and preparation of articles of impeachment by the Judiciary Committee. The full House then considers and adopts the articles, appointing managers to present them in the Senate. Members can start the process by submitting a resolution to the House hopper, which, if calling for impeachment, is referred to the Judiciary Committee. When a resolution calls for an impeachment, it is referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. If it calls for an investigation by a standing committee or proposes a special committee, it goes to the Committee on Rules. Such resolutions can be submitted at any time, but historically have been rare. A resolution for impeachment can also be brought to the floor as a question of House privileges, requiring notice from a Member and scheduling by the Speaker within two legislative days. Impeachment resolutions can be disposed of in various ways by the full House, including referring it to the Judiciary Committee or voting on it directly. Recent attempts at impeachment using this method have not been successful. The House typically conducts an investigation before impeaching an official, and a resolution proposing an investigation instead of impeachment would not be considered a proper question of House privileges. The House can receive material related to the conduct of federal officials, which may be referred to a committee for investigation. Standing committees have investigatory authority to research charges against officers before authorizing an impeachment investigation. The Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980 established a process for responding to complaints about federal judges, with findings potentially leading to impeachment proceedings. Recent impeachments of federal judges were initiated by resolutions submitted after receiving a determination from the Judicial Conference. In the last presidential impeachment, a communication from the independent counsel investigating President Bill Clinton was referred to the Judiciary Committee. The Committee was directed to review the information to decide if there were sufficient grounds to recommend an impeachment inquiry. The House later adopted a resolution to authorize an investigation by the committee. The resolution would be referred to the Rules Committee, which would decide whether to report it to the full House for consideration. If reported, the resolution would be privileged, allowing a Member to call it up on the floor under the hour rule. Debate could be limited by a majority vote to end discussion and prevent amendments. The resolution could be considered through various House processes, such as suspension of the rules, a rule from the Rules Committee, or unanimous consent. Recent impeachment investigation resolutions were adopted by unanimous consent without debate. In recent instances of judicial impeachments, the House did not explicitly approve a resolution authorizing an impeachment inquiry. Committees have been granted powers to subpoena witnesses and materials since 1975. The House may approve an authorizing resolution for an impeachment investigation. The Judiciary Committee reported a resolution authorizing an investigation into the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. The resolution was privileged for immediate consideration, with the chair of the committee requesting an extension of debate time. In the 93rd Congress, multiple resolutions to impeach President Richard M. Nixon were introduced and referred to the Judiciary Committee. The committee began examining the charges against the President under its investigatory authority. The House approved a resolution providing additional investigation authority. In late 1973, the House Rules Committee approved additional expenses for the impeachment inquiry into President Nixon. The Judiciary Committee then reported a resolution mandating an investigation to determine whether impeachment was necessary. On February 6, 1974, the resolution was debated under the hour rule, with the chairman moving the previous question before any other Member could speak. The House ordered the previous question 342-70 and approved the resolution for the impeachment investigation 410-4. Committees have the authority to subpoena persons, conduct hearings, and incur expenses in connection with investigations. Additional limitations or authorities may be granted to committees for impeachment inquiries. Subcommittees or task forces may be authorized by the Judiciary Committee for impeachment investigations. In impeachment proceedings, committees have the authority to subpoena witnesses, conduct hearings, and incur expenses. Committee members must take testimony or receive evidence, and staff may take depositions without members present. Chairs of standing committees can order depositions by committee counsel. The federal official under investigation has certain rights, including the right to be represented by counsel. Hearings would be governed by House and committee rules. In impeachment proceedings, committees have the authority to subpoena witnesses, conduct hearings, and incur expenses. Hearings must be governed by House and committee rules, with notice provided one week in advance. Members have the right to question witnesses under the five-minute rule. Hearings are generally public but can be closed for specific reasons. The Judiciary Committee conducted public hearings in 2009 in connection with the impeachment of federal judges. The Judiciary Committee conducted public hearings in 2009 to investigate whether two federal judges should be impeached. The task force heard from various witnesses, including law professors, individuals with information about the judges' alleged crimes, and task force attorneys. In 1998, the committee held hearings related to the impeachment of President Clinton, receiving testimony from experts on impeachment history, the independent counsel, and White House counsel. In recent decades, congressional committees often rely on information from external investigations for impeachment proceedings. In cases since 1980, judges facing impeachment had prior federal criminal trials or guilty pleas. For President Clinton's impeachment, results from an independent counsel investigation were submitted to the Judiciary Committee. After investigating impeachable offenses and reviewing evidence, the committee may meet for a markup to consider articles of impeachment. The process for considering and reporting out an impeachment resolution, known as a markup, involves giving notice of the meeting, making the articles of impeachment available in advance, allowing members to offer amendments, and requiring a majority of the committee to be present for the vote. The committee may also recommend that impeachment is not warranted after an investigation. In the most recent presidential impeachments, the Judiciary Committee held public, televised markups of the impeachment articles for several days. In 1974, a resolution to impeach President Nixon was considered for six days with special procedures. The resolution included two agreed-upon articles of impeachment, a third article proposed and agreed to, and two additional articles rejected. President Nixon resigned before a full House vote. In 1998, articles impeaching President Clinton were considered for three days with similar procedures. The Judiciary Committee debated and voted on four articles of impeachment over three days in December, following procedures similar to those used in 1974. Each member had 10 minutes for an opening statement, and amendments were made to Article I and Article IV. All four articles were agreed to, and a resolution (H.Res. 611, 105th Congress) was reported to the House. Members submitted additional views, protected under House Rule XI, clause 2(l), and committee records are accessible to all Members with reasonable restrictions. The committee may place restrictions on access to investigatory material to protect confidentiality. Access can be limited through executive sessions, where only committee members or authorized individuals can attend. This is done to determine if the material qualifies as a committee record and if release is prohibited by House rules. The committee may restrict access to investigatory material through executive sessions, where only authorized individuals can attend. Information received in executive session can only be released with committee authorization and may have further viewing conditions. Copying, releasing, or taking notes on materials from executive sessions is strictly prohibited without committee permission. Additional restrictions on information access can be imposed by the House or investigating committee. Special procedures were adopted in 1974 by the Judiciary Committee to limit access to select individuals and staff. The House adopted H.Res. 525 during the 105th Congress to review the independent counsel's report for possible impeachment proceedings. The resolution restricted access to executive session material to the Judiciary Committee and designated employees. It made 445 pages of the report immediately available to the public and set a deadline for the rest to be released based on committee recommendations. Discussions were held on access to the report by the public, the President, and House Members before its adoption. During impeachment proceedings, remarks in debate can refer to alleged misconduct of the President under consideration by the House. Articles of impeachment reported by the Judiciary Committee are privileged for immediate consideration on the House floor. The chair of the committee can call up the resolution containing the articles at any time other business is not pending. The House can consider an impeachment resolution immediately under the hour rule, with majority control over debate length and amendments. A vote on the resolution is by simple majority, with a motion to recommit allowed before the vote but not subject to debate. Instructions in the motion must be relevant to the resolution. The House considered impeachment resolutions for a federal judge and President Clinton, with debates and voting conducted separately on each article of impeachment. The process included unanimous consent agreements for debate length and additional hours of discussion. The House debated impeachment resolutions for a federal judge and President Clinton, with additional hours of discussion provided. On the second day, a Member's motion to recommit the impeachment resolution with instructions was ruled not germane by the Speaker. The House agreed to two of the four articles of impeachment under consideration. In the Nixon impeachment proceedings, the full House never acted on a resolution of impeachment as President Nixon resigned before impeachment proceedings could conclude. The Judiciary Committee recommended impeaching the President, and the House approved a resolution acknowledging this. The House could consider an impeachment resolution under a special rule reported by the Rules Committee, which would set the terms for debate, amendment process, and voting on each article separately. The House could consider an impeachment resolution under a special rule reported by the Rules Committee, which would set the terms for debate, amendment process, and voting on each article separately. Consideration and debate of an impeachment resolution could be governed by a unanimous consent agreement, allowing for structured consideration without a vote and minimal floor debate. To raise a question of the privileges of the House, a Member would draft a resolution containing articles of impeachment and consult with the Office of the House Parliamentarian to ensure its qualification. This action may not lead to a direct vote or debate on the articles, as the House could choose to refer it to the Judiciary Committee instead. To raise a question of the privileges of the House, a Member drafts a resolution with articles of impeachment and consults the House Parliamentarian. The Member then gives notice on the House floor, and the Speaker schedules consideration within two legislative days. If deemed proper, the resolution is assigned a number and considered under the hour rule. The House considers questions of privileges under the hour rule, voting to refer resolutions to committee or table them. Impeachment of an officer requires a committee investigation before appointing managers for a Senate trial. Resolutions informing the Senate of impeachment articles are privileged and can be done through a single resolution. The Senate receives impeachment resolutions from the House, informs when managers can present articles to the Senate, and conducts the trial where House managers present evidence against the accused. The Senate has specific rules for impeachment trials dating back to the 19th century, but modern practice allows for alternative procedures. The Senate can set aside its rules with a simple resolution, which may require a cloture process to reach a vote. Once convened as a Court of Impeachment, the Senate follows impeachment trial rules, not its regular legislative rules. The Senate, when convened as a Court of Impeachment, follows specific impeachment trial rules instead of its regular legislative rules. These rules restrict debate on resolutions and motions, potentially allowing a simple majority to determine procedures for responding to House impeachment articles."
