    "content": "GO GIRL GRANTS. Amends title III of the Elementary and Secondary Act of 1965 by adding a new subpart for grants to schools. Subpart may be cited as the 'Getting Our Girls Ready for the 21st Century Act (Go Girl Act)'. \"Congress acknowledges the historical underrepresentation of women in mathematics, science, and technology fields. Female students take fewer advanced courses in these subjects compared to male students and earn fewer degrees. Early career exploration and teachers' attitudes play a role in shaping females' interest in nontraditional fields.\" Stereotypes, lack of role models, and limited access deter girls from STEM careers. Females rate themselves lower in computer ability. By 2000, 65% of jobs will require tech skills. Recruitment practices often overlook females. \"SEC. 3163. PROGRAM AUTHORITY.\" The Secretary can provide grants to local educational agencies for subgrants to schools to support girls in science, math, and technology education. Agencies must submit applications with program descriptions to be eligible for grants. The program description includes content, research, and models used. Collaboration between schools, recruitment, selection of participants, instructional activities, motivational activities, and an evaluation plan are also outlined. \"Elementary school program outlined in SEC. 3164.\" Elementary schools selected for a program to encourage girls in grades 4 and higher to pursue studies in science, mathematics, and technology. The program also aims to introduce girls to careers in these fields and educate parents about the challenges girls face in these subjects. Funds can be used for tutoring in reading, science, math, and technology, as well as mentoring relationships. The program aims to encourage girls in grades 4 and higher to pursue studies in science, mathematics, and technology through various activities such as mentoring, attending events, after-school programs, summer programs, purchasing software, and field trips to educational locations and career sites. The program aims to encourage girls in grades 4 and higher to pursue careers in science, mathematics, and technology by providing information to parents to support their daughters' interest in these fields. \"SEC. 3165. SECONDARY SCHOOL PROGRAM.\" - A program targeting girls in grades 4 and higher to promote careers in science, mathematics, and technology. Local educational agencies must select secondary schools to provide services that encourage girls in grades 9 and higher to pursue majors in science, mathematics, and technology, offer academic advice, help with course selection, promote careers in STEM fields, and educate parents about the challenges girls face in these subjects. Secondary schools receiving subgrants can use the funds for specified purposes. The funds under this subpart can be used for tutoring, mentoring, attending events, internships, after-school activities, summer programs, and purchasing software to encourage girls' interest in science, mathematics, and technology. Field trips and visits to institutions of higher education are organized to introduce girls to careers and college-level programs in science, mathematics, and technology, aiming to encourage their interest in these fields. In this subpart, definitions for \"local educational agency\" and \"Secretary\" are provided. The term \"local educational agency\" is defined as in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, with exceptions for Hawaii, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education. Additionally, $50,000,000 is authorized for grants and contracts under this subpart for fiscal year 2000, with additional funding for the following years."
