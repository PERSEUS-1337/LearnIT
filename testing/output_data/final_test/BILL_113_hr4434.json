    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Africa Counter Terrorism Initiative Act\". Congress acknowledges the proliferation of terrorist groups in unstable countries in West and sub-Saharan Africa, including AQIM, Boko Haram, and al-Shabab. The need to expand the US strategic reach through AFRICOM is crucial, especially with the strategic pivot to the Pacific underway. The United States Central Command operates from its headquarters in Tampa, Florida. The United States Southern Command operates from its headquarters in Miami, Florida, with forward operating locations in Honduras and El Salvador. Analyses by the Government Accountability Office found that maintaining AFRICOM headquarters in the US would cost $60-70 million less annually than operating it in Germany. Overseas housing and cost-of-living pay for AFRICOM personnel cost $81 million per year, compared to $19-25 million if they were based in the US. The Department of Defense decided to keep AFRICOM headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, despite potential cost savings and job creation opportunities in the United States. Relocating AFRICOM to the US could create up to 4,300 jobs and have an annual economic impact of $350-450 million. The break-even point for relocation costs would be reached between 2-6 years after the move. The Government Accountability Office found in 2013 that the decision to keep AFRICOM headquarters in Germany lacked comprehensive analysis. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel urged the Department to challenge assumptions for cost savings and efficiency due to global uncertainties. The Secretary emphasized the need to constantly reassess military forces' size and shape, including the balance between forward-stationed, rotationally deployed, and home-based forces. Congress has the responsibility to analyze and implement any consolidation of military installations, with priority given to bases in close proximity that can achieve cost savings without affecting operational readiness. The decision to deploy assets to Moron Air Base is of concern due to the lack of infrastructure hindering the readiness and effectiveness of deployed troops. Moron lacks facilities for ground and naval training operations, with limited ability for air training operations. In contrast, Lajes Field has undergone over $150 million in infrastructure upgrades to improve quality of life, communication capabilities, security, and military operations. Lajes Field's strategic location, infrastructure improvements, and outstanding training environment make it an ideal forward operating base for AFRICOM. Moving AFRICOM headquarters from Stuttgart, Germany to the continental United States would save millions of dollars per year and bring thousands of jobs. Moving AFRICOM headquarters to the continental United States would save money and create jobs. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a plan to transfer AFRICOM headquarters from Stuttgart, Germany to the continental United States. The plan includes relocating assets to Lajes Field, Azores, Portugal for AFRICOM's use. The plan requires relocating the Special-Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force Crisis Response from Moron Air Base, Spain, to Lajes Field. It must be submitted to Congress within 6 months of the enactment of the Act and implemented within 6 months after submission. The Secretary of Defense will review the Agreement on Cooperation and Defense Between the United States and Portugal to ensure it aligns with the required plan. Lajes Field will operate 24/7 at or above 2012 readiness levels until at least the completion of the 2018 quadrennial defense review."
