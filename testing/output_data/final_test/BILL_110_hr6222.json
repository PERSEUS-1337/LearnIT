The \"Working Families Gas Tax Credit Act of 2008\" allows individuals to claim a credit against their tax for qualified taxable fuel expenditures up to $500 ($1,000 for joint returns) for nonbusiness use in highway vehicles. Qualified taxable fuel expenditures exclude amounts eligible for other fuel-related credits or refunds. The \"Working Families Gas Tax Credit Act of 2008\" allows individuals to claim a credit against their tax for qualified taxable fuel expenditures up to $500 ($1,000 for joint returns) for nonbusiness use in highway vehicles. The credit is subject to limitations based on modified adjusted gross income and the rate of increase in the price of a gallon of gasoline compared to the inflation rate. The percentage change in the price of a gallon of gasoline is calculated by comparing the average price at the end of the taxable year to the average price at the beginning. The inflation rate is determined by comparing the Consumer Price Index at the end of the year to the beginning. In this subsection, the price of a gallon of gasoline is determined by the U.S. Regular All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices. The Consumer Price Index is used to adjust for inflation in taxable years after December 31, 2008. The Secretary shall provide annual guidance by January 31 for adjusting dollar amounts in taxable years based on the cost-of-living adjustment. Amounts are rounded to the nearest multiple of $50, $10, or $100 as necessary. The Secretary will issue guidance to implement the provisions of this section for the previous taxable year. A clerical amendment will be made to the table of sections for subpart A. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2007."
