This move has faced criticism for alleged repressive force and questionable legality. The Indian government's decision to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019 has been met with criticism for its heavy-handed security measures and questionable legal arguments. The move has sparked international controversy as it is seen as a unilateral effort to change the status of a disputed territory. The US government's stance on Kashmir is that its status should be determined through negotiations between India and Pakistan, taking into account the wishes of the Kashmiri people. The government has avoided third-party involvement in Kashmir, while Pakistan and China have tried to internationalize the issue. Concerns exist about potential unrest in the region. The Trump Administration and the UNSC have called for peace and respect for human rights. US Congress members are worried about human rights abuses in Kashmir and the risk of conflict between India and Pakistan. Pakistan was angered by India's actions in August. India and Pakistan are facing escalating tensions after New Delhi's actions in August, which enraged Pakistan's leaders. The repeal of Article 370 in India has raised concerns about democracy and human rights, with analysts warning of the erosion of secular traditions. The United States is trying to balance its partnership with India while upholding human rights and maintaining relations with Pakistan. As of early January 2020, internet and mobile phone services remain blocked in Kashmir Valley, with hundreds of Kashmiris still in detention, including key political figures. Over 5,100 people were taken into custody in J&K after August 4, with 609 still detained, including alleged \"stone-pelters.\" New Delhi justifies restrictions due to security concerns, while the U.S. acknowledges terrorist threats in the region. The Indian Home Ministry reported a decrease in terrorist violence in J&K post August 5, with an increase in infiltration attempts from Pakistan. Indian officials aim to prevent violence and refute reports of shortages as fictitious. They accuse detractors of spreading false rumors through the U.S. media. Indian authorities deny major violence in street protests in Kashmir, but acknowledge attempts by terrorists to create fear. Some restrictions remain in place for public order. Reports describe a punishing blockade with sporadic protests and injuries from pellets and tear gas, leaving Kashmiris unsettled and angry. Despite claims of normalcy by the government, Kashmir remains unsettled, demoralized, and furious. Efforts to reopen schools have failed, with limited internet service and mobile phone suspensions. Essential supplies are said to be available, but there are still restrictions on movement and media access. Curbs on tourism have been lifted, and restrictions on post-paid mobile services have been removed. On October 14, post-paid mobile telephone service restrictions were lifted in the region, while pre-paid service and internet messaging remain blocked. Public schools have reopened, but parents are hesitant to send their children due to the unstable situation. The former J&K state residents now belong to either the Jammu and Kashmir Union Territory or the Union Territory of Ladakh. J&K UT can elect its legislature, but all administrative districts are controlled by India's federal government. The chief executives of each UT report to India's Home Ministry. The new J&K Union Territory has lieutenant governors reporting to India's Home Ministry. Over 100 federal laws apply, including the Indian Penal Code, while over 150 state laws are being repealed. The J&K assembly cannot make laws on policing or public order, giving New Delhi control. India and the US reaffirmed their strategic partnership during a recent summit meeting. The U.S. government is concerned about the situation in J&K, focusing on the need for economic and political normalcy. They are troubled by prolonged detentions of political leaders and residents, as well as restrictions on communication and internet access. Indian External Affairs Minister Jaishankar withdrew from a meeting with House Members due to concerns raised by Representative Jayapal's resolution urging an end to restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir. In October, India saw significant developments with Block Development Council elections in J&K showing disenchantment with the ruling party. India also allowed European parliamentarians to visit Kashmir, the first foreign officials since July. India allowed a U.S. official to visit J&K for the first time since August, following a visit by 15 ambassadors in January. The delegation's composition and funding raised international concerns about India's Kashmir policies. EU envoys did not participate in the visit, which excluded meetings with detained Kashmiri leaders. The visit aimed to showcase government efforts to \"normalize the situation,\" but faced criticism from opposition parties. India's Supreme Court also ruled against open-ended internet shutdowns in parts of J&K. The court ruled that an open-ended internet shutdown in parts of J&K violated free speech rights, giving authorities a one-week deadline to review all related orders. J&K, formerly a state, was divided into three regions: Kashmir, Jammu, and Ladakh, with the Kashmir Valley being the most populous area. Srinagar was the summer capital with 1.3 million residents, while Jammu city served as the winter capital. The former state of J&K has a diverse population, with roughly half living in the Jammu district. The region has a significant Muslim majority, with Hindus, Sikhs, and Buddhists also present. The Kashmir Valley is predominantly Muslim, while Jammu is two-thirds Hindu. Ladakh has an equal split between Buddhists and Muslims. The princely state had a unique status with a Muslim majority ruled by a Hindu king before the 1947 partition of British India. Kashmir had a diverse population with a Muslim majority ruled by a Hindu king. The economy was agriculture-based, with tourism being a major aspect of commerce. The region's natural beauty was a draw for tourists, but transportation and communication networks were hindered by its remoteness. India's central government provided $40 billion to J&K since 2004. The final status of J&K remained unsettled after Britain's 1947 withdrawal and the partition of India and Pakistan. In 1949, a U.N.-brokered cease-fire established the Line of Control separating Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir from Pakistani-administered Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. Article 370 of the Indian Constitution in 1950 formalized J&K's accession to India, requiring state government concurrence for administrative changes. Article 35A of the Constitution's Appendix prohibited nonresidents from working, attending college, or owning property in J&K. Over time, J&K's special status was eroded, with Article 370 providing constitutional but not political benefits. Repeal of Article 370 became a key policy goal. The repeal of Article 370 in J&K was seen as \"constitutional abuse\" and a key policy goal for the BJP. The integration of J&K into India progressed in the 1950s and 1960s, while the possibility of a U.N.-recommended plebiscite faded. India-Pakistan wars in 1965, 1971, and 1999 did not change territorial control significantly. Pakistan's infiltration into Indian-held Kashmir in 1965 led to a 17-day war with over 6,000 battle deaths. The 1971 war between India and Pakistan resulted in over 6,000 battle deaths, leading to the creation of Bangladesh from East Pakistan. In 1999, Pakistani troops infiltrated J&K to seize strategic high ground near Kargil, but were eventually ejected by Indian forces after three months of combat. Pakistan had disputed the accession process of J&K to India in 1947, leading to U.N. mediation and the issuance of 18 relevant Resolutions. UNSCR 47 of April 1948 recommended steps for a plebiscite in Kashmir, but conditions were never met. US mediation efforts in 1961 and 1962 failed, and President Clinton's involvement in 1999 did not change Kashmir's disputed status. Some believed resolving Kashmir would aid US success in Afghanistan. In recent decades, India has refrained from mediation in Kashmir due to suspicion of foreign motives, self-perception as a regional leader, and belief that mediation favors the weaker party. The 1972 Shimla Agreement and 1999 Lahore Declaration emphasized bilateral negotiations for resolving the issue. The conflict in J&K began in 1989 due to alleged election manipulation, leading to an insurgency for independence or merger with Pakistan. Violence has persisted, with frequent exchanges of fire along the LOC despite a cease-fire since 2003. The Indian government reports 42,000 casualties since 1989. Since 1989, the conflict in J&K has resulted in at least 42,000 casualties, with independent analyses suggesting over 70,000 deaths. India maintains a large security presence in the region. A peace plan for Kashmir was close to being finalized in 2007 but fell through due to various reasons. India accuses Pakistan of fueling the conflict, while Pakistan denies supporting militants and highlights Indian human rights abuses in the region. Separatist militants have targeted civilians, leading to accusations of terrorism. The conflict in J&K has resulted in thousands of casualties since 1989, with India accusing Pakistan of fueling the conflict. The U.S. government criticizes Islamabad for not doing enough to combat anti-India terrorist groups. Analysts argue that the Kashmir conflict is a clash between the Indian government and the Kashmiri people, with pro-independence parties facing restrictions and many Kashmiris feeling alienated. The conflict in J&K has resulted in thousands of casualties since 1989, with India accusing Pakistan of fueling the conflict. Critics argue that the Modi government's policies question the patriotism of Indian Muslims and portray Pakistan as a threat manipulating Kashmiri separatists. Indian officials reject claims of a \"freedom struggle\" in Kashmir, viewing it as a war imposed by Pakistan. Negotiations with Pakistan or Kashmiri separatist groups are deemed ineffective in resolving the conflict. In Kashmir, militancy has been on the rise since 2019, with a significant increase in terrorist incidents and conflict-related deaths during Modi's first five years in office. The killing of a militant commander in 2016 led to mass protests, while separatist violence levels decreased in 2019 following a security crackdown. The lack of a state assembly in early 2019 facilitated New Delhi's constitutional changes, with direct federal control established after the collapse of the BJP-Peoples Democratic Party coalition government in J&K. In December 2018, J&K came under \"President's Rule\" for the first time since 1996, with the state legislature's power under Parliament's authority. On February 14, 2019, an explosives-laden SUV rammed into a convoy carrying paramilitary police in Pulwama, Kashmir, killing at least 40 personnel. Indian jets reportedly bombed a JeM facility in Balakot, Pakistan on February 26, leading to aerial combat with Pakistan. The Pulwama bombing in February 2019 led to tensions between India and Pakistan, with Pakistan repatriating a captured Indian pilot to ease the crisis. The episode raised fears of war between the nuclear-armed powers and hindered prospects for dialogue. The White House called on Pakistan to end support for terrorist groups, while the Trump Administration was criticized for its perceived lack of diplomatic involvement during the crisis. President Trump was criticized for being a bystander during a serious South Asia crisis due to vacancies in key State Department positions. In July 2019, Trump claimed that Indian Prime Minister Modi had asked the US to mediate in the Kashmir dispute, causing uproar in India's Parliament. Indian External Affairs Minister Jaishankar denied the claim, stating that all issues with Pakistan are discussed bilaterally. Issues with Pakistan are discussed only bilaterally and future engagement with Islamabad would require an end to cross border terrorism. The U.S. clarified that Kashmir is a bilateral issue for both parties to discuss and stands ready to assist. Representative Engel reiterated support for the U.S. position on Kashmir and called on Pakistan to dismantle terrorist infrastructure on its soil. Secretary of State Pompeo was directly told by the Indian official that any discussion on Kashmir would need to be warranted. President Trump's warm reception of Pakistan's leader and desire for their help in Afghanistan, along with U.S. support for an IMF bailout of Pakistan, caused concern among Indian analysts. They criticized Washington for linking India and Pakistan and questioned Modi's trust in the U.S. Trump's claims of mediating on Kashmir led to India moving troops to the region in preparation for repealing Article 370. The J&K government in Kashmir issued orders cancelling a religious pilgrimage and requiring tourists to leave the region due to terror threats. This caused panic among Kashmiris fearing the removal of their constitutional protections. Senior political leaders, including former chief ministers, were placed under house arrest, schools were closed, and all telecommunications were curtailed, including internet and landline telephone service. Pakistan's government denounced these actions. The Indian government introduced legislation to abrogate Article 370 and reorganize J&K into two Union Territories. Prime Minister Modi praised the move, stating it would ensure integration and empowerment in the region. The Indian government's decision to abrogate Article 370 and reorganize J&K into two Union Territories was supported by the National Democratic Alliance coalition partners and many opposition parties. The move was popular among the Indian public, possibly due to a wave of nationalism. Proponents see it as a necessary correction of a historic injustice, despite claims that J&K's special status did not hinder its development. For example, J&K's per capita income was higher than seven other states in FY2014-FY2015. J&K's economy grew at 6.8% in FY2017-FY2018, outpacing eight states and slightly below the national average. It has a literacy rate of nearly 69%, ranking higher than five states. J&K also has a life expectancy of 73.5 years, ranking 3rd among states. In 2019, negative economic news led to criticism of the government, prompting suspicions of a shift in national conversation towards Hindu nationalism. Some analysts suggest that President Trump's comments in July may have influenced Indian officials to act quickly in Kashmir to prevent Pakistan from using it as a bargaining chip. Indian officials reportedly informed Secretary of State Pompeo about their plans to revoke J&K's special status, but the State Department claims they were not consulted. Concerns have been raised about detentions and individual rights in Kashmir. The spokeswoman addressed reports of detentions in Kashmir and emphasized the importance of respecting human rights and maintaining peace. She reiterated support for direct dialogue between India and Pakistan on Kashmir and other issues, emphasizing the need for observing the rule of law and international norms. The U.S. policy remains unchanged, and lawmakers expressed hope for democratic principles in India and called on Pakistan to uphold human rights. The US expressed concerns about human rights violations in J&K and urged India to engage with local leaders and hold promised elections. Ambassador Wells testified about the situation in Kashmir during a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee hearing. Ambassador Wells expressed concerns about the lack of normalcy in Kashmir, including detentions and security restrictions. She called on Indian authorities to restore everyday services swiftly and welcomed Pakistan's stance against Kashmiri militancy. Some viewed the hearing as a PR loss for India, emphasizing the need for direct dialogue between India and Pakistan to reduce tensions. In October, Members of Congress criticized India's restrictions on communications and movement in Jammu and Kashmir. Senator Chris Van Hollen was denied permission to visit J&K, while Senator Mark Warner expressed concern over the situation. The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee held a hearing on human rights in South Asia, focusing on the Kashmir issue. Representative Engel criticized the Trump administration for not holding countries accountable for violating human rights. During a hearing, Representative Engel criticized the Trump administration for not holding countries accountable for human rights violations, specifically mentioning India's revocation of Article 370 in Kashmir. The situation in Kashmir was described as a humanitarian crisis, with concerns raised about ongoing human rights violations in the region. The Congress's Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission held a hearing on \"Jammu and Kashmir in Context,\" where multiple House Members reiterated these concerns. The USCIRF Commissioner discussed religious freedom restrictions in India and ongoing human rights violations in Kashmir. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concern over the humanitarian crisis in Kashmir and called for restoring telecommunications, lifting the lockdown, and releasing detainees. A resolution was introduced condemning human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir and supporting Kashmiri self-determination. H.Res. 745, introduced on December 6, 2019, with 40 cosponsors, condemns human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir, urges the Indian government to respect human rights, lift restrictions on telecommunications and internet, release detainees, and allow international observers and journalists access to the region. Islamabad issued a strong response to New Delhi's actions. Pakistan responded strongly to India's actions in Kashmir, calling them illegal and in breach of international law. They downgraded diplomatic ties, halted trade, and suspended cross-border transport services. Pakistan's prime minister warned of potential future incidents like Pulwama and highlighted the risk of a direct military confrontation between the two nuclear-armed states. Despite diplomatic isolation, Pakistan received support from Turkey and China, leading to a UNSC session on Kashmir for the first time in over five decades. Pakistan's response to India's actions in Kashmir included downgrading diplomatic ties, halting trade, and suspending cross-border transport services. The UNSC discussed Kashmir for the first time in over five decades, with Pakistan facing limited options to respond due to reduced military capabilities and international credibility issues. Islamabad may rely on diplomacy and hope that India's policies in Kashmir and citizenship laws will backfire. The recent tensions between India, Pakistan, and China, sparked by India's actions in Kashmir and changes in citizenship laws, could damage India's reputation and diplomatic relations with Arab states. China expressed concern over India's actions in Kashmir, particularly the status change for Ladakh, which Beijing claims as Chinese territory. China has vowed to support Pakistan on the international stage regarding the Kashmir issue. China has supported Pakistan's efforts to bring the Kashmir issue before the U.N. Security Council, warning India of risks for its actions. The U.N. Secretary-General called for restraint and expressed concern over human rights restrictions in Indian Kashmir. Beijing's support led to UNSC consultations with Russia, indicating Kashmir's disputed status. India maintains its view on the matter. In September, the U.N. Human Rights Council expressed concerns about the human rights situation in Kashmir. The European Parliament also urged India to restore the rights of the population in Indian-administered Kashmir. China and Pakistan requested another closed-door meeting on Kashmir at the U.N. Security Council, but it has not happened yet. Several European Parliament members and world leaders have called on New Delhi to restore the basic freedoms of Kashmiris, expressing concerns about the human rights situation in the region. The Saudi government has agreed to host a special meeting on Kashmir in early 2020. Despite being popular with the Indian public, New Delhi's actions on August 5 faced criticism for lack of consultation and legal scholars opined that the government had overstepped its authority. The Modi government's actions in J&K have been criticized for lack of consultation and seen as undemocratic by many legal scholars. The government's argument of central rule since 2018 is rejected as a \"constitutional coup\" by observers. Critics view the moves as a total undermining of democracy. Critics see the government's actions in J&K as undemocratic and an attack on India's secular identity, driven by BJP's Hindu majoritarianism ideals. The BJP aims to bring back Hindu Pandits to Kashmir, potentially creating segregated enclaves, despite little local support. New Delhi also aims to lift residency restrictions and promote economic development in the region. The Indian government's actions in Kashmir have been criticized for alleged human rights abuses, excessive use of force, and a sweeping security crackdown. The Modi government faces renewed criticisms for widely alleged abuses, including torture and acting under vaguely worded laws that facilitate abuses. The government is reportedly in contravention of several U.N. commitments. The Indian government is reportedly not fulfilling its U.N. commitments, including allowing special rapporteurs to visit India. In 2019, Indian officials announced they would no longer engage with U.N. mandate holders. India leads in internet shutdowns, with 134 in 2018 compared to Pakistan's 12. The ongoing internet blackout in Kashmir, lasting over five months, has been criticized by U.N. Special Rapporteurs as collective punishment. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International also condemn the communication blackout. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International criticize the communications blackout in Kashmir, deemed impermissible by India's Supreme Court. The internet shutdown, the longest in a democracy, has caused significant losses for businesses. Concerns have been raised about India's reputation as a secular, pluralist nation due to its actions in Kashmir and controversial Hindu nationalist policies. The Modi/BJP government's controversial policies, including the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and actions in Kashmir, have led to widespread protests and criticism. These actions are seen as damaging India's international reputation as a secular, pluralist democratic society. Former Indian officials and analysts warn that these moves could increase domestic instability and hinder economic reforms, impacting India's standing on the global stage. India's international reputation as a multicultural, pluralist society has been questioned due to the rise of Hindu majoritarianism. Concerns have been raised by various groups, including the liberal international media, the U.S. Congress, and the Islamic world. Analysts warn that India needs to make course corrections to prevent serious external challenges in the new year. Modi's domestic policies have eroded India's goodwill and image, impacting its rise as a major regional player and U.S. partner. Analysts express concern that India's government may be testing bipartisan consensus in Washington by leaning towards majoritarianism and repression. Some Democratic lawmakers are reportedly upset with India's domestic policies, leading to a potential shift in U.S. support for India. The introduction of House resolutions on Kashmir by Democrats indicates a growing partisan divide on India in American foreign policy. The U.S. has traditionally aimed to prevent India-Pakistan conflict escalation, but recent years have seen closer ties between Washington and New Delhi. The Trump Administration has strengthened ties with India while distancing from Pakistan, suspending security assistance to Pakistan in 2018. Despite viewing India as a key anchor in the Indo-Pacific strategy, the US recognizes Pakistan's role in Afghan reconciliation. President Trump's offer to mediate on Kashmir was seen as a potentially unwise strategic shift. The US remains focused on preventing conflict over Kashmir from destabilizing South Asia. The absence of key officials in the US State Department raises concerns about the administration's readiness for India-Pakistan crises, potentially increasing regional instability. Some analysts worry that the hands-off approach of the Trump Administration towards international crises could weaken American influence. Questions arise for Congress regarding India's actions in Kashmir and the US's leverage and policies to address instability. The U.S. government's role in managing India-Pakistan conflict and addressing instability in Kashmir, as well as concerns about human rights abuses and religious freedom in India, are key questions that need to be addressed."
