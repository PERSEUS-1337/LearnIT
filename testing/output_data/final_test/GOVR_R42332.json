    "content": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established in 1970 to consolidate federal pollution control responsibilities. EPA's responsibilities include regulating air quality, water quality, pesticides, and toxic substances, managing solid and hazardous wastes, and cleaning up environmental contamination. EPA also awards grants to assist states and local governments in complying with federal pollution control requirements. The EPA and other agencies were funded under continuing resolutions until the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 was enacted on December 23, 2011. The House considered but did not pass a bill for FY2012 appropriations for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies. No bill was introduced in the Senate for funding these agencies. The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies released a draft bill for FY2012, providing $8.46 billion for EPA, with a 0.16% rescission. This was an 18.3% increase from the House proposal but 1.8% less than the Senate subcommittee draft. The enacted EPA FY2012 appropriation was $219.1 million less than FY2011 and $510.0 million below the President's FY2012 proposal. The FY2012 EPA budget was $8.68 billion, $510.0 million below the President's request. Recent EPA regulatory actions were central to the appropriations debate, with concerns raised by some Members. P.L. 112-74 included provisions affecting EPA actions, but not as many as proposed. The House Appropriations Committee proposed over 25 provisions in the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, H.R. 2584. The Senate subcommittee draft did not include similar provisions to restrict EPA actions. Congressional interest in provisions affecting EPA program activities was highlighted in response to P.L. 112-74 and H.R. 2584. The report extracts provisions from P.L. 112-74 and H.R. 2584 related to EPA programs, without providing a comprehensive analysis. The scope and impacts of the provisions are subject to interpretation, with only clearly identifiable provisions included. Funding levels for EPA accounts and program activities for FY2011 and FY2012 are summarized. The report provides an overview of enacted appropriations for FY2012 compared to previous years, including highlights of provisions in P.L. 112-74 and a comparison of selected provisions in H.R. 2584. Amendments from House floor debate are not included in the tables. The House floor debate on H.R. 2584 was suspended before completion, so details of submitted amendments are not included. Concerns about EPA's FY2012 funding focused on various environmental projects and initiatives, including wastewater infrastructure, air pollution control, climate change research, and Superfund site cleanup. Funding for specific water quality programs like the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay and Puget Sound were also of interest. EPA's funding has been allocated under eight statutory accounts since FY1996. Table 1 compares FY2012 enacted amounts for EPA with the House Appropriations Committee's proposed amounts in H.R. 2584. The FY2012 enacted appropriations for the EPA accounts reflect a decrease from FY2011 levels and the President's FY2012 request, with some exceptions for specific programs like the Hazardous Substance Superfund and the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund. The \"Oil Spill Response\" account was renamed to \"Inland Oil Spill Program\" to clarify jurisdiction for oil spill response in the inland coastal zone. The FY2012 appropriations for the EPA accounts were below the recommended levels in the Senate subcommittee draft, except for the Hazardous Substance Superfund and Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund. The House Committee proposed significant reductions for State and Tribal Assistance Grants, particularly for Clean Water State Revolving Funds. The FY2011 enacted and FY2012 requested levels were smaller than the decreases for the Clean Water SRF. FY2012 enacted amounts varied for program activities below the account level. The FY2012 enacted levels would decrease after a 0.16% rescission. The conference report provides a comparison of FY2012 appropriations with the President's request and FY2011 levels. Comparing with FY2011 enacted is not possible for all program activities. Conferees accepted the reorganization of the budget presentation for certain program areas. The budget presentation for certain program areas in FY2012 proposed by the President included consolidation and modifications of line items, making comparisons with FY2011 enacted funding levels not comparable. Transfers from the Hazardous Substance Superfund account to the Science and Technology (S&T) account and the Environmental Programs and Management (EPM) account were consistent with proposals for FY2012 and enacted levels for FY2011. The proposed budget for FY2012 included transfers from the Hazardous Substance Superfund account to the Science and Technology (S&T) account and the Environmental Programs and Management (EPM) account. Comparisons with FY2011 enacted funding levels were affected by a 0.16% rescission. Additionally, a rescission of $50.0 million was included in the \"Administrative Provisions\" for EPA under P.L. 112-74, with specified amounts from various grant programs. The Senate subcommittee proposed a $34.0 million rescission from unobligated balances funded through the Superfund and STAG accounts, while the FY2012 request suggested a $50.0 million rescission without specifying the account. Similar rescissions have been included in EPA appropriations since FY2006. Previous rescissions include $140.0 million from the STAG account in FY2011 and $40.0 million from the STAG and Hazardous Substance Superfund accounts in FY2010. Additionally, the FY2012 enacted appropriations allowed the Administrator to transfer up to $300.0 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. The FY2012 enacted appropriations allowed the Administrator to transfer up to $300.0 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, supporting projects under the GLRI and Great Lakes Water Agreement programs. EPA has proposed regulations implementing pollution control statutes, raising concerns about overreach and costs. The EPA has faced criticism for exceeding its authority and not fully considering the costs of proposed rules. However, the agency argues that its actions are in line with legal mandates and that cost-benefit analyses are conducted. Recent focus has been on Clean Air Act regulations for greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. Other laws, such as the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act, have also been debated. The FY2012 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill included provisions affecting EPA actions and authorities, with fewer administrative and general provisions in the enacted version compared to the proposed House Appropriations Committee version. The administrative provisions were similar to those in the House committee-reported bill, while the general provisions were a slightly revised subset. The FY2012 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill included provisions affecting EPA actions and authorities, with fewer administrative and general provisions in the enacted version compared to the proposed House Appropriations Committee version. The administrative provisions were similar to those in the House committee-reported bill, while the general provisions were a slightly revised subset. Additionally, three other provisions were included in the EPA Administrative Provisions setting terms and conditions for the use of FY2012 appropriations. The FY2012 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill included provisions affecting EPA actions and authorities. The bill allowed for funds to be transferred from other accounts if the Inland Oil Spill Program account was at risk of being exhausted within 30 days. The transferred funds would be reimbursed by the U.S. Coast Guard from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. Division E, Title IV of P.L. 112-74 included provisions specifying requirements for certain air quality regulatory actions, greenhouse gas emission reporting, and Clean Water Act permitting requirements for silvicultural activities. Section 425 of Division E of the FY2012 appropriations law required a comprehensive report on federal climate change programs. Section 426 and 427 prohibited the use of appropriations for certain Clean Air Act regulations. Section 432 transferred authority to regulate air emissions from EPA to the Department of the Interior. Section 429 in P.L. 112-74 transferred authority to regulate air emissions from EPA to Department of the Interior in the Outer Continental Shelf off Alaska's north coast. It prohibited EPA from requiring permits under the Clean Water Act for stormwater runoff from silvicultural activities. The provisions in the FY2012 appropriations bill are similar to those proposed in H.R. The FY2012 appropriations bill included provisions similar to those proposed in H.R. 2584, with recurring reporting requirements dating back to FY2009 and FY2010. These provisions were also retained in the FY2011 Full-Year Continuing Appropriations law. The FY2012 appropriations conference report, H.Rept. 112-331, included language requiring refinements to EPA's policies for conducting assessments under the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS). H.R. 2584 contained provisions restricting EPA's use of funds for regulatory actions, including amendments added during full committee markup. Title IV of H.R. 2584 contained provisions related to EPA programs and regulations, while Title V included amendments to the Clean Water Act and FIFRA in response to EPA's consideration of permits for pesticide discharges. The House debated H.R. 2584 from July 25-28, 2011, with concerns raised about EPA actions and roughly 150 amendments considered. These provisions would have impacted ongoing EPA activities, including those addressing greenhouse gas emissions. The curr_chunk discusses ongoing and anticipated EPA activities related to various environmental issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, hazardous air pollutants, and water quality impacts. It also highlights directive provisions in legislation that could restrict EPA's regulatory actions. The provisions are categorized by program areas like air quality, climate change, water quality, and waste management. The curr_chunk discusses provisions in legislation that could restrict EPA's regulatory actions, including those related to air quality, climate change, water quality, and waste management. H.R. 1, the FY2011 Full-Year Continuing resolution, included provisions that were not ultimately enacted into law. Since FY1996, EPA's appropriations have been requested and appropriated by Congress within eight statutory accounts. Table A-1 shows the amounts enacted for FY2008 through FY2012, including transfers between accounts and funding levels for grant programs in the State and Tribal Assistance Grants account. The data is based on information from congressional reports accompanying annual appropriations bills."
