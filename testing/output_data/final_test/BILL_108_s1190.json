    "content": "The Act titled \"Next Generation Hispanic Serving Institutions Act\" establishes postbaccalaureate opportunities for Hispanic Americans under Title V of the Higher Education Act of 1965. This includes redesignating sections and promoting postbaccalaureate opportunities for Hispanic Americans. Congress finds that by 2050, 1 in 4 Americans will be of Hispanic origin. Despite this growth, Hispanics are underrepresented in advanced degrees and instructional faculty in the United States. Increasing the number of Hispanics pursuing postbaccalaureate studies is crucial for future research and advanced study capacity. Hispanic-serving institutions are leading in increasing Hispanics attaining graduate and professional degrees. 25% of Hispanics who received master's degrees in 1999-2000 earned them at these institutions. Between 1991 and 2000, the number of Hispanic students earning master's degrees at these institutions grew significantly. Expanding the capacity of Hispanic-serving institutions for graduate and professional degree programs is in the national interest. The role of research at Hispanic-serving institutions is crucial for graduate education and undergraduate preparation in science and technology. University research is integral to the institution's mission.
