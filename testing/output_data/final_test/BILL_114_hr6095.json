    "content": "The \"Computer Science for All Act of 2016\" may be cited as the short title. The findings section follows. Congress finds that computer science is crucial for industry transformation, job creation, innovation, and productivity. Over 550,000 tech jobs are unfilled in the US, with a projected 1.4 million new jobs by 2020. However, 70% of these jobs will remain vacant due to a shortage of qualified graduates. Knowledge of computer science is essential for all individuals, not just those in the tech sector. Providing computer science education in schools is vital for student success and workforce development in the 21st century economy. While 90% of parents want computer science in schools, only 25% of elementary and secondary schools offer quality instruction. African-Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and Pacific Islanders are underrepresented in the tech sector. For example, they make up 27% of the workforce but only 13.8% of science and engineering professionals. Women of color also face an opportunity gap in STEAM education. Women of color face an achievement gap in science and engineering education, with only 15.7 percent receiving bachelor's degrees in these majors. In computer science, women overall struggle to access education, with only 18 percent of bachelor's degrees awarded to women in 2012. Women of color fare even worse, receiving only 6.6 percent of these degrees. In 2015, disparities in enrollment and academic achievement were evident in AP Computer Science exams, with only 22% of students being women and 13% African-American or Latino. Additionally, only 184 Native American students took the exam, representing less than half a percent of test-takers despite making up 1.1% of the student population. The curr_chunk is a section titled \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" In this Act, \"computational thinking\" encompasses problem-solving processes for computer execution, involving software and hardware understanding, logic, abstraction, algorithm design, programming, information security, and societal computing impact. \"Computer science education\" includes various aspects of learning in the field. \"Science education\" covers computational thinking, software and hardware design, algorithm implementation, programming languages, information security, artificial intelligence, and social impacts of computing. Eligible Tribal school refers to a school operated by the Bureau of Indian. The term \"school\" includes those operated by the Bureau of Indian Education, pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, or as defined in the Tribally Controlled Schools Act of 1988. The term \"institution of higher education\" is defined in the Higher Education Act of 1965, while \"local educational agency\" is defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The term \"poverty line\" is also defined. The term \"STEAM\" refers to science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics, including computer science. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education. SEC. 4. GRANTS TO STATES, LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES, AND ELIGIBLE TRIBAL SCHOOLS. The Secretary will award grants to States, local educational agencies, and eligible Tribal schools that demonstrate an ability to expand computer science education for all students, including underrepresented groups, and serve as models for national replication. States, agencies, or schools can apply for grants as part of a consortium or in partnership with other entities. Grants awarded under this section shall be for a maximum of 5 years. Applicants must submit plans for ensuring all high school students have access to computer science education within 5 years and all students have a progression of computer science education from prekindergarten. The curr_chunk discusses the progression of computer science education from prekindergarten through middle school, expanding access to STEAM classes, monitoring project activities, and sustaining project activities after the grant period ends. It also emphasizes reducing enrollment and achievement gaps for underrepresented groups. The grant funds are to be used for training teachers in computer science, expanding access to learning materials, creating plans for STEAM class expansion, and providing support for underrepresented students in STEAM fields. The grant funds can be used for building collaborations with various educational institutions and organizations to support underrepresented students in STEAM fields. The grant funds can be used for building collaborations with educational institutions and organizations to support underrepresented students in STEAM fields, including recruiting instructional personnel, sustaining project activities, disseminating effective practices, and limiting equipment purchases to 15 percent of the grant. Additionally, the Secretary may reserve up to 2.5 percent of funds for national activities such as technical assistance, evaluation, and dissemination. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of Appropriations: $250,000,000 is authorized to carry out this section. SEC. 5. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\nGrantees must submit reports twice a year on grant fund usage, including data on students served by race, ethnicity, gender, and lunch eligibility. The Secretary will analyze these reports and make recommendations for program expansion to Congress within 5 years of the first grant award."
