    "content": "Several temporary tax provisions expired at the end of 2013, with more set to expire at the end of 2014. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) of 2013 made some tax cuts permanent and indexed the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for inflation. However, uncertainty in the tax code remains as certain provisions were only temporarily extended through 2013. These provisions, known as \"tax extenders,\" are regularly extended by Congress. The research tax credit and other temporary tax provisions have been extended multiple times since being enacted. The 113th Congress has considered legislation to extend expired tax provisions, with the Senate proposing the EXPIRE Act to extend provisions through 2015. The House, on the other hand, has voted to permanently extend certain expired tax provisions as part of the Jobs for America Act. The America Gives More Act of 2014 (H.R. 4719) passed the House on July 17, 2014, making several charitable-related provisions permanent. Chairman Camp's Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposes to make certain provisions permanent, including the R&D tax credit and increased expensing under Section 179. The President's FY2015 Budget proposal also includes permanent extensions or modifications for various expired provisions such as conservation easements, small business stock exclusion, and renewable energy tax credits. The President's FY2015 Budget proposes to make various tax provisions permanent, including the R&D tax credit and Work Opportunity Tax Credit. Temporary extensions are suggested for provisions like the tax credit for cellulosic biofuel and energy-efficient new homes. Congress has a history of retroactively extending expired tax provisions. The report provides an overview of retroactively extended tax provisions under ATRA, including those expired in 2011 and extended through 2013. Specific extender provisions can be found in other CRS reports. The tax code contains temporary tax provisions, often referred to as \"tax extenders,\" which are expiring provisions temporarily extended by Congress. These provisions are typically extended for a short period of time, leading to a growing number of provisions considered as \"tax extenders.\" Congress may choose to enact temporary tax provisions for various reasons. Enacting temporary tax provisions allows Congress to evaluate their effectiveness before extension. Temporary provisions can provide relief during economic weakness or disasters and may be enacted for budgetary reasons. However, the rationale for temporary provisions is undermined if they are regularly extended without review. In practice, temporary tax provisions are regularly extended without systematic review, despite the rationale for enacting them temporarily. Dr. Rosanne Altshuler highlighted the importance of expiration dates to prompt policymakers to assess the costs and benefits of special tax treatment. However, in reality, there is a lack of systematic review, and extenders are typically passed as a package without individual analysis. Some temporary tax provisions expired during the 112th Congress, indicating a failure to evaluate whether the benefits outweigh the costs. Tax incentives for alcohol fuels, such as ethanol, were not extended beyond 2011 as their benefits were found to be duplicative and not increase consumption. Tax policy can also address temporary circumstances like economic stimulus or disaster relief through measures like bonus depreciation. Various tax policies have been enacted for relief following natural disasters. Tax policies can be enacted temporarily for budgetary reasons, such as the exclusion of mortgage forgiveness from taxable income during the housing crisis and payroll tax cuts. The Congressional Budget Office assumes temporary tax cuts expire as scheduled, making it easier to offset short-term extensions rather than long-term ones. Congress may allow provisions enacted for temporary situations to expire once resolved. Tax provisions are regularly extended, leading to potential overstatement of projected revenues in the long-term. Temporary tax benefits act as federal subsidies favoring certain activities, influencing economic behavior and resource allocation. Evaluating extenders based on economic efficiency, equity, and simplicity is crucial. Temporary tax provisions may be efficient but not equitable, or vice versa. Policymakers face trade-offs in balancing these factors. Tax extenders can provide subsidies to encourage specific activities and may improve economic welfare by addressing market failures. Efficiency depends on whether the extender remedies a market failure, and it may be more effective than direct subsidies. Market distortions from taxes and other factors can impact resource allocation, requiring policymakers to prioritize economic objectives. Tax extenders can provide subsidies to encourage specific activities and may improve economic welfare by addressing market failures. Direct spending programs are more successful at targeting resources than indirect subsidies like tax extenders. Tax fairness is crucial for a socially desirable distribution of the tax burden, with horizontal equity requiring equal treatment for individuals in similar positions. Vertical equity ensures fair tax burdens based on different abilities to pay. Extenders are often seen as inequitable as they benefit those with greater ability to pay taxes. Tax extenders can disproportionately benefit individuals with higher incomes, reducing the progressivity of the tax system and impacting equity. For example, two teachers claiming a deduction for classroom expenses may receive different benefits based on their income tax brackets. This results in higher-income taxpayers receiving a greater benefit, despite their presumably greater ability to pay taxes. Tax extenders can benefit higher-income taxpayers more, reducing tax system progressivity and equity. Complexity of tax code raises administration costs for government and individuals. Congressional Budget Office provides estimated costs for extending tax provisions. The cost of extending various tax provisions as passed by the House can be found in Table 3. According to CBO's estimates, extending expiring tax provisions over the 2014 to 2024 budget window would cost $963.4 billion. Extending certain provisions that expired in 2013 would cost $762.1 billion, while extending bonus depreciation would cost $296.4 billion. Extending expansions to the child tax credit, the earned income tax credit, and the American Opportunity Tax Credit would cost $165.4 billion. The majority of the cost (79%) is associated with provisions that expired at the end of 2013. The cost of extending tax provisions expired in 2013 is not included in CBO's revenue baseline, leading to smaller projected budget deficits. The President's FY2015 budget assumes certain tax credits are made permanent, resulting in lower revenue collection compared to CBO's baseline. The cost of a short-term extension is less than extending provisions through the budget. The cost of extending temporary tax provisions expired in 2013 is not included in CBO's revenue baseline. The short-term cost of extending provisions is less than the long-term cost, as many of the expired provisions are tax deferrals or timing provisions. For example, extending 50% bonus depreciation would reduce revenues by $73.6 billion in 2015, but only cost $2.9 billion over the 10-year budget window. Many tax provisions expired at the end of 2013, categorized into individual, business, charitable, energy, community development, or disaster relief. The EXPIRE Act aims to extend these provisions, with the cost detailed in Table 2. Notably, the above-the-line deduction for classroom expenses for school teachers is one of the longest-standing individual provisions that have been regularly extended since 2002. The health coverage tax credit, along with other individual provisions like state and local sales tax deduction, tuition deduction, mortgage insurance deduction, and employer-provided mass transit benefits, has been regularly extended since 2002. The health coverage tax credit was initially enacted without an expiration date in 2002 but was given a termination date of January 1, 2014, in 2011. Despite not being included in the chairman's mark of the EXPIRE Act, a two-year extension was agreed upon during the Senate Finance Committee markup in April 2014. The Senate Finance Committee markup in April 2014 agreed to extend most expired business provisions, including the research tax credit, rum excise tax cover-over, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, and active financing exception. Bonus depreciation and enhanced expensing allowances, seen as economic stimulus measures, are also set to expire. The EXPIRE Act proposed extending these provisions, except for the look-through treatment of payments between controlled foreign corporations, seven-year amortization for motorsports racing facilities, and special expensing. The EXPIRE Act proposed extending most expired business provisions, including the research tax credit, rum excise tax cover-over, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, and active financing exception. The House has also voted to make permanent several business-related extenders. Provisions providing an enhanced deduction for non-corporate businesses donating food inventory were first enacted in response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The EXPIRE Act extends charitable provisions through 2015, including contributions of capital gain real property for conservation purposes. The House also voted to make permanent these extenders. Energy-related provisions like the renewable energy production tax credit are also addressed. The EXPIRE Act extends various tax incentives for energy efficiency improvements, alternative technology vehicles, and alternative fuel vehicle refueling property. Some provisions were initially excluded but later added, including the PTC and provisions for residential and commercial energy efficiency. The EXPIRE Act extends tax incentives for energy efficiency improvements, alternative technology vehicles, and alternative fuel vehicle refueling property. The special rule for reporting income from electric transmission restructurings was included. Provisions not extended include tax credits for energy-efficient appliances and certain refinery property expensing. Community development provisions like Qualified Zone Academy Bonds (QZABs) and New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) were also extended. The EXPIRE Act, enacted in 2000, includes tax incentives for economic activity in American Samoa and empowerment zones set to expire in 2013. The Act extends provisions for QZABs, NMTC, and American Samoa economic development credit. It also extends empowerment zone tax incentives and modifies NMTC to allow unused allocations for a manufacturing communities tax credit. Disaster relief tax provisions expired in 2013, including tax-exempt bond financing for New York Liberty Zone facilities and nonrecognition of gain for areas damaged by 2008 Midwestern storms. Several other temporary disaster relief provisions have expired in recent years. The EXPIRE Act does not include disaster relief provisions that expired in 2013. Six tax provisions are set to expire at the end of 2014, including incentives for alternative fuels, fuel cell vehicles, and hydrogen refueling property. The Act would extend these energy-related provisions and other expiring provisions related to multiemployer defined benefit plans. The EXPIRE Act (S. 2260) would extend most expiring provisions through 2015, costing an estimated $84.9 billion over the 2014-2024 budget window. The House has passed legislation to make certain expired provisions permanent, with a different approach to tax extenders. The House has passed legislation to make nine expired provisions permanent, reducing revenues by $511.4 billion over 10 years. Some provisions were part of the Jobs for America Act and the America Gives More Act of 2014. The Ways and Means Committee reported legislation to make two international-related provisions permanent. Proposed legislation includes policy changes, such as a permanent 20% research credit. The House-passed proposals aim to provide a permanent 20% research credit for taxpayers' qualified research expenditures, basic research payments, and qualified energy research conducted by an energy research consortium. Additionally, the proposals include indexing the limits for inflation starting in 2015 and expanding the list of eligible property for 50% bonus depreciation. The ATRA extended temporary tax provisions, costing $73.6 billion, including research credit, wind production tax credit, and active financing income exception. Some traditional extenders were not renewed. Several charitable provisions and energy-related incentives, including deductions for donations of computer equipment and book inventory to schools, as well as tax incentives for ethanol and environmental remediation costs, were allowed to expire in ATRA. Additionally, the estate tax look-through rule for regulated investment company stock was not extended, along with other provisions that expired at the end of 2012. Several provisions, including Section 1603 grants and 100% bonus depreciation, expired at the end of 2012. Other expired provisions included disaster relief measures like Gulf Opportunity (GO) Zone provisions and tax provisions related to the 2008 Midwestern Storms and Hurricane Ike."
