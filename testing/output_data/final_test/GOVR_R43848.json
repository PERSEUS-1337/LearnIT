    "content": "Cyberspace is now considered a critical domain that must be secured to protect national interests. The Obama Administration's 2010 National Security Strategy highlights cybersecurity threats as a significant challenge. Cyberattacks are a common element in international conflicts, targeting government networks, media outlets, banking services, and critical infrastructure, with varying effects from defacing websites to damaging industrial infrastructure. Cyberattacks are difficult to identify and thwart due to their commonality, politically motivated crowd-sourcing, and easy access to online criminal organizations. State-sponsored cyberattacks are suspected but hard to prove, given the anonymity of actors in cyberspace. This report focuses on cyberattacks as a form of warfare, distinct from espionage, cybercrime, or intimidation. Distinguishing between cyberwar, cyberterrorism, cyberespionage, and cybercrime is challenging, with both state and non-state actors engaging in cyberattacks daily. The threshold for cyberwar remains undefined, with experts debating its conditions. The debate over whether cyberattacks constitute cyberwarfare continues among experts. Some argue that cyberwarfare involves physical destruction in cyberspace, while others have a broader definition that includes data manipulation and service disruption. As military operations rely more on information technology, vulnerabilities in network-centric operations become more apparent. A cyberattack on military assets could be considered an act of war, triggering a response under the Law of Armed Conflict. The Internet is part of cyberspace, which includes networks not connected to it. The Department of Defense views cyberspace as a global domain like air, sea, and space. Cyberspace is defined as interdependent networks of information technology infrastructures. The physical network, logical network, and cyber-persona layers are key components of cyberspace. The physical network includes geographic and physical components, the logical network abstracts elements from the physical network, and the cyber-persona layer creates digital representations of individual or entity identities. Challenges in cyberspace include attributing responsibility, insider threats, and targeting attacks. Cyberspace operations utilize capabilities to achieve objectives through legitimate network access. The information environment consists of individuals, organizations, and systems that process and act on information. Various tools are used to achieve effects in cyberspace, ranging from disrupting access to online services to destroying network operations. Malware, including bots, viruses, and worms, are common cyber weapons used by actors ranging from individual hackers to nation states. Botnets, created by bots, allow for remote control of linked computers. Viruses infect hosts, while worms are self-replicating programs. The first known PC virus was created in 1986 by two brothers in Pakistan. The brothers from Lahore innocently included their contact details in the code of their computer shop creation, which eventually spread globally. Malware can target specific companies through methods like infecting popular websites or sending malicious emails. Air-gapped networks, not connected to the internet, can still be infected through external devices like thumb drives. Botnets, also known as robotic networks, are chains of computers linked together by a program that allows a single operator to control them. These networks can be used for both malicious purposes, such as spreading viruses and worms, or for legitimate communication. Botnets exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems like Microsoft Windows to take over computers and turn them into \"zombies\" that can be controlled remotely. The majority of email spam is generated by botnets without the knowledge of the computer's owner. Botnets are operated remotely, with owners often unaware that their computers are part of a botnet. Early operators were skilled coders, but now there is an underground industry of botnet providers. Bots became easier to use in 2004, resulting in a surge of email spam. Botnets can also launch denial-of-service attacks, flooding targets with requests and causing service outages. DDoS attacks are distributed and utilize botnets to overwhelm a server, causing service outages. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the target's software, with the severity measured by duration. Unlike malware, DDoS attacks consist of legitimate requests but at a higher rate, aiming to render networks unavailable. A DDoS attack utilizes botnets to overwhelm networks, causing service outages. Attacks can have multiple vectors, amplifying their strength and making attribution difficult. The decentralized nature of the Internet could potentially allow a DDoS attack to take down the entire web by targeting root servers. The potential for a DDoS attack to bring down the entire web by targeting root servers has not yet been realized. Retaliatory hacking, known as \"active defense,\" is being considered by the DOD as a response to network breaches. However, uncertainties in attack attribution and legal concerns under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 complicate such operations. The military would only engage in counterattacks during a national security crisis, but companies may be encouraged to participate in defensive actions. During a national security crisis, the government may encourage companies to engage in retaliatory hacking as a first line of defense for critical infrastructure. DARPA has a Cyber Grand Challenge program to develop automated security systems for responding to cyberattacks. Attacks on information technology can destroy, degrade, or exfiltrate data. Cyberwarfare targets government and military networks, as well as critical infrastructure and industrial control systems. In cyberwarfare, nation states target government and military networks to gain intelligence or plant malicious code for future disruption. The Pentagon experienced a major breach in 2008 due to an infected thumb drive, leading to a cleanup operation named Buckshot Yankee. Malware could have hidden functions like disabling communications or spreading disinformation. Civilian critical infrastructure, owned by the private sector, is vital for a nation's operations. Critical infrastructure sectors owned by the private sector, such as energy, transportation, financial services, food supplies, and communications, are vulnerable to cyberattacks due to reliance on open-source software, third-party utilities, and interconnected networks. Large-scale industrial control systems like SCADA systems are particularly at risk, as they control operations and can be targeted to cause significant disruptions. This includes specialized equipment like uranium enrichment plants as well as everyday systems like heating and air conditioning. The capability to remotely control industrial hardware for maintenance and operations purposes makes these machines vulnerable to cyberattacks, with attacks against operations technology (OT) having the potential to produce kinetic effects. Nation states, hacker groups, and criminal organizations may use networked technology for strategic effects, making attribution of cyberattacks challenging. Cyberwarriors and cyberhactivists may work together but have different motivations. Cyberwarriors are agents of nation states who conduct cyberattacks to support strategic objectives, sometimes without government authorization. They are often blamed by the host country when accusations are made. Cyberhactivists, on the other hand, perform cyberattacks for personal pleasure or nonmonetary reasons. Cyberwarriors and cyberhactivists have different motivations. Cyberwarriors are state-sponsored actors engaging in cyberattacks for strategic objectives, while cyberhactivists, like members of Anonymous, attack for political reasons. Cyberterrorists use cyberattacks as warfare, and terrorist organizations utilize the internet for planning attacks and recruitment. U.S. critical infrastructure is vulnerable to cyber threats, although no terrorist-initiated cyberattacks have been reported. In 2007, a cyberattack at Idaho Labs demonstrated the ability to shut down parts of the electrical grid. The term \"Advanced Persistent Threat\" (APT) is used to describe sophisticated cyberespionage activities by nation-states or other organizations. APT techniques target specific networks or servers to gather valuable information or cause damage, with likely targets being government agencies and corporations in critical infrastructure sectors. In 2013, the U.S. security firm Mandiant identified APT1, a Chinese cyber threat actor believed to be government-sponsored. APT1 allegedly stole data from 141 organizations across 20 industries worldwide since 2006. Analysts investigating cyberattacks are hindered by botnets, which can obscure the origin of the attack through infected computers located globally and the use of peer-to-peer software to control the botnet. The prevalence of peer-to-peer software can obscure the server controlling the botnet. IP addresses can be faked through spoofing, making it difficult to trace the location of a computer launching an attack. Uncertainty exists in identifying the perpetrator of cyberattacks, especially when a computer is infected without the user's knowledge. At the nation-state level, deniability in cybersecurity and network control is possible. States can disclaim responsibility for cyber actors and attacks within their borders. Cyberattacks provoke political and military responses from state leaders. The section focuses on cyberattacks that have strategic effects, play a tactical role in military operations, threaten future military capabilities, or undermine public trust in online information security. Each case study illustrates different uses of cyber weapons, raising questions about cyber warfare and terrorism. One case study involves Estonia, a Baltic state that regained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and joined the European Union in 2004. In 2007, Estonia faced cyberattacks that targeted crucial sectors, shutting down Internet access to government, banking, and media websites. Estonians were unable to bank online or use ATMs, and vital services were disrupted. The 2007 cyberattacks in Estonia originated in Russia after a controversial decision to relocate a World War II-era statue. The attacks shut down vital services and communication for weeks. The 2007 cyberattacks in Estonia, following a controversial decision to relocate a WWII-era statue, involved patriotic hackers and possible government involvement. Instructions for coordinated attacks were shared in Russian chat rooms, leading to disruptions on May 9. At midnight in Moscow, nearly 1 million computers accessed Estonian websites, causing a 200-fold increase in Internet traffic. The Estonian computer emergency response team successfully mitigated the attack by blocking specific computers. The event highlighted NATO and the EU's unpreparedness for cyberattacks on member states. The cyberattack on Estonia raised questions about alliance obligations, as the aggressor could not be identified. It caused no physical damage but resulted in short-lived commercial losses. Some viewed it as a national security crisis, while others saw it as a \"cyber riot\" or \"costly nuisance.\" In 2008, Russia invaded Georgia by land and air, blockading the nation by sea. Pro-Russian hackers besieged Georgia's Internet, disrupting communication during the armed conflict. Georgia, a former Soviet state, declared independence in 1991, leading to tensions with Russia. Georgia's failed bid to join NATO in 2008 further escalated the situation. In the spring of 2008, Russian-backed separatists took control of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia. Cyberattacks, believed to be orchestrated by Russian special forces, targeted Georgian websites using a Russian malware called \"MachBot.\" Pro-Russian hackers discussed the attacks online and temporarily shut down Georgian servers. Three weeks later, Russian tanks crossed into South Ossetia. On August 8, Russian tanks invaded South Ossetia, accompanied by a second round of DDoS attacks targeting pro-Georgian hackers. This preemptive attack disrupted Georgian access to critical websites, leading officials to transfer resources to foreign servers. Tulip Systems, a privately owned web-hosting company, provided refuge for some Georgian websites, raising concerns about sovereignty in the digital age. The cyberattacks on Georgia's Internet connection during the five-day fighting raised questions about sovereignty in cyberwarfare. The attacks followed the same patterns as land and air invasions, targeting communications before bombings. A new computer worm exploiting a \"zero-day vulnerability\" in Microsoft Windows was discovered by a Belarussian cybersecurity firm in June 2010, showcasing rare sophistication in malware. The Stuxnet worm, discovered in Windows operating systems, was a highly sophisticated cyber weapon targeting industrial control systems. It was designed to search for a specific target, with Iran's nuclear facility at Natanz believed to be the intended target. The worm spread through air-gapped networks via USB thumb drives, installing a file containing a stolen security certificate to deceive its hosts. The Stuxnet worm deceived its host into thinking it was a trusted program and could spread through networked systems. Infected computers sent data to domain names in Denmark and Malaysia, allowing experts to track the infection pattern, which was mainly concentrated in Iran. The worm targeted Iran's nuclear facility at Natanz and spread through USB thumb drives. Stuxnet targeted Iran's uranium enrichment facility at Natanz by exploiting vulnerabilities in the industrial control system Simatic WinCC Step7, used to control centrifuges. The malware caused irreparable damage by manipulating the centrifuges' rotor, which are crucial for processing uranium for nuclear purposes. Stuxnet targeted Iran's uranium enrichment facility at Natanz by manipulating the centrifuges' rotor frequencies to cause damage. The overall impact on Iran's nuclear program remains unclear, with experts suggesting that although the rate of production may not have changed, more centrifuges were needed to maintain efficiency after the attack. Iran's efficiency at the fuel enrichment plant has declined, with no clear explanation for the diminished effectiveness. The Stuxnet attack on Iran's uranium enrichment facility at Natanz was reportedly a joint venture between the United States and Israel. Israel simulated the attack at a centrifuge plant in Dimona, while the US provided information on vulnerabilities in the Siemens controller. The Department of Defense is responsible for securing its own networks, including the .mil domain. The Department of Defense (DOD) cybersecurity budget for FY2015 was approximately $5.1 billion, part of the overall IT budget of $36 billion. The budget includes activities such as Information Assurance, Cyberspace Operations, and U.S. Cyber Command, established in 2010. The U.S. Cyber Command, part of the Department of Defense, operates under U.S.C. Title 10 and is co-located with the NSA at Fort Meade, Maryland. It is led by a four-star general who also serves as the director of the NSA. The NSA's primary missions include information assurance and signals intelligence, with the Central Security Service handling military cryptology. The main mission of U.S. Cyber Command is to defend and operate the DODIN. The Cyber Commander of U.S. Cyber Command is responsible for executing cyberspace missions to secure the nation's freedom of action and mitigate risks to national security. Specific missions include directing DODIN operations, securing and defending the DODIN, maintaining freedom of maneuver in cyberspace, and providing shared situational awareness of cyberspace operations. The U.S. Cyber Command is responsible for integrating cyberspace operations with combatant commands and other government agencies to defend the nation's interests. Operators are known as \"cyber warriors\" and the Cyber Command plans to create different Cyber Mission Forces to protect critical infrastructure. The U.S. Cyber Command plans to create different Cyber Mission Forces, including mission forces to protect critical infrastructure, combat mission forces for offensive operations, and cyber protection forces for network defense. The number of Cyber Mission Forces is set to increase to 6,200 by the end of FY2016, with a focus on providing surge capacity and specialized capabilities for national security in cyberspace. USCYBERCOM Commander Admiral Michael S. Rogers has stated that Cyber Mission Forces will make up about 80% of the overall cyber workforce. Commander Admiral Michael S. Rogers stated that Cyber Mission Forces will be 80% military and 20% civilian. Lieutenant General James McLaughlin mentioned the formation of 133 tactical teams to support Combatant Commands, with at least half focused on defense. The military services are increasing their cyber operators, and a DOD program involves sharing threat information with defense industry partners. The NSA shared threat signatures obtained through computer monitoring activities. DHS initiated the Joint Cybersecurity Services Pilot (JCSP) in January 2012, which became the DIB Enhanced Cybersecurity Services (DECS) program. DHS communicates with Internet service providers, while DOD is the point of contact for DIB contractors. U.S. military cyber operations are organized by domain, not by threat nature. Presidential Policy Directive 20 distinguishes between network defense and other activities. The U.S. policy on network defense is based on a risk-management framework by NIST, with responsibilities shared among government departments. Private companies can voluntarily adopt the NIST framework for their own network defense. Offensive cyberspace operations may involve a classified \"Execute Order\" issued by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under the direction of the Secretary of Defense to implement military operations. The U.S. policy on network defense is based on a risk-management framework by NIST, with responsibilities shared among government departments. Private companies can adopt the NIST framework for their network defense. Air Force Instruction 10-1701 addresses classified processes for command and control of offensive and defensive cyberspace operations. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff issues an Execute Order for military operations, allowing geographic combatant commanders to conduct Defensive Cyberspace Operations within their networks. There may also be standing orders for offensive cyberspace operations. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 affirms the Secretary of Defense's authority to conduct military activities in cyberspace, including clandestine activities in support of military operations outside the United States. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 grants the Secretary of Defense authority for military activities in cyberspace, including clandestine operations outside the US. This blurs the lines between military and intelligence activities, especially in cyberspace, where Computer Network Attack and Computer Network Exploitation can overlap. The U.S. Cyber Command, responsible for offensive cyber operations under Title 10, is led by the Director of the National Security Agency, a Title 50 intelligence agency. The definition of clandestine operations and covert actions under Title 50 U.S.C. emphasizes concealment of the operation rather than the sponsor's identity. Traditional military activities are exempt from the covert action definition as the sponsor's identity may be well known. The curr_chunk discusses the approval and reporting requirements for military-directed cyberspace operations and those conducted by the intelligence community. It distinguishes between clandestine operations and covert operations based on the concealment of the sponsor's identity. The provision requires quarterly briefings on such activities. The language in the curr_chunk addresses concerns about oversight requirements for cyber operations, including the distinction between covert and clandestine elements. President-elect Obama outlined cybersecurity goals, such as strengthening federal leadership and developing secure networks for national security. In February 2009, a 60-day interagency review was initiated to develop a strategic framework for federal cybersecurity initiatives. The Cyberspace Policy Review was released in May 2009, announcing a new comprehensive approach to securing America's digital infrastructure and the creation of a White House office led by a Cybersecurity Coordinator. Between 2009 and 2013, cyber threats to U.S. infrastructure and assets grew, leading to the Obama Administration's introduction of new cybersecurity policies and directives. This included Executive Order 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, and other classified measures to address the evolving threats in cyberspace. The Obama Administration's Cyberspace Policy Review, building on the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) from the Bush Administration, established a multipronged approach to address cyber threats and vulnerabilities. President Obama implemented PPD-20 on U.S. Cyber Operations Policy in October 2012, with leaked contents remaining classified. PPD-20 distinguishes between network defense and offensive cyber actions. The directive PPD-20, implemented by the Obama Administration in October 2012, distinguishes between network defense and cyber-operations to guide officials in making rapid decisions when facing threats. It outlines a process to vet operations outside government and defense networks, ensuring data privacy and compliance with international laws of war. This directive closes a perceived gap in authorities for DOD to defend the nation in cyberspace, without creating new powers for federal agencies or the military. The directive PPD-20, implemented by the Obama Administration in October 2012, distinguishes between network defense and cyber operations to guide officials in making rapid decisions when facing threats. It provides a policy framework for the Pentagon's rules of engagement for cyberspace, prioritizing network defense and law enforcement as preferred courses of action. The directive mandates that the United States take the least action necessary to mitigate threats and integrates cyber tools with national security tools. EO 13636, released on February 12, 2013, emphasizes a whole-of-government approach consistent with domestic and international values. EO 13636, released on February 12, 2013, aims to enhance the security and resilience of the Nation's critical infrastructure by expanding information sharing, developing cybersecurity standards, establishing a consultative process, and providing incentives for voluntary adoption of the framework. The order establishes a program with incentives for voluntary adoption of the framework by CI owners and operators, reviews cybersecurity regulatory requirements, and incorporates privacy and civil liberties protections. It assigns specific responsibilities to various government agencies and supersedes previous directives on critical infrastructure security and resilience. PPD-21, released in 2003, aims to enhance the security and resilience of critical infrastructure by clarifying federal agency relationships, establishing separate DHS centers for physical and cyber-infrastructure, and prioritizing information sharing. It assigns responsibilities to DHS, sector-specific agencies, and other government departments, as well as the intelligence community and regulatory bodies. The National Infrastructure Response Plan (NIPP) outlines how government and private sector critical infrastructure stakeholders collaborate to manage risks and achieve security. The phrase \"defense support of civil authorities\" refers to DOD's mission to assist civil authorities during domestic emergencies. For civil cybersecurity, DHS leads with DOD support, and the National Cyber Incident Response Plan coordinates responses to domestic cyber incidents. The DOD plays a key role in responding to domestic cyber incidents, following guidelines outlined in the National Response Framework and a 2010 agreement with DHS. Military response to cyberterrorism or cyberwar requires a presidential finding and order execution. International discussions may influence the criteria for military action in cyberspace. The international governance of cyberspace is currently managed by private organizations like IETF and ICANN. However, politically motivated cyberattacks are on the rise, leading to a need for national strategies for cyberdefense and cyberoffense. The Obama Administration has taken steps to address these challenges. The Obama Administration's International Strategy for Cyberspace in 2011 focuses on strengthening partnerships and preserving Internet openness. The U.S. stance differs from China and Russia's nationalistic approach to Internet governance. In 2012, the U.S. State Department publicly discussed whether cyber activities could be considered a use of force under international law. According to the U.N. Charter and customary international law, cyber activities resulting in death, injury, or significant destruction could be seen as a use of force. Examples include causing a nuclear plant meltdown or interfering with air traffic control to crash airplanes. The U.S. recognizes cyberattacks without kinetic effects as armed conflict under certain circumstances. Cyberattacks on information networks during armed conflict are subject to principles of proportionality. Retaliation may involve kinetic force. Computer network activities constituting an armed attack or imminent threat could trigger a nation's right to self-defense under the U.N. Charter. The U.S. reserves the right to respond to hostile acts in cyberspace using all necessary means, including diplomatic, informational, military, and economic measures. The International Strategy for Cyberspace emphasizes working internationally to encourage responsible behavior, deter malicious actors, and defend national assets. NATO established the Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence in response to the 2007 DDoS attack on Estonia to address the application of international law to cyberwarfare. The CCDCOE hosts workshops and courses on law and ethics in cyberspace, as well as cyber-defense exercises. In 2009, an international group of experts drafted the Tallinn Manual on cyberwarfare law, published in 2013. It sets out 95 rules governing cyber conflict. The United Nations convenes Groups of Governmental Experts to study information security. The United Nations convenes Groups of Governmental Experts (GGE) to study information security and cyberwarfare. The GGE aims to reach consensus on norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior by states in the ICT environment. This process includes China and Russia, unlike the NATO-led efforts in Tallinn. Various international instruments, including treaties and agreements like the United Nations Charter and the Geneva Conventions, govern cyberwarfare alongside U.S. laws. The Budapest Convention, also known as the law-enforcement treaty, requires signatories to adopt criminal laws against specified activities in cyberspace and cooperate with other signatories. It focuses on identifying and punishing cyber criminals for attacks on cyber-systems and content-related crimes. However, it may not prevent cybercrime and could conflict with different nations' approaches to freedom of expression. Some nations have ratified the cybersecurity treaty, while others view it as unsuccessful. U.N. resolutions on cybersecurity have been ongoing for 15 years, with a 2010 report recommending steps to reduce ICT disruptions. This report is seen as progress in bridging differences between the U.S. and Russia on cybersecurity. The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) endorsed by the General Assembly in 2001 aimed to address cybersecurity issues. Delegates from 175 countries adopted a Declaration of Principles at the first summit in Geneva in 2003. Controversial issues like Internet governance and funding remained unresolved. Proposals for the United States to relinquish control of ICANN were rejected at both summits. The \"Law of War\" may apply to cyberattacks, but there is no specific agreement on its application by nation states. The \"Law of War\" may apply to cyberattacks, but without specific agreement by nation states, its relevance remains unclear. Difficulties in attribution, use of botnets, and potential harm to third parties from cyber-counterattacks complicate the issue. Questions of territorial boundaries and what constitutes an armed attack in cyberspace also remain. The Tallinn Manual addresses these issues, relating to how states may respond to international law violations that do not justify self-defense. NATO has established authorities for cyberdefense since the 2007 attack on Estonia, with a policy and action plan adopted in 2011. The NATO Cyber Center of Excellence in Tallinn provides legal analysis, while the International Telecommunication Union regulates international telecommunications. Regulations by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) address interference with communication services and security control of non-state telecommunications. Military cyberattacks are not expressly forbidden, and the ITU has limited enforcement authority. International law, such as aviation and maritime regulations, may apply to cybersecurity. Mutual legal assistance treaties between countries can be used for cybersecurity forensic investigations. The United States has signed treaties with other countries and the European Union for information security, particularly related to military and defense information protection. The United States and Australia have agreed to include cybersecurity cooperation in a defense treaty, stating that a cyberattack on one country would lead to retaliation by both. Various regional associations of nation states have issued declarations and statements regarding cybersecurity goals, but these documents do not appear to be legally binding. In September 2011, members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization proposed a voluntary code of conduct for cybersecurity to be placed on the U.N. General Assembly agenda. In 2011 and 2012, the United States, Russia, and other countries negotiated a cybersecurity agreement under the OSCE, focusing on early warning for cyber-operations to prevent conflict. However, consensus was not reached due to conflicting interests and attribution challenges. Some doubt the effectiveness of such an agreement. At the World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) in Dubai in December 2012, concerns were raised about a shift in Internet control towards the U.N. and national governments. Despite baseless fears, a controversial deep packet inspection proposal from China was adopted. Germany and other dissenting countries worry about increased Internet censorship. Discussions also revolve around whether USCYBERCOM should have more authority over critical infrastructure protection. The international community faces ambiguity in defining cyberattacks as acts of war or national significance, lacking clear redlines and consequences. Some argue against giving USCYBERCOM more authority over private sector infrastructure, fearing it could lead to distrust, stifled innovation, and decreased profits. Congress must consider the implications of militarizing cyberspace. Skilled cyber operators are in demand in the military, with the national supply of cyber professionals mainly in the private sector. Services are exploring ways to enhance opportunities for officers interested in cybersecurity careers. However, barriers to hiring skilled civilians for the DOD cyber mission could impede workforce development. Congress may need to incentivize recruitment outside the military by offering special hiring authorities, streamlining security clearance processes, and providing competitive compensation. The USCYBERCOM cyber force's \"National Mission Teams\" protect critical infrastructure, mainly in the private sector. Questions arise on how they operate during peacetime without violating Posse Comitatus. USCYBERCOM is organized under Strategic Command, co-directed with NSA, leading to suggestions of separating the two organizations for clearer authority. Some suggest separating USCYBERCOM and NSA, giving civilian control to NSA and elevating Cyber Command. DOD tasked to study implications of this. Congress questions how one individual can lead both organizations conducting cyber operations. Proponents argue for a separate cyber force, while critics raise concerns. The blurred lines between operations under Title 10 and Title 50 authorities complicate the chain of command and jurisdictional review process in cyberspace. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 includes provisions for DOD cybersecurity, requiring reporting on cyber incidents and improvements to cyber operations. The Principal Cyber Advisor is tasked with identifying improvements for civilian workforce support for USCYBERCOM. A program of decryption is directed to inspect DOD networks for threats. Congress emphasizes the importance of ICANN leadership and legacy IP numbers for DOD. A new mission plan for cyber defense forces is to be submitted. Congress considers the role of reserve components in cyber defense due to their unique experience. Kosovo was the site of the first large-scale Internet war in February-June 1999. The first large-scale Internet war took place in Kosovo, with pro-Serbian forces cyberattacking NATO while NATO planes bombed Serbia. The \"Black Hand\" hacker group targeted NATO, U.S., and UK infrastructure with DoS attacks and virus-infected emails. The White House website was defaced, the UK lost database information, and NATO's public affairs website was inoperable. In retaliation, Chinese hackers attacked U.S. government websites after a NATO jet bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. Riots in the Palestinian territories in October 2000 led to cyberattacks between Israelis and Palestinians. The cyberwar between Israelis and Palestinians escalated with attacks on official websites. Pro-Israeli hackers targeted Palestinian Authority, Hamas, and Iran, while Pro-Palestinian hackers retaliated against Israeli political, military, and commercial websites. The conflict mirrored the ground conflict in the Middle East since 2000. In 2007, DDoS attacks in Estonia were blamed on Russian retaliation for moving a war memorial. Israel disrupted Syrian air defense during a bombing in 2007. In 2008, Lithuanian and Georgian government websites were defaced by Russian nationalist hackers. In August 2008, Georgian government and commercial websites were shut down by DoS attacks during Russian ground troop invasion. In January 2009, Russian-originated DoS attacks targeted Kyrgyzstan's Internet servers while pressuring the country to bar U.S. access to an airbase. In June 2010, the \"Stuxnet\" worm damaged an Iranian nuclear facility, implicating the United States and Israel. In September 2011, \"Keylogger\" malware infected U.S. Air Force UAV ground control stations at Creech Air Force Base. In May 2012, an espionage worm called \"Flame\" was discovered on Iranian computers. In August 2012, the \"Gauss\" worm infected 2,500 systems worldwide, targeting Lebanese banks. The \"Cutting Sword of Justice\" group used the \"Shamoon\" virus to attack major oil companies in August 2012. In September 2012-June 2013, the hacker group Izz ad-Din al-Qassam launched DoS attacks against major U.S. financial institutions. In January 2013, the New York Times and Wall Street Journal were targeted. In January 2013, major news outlets were targeted by cyberattacks believed to be linked to China. In May 2013, the Syrian Electronic Army attempted to compromise the water supply in Haifa. In August 2013, leaks revealed the US government conducted cyber intrusions against Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran. In April 2014, the Heartbleed bug exposed vulnerabilities in Internet security. In May 2014, the US indicted five Chinese military officers for computer hacking and economic espionage. In July 2014, the United States charged a Chinese entrepreneur with hacking into the computer systems of Boeing and other firms to steal data on military programs. This case involved economic espionage by members of the Chinese military, marking the first charges against a state actor for this type of hacking. In December 2014, a cybersecurity firm reported a massive cyber operation targeting industrial firms globally, although the source was not definitively attributed to any one country. In December 2014, a U.S. cybersecurity firm reported that an Iranian hacker group breached airlines, energy and defense firms, and the U.S. Marine Corps intranet in an attack known as \"Operation Cleaver,\" without attributing the attack to any specific country."
