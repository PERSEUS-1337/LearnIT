    "content": "The Act titled \"Small System Safe Drinking Water Act of 2005\" focuses on compliance and enforcement measures. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include guidance on convening a working group to study barriers to the use of point-of-use water systems. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include guidance on studying barriers to the use of point-of-use water systems, package plants, and modular units. A model guidance document will be developed based on recommendations from the working group for distribution to States to assist in regulating and promoting treatment options for small water systems. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include guidance on studying barriers to the use of point-of-use water systems, package plants, and modular units. A model guidance document will be developed for distribution to States to assist in regulating treatment options for small water systems. Enforcement of National Primary Drinking Water Regulations will include additional health effects considerations. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include health effects considerations for national primary drinking water regulations, focusing on the quantity of water consumed and the time before contaminants can occur. Feasible technologies must reflect different water sources in the United States. Variance technologies are also addressed in the amendments. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include health effects considerations for national primary drinking water regulations, focusing on water quantity and contaminant occurrence time. Variance technologies are addressed in the amendments, reflecting different US water sources and establishing affordability criteria. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include affordability criteria for treatment technologies and techniques, considering costs and prioritizing low-income households and communities meeting state criteria. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include affordability criteria for treatment technologies and techniques, prioritizing low-income households and communities meeting state criteria. No national primary drinking water regulation for small public water systems can be more costly per capita than for large systems to acquire feasible technology. Enforcement of regulations for systems serving less than 10,000 individuals is prohibited. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include affordability criteria for treatment technologies, prioritizing low-income households and communities. Enforcement of regulations for systems serving less than 10,000 individuals is prohibited unless a variance technology has been identified. Compliance agreements with states allow systems to be considered in compliance with federal drinking water standards. State revolving loan funds are also amended. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include affordability criteria for treatment technologies, prioritizing low-income households and communities. Enforcement of regulations for systems serving less than 10,000 individuals is prohibited unless sufficient funds are available for compliance. Compliance agreements with states allow systems to be considered in compliance with federal drinking water standards. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include affordability criteria for treatment technologies, prioritizing low-income households and communities. Compliance agreements with states allow systems to be considered in compliance with federal drinking water standards. A research pilot program is established to explore new technologies for public water systems to comply with drinking water standards. The Administrator shall establish an application process with criteria to assess water systems for a program funding new technologies for Federal drinking water standards. 20 communities with various populations and water sources will be selected for participation, coordinating projects with the Arsenic Water Technology Partnership program. The Administrator will conduct a pilot program to research technology transfer and disinfection strategies for drinking water, including risks related to chloramines. Additionally, amendments are made to subsection (e) regarding types of assistance provided under the program. The Administrator will ensure that water systems receive technical assistance to comply with Federal drinking water rules, including support from qualified nonprofit organizations. The Administrator will prioritize assistance to water systems not in compliance with specific rules on disinfectants, disinfection byproducts, arsenic, and new source contaminants monitoring. Enforcement action will be taken for non-compliance. Enforcement action will not be taken against a water system under this Act without providing assistance first. $15,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year 2006-2010 for this purpose. No funds can be used for lobbying expenses from the State revolving loan fund or funds under this subsection. Tribal assistance is also included in the allocated amount. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will establish a panel of experts for a contaminant study and report, with members appointed based on recommendations from various entities. At least 3 percent of funds available for technical assistance to public water systems owned or operated by Indian Tribes. The Environmental Protection Agency will establish a panel of experts to review studies on the health effects of exposure to arsenic and disinfection byproducts. The panel will submit a report to the Senate and House committees within 180 days of the Act's enactment, including the review results and assessment of recent scientific findings on the health effects of these substances. The EPA will review health effects of exposure to arsenic and disinfection byproducts, comparing studies conducted after establishing contaminant levels under the Safe Drinking Water Act."
