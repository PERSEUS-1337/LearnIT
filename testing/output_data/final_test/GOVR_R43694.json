    "content": "The Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) was passed by Congress in 2002 to address improper payments made by federal agencies. It defines improper payments as payments that should not have been made or were incorrect, including overpayments and underpayments. The act requires agencies to identify programs at risk of improper payments and improve estimation and reporting processes. Since FY2004, agencies have reported approximately $800 billion in erroneous payments due to significant improper payments in federal programs. In FY2013, 85 programs were identified as susceptible to significant improper payments, issuing over $106 billion in improper payments that year. The data from FY2004 to FY2013 shows a relatively flat trend in reported improper payment amounts. The amount of improper payments reported remained relatively flat through FY2007, then rapidly increased, nearly tripling by FY2010, before slowly declining. The increase between FY2007 and FY2010 was partially due to new programs being included, such as Medicaid in FY2008 estimating $19 billion in improper payments out of $178 billion in outlays. Government expenditures for public assistance also rose between FY2007 and FY2010, contributing to the growth in improper payments. For example, expenditures under the Medicare Fee-for-Service program increased from $276 billion in FY2007 to $326 billion in FY2010. The program's expenditures increased from $276 billion in FY2007 to $326 billion in FY2010, with improper payments rising from $11 billion to $30 billion during the same period. President Obama signed Executive Order 13520 in November 2009 to identify high priority programs with the highest improper payments, set targets for reducing them, and require agencies to publish data on improper payments. The executive order required agencies to publish data on improper payments estimates and targets for high priority programs. OMB created PaymentAccuracy.gov to display data for these programs. OMB revised Circular A-123 to include new requirements for high priority programs with over $750 million in improper payments. As of July 2014, OMB identified 13 high priority programs with improper payment amounts exceeding $750 million. 12 of these programs reported improper payments for FY2013. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is the only program without reported improper payments data, expected to be available by the end of FY2014. Some high priority programs faced challenges in estimating improper payments, with incomplete data on programs like National School Lunch Program, Medicaid, Medicare Part C, Pell Grants, and Medicare Part D. Table 2 shows that 12 high priority programs issued $738 billion in improper payments from FY2004 to FY2013. Four programs - Medicare Fee-for-Service, Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage - accounted for a large portion of the total improper payments, totaling $77 billion in FY2013. These four programs made up 73% of the government's improper payments that year. High priority programs have accounted for a large percentage of the government's total annual improper payments each fiscal year, with programs like Medicare Fee-for-Service, EITC, and Medicare Advantage seeing significant increases in improper payments. Only Medicaid and Rental Housing Assistance have shown a decrease in improper payments. These high priority programs have consistently made up 85% to 96% of the total improper payments reported by agencies annually from FY2004 to FY2013. Between FY2004 and FY2008, high priority programs accounted for 85% to 96% of the government's total improper payments, showing a variance of 11 percentage points. From FY2009 to FY2013, this range narrowed to 92% to 95%, with a variance of 3 percentage points. The variance in the earlier years may be attributed to the addition of new high priority programs, leading to fluctuations in improper payments estimates. Over time, as agencies refine their measures, these year-to-year variations should decrease. The government-wide error rate has decreased steadily over the past five fiscal years, with high priority programs accounting for 9 out of every 10 dollars reported as improper payments. While some high priority programs have improved, others have shown little to no progress or even an increase in error rates. The OMB's guidance on high priority programs aimed to focus agency efforts on programs with the highest improper payment amounts. The error rates for high priority programs have shown mixed results between FY2009 and FY2013. While some programs have improved, others have remained stagnant or even increased. EITC, Medicare Fee-for-Service, and RSDI had the same error rates after 10 years. SSI and Medicare Part D saw an increase in error rates during this period. The error rates for high priority programs have shown mixed results between FY2009 and FY2013. Some programs have improved, while others have remained stagnant or increased. The error rate for Unemployment Insurance decreased from 10.3% in FY2004 to 9.3% in FY2013, but exceeded 10.0% in intervening years. The National School Lunch Program saw a small reduction in error rate over seven years, dropping from 16.3% in FY2007 to 15.7% in FY2013, equating to an average reduction of one-tenth of one percentage point per year. The error rates for high priority programs have shown mixed results between FY2009 and FY2013. Some programs have improved, while others have remained stagnant or increased. The error rate for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) fell from 6.6% in FY2004 to 3.4% in FY2013, Medicaid's fell from 10.5% in FY2008 to 5.8% in FY2013, Pell Grants program's error rate was halved, and Rental Housing Assistance program's error rate declined from 6.9% to 4.9% over the same period. Despite government-wide improvements, there has been little progress in reducing error rates for high priority programs, resulting in over $100 billion in improper payments annually."
