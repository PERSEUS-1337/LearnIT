Qualified investment credit property includes tangible property under section 168 and section 1245 property, completed by the taxpayer or acquired with original use commencing with the taxpayer. Eligible property must meet specific criteria. Eligible property for the Incremental Investment Credit provision must be tangible property used in manufacturing, production, extraction, transportation, communication, energy, gas, water, waste disposal, or pollution control services. Property eligible for the Incremental Investment Credit must be tangible property used in various industries, including manufacturing, production, extraction, transportation, communication, energy, gas, water, waste disposal, or pollution control services.

The Incremental Investment Credit excludes certain property from eligibility, such as passenger automobiles and office furnishings. The term 'United States' includes Puerto Rico and US possessions. The base amount is calculated as the product of specific factors. The Incremental Investment Credit calculates the base amount by multiplying the fixed-base percentage with the average annual gross receipts of the taxpayer for the 4 preceding taxable years. The base amount cannot be less than 50 percent of the calculated amount. The fixed-base percentage is determined based on aggregate amounts for taxable years after December 31.

The base amount cannot be less than 50 percent of the calculated amount. The fixed-base percentage is determined based on aggregate amounts for taxable years after December 31, 1987, and before January 1, 1993. The percentages are rounded to the nearest \\1/100\\ of 1 percent. Rules similar to section 41(c) apply, and the subsection does not apply to properties eligible for the energy credit or rehabilitation credit unless the taxpayer waives those credits. Certain progress expenditure rules are also made applicable. Rules similar to subsection (c)(4) and (d) of section 46 apply for the Incremental Investment Credit. Special rules for the credit are applied separately for C corporations. The incremental investment credit allowed under subsection (a) is limited to not exceed the net chapter 1 tax for the taxable year. The term 'net chapter 1 tax' includes regular tax liability and section 55 tax, minus certain credits. Incremental investment credit refers to the credit under section 48(c). Technical amendments were made to sections 49(a)(1)(C), 50(a)(2), and 50(a) of the Code, including inserting \"qualified investment credit property\" after \"energy property\" and adding special rules for certain property. Special rules apply to qualified investment credit property that is 3-year property, with specific percentages set for different clauses in the table. Amendments were made to section 48 of the Code to reflect these changes. Amendments to section 48 of the Code apply to property acquired or constructed after December 3, 1992, with specific rules for the basis attributable to construction after that date."
