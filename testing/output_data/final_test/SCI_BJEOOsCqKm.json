    "content": "Parametric texture models have been successfully used to create artificial images. In industrial applications, a texture analysis system needs to determine if humans can distinguish between a reference and a new texture. A human-vision-inspired novelty detection approach was implemented, comparing psychophysical and learned texture representations using a pretrained CNN. Additionally, a new objective function was introduced to train one-class neural networks for novelty detection. The study introduces a novel objective function for training one-class neural networks for novelty detection and compares it to standard one-class SVM approaches. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of psychophysical texture representations over CNN-encoded features in detecting visual anomalies. The concept of describing textures using statistics dates back to early work by Gibson and Julesz. Various texture models have been developed, including Markov random field models and human-vision-inspired models. The PS-model and SW-model are human-vision-inspired texture models based on frequency and orientation bands. The PS-model focuses on synthesizing realistic textures using complex wavelet coefficients, while the SW-model uses log-Gabor decomposition. In contrast, BID2 introduced a texture model based on features from a deep CNN, showing impressive results in generating artificial textures. These models are used in industrial applications for specific texture representations. In industrial applications, specific texture representations are needed for tasks like pattern recognition and human perception modeling. This work focuses on detecting visual anomalies when comparing reference and novel textures, known as novelty detection. Using images of artificial wood textures digitized from line-scanner cameras, the goal is to reproduce the reference texture visually indistinguishable. Machine learning is used, but there are no labeled training samples available. In industrial applications, specific texture representations are needed for tasks like pattern recognition and human perception modeling. This work focuses on detecting visual anomalies in decorative surfaces using an unsupervised one-class neural network approach. The goal is to detect anomalies in textures that are visually indistinguishable from the reference texture, presenting a continuous problem in industrial applications. In industrial applications, specific texture representations are needed for tasks like pattern recognition and human perception modeling. This work introduces a novel objective function (MinMax-loss) for training one-class neural networks for novelty detection in textures. Psychophysically motivated texture models (PS-model and SW-model) are compared with deep CNN texture features for novelty detection. Texture dependent differences between the models are highlighted, which are relevant for visual surface inspection applications. Various approaches for outlier detection in data are discussed, with a focus on novelty detection using clustering methods and distance measures. The text discusses outlier detection methods, including clustering techniques, support vector machines (SVM), and one-class SVMs (OC-SVM). OC-SVM divides reference data into two sets using a hyperplane to detect anomalies. These methods have been successfully applied in industrial contexts for detecting visual anomalies on textured surfaces. Subspace and latent code techniques are also mentioned for finding anomalies by projecting data onto a chosen subspace. The text discusses outlier detection methods, including clustering techniques, support vector machines (SVM), and one-class SVMs (OC-SVM). OC-SVM divides reference data into two sets using a hyperplane to detect anomalies. Subspace and latent code techniques find anomalies by projecting data onto a chosen subspace, with common techniques related to principal component analysis (PCA) or autoencoders. Hybrid approaches combine robust PCA (RPCA) with autoencoders to separate noise from the reference data. Our approach introduces a neural network training technique to separate reference data from data with similar image statistics, aiding in novelty detection for textures without prior anomaly knowledge. A novel objective function is used to train a model based on a one-class approach, minimizing predicted reference outputs. Regularization is achieved by using a second training input with the same image statistics as the reference texture. The MinMax-loss objective function is used in our neural network training technique for novelty detection in textures. It separates reference data from similar data by minimizing the predicted reference outputs. This approach utilizes an interval-based decision function to classify predicted outputs based on quantiles of reference values. The MinMax-loss objective function is utilized in a neural network for novelty detection in textures. An interval-based decision function is used to classify anomalies as 0, with the classifier trained on reference and shuffled texture patches. Studies in visual psychophysics focus on the discriminability of textures synthesized with the PS-model. The generated images are indistinguishable from the original image, using a representation that captures texture appearance. The processing pipeline involves preprocessing the input image, computing representations, and evaluating them with one-class classifiers. A MinMax-loss separates output distributions of reference and shuffled textures based on a complex wavelet transformation with directional, non-uniform filter banks. The image is decomposed using high-and low-pass filters, with sub-sampled low-pass responses filtered iteratively. The parametric texture model in BID14 synthesizes artificial and natural textures based on joint statistics of complex wavelet coefficients. Feature preprocessing involves four spatial orientations and a spatial neighbourhood of 9 \u00d7 9. Based on the size of the sliding window and the requirement for dimensions to be a multiple of 2, up to four scales are used in the model by Sch\u00fctt & Wichmann FORMULA1 for early spatial visual processing. The model involves image preprocessing, decomposition into spatial frequencies and orientations using a complex log-Gabor filter bank, and applying nonlinearity and normalization to each channel response. Parameter values are based on previous work, with specific configurations for Gabor standard deviations. The model by Sch\u00fctt & Wichmann uses Gabor standard deviations for spatial frequency and orientation, nonlinearity constants, and pool orientation. Different averaging methods are evaluated for the SW-features, with descriptors x apc SW and x fr SW having different sizes. Texture representations are based on neural network activations, unlike handcrafted psychophysical models of human vision. The text discusses the use of a VGG-19 network for feature extraction in a neural network model. The normalized features are computed from the feature maps of a pretrained convolutional layer. Novelty detection experiments were conducted to compare different texture representations and evaluate the performance of a one-class neural network. The experiments evaluated different averaging methods to reduce the size of the SW-feature vector and tested PS-features with and without image statistics. The performance of normalized features from VGG-19 layers was analyzed, with the best results achieved using the feature maps of layer pool4. Our approach was tested in a surface inspection system for artificial wood decors, evaluating 74 different printed decors using synthesized anomalies. Experiments used a three-layer neural network with a single linear output neuron. In experiments, a three-layer neural network with a single linear output neuron was used. The number of hidden neurons matched input neurons, with a sigmoid activation function. Weights were optimized using MinMax-loss and gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.001. Models were trained for 1000 epochs on 8-bit contrast images. RGB textures were converted to greyscale using a weighted sum formula. A sliding window approach was used for processing texture images independently. Greyscale images were duplicated into three channels for compatibility with the VGG-19 network. The OC-NN, VGG-19 network, SW-model, and PSmodel were implemented in Python using PyTorch. In Python, models like OC-NN, VGG-19, SW-model, and PSmodel were implemented using PyTorch, Torchvision, Imageio, NumPy, and SciPy. Experiments included linear, sigmoid, and RBF kernels for OC-SVM comparisons. Anomalies were synthesized by adding/subtracting offset values from pixels with different intensities and extending anomalies to adjacent lines. Models were tested against 100 randomly placed anomalies and evaluated using the AUC measure. The models were evaluated using the AUC measure, with an upper bound on training errors. OC-NN and OC-SVM were trained on texture features without normalization. Results based on reference textures showed AUC greater than 0.5 for all texture representations with OC-NN on red-bricks texture. The OC-NN classifier achieved the best AUC on red-bricks using CNN-encoded features. However, the AUC decreased for larger anomalies. OC-SVM models with SW-representation and CNN-encoded features failed to detect anomalies, but using PS-representations allowed for detection on specific textures. Noise in printed textures can be detected using a human-vision-inspired approach. In this study, the performance of novelty detection in digital print inspection was evaluated using different types of noise distortion on input images. The OC-NN model trained with VGG-19 texture representation achieved high AUC scores when evaluating examples distorted by Gaussian noise. The study highlights the importance of using human-vision-inspired approaches for detecting anomalies in printed textures. The study introduced state-of-the-art methods for texture modelling, including a model focusing on synthesizing realistic textures and another model based on the human early vision system. A novel objective for training neural network based one-class classifiers for novelty detection (OC-NN) was introduced, showing superior results compared to an OC-SVM based classifier. The OC-NN approach achieved reasonable results when evaluating quasi-periodic textures, while anomalies could not be detected by an OC-SVM based classifier. The study introduced advanced texture modeling methods and a novel approach for training neural network classifiers for novelty detection. The learned texture representations provide effective features for detecting novelties, performing well even when not perceived by humans. Different texture features were evaluated, with SW-features outperforming others for small anomalies on aperiodic textures. However, the detection rate decreases when anomalies dominate. Further work is needed to improve preprocessing techniques for anomaly detection. Further work is needed to validate anomalies using psychophysical data from experiments and evaluate different methods for SW-features. Additionally, fine-tuning an OC-SVM for utilizing SW-features is planned."
