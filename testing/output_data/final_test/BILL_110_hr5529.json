Congress finds that renewable energy technology is crucial for reducing dependence on oil and combating global warming. There is a need to strengthen institutional support for renewable energy technology. International agencies like the IAEA and IEA have been formed to address energy source-related issues. The IAEA, established in 1957, focuses on the safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy. The IAEA promotes safe nuclear technology use, with nuclear power now supplying 16% of global electricity. The IEA, established during the 1973-74 oil embargo, enhances energy security through an oil reserve program. Renewable capacity grew by 26 gigawatts in 2005, reaching over 182 gigawatts globally. Meeting the world's energy demands in the coming century while reducing emissions and growing the global economy will require actions across nations to reform policy, expand markets for renewable energy technologies, and gather information on best practices. The direct cost to the United States of dependence on foreign oil from 1970 to 2005 was $7 trillion in constant 2000 dollars, harming the economy, entangling the military in foreign conflicts, and endangering public health and the environment. Significant public health, national security, and environmental costs are associated with greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. These costs are not currently paid by polluters, leading to overuse of carbon-emitting energy. Revenue of renewable energy companies increased to $55 billion in 2006, with significant venture capital investment in energy technology. Over a billion tons of emissions are produced in the United States alone. (11) Over a billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions could be eliminated annually in the United States through energy efficiency measures by 2030, avoiding the need for hundreds of power plants.\n(12) Renewable energy has higher construction and maintenance costs but lower fuel costs compared to fossil energy, resulting in more jobs per unit of energy generated. For example, photovoltaic solar energy creates 7 to 11 times more jobs than coal or gas-generated electricity.\n(13) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has... The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has set a target to stabilize greenhouse gases at 450-500 parts per million for limited global temperature rise and sea-level rise. Global emissions need to peak by 2015 and decline to 15% of 2000 levels by 2050. In 2004, carbon dioxide emissions from OECD countries were surpassed by non-OECD countries for the first time. Developing countries are projected to contribute over 75% of global emissions growth by 2030. encouragin growth of renewable energy in these countries can help reduce emissions. Investment of $20 trillion in energy generation and infrastructure is needed globally by 2030 to meet energy needs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Near-term energy investment decisions are crucial in determining future emissions. Establishment of an International Renewable Energy Agency. The President will establish the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) to support governments in promoting renewable energy policies and programs, conducting country studies, and providing global status reports on renewable energy progress. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) will review progress on renewable energy programs, provide long-term projections, organize training programs, assist in curriculum development, cooperate with financing institutions, and facilitate knowledge transfer. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) aims to transfer knowledge, develop international norms and standards, and disseminate information on renewable energy programs. Membership includes interested member states of the United Nations. The President must submit a report to Congress on the implementation of the Act within one year of its enactment. In this Act, \"energy efficiency measure\" refers to improvements in process or technology that reduce energy inputs for the same level of service or increase services for the same energy inputs. \"Greenhouse gas\" includes carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. \"Renewable energy\" is based on solar radiation, solar heat, wind power, tidal, or wave power. Renewable energy sources include wind power, tidal or wave power, biomass, geothermal energy, small hydropower, and large hydropower, following United Nations Dams and Development Project recommendations. Authorization of appropriations for the President is set at $1,500,000 for fiscal year 2008."
