The Congress finds that the National Science Foundation invests significantly in STEM education, influencing research and policy agendas. Early engagement in scientific activities fosters positive attitudes towards STEM and career pursuits. However, current research mainly targets older students, and women are underrepresented in the STEM workforce, requiring strategic funding to address this gender gap. In this Act, key definitions include the Director as the head of the National Science Foundation, early childhood referring to children up to age 10, institution of higher education as defined in the Higher Education Act of 1965, local educational agency encompassing preschools and after-school programs, and STEM defined in the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. The term \"young girls\" in the Act refers to female individuals under the age of 11. In the Discovery Research PreK-12 program, grants will be awarded with consideration for age distribution to allocate funding for early childhood research studies. Additionally, support will be provided for girls in STEM education and computer science. The Director will award research grants to institutions or organizations to accelerate efforts in understanding factors that influence young girls' participation in STEM activities, including teacher training and incentives. The Director will award research grants to institutions or organizations to accelerate efforts in understanding factors that influence young girls' participation in STEM activities, including the role of teachers, learning environment, parents, and types of STEM activities that elicit greater participation. The Director will award grants to institutions to study factors influencing young girls' participation in STEM, including mentorship, informal learning, and scalable engagement models. Grant recipients must report on activities and materials developed using the funds. The Director will award grants to institutions to develop interventions in pre-K and elementary school classrooms that increase young girls' participation in computer science activities. Recipients must partner with local educational agencies or states and use funds for activities drawing upon partner expertise. The Director will award grants to partner entities to increase young girls' participation in computer science activities through training programs for teachers, gender-inclusive teaching practices, and distance learning programs. The Director will award grants to partner entities for the professional development of teachers in computer science, creating master teachers to promote gender-inclusive practices, developing evaluation tools, and adapting curricular materials for early childhood education. The Director will award grants for developing gender-inclusive computer science programs, providing mentors for girls, engaging parents, introducing girls to computer science careers, and other activities as determined. The Director will award grants for gender-inclusive computer science programs, mentorship for girls, parental engagement, career introductions, and other activities as deemed necessary. Grant recipients must report on their activities, materials developed, and student outcomes. An evaluation of the grant program will be conducted within 4 years, focusing on identifying best practices and materials developed by partnerships. The Director will disseminate evaluation results of the grant program on a website and to Congress. Effective materials developed under the program will be shared to achieve program goals. The Director may convene an annual meeting of partnerships funded by a grant under this subsection to foster national collaboration. Technical assistance will be provided to partnerships upon request to meet program requirements. SEC. 6. Amends the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 to include computer science in the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program. Passed the House of Representatives on February 13, 2018. Passed the House of Representatives on February 13, 2018."
