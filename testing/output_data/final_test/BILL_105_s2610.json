    "content": "Standards of performance for electric utility units. Congress finds that older electric utility units are exempt from strict emission control requirements, allowing them to emit more dangerous pollutants. This regulatory disparity is concerning in the era of electric utility restructuring, as utilities spending less on environmental controls can increase power generation and emissions, creating an unfair competitive disadvantage for utilities meeting strict environmental standards. Electricity restructuring can bring significant benefits for consumers and the environment if implemented correctly. The Clean Air Act is amended to include standards of performance for electric generating units, defining grandfathered units as those not previously subject to emission control standards. The Clean Air Act is amended to include standards of performance for electric generating units, defining grandfathered units as those with capacity over 25 megawatts generating electricity across state lines. Compliance deadlines are set for grandfathered units. The Clean Air Act is amended to include standards of performance for electric generating units, with compliance deadlines set for grandfathered units. Compliance must be met within 5 years for existing standards and 3 years for new standards. Alternative compliance options are provided by the Administrator. The Clean Air Act mandates standards of performance for electric generating units, with compliance deadlines for grandfathered units. Compliance must be achieved within specific timeframes for existing and new standards. Alternative compliance options are available. Transferable allowances for pollutants are allocated to electric utility units based on their share of total electric generation. The Clean Air Act mandates standards of performance for electric generating units, with compliance deadlines for grandfathered units. Compliance must be achieved within specific timeframes for existing and new standards. Transferable allowances for pollutants are allocated to electric utility units based on their share of total electric generation. Grandfathered units are required to meet emission standards by emitting no more pollutants than the allowances held for each pollutant in a calendar year. The Administrator applies the standard for the applicable fuel type in effect in 2000 when calculating limitations. This subsection does not affect the obligation to comply with other provisions.
