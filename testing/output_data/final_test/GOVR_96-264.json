    "content": "A tax-exempt organization is generally exempt from federal income taxes under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), with Section 501(c)(3) being the most common type. This section includes entities operating for religious, charitable, scientific, educational, or other specified purposes. Other types of tax-exempt organizations include social welfare organizations, labor unions, and veterans' organizations. A tax-exempt organization, also known as a nonprofit organization, is exempt from federal income taxes under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). Nonprofit corporations are not automatically tax-exempt and must meet specific criteria under federal and state laws. State laws consider the lack of shareholders and profit motives in nonprofit corporations when determining their status and privileges. A nonprofit organization must meet specific criteria to be tax-exempt under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). Organizations must apply for exemption with the IRS under Section 501(c) and specify the qualifying paragraph. This process is straightforward for most categories, such as fraternal societies under Section 501(c)(8) and credit unions under Section 501(c)(14). Section 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) organizations both operate for charitable purposes, but differ in key ways. 501(c)(3) organizations can receive tax-deductible contributions, while 501(c)(4) organizations generally cannot. This tax benefit encourages donors to contribute more. Additionally, 501(c)(3) organizations have limitations on lobbying activities. 501(c)(3) organizations are limited in lobbying and campaign activity, while 501(c)(4) organizations are not. When choosing between the two, consider the group's agenda and whether it depends on influencing public opinion or legislation. It may be more beneficial to form as a 501(c)(4) organization for lobbying purposes. However, for tax-deductible contributions, it is usually better to be a 501(c)(3) organization. Organizations can be linked with both types under certain circumstances. A Section 501(c)(3) organization can conduct charitable activities and may be linked with other tax-exempt organizations. These organizations must be legally separate entities, and their activities and funds must be kept separate. Public charities provide charitable services directly to beneficiaries, while private foundations are tightly controlled and make grants. Private foundations receive funds from a small number of donors or a single source and make grants to other organizations instead of directly carrying out charitable activities. They are closely regulated to prevent self-dealing or abuse of position by the controlling group. Private foundations face penalty taxes for various violations, such as failing to distribute a certain amount of income annually or making investments that jeopardize their charitable purpose. Organizations classified as private foundations under Section 501(c)(3) must demonstrate how they qualify for public charity status based on support and control tests in IRC Section 509. Contributions made for charitable purposes are tax-deductible under Section 170. Contributions for charitable purposes are tax deductible under Section 170 when made to qualifying organizations like Section 501(c)(3) organizations. The IRS determines eligibility for tax-deductible contributions when considering an organization's exempt status application. Donors can verify eligibility using the IRS \"Exempt Organizations Select Check\" search engine. Contributions meeting Section 170 requirements are not deductible if goods or services are provided in exchange, unless the contribution exceeds the fair market value of the exchange. When an organization receives over $75 in exchange for goods or services, it must inform the donor of the tax-deductible amount. Individual taxpayers may not be able to deduct the entire contribution, as only itemizers can deduct charitable contributions. Section 170 may limit the deduction based on the contribution size and nature. Substantiation requirements include obtaining a written acknowledgment for contributions over $250 and providing proof for cash donations. If a contribution to a tax-exempt organization is not deductible, the organization must comply with certain rules. When a contribution to a tax-exempt organization is not deductible, the organization must notify the potential contributor at the time of solicitation. Failure to provide this notification can result in fines of $1,000 per day, up to $10,000 annually. Organizations that intentionally disregard this requirement face higher fines with no annual cap. Dues to certain tax-exempt organizations may be deductible as business expenses, but lobbying or political activities may disallow a deduction for those portions. Organizations must inform members of nondeductible amounts to avoid proxy taxes on lobbying or political expenditures. Under the IRC, tax-exempt organizations face restrictions on lobbying and political expenditures. Section 501(c)(3) organizations, for example, are limited in their lobbying activities to ensure that \"no substantial part\" of their activities involves lobbying. The definition of \"no substantial part\" is vague, leading courts to consider factors like expenditures and time spent on lobbying. This standard poses challenges for Section 501(c)(3) organizations. Tax-exempt organizations, except churches, can choose to measure lobbying activities by a numerical limit in IRC Section 4911. If a Section 501(c)(3) organization conducts substantial lobbying, it may lose its exempt status and face excise taxes under Sections 4911 and 4912. Private foundations are taxed on lobbying expenditures under IRC Section 4945. Other tax-exempt organizations like social welfare organizations, labor unions, and trade associations are not subject to tax law limits on lobbying. Lobbying by tax-exempt organizations can impact their contributors. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 prohibits Section 501(c)(4) organizations from receiving federal grants if they engage in lobbying activities, even with their own funds. Tax-exempt organizations like Section 501(c)(3) can lose their status for participating in political campaigns. Section 501(c)(3) organizations can lose their tax-exempt status for engaging in election-related activities supporting or opposing candidates. They can participate in non-campaign political activities like public forums and issue advertising as long as they remain nonpartisan. Other types of Section 501(c) organizations are generally allowed to engage in campaign activity as long as it complies with IRS regulations. Section 501(c) organizations like social welfare organizations, labor unions, and trade associations can engage in limited campaign activity under the IRC, but must comply with election laws. They may be subject to tax under Section 527(f) if they influence elections. The tax imposed on tax-exempt organizations is based on their expenditures or net investment income. It may discourage some organizations from directly engaging in certain activities, leading them to set up separate funds. Section 527 political organizations are subject to special tax rules for income used in political activities. Incorporation is often the first step for many tax-exempt organizations. Incorporation is a crucial step for tax-exempt organizations to receive limited personal liability for their members. The organization needs to register with the Secretary of State to conduct business, own property, and solicit charitable contributions. Filing articles of incorporation is necessary, regardless of tax-exempt status, and applying for tax-exempt status from the IRS is required for Section 501(c)(3) organizations. To obtain tax-exempt status as a 501(c)(3) organization, filing an application with the IRS is generally required. Some qualifying organizations, like those with gross receipts under $5,000 and churches, are exempt from this requirement. The application is filed using IRS Form 1023, with a simplified version (Form 1023-EZ) available for smaller groups. A fee is required for filing either form, and an employer identification number (IRS Form SS-4) must be obtained. Other types of 501(c) organizations usually do not need to apply for tax-exempt status. Organizations generally do not need to apply for tax-exempt status, but can choose to do so using IRS Form 1024. The application fee varies based on the organization's gross receipts, ranging from $400 to $850. The IRS may revoke an organization's tax-exempt status if it violates the law or undergoes significant changes. Additionally, the IRS can suspend tax-exempt status for organizations designated as terrorist organizations. The IRS can revoke an organization's tax-exempt status if it violates the law or undergoes significant changes. Organizations designated as supporting terrorism can also have their tax-exempt status suspended. Individuals can file a complaint with the IRS using Form 13909 to challenge an organization's exempt status. However, it is not possible to legally challenge the IRS's decision to grant an exemption to an organization. The Supreme Court in 1976 limited third parties' ability to challenge IRS policies by requiring a direct personal injury for standing. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals stated that it is rare for a third party to have standing to challenge the tax-exempt status of an organization. Most tax-exempt organizations must file annual information returns disclosing financial details. The Form 990 has schedules for donor information, campaign activities, and related organizations. Failure to file incurs penalties, with higher penalties for organizations with over $1 million in annual gross receipts. Organizations with less than $50,000 in gross receipts can file Form 990-N electronically. Failure to file Form 990-N for three years results in tax-exempt status revocation. Tax-exempt organizations may be subject to tax and must file a tax return if applicable. Tax-exempt organizations must file various tax forms depending on their activities, such as Form 990-T for unrelated business activities, Form 1120-POL for political organization income, and Form 4720 for penalty taxes. They are also required to pay employment taxes like for-profit employers, including income tax withholding, Social Security, Medicare taxes, and unemployment taxes. Failure to file tax returns or pay taxes can result in penalties, including for estimated tax payments and employment taxes. Some organizations may have additional requirements. Tax-exempt organizations must file various tax forms depending on their activities, such as Form 990-T for unrelated business activities and Form 1120-POL for political organization income. They are also required to pay employment taxes like for-profit employers, including income tax withholding, Social Security, Medicare taxes, and unemployment taxes. Some organizations, like political organizations under Section 527(j), must file periodic reports to the IRS disclosing contributions and expenditures. Additionally, organizations must allow public inspection of their exempt status application, annual information return (Form 990), and unrelated business income tax returns (Form 990-T). Tax-exempt organizations must provide copies of documents upon request, either in writing or in person, with immediate provision for in-person requests and within 30 days for written requests. A reasonable fee can be charged for reproduction and mailing costs. Exceptions exist for disclosure, such as not having to provide individual copies if documents are widely available online or if requests are part of a harassment campaign. The IRS can create exceptions for public disclosure of certain information to protect the organization. Tax-exempt organizations must provide copies of documents upon request, with exceptions for disclosure to protect the organization. If an organization refuses to provide returns, Form 13909 can be filed with the IRS. The IRS may assess penalties for failure to provide returns. Information can be obtained from the IRS using Form 4506-A or from organizations like GuideStar. GuideStar [www.guidestar.org] may have copies of recent Form 990s for organizations. Charity Watch and BBB Wise Giving Alliance provide ratings and reports on charities' financial and managerial practices. Access to reports may require a fee, but they list charities with high grades. The Alliance's website provides reports on charities' staff, governance, financial status, and fund-raising practices, including whether they meet standards for charitable solicitations.
