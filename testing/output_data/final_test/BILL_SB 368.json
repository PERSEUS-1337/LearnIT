    "title": "SB 368",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The California Workplace Flexibility Act of 2015/2016 allows for flexible work schedules to benefit employers and workers by addressing outdated and inefficient workplace and overtime rules. California's unique overtime laws hinder flexibility in scheduling, making it challenging for employers to establish flexible work arrangements. The act aims to permit employers to offer a four 10-hour days per week schedule without requiring overtime pay. The California Workplace Flexibility Act of 2015/2016 aims to allow employees to work four 10-hour days per week without overtime pay, providing them with more time for family and personal matters. The California Workplace Flexibility Act of 2015/2016 allows employees to work four 10-hour days per week without overtime pay. Overtime rates apply after 10 hours in a day and double pay after 12 hours. Workers receive overtime for any hours over 40 in a week. The California Workplace Flexibility Act of 2015/2016 allows employees to work four 10-hour days per week without overtime pay, benefiting unionized workplaces more than nonunionized ones. In California, the labor law states that eight hours of work is considered a day's work. Any work exceeding eight hours in a day or 40 hours in a week must be compensated at 1.5 times the regular rate. Working over 12 hours in a day or on the seventh day of the week requires double the regular pay. The law does not require combining different rates of overtime pay. An alternative workweek schedule can be adopted under various sections of the Labor Code, and commuting time in an employer-owned vehicle for ridesharing is not considered part of a workday. This section does not impact an employer's liability under workers' compensation law. Section 511.5 of the Labor Code allows nonexempt employees to work up to 10 hours per workday without overtime pay if requested in writing and approved by the employer, known as an overtime exemption for a flexible work schedule. If an employee-selected flexible work schedule is adopted, the employer must pay overtime at 1.5 times the regular rate for hours over 40 in a workweek or 10 in a workday. Overtime for work over 12 hours in a day or on the fifth, sixth, or seventh day of the week is paid at double the regular rate. The employer can consider employee requests for flexible schedules but cannot offer benefits or threats to induce requests. The employee or employer can end the flexible work schedule by giving written notice. The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement will enforce this section. This section prevails over any inconsistent provisions in any wage order of the Industrial Welfare Commission."
