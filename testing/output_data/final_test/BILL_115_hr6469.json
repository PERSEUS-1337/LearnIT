    "content": "The \"Integration of Baseball Commemorative Coin Act\" may be cited as the short title. The findings section is included in the Act. The Congress finds that the integration of Major League Baseball in 1947, with Jackie Robinson and Larry Doby breaking the color barrier, was a significant moment in American history and the Civil Rights Movement. The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, along with the Jackie Robinson Foundation, highlight baseball's role in ending racial segregation and promoting civil rights in the United States. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS. The coins issued under this Act will be square in shape, with enhanced uncirculated treatment on the reverse side. The Secretary of the Treasury may also use this treatment on the obverse side. The coins will commemorate the 75th anniversary of baseball integration and include $5 gold coins weighing 1 ounce and containing at least 90 percent gold, as well as $1 silver coins. The Act authorizes the minting of $1 silver coins weighing 26.73 grams with at least 90 percent silver content, limited to 500,000 coins. Additionally, up to 750,000 half-dollar clad coins will be minted with specifications chosen by the Secretary. All coins minted under this Act are legal tender and considered numismatic items. SEC. 4. DESIGN OF COINS. The design for the coins minted under this Act shall be selected by the Secretary in consultation with the National Baseball Hall of Fame, the Commission of Fine Arts, and reviewed by the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee. Each coin minted under this Act shall have a value designation using a dollar sign and a numeral, an inscription of the year \"2022\", and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design of the coins minted under this Act will feature a baseball diamond on the common reverse. The Secretary will conduct a competition to determine the emblematic design of the common obverse, encouraging 3-dimensional models to be submitted. The Secretary may accept proposals from artists, engravers, and the public for the design contest, with a focus on youth baseball program participants. The compensation for the winning design will be at least $5,000, which will impact the sale price of the coins. Coins minted under this Act will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities, and the Secretary can only issue them during a 1-year period starting on January 1, 2022. SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS.\n\nThe coins will be sold by the Secretary at a price equal to the face value, surcharge, and cost of designing and issuing. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted with a reasonable discount.\n\nSEC. 7. SURCHARGES. All sales of coins minted under this Act include surcharges: $50 for the $5 coin, $10 for the $1 coin, and $5 for the half-dollar coin. Surcharges received will be promptly paid to the National Baseball Hall of Fame for education programs on baseball integration and artifact preservation. The Hall of Fame will work with the Jackie Robinson Foundation for these programs. The Hall of Fame will be audited as per title 31, United States Code. The Secretary of the Treasury may issue guidance to carry out the audit requirements of section 5134(f)(2) of title 31, United States Code, regarding amounts received under subsection (b). No surcharge may be included for issuing any coin if it would exceed the annual commemorative coin program limitation under section 5112(m)(1) of title 31, United States Code."
