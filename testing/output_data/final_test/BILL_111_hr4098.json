It also addresses the use of such software on personal computers for telework purposes. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must develop a procedure for approving specific open-network peer-to-peer file sharing software programs for Government employees and contractors. The software must be necessary for agency operations or instrumental in supporting the agency's mission. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must direct agencies to establish or update personal use policies consistent with guidance issued, require contractors to comply with the guidance, and update their information technology within 180 days of the Act's enactment.
