    "content": "The Teacher Liability Protection Act, also known as the Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001, amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to provide protection for teachers. The Act aims to address liability issues faced by teachers in the education system. The Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001 acknowledges the challenges faced by teachers, principals, and school professionals due to frivolous lawsuits, increasing violence in schools, and the need for a safe environment to improve educational opportunities. The Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001 aims to limit liability for school professionals taking reasonable actions to maintain order and discipline in schools, recognizing the importance of protecting teachers from frivolous lawsuits that impact the education of millions of children nationwide. The purpose of the Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001 is to provide school professionals with tools to maintain order, discipline, and an appropriate educational environment. The Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001 preempts state laws inconsistent with it, except for laws providing additional teacher liability protection. States can elect nonapplicability of the Act for civil actions against teachers by enacting specific legislation. The Act also limits liability for teachers. Liability Protection for Teachers under the Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001 includes immunity for harm caused by acts or omissions within the scope of their employment, in conformity with laws, and with proper licensing. The Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001 provides immunity for harm caused by teachers within the scope of their responsibilities, as long as it was not due to willful misconduct, gross negligence, or operating a vehicle without proper licensing. This does not affect civil actions brought by schools or governmental entities against teachers. The Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001 provides immunity for harm caused by teachers within their responsibilities, except for willful misconduct or gross negligence. State laws imposing liability on schools or entities for teacher actions are not inconsistent with this protection. The Teacher Liability Protection Act of 2001 limits punitive damages against teachers for actions within their responsibilities unless clear evidence of willful misconduct or gross negligence is proven. This does not create a cause of action for punitive damages and does not override any existing laws limiting punitive damages. Exceptions to the limitations on liability for teachers include misconduct involving violence, sexual offenses, violation of civil rights laws, or acts of international terrorism. The limitations on liability for teachers do not apply in cases involving violence, sexual offenses, violation of civil rights laws, or intoxication at the time of misconduct. \"SEC. 15005. LIABILITY FOR NONECONOMIC LOSS.\" In civil actions against teachers, liability for noneconomic loss is determined based on the teacher's responsibility for the harm to the claimant. Each defendant teacher is liable only for the portion of noneconomic loss directly related to their responsibility for the harm. \"In civil actions against teachers, the trier of fact determines the percentage of responsibility of a defendant teacher for the claimant's harm to allocate noneconomic loss.\" \"SEC. 15006. DEFINITIONS.\" The term 'economic loss' refers to pecuniary loss resulting from harm, including loss of earnings, medical expenses, burial costs, and loss of business opportunities. 'Harm' encompasses physical, nonphysical, economic, and noneconomic losses. 'Noneconomic losses' include physical and emotional pain, suffering, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life. The term 'school' refers to public or private educational institutions, while 'State' encompasses various regions within the United States and its territories. A 'teacher' is defined as an educational professional involved in instruction or administration. The curr_chunk refers to individuals working in educational institutions such as schools, school boards, and educational agencies. The Teacher Liability Protection Act will take effect 90 days after enactment. It applies to any claim for harm caused by a teacher's act or omission filed on or after the effective date, regardless of when the harm occurred."
