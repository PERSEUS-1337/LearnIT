    "content": "The 2008 farm bill provisions were extended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act in 2013. Parts of the bill expired in 2013, leading to concerns about implementing outdated laws for dairy in 2014. The Agricultural Act of 2014 resolved the issue, pushing the expiration to 2018. Limited progress was made on a new farm bill in 2012. Limited progress was made on the farm bill in 2012, leading to a one-year extension in P.L. 112-240. In 2013, the Senate passed S. 954, but the House faced difficulties passing a bill due to disagreements over the nutrition title. Eventually, a final farm bill was enacted in February 2014 after combining different bills into one. The 2014 farm bill was enacted in February 2014 after facing delays. Questions arise about the consequences of not enacting a new farm bill, including the impact on programs like SNAP and crop insurance benefits. The expiration of a farm bill affects various authorities and funding mechanisms, leading to uncertainties when the bill expires or appropriations are delayed. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) states that appropriations can continue even without a new farm bill or extension. Congress differentiates between authorizations and appropriations, but GAO emphasizes that funding for programs can still be authorized even if the funding authorization has expired. The farm bill allows for discretionary spending on various programs, including rural development, research, education, conservation, and nutrition. Some programs receive both mandatory and discretionary funding. The Congressional Budget Office tracks programs with expired authorizations, with 18 agricultural programs receiving over $37 million in FY2012. Over 100 farm bill programs lost authorization briefly in FY2012, receiving $2.3 billion until a one-year extension was passed on January 1, 2013. Most farm bill programs with mandatory funding have expiration dates on their program or funding authority, including SNAP, farm commodity programs, conservation programs, agricultural trade programs, and foreign food aid programs. Without reauthorization or extension, these programs would cease to operate. Exceptions include SNAP, which can continue via appropriations, crop insurance which is permanently authorized, and some conservation programs extended through FY2014. Mandatory spending for farm programs includes farm commodity programs, crop insurance, nutrition assistance, conservation, and trade programs. Nutrition assistance received the largest share of funding in 2013, followed by crop insurance, conservation, and farm commodity programs. Programs relying on mandatory funding are at risk for interruption without farm bill action. The enacted extension in January 2013 continued farm bill programs with mandatory funding until September 30, 2013. Certain programs lacked baseline beyond FY2012 and required offsets for future funding, including agricultural disaster assistance, conservation, specialty crop research, organic research, and rural development programs. The extension in January 2013 continued farm bill programs with mandatory funding until September 30, 2013. However, programs like disadvantaged farmer programs, rural development, bioenergy, and farmers market promotion did not receive mandatory funding. Despite an \"authorization of appropriation\" for discretionary funding in FY2013, no funding was provided in the full-year appropriation for FY2013 or the continuing resolution for FY2014. As a result, these programs remained unfunded throughout 2013. Farm bills have become more complex and politically sensitive, leading to longer enactment times compared to previous decades. For example, the 1973 farm bill was enacted in less than two months, while the 2008 farm bill took over a year to pass due to complications with revenue provisions from other committees. The 2014 farm bill took over 18 months to pass, spanning the 112th and 113th Congresses. Both the 2008 and 2002 farm bills expired before extensions were enacted, with the 2008 bill requiring a full year extension due to the legislative process restarting in the 113th Congress. The legislative process to restart in the 113th Congress for enacting farm bills after the fiscal year is common. Farm bills have been enacted at various times in the past, with the most recent ones passed in April (1996), May (2002), June (2008), and February (2014). The House and Senate have alternated as the first chamber to take action on farm bills since 1965. Since 1965, farm bills have been marked up in various years, with 8 out of 12 bills introduced in the first session of a two-year Congress. The 2014 farm bill was an exception, starting in one Congress and needing to be reintroduced in a subsequent Congress. Enactment of the past five farm bills (1990-2014) occurred in the second session, with only the 1970 and 1990 bills enacted after an election during a lame-duck Congress. A nutrition title has been included in each farm bill since 1973. Since 1970, only the 2002 and 2008 farm bills required extensions as successors were delayed. The 1965 farm bill was extended early, while the 1996 and 2002 bills were not delayed. Extensions are rare due to appropriations continuity. Extensions are rare in farm bills due to appropriations continuity. The primary concern is the expiration of mandatory programs, which can be temporarily extended but may require offsets for those without continuing funding. When the 2002 farm bill expired, portions of it were extended multiple times for less than a year. The 2008 farm bill extended certain provisions from the 2007 bill but did not extend programs for major commodities like feed grains and cotton. The bill expired in 2012, with some programs continuing under a continuing resolution. The 2008 farm bill was extended in 2013 to avoid reverting to permanent law for farm commodity programs. The dairy price support program was continued until December 31, 2013. However, most of the farm bill expired again on October 1, 2013, with some programs ceasing new operations. The dairy program technically reverted to an outdated 1949-era law from January 1, 2014, until enactment on February 7, 2014. The farm bill expiration and government shutdown in October 2013 caused challenges for some operations. Farm commodity price and income support programs aim to raise farm income by making payments and reducing financial risks. Dairy price supports and export incentives were set to expire on December 31, 2012. The American Taxpayer Relief Act extended farm commodity programs, including the direct payment program and dairy price support program, until 2013. The new effective deadlines for enacting the farm bill were set for January 1, 2014, for dairy and the 2014 crop year for other commodities. The House passed a one-month extension in December 2013 to extend program authorities until January 31, 2014. The farm bill extension (H.R. 3695) aimed to avoid uncertainty by extending program authorities until January 31, 2014. The dairy program temporarily reverted to outdated 1949-era law until the 2014 farm bill was enacted on February 7, 2014. Permanent law provisions from the Agriculture Adjustment Act of 1938 still exist despite updates in farm bills. The 1938 and 1949 permanent laws in the Agriculture Adjustment Act were suspended by more modern farm bills, but if not renewed, they would resume. The House farm bill aimed to repeal these laws and establish a new permanent law for farm commodity programs. The Senate bill and the enacted 2014 farm bill continued to suspend the permanent law provisions. The 2014 farm bill did not repeal permanent law but continued to suspend it. Proposals to repeal permanent law are rare due to the significant differences from current policy and potential costs to the government. Permanent law provides mandatory support for basic crops through nonrecourse loans, without modern support approaches. A 1985 USDA report highlighted market intervention and increased government expenditures under permanent law. The White House estimated that reverting to permanent law could cost the government over $12 billion per year for dairy, resulting in milk prices doubling. Without a comprehensive budget estimate from any agency, USDA would be required to implement permanent law if the farm bill expires. The USDA may need time to develop processes to implement permanent law if the farm bill expires. While it may become the \"law of the land\" immediately, the practical effect could be gradual. Secretary Visack suggested it could take at least a month to implement permanent law. Secretary Vilsack stated that it could take at least a month to implement permanent law if a new farm bill is enacted. Support under permanent law is based on \"parity prices,\" which may not align with modern farming practices due to technological advancements. Under permanent law, support levels for various commodities could be as high as 90% of parity, with milk support between 75% and 90% of parity. Nonrecourse loan rates for wheat, rice, cotton, corn, and other feed grains serve as farm price supports. Permanent law supports could exceed 2013 market prices, leading to higher federal outlays compared to the 2008 farm bill. Grains serve as farm price supports through nonrecourse loans, with USDA allowing farmers to repay loans for less than the principal plus interest. Additional production controls exist for wheat and cotton, with mandatory acreage allotments and marketing quotas. Not all commodities in the 2008 (or 2014) farm bill receiving federal support are covered by permanent law. The 2008 (or 2014) farm bill covers commodities that receive federal support under permanent law, including soybeans, oilseeds, peanuts, wool, mohair, sugar beets, sugar cane, dry peas, lentils, and chickpeas. Parity-based supports for wool, mohair, and peanuts were repealed, and oilseeds and sugar do not qualify for parity support. Discretionary authority in the Agricultural Act of 1949 and the CCC Charter Act allows for support of other commodities, but it is rarely used due to budgetary reasons. The existence of permanent law ensures that farm commodity programs are revisited when a farm bill expires to avoid the consequences of permanent law. The existence of permanent law in the farm bill necessitates Congress to take action before expiration to avoid reverting to undesirable policies. Legislative options include passing a new farm bill, extending the current one, suspending permanent law, or repealing it and taking subsequent actions. Inaction would lead to consequences that almost everyone would regret. If Congress cannot agree on a new farm bill, extending the current one is the likely option to avoid reverting to permanent law. Repealing permanent law would allow for debate on farm supports without the consequence of inaction, but this also requires legislative action. Some find it easier to negotiate a new farm bill than to deal with repealing permanent law. The federal crop insurance program protects producers against crop losses and is permanently authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act. The Federal Crop Insurance Program is permanently authorized and does not require reauthorization in the farm bill. Producers of ineligible crops may qualify for direct payments under USDA's Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program. In 2013, USDA administered over 20 agricultural conservation programs providing technical and financial assistance for natural resource concerns on private agricultural and forested lands. Many conservation programs had different expiration dates and funding authority, impacting their status during the 2008 farm bill expiration and extension. The 2008 farm bill extension allowed conservation programs with expired mandatory funding authority to continue until September 30, 2013. The Conservation Reserve Program's funding and program authority were extended to the end of FY2013, allowing the program to continue at the original authorized rate of enrollment. Without reauthorization or further extension, expired conservation programs were unable to sign new contracts or enroll additional acres after September 30, 2013. The 2008 farm bill extension allowed conservation programs with expired mandatory funding authority to continue until September 30, 2013. Existing contracts and agreements stayed in force, with payments continuing. Some programs had limited baseline beyond FY2012 due to previous reductions in annual appropriations, impacting enrollment levels. The Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) had authority to enroll a limited number of acres within its original cap. Other programs had no baseline beyond FY2012, affecting their ability to enroll new acres. The FY2012 Agriculture Appropriations Act extended funding authority for select mandatory conservation programs, including AMA, CSP, EQIP, FPP, and Wildlife Habitat Incentives, due to budget enforcement rules and appropriations dynamics. The last year of authorization was used to determine the 10-year funding baseline for farm bill reauthorization. The FY2012 Agriculture Appropriations Act extended funding authority for select mandatory conservation programs like AMA, CSP, EQIP, FPP, and Wildlife Habitat Incentives. Program authority for reduced programs was extended to 2014, allowing them to continue operating without affecting the farm bill baseline. Some conservation programs have permanent authority, while others require annual appropriations. Funding levels vary based on appropriations. Some discretionary programs expired in FY2013 but can continue with appropriated funding. Conservation programs are categorized by funding authority type\u2014mandatory and discretionary. The adjusted gross income requirement no longer applied to conservation programs during the expiration period. Compliance activities and regional equity funding requirements continued for programs authorized beyond September 30, 2013. The nutrition authorizations in the 2008 farm bill expired after September 30, 2012, and were extended another year. Operations were able to continue under short-term appropriations and full-year FY2014 appropriation. The impact on operations of various domestic food assistance programs, including SNAP and TEFAP, is based on authorizing statutes, appropriations actions, and farm bill extensions. These programs fell into three categories for expiration or extension: permanently authorized and funded, continued solely by appropriations action, or requiring specific authorities for continuation. The 2008 farm bill included an expansion of the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) and permanently funded it through Section 32, allowing it to continue without expiration. Appropriations for SNAP can also extend operations for most nutrition programs in the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, even without a farm bill extension. The first weeks of FY2014 faced unique circumstances with an expired farm bill extension and lapsed appropriations. The farm bill nutrition provisions could continue operating with funds appropriated to the SNAP account, thanks to the CR (P.L. 113-46) and full-year appropriation (P.L. 113-76). Most aspects of SNAP operations, TEFAP commodities purchase and distribution, FDPIR, nutrition assistance funding for certain territories, and Community Food Projects continued to operate. The authority and funding for the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (SFMNP) expired after September 30, 2012, but was extended through September 30, 2013 with P.L. 112-240. However, it expired again when the extension ended. Other programs required specific appropriations or extensions of authority to operate, with no appropriations made in FY2013 or FY2014. The authorities for Hunger-Free Communities grants, SNAP pilot projects, FDPIR's \"Traditionally and Locally Grown Food Fund,\" Nutrition Information and Awareness Pilot Program, and USDA's purchase of commodity foods were extended by P.L. 112-240 but expired on September 30, 2013. Additional funding would have required specific authorization and appropriation to continue these programs beyond FY2013. The new farm bill prevented the expiration of agricultural trade and international food aid programs. Trade programs with mandatory funding affected included export credit guarantees, export market promotion, dairy export subsidies, and technical assistance for specialty crops. Without new program authority, the Commodity Credit Corporation would not have been able to support U.S. agricultural exports. Food aid programs affected were the Food for Peace Act. The new farm bill prevented the expiration of agricultural trade and international food aid programs, including the Food for Peace Act, the Farmer-to-Farmer program, Food for Progress program, Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust, and McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program. Presidential vetoes of farm bills are rare, with only two complete farm bills being vetoed as stand-alone measures in 1956 and 2008. In 1956, President Eisenhower vetoed the first version of the Agricultural Act. In 2008, President George W. Bush vetoed the farm bill twice, which was eventually overridden by Congress. The 2008 farm bill was the only one enacted by overriding a veto. In 1995, a farm bill was vetoed as part of a larger budget reconciliation package. The 1995 budget reconciliation package, which included the first version of the 1996 farm bill, was vetoed by President Clinton. The veto was not necessarily due to the farm bill itself. The \"permanent law\" provisions for farm commodity programs were enacted in the 1938 and 1949 Agriculture Adjustment Acts. These provisions have been suspended for the duration of each farm bill, rather than being repealed. If no action is taken when a farm bill expires, the suspension of permanent law also expires, allowing the policies of permanent law to resume. The 1938 and 1949 Agriculture Adjustment Acts established \"permanent law\" provisions for farm commodity programs, which have been suspended during each farm bill. If no action is taken when a farm bill expires, the suspension of permanent law also expires, allowing the policies of permanent law to resume. In the 1950s and 1960s, farm bills amended these acts, sometimes making amendments permanent or applicable only for specific years. The 1970s saw a shift away from using permanent law provisions in farm bills, but some bills still incorporated provisions from the 1938 and 1949 acts. The 1977 farm bill onwards, direct suspension or nonapplicability language has been used regarding the permanent laws, continuing through the 2014 farm bill. Repeal proposals for permanent law have been rare, with some advancing during the 1996 farm bill development. The existence of permanent law could have been an obstacle if Agricultural Market Transition Act payments were to end in 2002. During the 1995-1996 farm bill negotiations, the repeal of permanent law was considered but ultimately dropped in favor of continued suspension. The House and Senate had differing approaches, with the final conference agreement adopting the Senate's repeal provision. The agreement passed both chambers but was vetoed for reasons unrelated to the farm bill provisions. In 1996, a stand-alone farm bill was passed with a provision to repeal permanent law, which was later suspended instead. Other bills from 1995 to 2001 also proposed repealing permanent law but were not formally considered. In 1996, a stand-alone farm bill was passed with a provision to repeal permanent law, which was later suspended. Several bills from 1995 to 2001 also proposed repealing permanent law but did not progress beyond committee referral. The 2014 farm bill replaced the suspension of permanent law with the repeal of certain provisions. The House-passed farm bill in 2013 would have repealed the 1938 and 1949 permanent laws and established new permanent laws for farm commodity programs. The Senate bill and the enacted 2014 farm bill continued to suspend permanent law."
