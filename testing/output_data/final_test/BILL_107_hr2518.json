    "content": "The \"Clean Green School Bus Act of 2001\" establishes a pilot program. The Secretary of Energy will establish a pilot program for awarding grants to eligible entities to promote the use of alternative fuel school buses. Grant requirements will be published, and proposals will be solicited within specified timeframes. Grants will only be awarded to local governmental entities responsible for school transportation. Grants under this section may be provided to local governmental entities for school bus services, including replacement bus grants and fleet expansion bus grants for areas with high numbers of low-income families. Replacement Bus Grants require that for each new bus acquired, an older model year bus must be retired and crushed. The order of bus acquisition prioritizes replacing buses manufactured before model year 1977 first, followed by diesel-powered buses manufactured before model year 1991 if necessary. Replacement Bus Grants prioritize replacing buses manufactured before model year 1977. Grants require exchanging older buses for buses from another fleet, with the old bus being crushed. The Secretary gives priority to applicants focusing on replacing older buses. Grants come with the condition that acquired buses must be used in the school bus fleet for at least 5 years. The grant requires replacing buses manufactured before 1977 with new alternative fuel school buses. Funds can be used for buses and up to 15% of the price for necessary alternative fuel infrastructure. The buses acquired must be used in the school bus fleet for a minimum of 5 years. The grant recipient must contribute 10% of the total cost of a replacement bus, not exceeding $10,000, for buses manufactured before specific model years. The grant recipient must contribute 10% of the total cost of a replacement bus, not exceeding $10,000, for buses manufactured before specific model years. Funding under a grant may be used to acquire new school buses with a gross vehicle weight over 14,000 pounds, powered by a heavy-duty engine, and meeting specific emission standards. The Secretary aims to achieve nationwide deployment of alternative fuel school buses, with a goal of no State receiving more than 10% of the grant funding in a fiscal year. The buses must meet specific emission standards and be powered by electricity, natural gas, propane, or ethanol at a minimum of 85% by volume. The Fuel Cell Bus Development and Demonstration Program is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary will establish a program for cooperative agreements with private sector fuel cell bus developers to develop fuel cell-powered school buses. Non-Federal contributions required for activities funded under this program are specified. Funding for this program is limited to $25,000,000 for fiscal years 2002 through 2006. The Secretary will transmit a report to Congress evaluating the conversion of natural gas infrastructure for fuel cell-powered school buses and assessing the development program results by October 1, 2006. Authorization of appropriations for carrying out the Act includes $40 million for 2002, $50 million for 2003, $60 million for 2004, $70 million for 2005, and $80 million for 2006."
