    "content": "The \"Mental Health in Schools Act of 2007\" is the short title of this Act. Congress finds that 1 in 5 children have a diagnosable mental disorder, 1 in 10 have a serious emotional or behavioral disorder, and 75% of children with these disorders do not receive specialty mental health services. Additionally, only half of schools have partnerships with mental health providers, highlighting the need for resources to support students' mental health needs. Effective school mental health programs involve collaboration and commitment from families, students, educators, and community partners to provide appropriate supports and services. The purpose of this Act is to expand the Safe Schools-Healthy Students program to provide more comprehensive school-based mental health services and training for school personnel to identify and support children with mental illness. Amendments to the Public Health Service Act are also included. The Public Health Service Act is amended to assist local communities and schools in applying a public health approach to mental health services in schools and the community. The Public Health Service Act is amended to implement a comprehensive school mental health program that addresses child and adolescent mental health issues, incorporating positive behavioral interventions and supports. The Public Health Service Act is amended to require partnerships between education agencies and community programs for mental health services. Partnerships between education agencies and community programs for mental health services must submit an application endorsed by all members, ensuring various entities are involved in carrying out activities under this section. Partnerships for mental health services must submit an application that clearly outlines responsibilities, accountability, and funding contributions of each partner to sustain the program. The program should support flexible use of funds to address mental health needs. The flexible use of funds is aimed at promoting social, emotional, and behavioral health of students, reducing the likelihood of at-risk students developing problems, providing treatment for existing issues, early identification of problems, and implementing early intervention services. The comprehensive mental health program includes culturally and linguistically appropriate training for school personnel to identify and support children with mental illness, refer them to treatment services, and implement strategies for promoting mental health. The comprehensive school-based mental health program must include strategies for promoting a positive environment, ongoing training, sustainability measures after funding ends, support from the state educational and mental health system, and be based on evidence-based practices. The comprehensive school-based mental health program must be coordinated with early intervening activities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and culturally appropriate. The duration of the program shall be specified, with each entity eligible for only one award. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include an evaluation process for activities carried out by entities providing regional services and supports. This process includes guidelines for program data submission, measures of outcomes, and annual reports. The Administrator shall develop measures of outcomes for recipients of assistance under this section, including student and family measures and local educational measures. The Administrator shall develop measures to evaluate the impact of programs on students and families, including social and emotional competency, academic competency, disruptive behaviors, family functioning, substance abuse, and aggressive behaviors. The Administrator will develop measures to evaluate the impact of programs on students and families, including social and emotional competency, academic competency, disruptive behaviors, family functioning, substance abuse, and aggressive behaviors. Local educational outcomes will assess the effectiveness of comprehensive school mental health programs in reducing suspensions, truancy, expulsions, violence, increasing graduation rates, and improving access to care for mental health disorders. The curr_chunk discusses the evaluation criteria for programs, including partnership linkages, sustainability, and training effectiveness. The curr_chunk outlines the requirement for entities receiving grants to submit annual reports evaluating program success. The Administrator will then evaluate the data and submit a report to Congress on program results and effectiveness. The curr_chunk amends the Public Health Service Act to specify the amount of grants and authorization of appropriations for grant years 2008 through 2012. The maximum grant amount is $1,000,000 based on the population of children served, with $200,000,000 authorized for each fiscal year. The Public Health Service Act is further amended by this section to specify grant amounts and authorization of appropriations for grant years 2008 through 2012. The Public Health Service Act is amended to address school-based mental health and children and violence by updating section 581."
