    "content": "The \"Clean Engine Technology Act of 2003\" may be cited as the official title. It introduces a credit for qualifying clean technology engines under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Clean Engine Technology Act of 2003\" introduces a tax credit for qualifying clean technology engines placed in service by taxpayers in connection with their trade or business. The credit is 25% of the engine's cost, capped at $15,000 per taxpayer per year. Additionally, there is a limit of $13,600 per ton of emissions eliminated. The \"clean technology engine\" is a qualifying engine that replaces a non-qualifying diesel engine in heavy-duty trucks, buses, or off-highway use. It must emit 75% of its emissions in a severe or extreme ozone nonattainment area. The \"clean technology engine\" must emit at least 30% fewer ozone forming pollutants than the engine it replaces, meet Federal and State pollution control requirements, and be certified by the local air pollution control authority. This includes engines in new motor vehicles. The qualifying clean technology engine in a new motor vehicle must replace a diesel engine in the old vehicle used by the taxpayer before the new vehicle is placed in service. The taxpayer must destroy the old engine before receiving a credit for the new clean technology engine. The credit cannot exceed the regular tax reduced by other allowable credits. The basis of the property is reduced by the cost of the new engine. No double benefit is allowed for any deduction. The credit for clean technology engines cannot exceed the regular tax reduced by other credits. The basis of the property is reduced by the cost of the new engine. Any deduction for a cost used to calculate the credit must be reduced by the amount of the credit. Excess credit can be carried back three years and forward 20 years. The enactment of this paragraph includes rules for credit carryback and carryforward. Special rules similar to section 179A(e) apply, and regulations will be prescribed by the Secretary. The section does not apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2009. Conforming amendments are made to Section 1016(a) of the Code. The Code is amended by adding a new paragraph (29) in section 30B(e) and making changes to section 55(c)(2) by inserting \"30B(d),\" after \"30(b)(3),\". The table of sections for subpart B of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 is also updated. The amendments made by this section apply to property placed in service after the enactment date of this Act, in taxable years ending after that date."
