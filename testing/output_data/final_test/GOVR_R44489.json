    "content": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a proposed free trade agreement among the United States and 11 Asia-Pacific countries, aiming to eliminate trade barriers and integrate the U.S. into the dynamic Asia-Pacific region. It would be the largest plurilateral FTA by trade value, covering 40% of world GDP, with the potential to negotiate new rules and expand membership. The TPP negotiations were concluded in late 2015, with trade ministers signing the final agreement text in February 2016. Congress must approve implementing legislation for the agreement to enter into force, potentially impacting various sectors of the U.S. economy and shaping future trade policy. The TPP, a trade agreement signed in 2016, aims to strengthen regional alliances and extend U.S. influence in the Asia-Pacific region. It originated from the P-4 agreement in 2006 and has provisions that may be of interest to Congress. President Bush and Obama were involved in the negotiations, with Congress needing to approve implementing legislation for the agreement to take effect. The TPP negotiations began in 2009 under President Obama, with Malaysia joining in 2010. The agreement framework was announced in 2011, and Canada, Mexico, and Japan joined in subsequent years. Other countries like South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines showed interest but the agreement was concluded before new members were considered. The TPP agreement was concluded before considering new members. It must be ratified by all parties within two years of signing in 2016. At least six countries representing 85% of the bloc's 2013 GDP need to accede for it to take effect, including the United States and Japan. The Bipartisan Comprehensive Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 sets procedures for congressional consideration of the proposed TPP under TPA-2015. The TPP agreement, signed in 2016, can be considered under expedited procedures of TPA-2015. The final text was released on February 4, 2016, with implementing legislation introduced on March 14, 2016. The President notified Congress of required changes on April 1, 2016. The TPP agreement, signed in 2016, falls under expedited procedures of TPA-2015. A report by the USITC on the economic effects was released on May 18, 2016. Proponents argue the TPP's strategic importance could positively impact geo-economic and geo-political spheres, allowing the US to exert influence beyond just economic realms. The TPP agreement, signed in 2016 under expedited procedures of TPA-2015, is strategically important beyond just economic realms, as emphasized by administration officials. USTR Ambassador Froman highlighted TPP's significance both economically and strategically, binding together a group representing 40% of global GDP. Secretary of State John Kerry also emphasized TPP's broader impact, stating that the Asia-Pacific region will play a crucial role in shaping international rules in various areas. The TPP agreement, signed in 2016, is strategically important beyond economic realms. Proponents argue that it can further goals such as liberalizing trade, driving economic growth, and enhancing national security. It aims to establish regional trade rules consistent with U.S. interests and strengthen alliances in the Asia-Pacific region. Some see it as an alternative to FTAs constructed by other countries in the region. The TPP agreement, signed in 2016, may offer an alternative to FTAs in the Asia-Pacific region. It includes provisions on agriculture, services, investment, and intellectual property rights, as well as protections for worker rights and the environment. Policymakers believe the TPP could give the U.S. leverage to shape regional and multilateral economic norms. The TPP agreement, signed in 2016, is seen as a litmus test for U.S. credibility in the Asia-Pacific region. Proponents argue that the TPP signals U.S. integration into Asia's economic and diplomatic structures, while critics believe the strength of bilateral relationships depends more on countries' assessment of their interests. The TPP agreement, signed in 2016, is viewed as a test of U.S. credibility in the Asia-Pacific region. Proponents argue that the TPP signifies U.S. integration into Asia's economic and diplomatic structures. The strength of bilateral relationships is more dependent on countries' assessment of their political and security interests rather than having a trade agreement with the United States. China's emergence as a regional economic power is a significant backdrop to the TPP's consideration. Supporters, including President Obama, see the TPP as a way to maintain U.S. leadership in Asia against China's rise by setting rules for regional trade and investment. However, some argue that framing the TPP as a counter to Chinese initiatives could be counterproductive and create negative perceptions of U.S. intentions in China and the region. The U.S. and Chinese goals for trade liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region can be mutually reinforcing. Trade agreements involve economic and political elements, creating a tension in balancing policy priorities. Critics argue that the focus on the TPP's strategic elements distracts from its potential impact on the U.S. economy. Proponents highlight the broader strategic implications, which are difficult to quantify but significant. Preferential multi-country trade agreements like the TPP aim to lower tariffs and reduce barriers to enhance productivity, increase consumer choice, lower costs, stimulate economic growth, and improve economic welfare. The Japanese government seeks to revitalize less productive sectors and lower costs for consumers through increased international competition. However, the gains of trade may not be evenly distributed, leading to efficiency and job gains in some sectors while reducing production in others. Removing formal barriers to trade, such as tariffs and quotas, can lead to efficiency and job gains in some sectors but may also cause worker dislocation and job losses. Lower prices resulting from trade agreements like the TPP can impact trade patterns by increasing overall trade and shifting trade to countries within the agreement. Countries may participate in trade agreements to prevent trade diversion effects. The impact of the TPP on trade creation and diversion effects is influenced by various factors such as tariff rate differences, speed of tariff cuts implementation, and external economic conditions. Global economic slowdowns and changes in commodity prices and exchange rates have had a significant impact on global trade volumes. The effectiveness of tariff cuts under the TPP may be limited due to existing trade agreements among participants and low tariff rates. The TPP aims to reduce market-distorting activities and create open, nondiscriminatory treatment for participants. Analysts suggest that countries like Vietnam could benefit from market-oriented reforms within their economies. This could lead to long-term economic benefits for TPP participants. The TPP aims to provide economic benefits to countries and participants through various rules such as IPR protections and labor/environmental commitments. It would be the largest U.S. FTA in terms of parties and trade flows, with Japan's participation increasing its economic significance. Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam are key countries in the TPP without existing U.S. FTAs. Japan is the largest economy and trading partner without an FTA, while Malaysia and Vietnam have potential for growth due to their young populations and high tariffs. The U.S. aims to remove nontariff barriers in these countries. The TPP aims to enhance trade relations between the U.S. and other countries, with a focus on reducing barriers and increasing economic cooperation. Trade with TPP countries was significant, totaling over $1.5 trillion in merchandise and $276 billion in services. The TPP would be the largest U.S. FTA by trade flows, with diverse member countries and major exports including motor vehicles, petroleum products, electronics, and agriculture. The top U.S. merchandise imports vary greatly by country, including agriculture and natural resources products from Australia, Chile, New Zealand, and Peru, apparel products from Vietnam, crude oil and manufactured products from Canada and Mexico, manufactured products from Malaysia and Singapore, and motor vehicles and parts from Japan. Canada and Mexico are the largest U.S. trading partners among TPP countries in goods. Japan, Singapore, and Australia are key U.S. trading partners within the TPP. The agreement could impact the WTO's multilateral trading system. Despite commitments made in the Trade Facilitation Agreement in 2013, the Doha Development Agenda negotiations launched in 2001 have not concluded a major multilateral trade round. Persistent differences among WTO members on trade liberalization hinder progress, with services trade negotiations happening outside the body. The United States advocates for ending the Doha Round, but at the recent WTO Ministerial, no agreement was reached. Developing countries fear agricultural issues may be neglected if the Doha agenda is abandoned. The last major global trade negotiations were the Uruguay Round in 1994. The Uruguay Round in 1994 led to the need for updated trade rules to address new challenges like digital trade and e-commerce. Countries like the United States are pursuing new trade agreements like the TPP to fill these gaps. There is ongoing debate on whether bilateral and \"mega-regional\" agreements help or hinder broader multilateral trade initiatives. These agreements could provide alternative venues for establishing new rules and disciplines for the trading regime. The size and economic significance of new trade rules could influence multilateral negotiations. The conclusion of NAFTA in 1994 pushed Uruguay Round negotiations. Shifting trade negotiations to \"mega-regional\" agreements may limit the effectiveness of the multilateral system. If WTO rules no longer reflect global trade standards, it could jeopardize the organization's legitimacy. A two-tier trading system could alienate countries not involved. The TPP countries are part of a network of Asia-Pacific FTAs, with varying degrees of trade liberalization. The United States has FTAs with six TPP countries. Mega-regional agreements could complicate international commerce and divert trade into trading blocs, potentially reducing global economic efficiency. TPP countries like Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam are part of ASEAN, with existing FTAs and new agreements with key markets. As tariffs decrease under these agreements, U.S. firms without FTAs may face disadvantages. The concept of \"competitive liberalization\" drives countries to seek similar pacts to stay competitive. If the TPP is enacted, it could attract more countries to join. The TPP partners are also members of APEC, which aims for open trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region. APEC Leaders have agreed to create a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP). Twelve APEC countries, seven in TPP, are negotiating the RCEP. The RCEP and TPP would cover a significant portion of regional economic activity, with the US involved in TPP. The TPP and RCEP are two potential agreements involving the region's economic leaders, the United States and China. The TPP could proceed without the US, potentially forming a replacement agreement with Japan and other countries. The TPP agreement consists of 30 chapters and aims for further Asian integration. The TPP agreement consists of 30 chapters with the main goal of establishing a comprehensive regional agreement for trade liberalization and addressing 21st-century challenges. It includes provisions for market access and rules covering trade procedures, standards, and regulatory considerations. Tariff negotiations are a key component of trade agreements. U.S. firms excel in international trade of services and products with high research and development levels, facing nontariff barriers. U.S. FTAs prioritize transparent regulatory procedures and worker/environment protection. The TPP includes a new chapter on regulating state-owned enterprises in international trade. The TPP aims to regulate trade among 12 countries with varying competitive advantages and levels of economic development. Negotiations involve exceptions and phase-in periods. Specific commitments in the agreement must consider these exceptions, which may impact its practical application. The major issues addressed in the TPP negotiations include trade in merchandise goods, with background information, provisions in the text, and a summary of the debate provided. Most stakeholders have varying views on the TPP agreement, with business groups generally supporting it while labor unions and certain NGOs are opposed. The focus is on specific commitments in the agreement and the debate surrounding them. Despite the importance of services in international trade, merchandise trade still dominates, accounting for over 75% of U.S. trade in 2015. The top priority in U.S. trade negotiations is to expand opportunities for trade in goods by reducing tariff and nontariff barriers, as highlighted in the TPA-2015. The TPP agreement aims to eliminate industrial goods tariffs and most agriculture tariffs and quotas over varying periods. Each TPP country has its own unique tariff schedule outlining product-specific tariff commitments, including current tariff rates, staging categories, and post-TPP annual tariff rates. Tariff and quota protections would remain for sensitive agriculture products. The United States has 36 unique staging categories for tariff commitments in the TPP agreement, with the longest phase-out period among TPP countries. This includes delaying the removal of tariffs on certain products from Japan and New Zealand for up to 30 years. The U.S. negotiated bilaterally for import-sensitive products, resulting in different tariff and quota commitments with different partners. The United States has 36 unique staging categories for tariff commitments in the TPP agreement, with the longest phase-out period among TPP countries. U.S. tariffs on some products may be eliminated according to different staging categories for different countries, in contrast to the most-favored nation approach in the WTO. Key factors impacting the potential significance of TPP tariff commitments include current tariff levels among TPP countries. The TPP agreement would result in minimal changes to the already low U.S. average tariff rate of 3.5%. Existing trade agreements among TPP countries may reduce the need for significant adjustments to tariff commitments. Exporters can choose between different agreements for tariff rates as long as they meet the rules of origin. Tariffs are generally below 10% on average in all TPP countries. The TPP agreement would have minimal impact on the low U.S. average tariff rate of 3.5%. Tariffs in TPP countries are generally below 10% on average, but can be much higher on certain sensitive items. U.S. imports from Vietnam are concentrated in high-tariff footwear and apparel products, while U.S. exports facing high tariffs in TPP markets include autos, agricultural products, and heavy machinery. Effective duty rates in 2015 were highest on imports from Vietnam. The TPP agreement focuses on tariff commitments between the United States and five TPP countries without existing U.S. FTAs. More than one-third of tariff lines are already duty-free in each country, with most tariff elimination happening in the first few years after the agreement's entry into force. Eventually, 95% or more tariff lines in each country would be duty-free. The TPP agreement aims to reduce tariffs between the United States and five TPP countries. Most tariff lines will be duty-free, with the U.S. phasing in commitments over a longer period. Japan and Vietnam will maintain some tariff protection on certain products. The TPP agreement aims to reduce tariffs between the United States and five TPP countries, with most tariff lines becoming duty-free. However, some products from each country will still have tariffs, with the highest number of tariffs remaining on imports from New Zealand, particularly on dairy products. Rules of origin determine eligibility for benefits within the FTA area and prevent transshipments. In the TPP agreement, rules of origin are detailed and must be approved by Congress. Different types of rules, such as \"substantially transformed\" and \"yarn forward,\" determine product eligibility within the FTA region. FTAs like TPP have specific rules of origin (ROO) that require a minimum percentage of the product to be produced in the FTA region. TPP's ROO include regional value content rules, limits on foreign content, and requirements for manufacturing or processing operations in the region. TPP allows cumulation among member countries, promoting regional supply chains and potentially attracting new members to avoid exclusion from these chains. The TPP rules of origin (ROO) are similar to other U.S. FTAs but have important distinctions for import-sensitive industries like textiles, apparel, and automotive. U.S. apparel companies rely on global supply chains, supporting gradual tariff reductions if products are assembled using yarn from a TPP country. The TPP agreement includes the \"yarn-forward\" rule of origin for products assembled using yarn from a TPP country. U.S. apparel companies and retailers support immediate elimination of textile and apparel tariffs, opposing the restrictive rule. The U.S. footwear industry also supports tariff elimination, except for sensitive items still manufactured domestically. Vietnam is a focus of TPP negotiations for textile, apparel, and footwear commitments, accounting for a significant portion of imports to the U.S. Vietnam accounted for a significant portion of apparel and footwear imports to the United States in 2015, being the second-largest supplier after China. Despite not having an existing FTA with the U.S., Vietnam's apparel sector heavily relies on yarns and fabrics from non-TPP members like China, Taiwan, and South Korea. Concerns have been raised about Vietnamese-made apparel potentially displacing garments made with U.S. fabric in countries like Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Associations representing the U.S. textile industry support the TPP, but domestic industry worries about the impact on U.S. garment makers in Western Hemisphere countries. The TPP countries currently face high U.S. tariff rates on textiles, apparel, and footwear, with concerns over Vietnam potentially shifting sourcing of textile inputs from the United States. Proponents argue that encouraging movement up the value chain in developing countries like Vietnam is a goal of U.S. FTAs. The USITC estimated that under the TPP scenario in 2032, the apparel industry would see a 1.4% increase in imports ($1.9 billion) with Vietnam driving much of the growth, while textile imports and exports would also increase by 1.6% ($869 million) and 1.3% ($257 million) respectively. Output and employment in the apparel industry would slightly rise above baseline, while textiles would see a slight decrease. Footwear imports to the U.S. would rise by 2.7% ($1.1 billion). The USITC estimated a 2.7% increase in total U.S. footwear imports, with a shift towards TPP countries. The agreement is not expected to significantly impact the U.S. industry, but there may be an increase in exports to Vietnam. Tariffs on textile, apparel, and footwear will be eliminated or phased out over a decade following TPP implementation. The TPP agreement will eliminate tariffs on men's and boys' overcoats, women's blouses and skirts, men's leather boots, and women's pumps over a period of 10 to 12 years. A textile and apparel safeguard will allow the U.S. to reimpose tariffs if import surges harm domestic industry. Rules of Origin must be met for favorable tariff treatment. The TPP agreement eliminates tariffs on various clothing items over 10 to 12 years. Textiles and apparel must meet Rules of Origin for favorable tariff treatment, including a yarn-forward rule and methods for determining TPP-originated products. Vietnamese footwear producers may benefit from these rules in the U.S. market. The TPP agreement includes exceptions for textiles and apparel deemed in \"short supply\" within the region, allowing privileged access for goods made using non-TPP inputs from the short supply list. The Earned Import Allowance Program encourages the use of American fabrics in Vietnamese-manufactured clothing, exempting some U.S. apparel imports from Vietnam from the TPP yarn-forward rule. The TPP agreement exempts some U.S. apparel imports from Vietnam from the yarn-forward rule if Vietnam imports a specific quantity of U.S. fabrics. This allows apparel cut, sewn, and assembled in Vietnam to enter the U.S. duty-free, even if the garments include fabric from non-TPP countries. The TPP includes customs procedures for enforcing commitments, such as visiting textile and apparel factories for verification. A Committee on Textile and Apparel Matters will address industry concerns and resolve trade issues. The Industry Trade Advisory Committee (ITAC) on Textiles and Clothing (ITAC 13) under the TPP summarizes divergent industry views on trade in textiles and clothing products. Members differ on market opening, U.S. market access, consumer perspectives, and industry adjustments to competition. Some industry groups like NCTO, AAFA, and Footwear Distributors support the TPP, while others like Patagonia do not. The Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America have endorsed the TPP, while Patagonia and New Balance have expressed opposition. Motor vehicle market access was a central issue in TPP negotiations, involving the US, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The North American auto industry is highly integrated, with Japan being the largest source of US vehicle imports outside of NAFTA. U.S. vehicle exports have been increasing since the 2007-2009 recession. In 2014, U.S. vehicle exports to TPP countries exceeded two million units for the first time, with Canada being the largest market. Most exports to TPP countries already have duty-free access, except for Japan. The TPP did not specify objectives for trade in motor vehicles. The TPP did not specify objectives for trade in motor vehicles, but sought to reduce tariffs and NTBs. TPP auto manufacturing countries aimed to eliminate or reduce U.S. vehicle tariffs, with a focus on developing rules of origin for smooth parts supply chains. Reference points were taken from NAFTA and the U.S.-South Korea FTA. The USITC study estimated impacts on the passenger vehicle industry over 30 years, highlighting significant transition periods. The TPP aims to reduce tariffs and NTBs in the auto industry. Canada, Malaysia, and Vietnam would eliminate import duties on autos, potentially increasing competition. The US would eliminate import tariffs on Japanese autos, impacting U.S. producers. The study predicts a 2% increase in vehicle exports and a 1.5% increase in parts exports. Output and employment are expected to slightly increase for autos and decline for parts. If the TPP agreement is enforced, member countries will eliminate import tariffs on most vehicles and parts. U.S. tariff commitments are on a bilateral basis, with longer phaseouts for vehicle shipments from Japan. The 2.5% tariff on passenger cars from Japan will remain until year 15 and be gradually eliminated by year 25. The 25% U.S. light truck tariff with Japan will be eliminated in year 30 of the TPP. The rationale for longer phaseouts on Japanese vehicles is to allow Japan to remove its own NTBs and transition to a more open automotive market. The reduction in foreign barriers to U.S. vehicles is expected to be most significant in Malaysia and Vietnam. The reduction in foreign barriers to U.S. vehicles is likely to be most significant in Malaysia and Vietnam, where high tariff levels make imported vehicles costly. Malaysia's tariffs can be as high as 40% and Vietnam's as much as 70%. Non-tariff barriers in the vehicle industry include tax breaks for local vehicles, local content requirements, safety, and environmental regulations that differ among countries. Japan, despite not having tariffs on vehicles, uses NTBs to restrict foreign-made vehicle sales. Bilateral U.S.-Japan side letters to the TPP agreement establish a special dispute resolution process and commit Japan to adopt a more open automotive rulemaking process. The motor vehicle rules of origin, focused on U.S.-Japan vehicle trade, are also relevant to Canada and Mexico. NAFTA rules served as a model for the TPP, requiring 62.5% regional content for reduced tariffs. The TPP allows two methods for calculating regional content in vehicles: the net cost method (requiring 45% TPP content) and the build-down method (requiring 55% TPP content). Japan has argued for the build-down method, which does not subtract shipping and marketing costs, resulting in higher regional content. This is lower than NAFTA's 62.5% requirement but higher than KORUS's 35% level. The TPP allows two methods for calculating regional content in vehicles: the net cost method (requiring 45% TPP content) and the build-down method (requiring 55% TPP content). This is lower than NAFTA's 62.5% requirement but higher than KORUS's 35% level. Vehicle and parts manufacturers in North America can choose between NAFTA and TPP rules of origin, which may impact trade in auto parts due to different regional value content standards. Under TPP rules, some auto parts with value added outside the TPP region may enter the US duty-free. The auto industry acknowledges concerns about regional value content in automotive parts within the TPP. There is no unified position among motor vehicle industry members, with some supporting the agreement, others expressing concerns, and one company opposing it. The United Autoworkers union (UAW) is against the TPP due to worries about currency manipulation. Some automakers recommend including enforceable measures to prohibit currency manipulation, but the TPP only establishes a forum to address this issue. The impact of U.S.-Japan Side Letters and Appendix on the United States is analyzed by ITAC 2, stating that Japan's vehicle NTB commitments are seen as marginal improvements but may not significantly increase U.S. presence in the Japanese motor vehicle market. The long phase-out period of U.S. tariffs on imported Japanese cars and trucks, lasting up to 30 years, is viewed as emphasizing protection over liberalization. Malaysia and Vietnam have a slow liberalization schedule under the TPP, with Vietnam's restrictions remaining even after tariff reductions in year 13. In year 13 of TPP implementation, Vietnam's restrictions will remain despite tariff reductions. Auto parts from TPP countries can enter the US duty-free if they meet origin rules. TPP allows non-TPP content in vehicles and parts. ITAC 2 calls for monitoring and enforcing rules to prevent non-TPP countries from benefiting. Lack of regulatory harmonization may require US producers to modify vehicles before selling them. The lack of recognition of U.S. standards in TPP member countries may require U.S. producers to modify vehicles before selling them, which could be costly. This represents a missed opportunity according to ITAC 2. The United States prioritizes increased market access for services providers in bilateral and regional FTAs, with services trade accounting for a significant portion of total U.S. trade. The United States prioritizes increased market access for services providers in bilateral and regional FTAs, with services trade accounting for a significant portion of total U.S. trade. Services accounted for 78% of U.S. private sector GDP and 82% of private sector employees in 2013. The U.S. consistently runs a surplus in services trade, with exports surpassing imports by $233 billion in 2014. The TPP may offer the greatest benefit for the U.S. in terms of expanded commitments in international services trade, particularly with partner countries like Brunei, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Vietnam. The U.S. sought to address new services trade barriers not covered in previous agreements. The TPP aims to address new services trade barriers not covered in previous agreements, including restrictions on data flows and electronic payment systems. Nontariff barriers in services trade can vary in form and are challenging to quantify. The OECD has developed indices to measure services trade restrictiveness across countries. The OECD indices show significant variation in services trade restrictiveness among TPP OECD countries, indicating potential for liberalization through TPP negotiations. For example, in telecommunications, the index ranges from 0.12 for the United States to 0.34 for Mexico. Similar findings by the World Bank suggest even greater restrictions among non-OECD TPP countries. The USITC predicts positive results for U.S. services industries from the TPP, with estimated increases in output and employment. Both exports and imports are expected to rise above baseline levels. The USITC predicts that U.S. services exports and imports will increase above baseline levels due to the TPP. Factors contributing to this include higher U.S. incomes leading to more spending on tourism abroad, a shift in productive resources to sectors with greater market liberalization, and increased demand for services imports. Services exports are expected to increase mainly to TPP countries without existing FTAs, while services imports will come from non-TPP countries, particularly the EU. The TPP utilizes a \"negative list approach\" for provisions governing services between buyers and sellers in different territories, which is more comprehensive than the \"positive list approach\" used in the GATS. Key provisions include nondiscriminatory treatment of services, no limitations on service suppliers, and no restrictions on the value or volume of services provided. The TPP includes provisions for services such as nondiscriminatory treatment, no limitations on service suppliers, and no restrictions on the value or volume of services provided. It also addresses issues like market access for express delivery services and mutual recognition of professional qualifications for service providers. Japan Post, a government-owned postal system, provides express delivery services and is moving towards privatization. The TPP aims to eliminate unique advantages of the Japanese postal service, including cross-subsidizing express delivery with revenue from its monopoly power. TPP also requires independence between express delivery regulators and providers. Vietnam would be exempt from certain rules for 3 years. The TPP aims to eliminate advantages of the Japanese postal service, including cross-subsidizing express delivery. It requires independence between express delivery regulators and providers. Unlike KORUS, TPP lacks a specific threshold for customs de minimis, a critical commitment for express delivery providers. Financial services are addressed in a separate chapter as in previous FTAs. The financial services chapter in TPP incorporates provisions from the foreign investment and cross-border trade in services chapters. It allows measures to maintain financial system integrity and stability. TPP distinguishes between cross-border financial services and those provided by a foreign entity in the buyer's country. Critics point out numerous Non-Conforming Measures (NCMs), such as the exclusion of Government-Sponsored Enterprises like Fannie Mae by the United States. The financial services chapter in TPP includes provisions from foreign investment and cross-border trade in services chapters. Malaysia's NCMs have raised concerns about government approval for certain investments. Financial services are not covered under the e-commerce chapter, but there is a provision prohibiting restrictions on cross-border data flows. U.S. financial services firms and Congress members are worried about the treatment of financial services in the agreement. Financial services firms and some Members of Congress are concerned about the distinct treatment of the sector in TPP due to reliance on cross-border data flows for data security and cost savings. Localization requirements imposed by countries could increase costs and act as a barrier to trade, although supporters argue they enhance local control and data security. USTR negotiated for flexibility for financial regulators to impose localization requirements in TPP, despite not currently being in place in TPP countries. While localization requirements are not currently in place in TPP countries, Malaysia and Vietnam are considering imposing such regulations. Concerns are also raised about other countries like South Korea and Indonesia, which have or are considering localization requirements. Treasury Secretary Lew proposed a solution for future trade agreements to address this issue. TPP addresses insurance sold by government postal entities, with U.S. providers arguing for fair competition against government-owned insurance providers. The TPP agreement aims to prevent postal insurance entities from having advantages over private suppliers, including regulations, licensing requirements, and access to distribution channels. The agreement also includes commitments on electronic payment card services for the first time in a U.S. FTA, allowing for cross-border supply of electronic payment services with certain preconditions. The TPP agreement includes commitments on temporary entry for business persons to facilitate trade, with the United States not seeking additional visas but agreeing to measures on regulatory transparency. Dispute settlement for this chapter is limited, and other TPP parties have made additional access commitments on the temporary entry of business persons. The TPP agreement includes commitments on temporary entry for business persons to facilitate trade, with the United States not seeking additional visas but agreeing to measures on regulatory transparency. Other TPP parties have made additional access commitments on temporary entry of business persons, including defining categories for \"business visitors\" with specific conditions and limitations. The telecommunications chapter covers mobile service providers, promoting competition and consumer choice while ensuring regulator independence. The TPP telecommunications chapter promotes competition and consumer choice in the U.S. mobile market, with provisions for regulatory transparency, interconnection between providers, access to networks and infrastructure, protection of technology options, cooperation on international roaming charges, and regulation of mobile roaming service rates. The chapter also ensures suppliers can resell and unbundle services, with positive reactions from the services industries. The International Trade Advisory Committee for services and finance industries (ITAC 10) supports the TPP agreement, stating it promotes the economic interests of the United States. Business groups highlight the benefits of TPP for countries without existing U.S. FTAs, especially in terms of market access and provisions related to data flows and digital trade. The agreement also includes provisions on electronic payment card services, electronic signatures, mobile telecommunications carriers, and international roaming rates, which are seen as advancements for U.S. service firms and the larger business community. Some concerns have been raised by business groups regarding the TPP agreement, particularly in the services sector. Opposition stems from the exclusion of financial services firms from the e-commerce chapter and provisions prohibiting localization requirements for computing facilities. The U.S. Treasury Department supports this exception for regulatory flexibility, while critics see it as unnecessary. Members of Congress have urged the Administration to address these issues in TPP negotiations. Other concerns include nonconforming measures limiting liberalization and various industry-specific challenges. The Communications Workers of America (CWA) opposes TPP due to concerns about negative impacts on service workers, including in call centers and data processing jobs. Other groups also oppose TPP, particularly in financial services, arguing that the commitments will restrict the U.S. government's ability to regulate the industry. Exports are crucial for U.S. agriculture, absorbing about 20% of production. Exports are vital for U.S. agriculture, absorbing about 20% of total production, with certain commodities like wheat, rice, soybeans, cotton, almonds, pecans, pistachios, and walnuts having a larger share. Foreign demand for U.S. food and fiber contributes to higher commodity prices and farm income, benefiting farmers, ranchers, rural communities, and industries providing seed, fertilizer, and machinery. Rising farm productivity and market-oriented farm policies also play a role in boosting exports. The TPP agreement aims to liberalize agricultural trade among member countries, benefiting U.S. agriculture and food industry interests by improving market access and competitiveness. It also provides TPP partners with greater access to U.S. markets, increasing competition. USITC estimates the economic impact on U.S. agriculture, highlighting key considerations for the industry. The TPP agreement aims to liberalize agricultural trade among member countries, benefiting U.S. agriculture by improving market access and competitiveness. The economic impact on U.S. agriculture includes key considerations such as the potential for boosting exports to significant TPP markets like Japan, Vietnam, and Malaysia. These countries impose higher tariffs than the U.S., which could benefit U.S. farm and food exports as tariffs decline under the agreement. The TPP agreement aims to liberalize agricultural trade among member countries, benefiting U.S. agriculture by improving market access and competitiveness. Tariffs on agriculture products are higher in Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam compared to the U.S., presenting export opportunities. Japan and Vietnam are key markets due to their protected farm and food markets, large populations, and growing economies. Vietnam is seen as holding significant future growth potential for U.S. farm and food products. The TPP agreement offers export opportunities for U.S. food and agriculture interests, with potential expansion in beef and pork to Japan and dairy products to Japan, Canada, and Vietnam over time. Safeguard measures in place for certain products and countries may impose additional tariffs if import thresholds are exceeded. Preferential access under NAFTA to markets in Canada and Mexico will gradually become available to more competitors as tariffs are lowered for TPP countries. The TPP agreement offers export opportunities for U.S. food and agriculture interests, with potential expansion in beef and pork to Japan and dairy products to Japan, Canada, and Vietnam over time. Competitors could gain a competitive edge over U.S. exports if the U.S. does not implement the TPP agreement, as other countries have preferential tariff arrangements or are negotiating FTAs that could enhance their producers' competitive position. The USITC concluded that TPP would provide significant benefits to U.S. agriculture, estimating that agricultural exports would be $7.2 billion higher in 2032 compared to a baseline scenario without TPP. The USITC concluded that the TPP agreement would lead to significant benefits for U.S. agriculture. Agricultural exports would increase by $7.2 billion (2.6%), while imports would rise by $2.7 billion (1.5%). Overall agricultural output would expand by $10 billion (0.5%), with employment in agriculture also increasing by 0.5%. Specific export gains include dairy products at $1.85 billion (18%), processed foods and beef at $1.54 billion (3.8%) and $876 million (8.4%) respectively. Fresh fruit, vegetables, and nuts would see a $575 million (2%) increase, while pork and poultry meat products would increase by $219 million (1.9%) and $174 million (1.3%) respectively. Corn and rice exports are estimated to decrease marginally by 0.1% and 0.3% respectively. On the import side, processed food would increase by $427 million (1.1%), beef imports by $419 million (5.7%), and dairy products by $349 million (10.3%). The TPP agreement aims to increase market access for U.S. agricultural exports, with significant gains in Japan and Vietnam. The agreement focuses on reducing foreign tariffs on U.S. commodities to create competitive opportunities. Key changes include improvements in market access for beef products, with Japan being the largest export market for the U.S. Under the TPP agreement, Japan would reduce tariffs on beef and beef products, dropping from 38.5% to 27.5% in year one and eventually to 9% by year 16. Vietnam would eliminate tariffs on beef products over three to eight years. Japan would also lower tariffs on pork, cutting the tariff on pork cuts to 2.2% and phasing out the residual over nine years. The United States would eliminate tariffs on beef and beef products in no more than 15 years. Under the TPP agreement, Japan would reduce tariffs on pork cuts immediately to 125 yen per kilogram, with a gradual decrease to 50 yen in year 10. A U.S.-specific safeguard would allow Japan to increase the duty temporarily if imports exceed a trigger level. Vietnam would eliminate tariffs on pork and pork products within 10 years, while the United States would immediately eliminate most tariffs on these products. Canada would allow incremental increases in access to its poultry and egg markets over five years via new duty-free TRQs. Under the TPP agreement, quotas for poultry and dairy products would be gradually increased over the years. Vietnamese tariffs on poultry would be eliminated within 13 years, while U.S. tariffs would be eliminated within 10 years. Canada would allow incremental additional access to its dairy markets, amounting to 3.25% of its output for 2016 under TRQs that would be phased in over five years. Under the TPP agreement, quotas for dairy products would be gradually increased over the years. Canada would increase TRQs for dairy products, such as fluid milk, butter, cheese, and yogurt, between 14 and 19 years and then remain fixed. In-quota dairy products would enter Canada duty free, and Canada would eliminate its over-quota tariff on whey powder over 10 years. Japan and the United States would also make changes to their dairy tariffs and establish TRQs for dairy products from Australia and New Zealand. The TPP agreement includes new duty-free quotas for U.S. rice in Japan, with initial quota of 50,000 tons rising to 70,000 tons in year 13. U.S. tariffs on rice products up to 11.2% would be eliminated within 15 years. U.S. tariffs on cotton would be eliminated by 2022. Access to the U.S. sugar market would be expanded with new TRQs totaling 86,300 tons annually. The TPP agreement includes new duty-free quotas for U.S. sugar and sugar-containing products totaling 86,300 tons annually. Australia and Canada would receive new duty-free quotas, with the residual split between Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Japan would provide new TRQs to expand access to its market for sugar and sweetener-related products. U.S. tariffs on tobacco of up to 350% would be eliminated within 10 years. The TPP agreement includes the elimination of U.S. tariffs on tobacco over 10 years. Japan and Malaysia will also eliminate tariffs on tobacco products over 11 and 16 years, respectively. Vietnam will gradually increase imports of unmanufactured tobacco over 20 years and eliminate tariffs on tobacco leaf after 20 years. There is controversy over excluding tobacco product manufacturers from investor-state dispute settlement protections for tobacco control measures. The TPP agreement includes the elimination of tariffs on tobacco products over a period of time. Geographic Indications (GIs) protect the quality and reputation of products from specific regions, such as Parmesan cheese and Champagne. GIs can be commercially valuable and provide relief from infringement or unfair competition. Champagne, Florida oranges, Idaho potatoes, Washington State apples, and Napa Valley wines are examples of Geographic Indications (GIs) that protect the quality and reputation of products from specific regions. GIs have sparked controversy in international trade as some consider them protected intellectual property while others view them as generic names. For instance, \"feta\" is a protected GI in the EU but considered generic in the United States. The TPP agreement mandates recognition of GIs and provides a process for canceling GI protection. The TPP agreement mandates recognition of Geographic Indications (GIs) and provides a procedure for objecting to a GI based on various reasons, including potential confusion with trademarks or existing grape varieties. Factors like common usage in dictionaries and trade also play a role in determining if a term is the customary name for a good. The TPP agreement mandates recognition of Geographic Indications (GIs) and provides a procedure for objecting to a GI based on various reasons. The agreement also addresses nontariff barriers to trade, specifically focusing on SPS measures related to food safety, plant pests, and animal diseases. The TPP agreement addresses SPS commitments, including the establishment of an SPS committee, basing measures on international standards or scientific evidence, allowing public comment, and providing rapid notification of importation issues. Disputes are to be resolved through technical consultations first, with the option of turning to dispute settlement procedures if needed. The agreement also introduces a rapid notification requirement for importing countries. The TPP agreement introduces a rapid response mechanism for SPS concerns, requiring importing countries to notify within 7 days of restrictions. It also promotes transparency on biotech products and encourages information sharing to minimize disruptions in trade. The TPP agreement establishes a working group on agricultural biotechnology and commits to eliminating export subsidies. Parties are not obligated to change their laws on biotechnology. The agreement sets a standard for future reform on export subsidies. The TPP agreement aims to develop multilateral disciplines around agricultural programs and discourages restrictions on food exports. It limits restrictions to six months and requires consultation for restrictions over 12 months. Various interest groups in the food and agricultural sector have passed judgment on the agreement, with support from agricultural groups, meat and commodity associations, and the Grocery Manufacturers Association. U.S. dairy groups have also recently endorsed the agreement. Several U.S. dairy groups, including the National Association of Milk Producers, have endorsed the TPP agreement. The Agricultural Policy Advisory Committee for Trade on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (APAC) also expressed strong support for the deal, reflecting the views of a majority of its members. However, not all sectors within the food and agriculture industry support the agreement, with the National Farmers Union (NFU) opposing it due to concerns about increased competition from imports. The National Farmers Union (NFU), United Food and Commercial Workers Union International (UFCW), and tobacco leaf growers oppose the TPP agreement due to concerns about job losses, lack of enforcement against currency manipulation, and negative effects on U.S. tobacco farmers. Certain NGOs also oppose the agreement. Certain NGOs oppose the TPP agreement, citing concerns with provisions related to agriculture, particularly regarding seafood imports from Malaysia and Vietnam. They also criticize potential food labeling restrictions resulting from TPP commitments. The Government Procurement chapter establishes standards for government purchases among TPP countries, focusing on transparency in developing guidelines and regulations. The United States is a member of the plurilateral WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) and has sought the inclusion of government procurement provisions in its FTAs. TPP contains first-ever reciprocal procurement commitments for Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei, providing opportunities for firms to bid on certain contracts over a set monetary threshold on a reciprocal basis. FTAs with government procurement provisions in TPP allow U.S. firms access to overseas markets valued at $1.6 trillion in 2008. Supporters argue for open procurement markets to increase efficiency, while others believe procurement should prioritize domestic industries. The Buy American Act limits foreign companies' ability to bid on certain projects. The United States negotiated federal procurement in the TPP, excluding state or local commitments. States must opt in voluntarily, with only 10 states acceding to commitments in recent FTAs. Countries set schedules for government entities accepting bids from overseas companies in procurement agreements. The TPP outlines government entities accepting bids from overseas companies, eligible procurements, monetary thresholds, and exceptions. It promotes national treatment, transparency in tendering processes, and covers public-private partnerships and BOT projects. Malaysia, Mexico, and Vietnam are excluded from certain provisions. The TPP outlines government entities accepting bids from overseas companies, eligible procurements, monetary thresholds, and exceptions. Most countries will adopt a baseline threshold of SDR130,000, with transitional thresholds for Brunei, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Sub-central procurement and construction projects have higher thresholds. Countries have made incremental changes in covered commitments, with exceptions for sub-national procurement by the United States and four other countries. Vietnam, Malaysia, Mexico, and Vietnam may impose offsets, set-asides, and price preferences for varying periods. For example, Vietnam can set aside 100% of pharmaceutical procurements for the first 3 years, transitioning to 50% by year 16. Malaysia can exempt procurements affecting essential security interests. Intellectual property rights grant inventors and artists monopolies to use, commercialize, and market their creations. The use of trade policy to advance intellectual property rights internationally emerged with NAFTA and the WTO Agreement on TRIPS. U.S. trade negotiating objectives in TPA-2015 call for FTAs to reflect a standard of protection similar to U.S. law and apply existing IPR protection to digital media. TPP countries represent a significant market for U.S. IP-based exports. In 2014, U.S. exporters received approximately $130 billion in IP royalties, license fees, and payments. The TPP countries' improvements in patent protections led to a $2.9 billion increase in U.S. IP receipts in 2010. The USTR designated five TPP parties with IPR regimes of concern in the 2016 \"Special 301\" report. Chile was placed on the \"Priority Watch List\" for significant IPR concerns, while Canada, Mexico, Peru, and Vietnam were placed on the \"Watch List.\" In FTA negotiations, the United States seeks IP commitments exceeding WTO TRIPS Agreement standards. Debate continues on balancing private rights and public benefits. TPP negotiations included controversial aspects like pharmaceutical protections, raising concerns about innovation vs. affordable access to medicines. Patents and data exclusivity are seen as providing incentives for innovation. The debate over patents and data exclusivity in the context of pharmaceutical innovation and affordable access to medicines has intensified, particularly in the TPP negotiations. While some argue that these mechanisms incentivize innovation, others raise concerns about increased drug costs and delayed market entry for generics. The balance between copyright holders' exclusive rights is also a longstanding issue in the intellectual property debate. The debate over copyright holders' exclusive rights and fair use, as well as the balance between ISPs' operations and copyright theft enforcement, are key issues in the TPP negotiations. Stakeholders are comparing the TPP's IP chapter to other FTAs like KORUS and the \"May 10th\" FTAs. Some business groups, especially in the pharmaceutical sector, support the IPR chapter but have concerns about certain aspects of it. Some stakeholders express concerns about certain aspects of the IPR chapter in TPP compared to KORUS, particularly regarding transition periods for implementing IPR commitments. There are debates on maintaining the May 10th approach to patents and its impact on affordable access to medicines in developing countries. TPP includes provisions favorable to both sets of stakeholders, extending patent and data protections. The TPP extends patent and data protections beyond the May 10th Agreement, with new commitments for developing countries. The IP chapter addresses patents primarily, reflecting some elements of the May 10th Agreement but also introducing new provisions. The goal is to establish consistent patent regimes throughout the TPP region, building on TRIPS provisions and previous U.S. FTAs. The TPP extends patent and data protections beyond the May 10th Agreement, with new commitments for developing countries. It aims to establish consistent patent regimes throughout the TPP region, focusing on patents for inventions, products, and processes. The agreement also includes provisions for new uses, methods, and processes of known products, while excluding diagnostic, therapeutic, and surgical methods from patentability. Access to medicines is emphasized to encourage innovation and medicine accessibility. The TPP extends patent and data protections, including patents for inventions derived from plants. It also emphasizes access to medicines and allows for patent term adjustment for unreasonable delays in the examination process, particularly for pharmaceutical products. The TPP extends patent and data protections, including patent term adjustment for unreasonable delays. It provides at least five years of data exclusivity for small molecule pharmaceuticals. The TPP extends patent and data protections, including patent term adjustment for unreasonable delays. It provides at least five years of data exclusivity for small molecule pharmaceuticals. For countries relying on US marketing approval, a concurrent period is granted if the country approves within six months. An additional three years of data exclusivity is provided for new indications, formulations, or methods of administration. The expiration of a patent does not limit data protection. Biologics data exclusivity has been a contentious issue, with the US seeking a 12-year exclusivity period in TPP negotiations. The TPP negotiations included discussions on data exclusivity for biologics, with some countries offering no exclusivity period while others had periods ranging from five to eight years. The TPP ultimately provided for either eight years of data exclusivity or five years with additional measures to ensure effective market protection. Some Members of Congress have raised concerns about the shortened exclusivity period and may seek clarification on its implementation. Australia and New Zealand have stated they may not need to make changes in response to this provision. The TPP includes protections for biologics as an obligation, with patent linkage requiring permission from the patent holder for generic drug approval. The agreement provides flexibility on notification systems and procedures for patent holders. Australia and New Zealand may not need to change their laws to comply with the TPP language. The TPP extends flexibility on notification systems and procedures for patent holders and parties challenging patent validity to all countries. Copyright protections in the TPP are similar to KORUS, including new features like \"fair use\" and enforcement. International agreements in the TPP, like KORUS, require ratification or accession by each party. TPP, similar to KORUS, mandates ratification of international agreements related to copyright protection. The WIPO Internet Treaties, setting norms for digital copyright, are in force for nine TPP countries. TPP extends copyright terms to life plus 70 years, surpassing the TRIPS Agreement baseline. Some TPP countries, like Brunei, New Zealand, and Vietnam, have yet to ratify these agreements. TPP, like KORUS, mandates exclusive rights for copyright holders, including reproduction, communication, and distribution. It also emphasizes achieving a balance between users and rights holders through fair use exceptions. Additionally, TPP requires measures like encryption to prevent unauthorized use, with penalties for violations. TPP, like KORUS, mandates penalties for circumventing TPMs and copyright enforcement in the digital environment, including criminal penalties for camcording in movie theaters. It also allows for new exceptions like cellphone unlocking while protecting legitimate digital trade. TPP includes provisions for criminalizing theft of encrypted signals and recognizing collective management societies for copyrights. It also addresses ISP liability and requires legal frameworks to combat digital copyright infringement. The KORUS and TPP agreements address ISP liability for copyright infringement, including \"notice and takedown\" provisions to remove infringing materials. TPP also includes safeguards against abuse of the system. TPP includes provisions on trademark protection and enforcement, with key features such as the term of protection being no less than 10 years and extending protections to sounds. Unlike KORUS, TPP does not extend trademark protections to scents but requires \"best efforts\" to do so. TPP extends trademark protections to certification and collective marks, including well-known marks for dissimilar goods and services. Stakeholders value the \"best efforts\" language but prefer mandatory protection for scents. The TPP, like KORUS, requires measures to protect well-known trademarks from being used in a way that could cause confusion or damage the trademark owner's interests. It also includes provisions for geographical indications (GIs) to be eligible for trademark protection, primarily for agricultural products. Limited exceptions to trademark rights are allowed under TPP. TPP, similar to KORUS, allows exceptions to trademark rights like \"fair use of descriptive terms\" and enhances efficiency in trademark systems. It prohibits requiring marks to be recorded for legal proceedings, aiming to facilitate trademark protection. TPP also mandates a system for managing country-code top level domains (ccTLDs). The TPP requires parties to provide remedies for domain name registration with bad faith intent, aiming to prevent cybersquatting. It also includes criminal procedures and penalties for trade secret theft, including through cyber means and by State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). Some stakeholders see these commitments as positive, while others have concerns about the provisions. The TPP includes provisions for industrial designs beyond the TRIPS Agreement, with hortatory language on improving design registration systems. The United States negotiates investment rules in trade agreements to reduce restrictions and protect investors. The U.S. negotiates investment rules in trade agreements to protect investors, ensuring foreign investors do not have greater rights than domestic ones. TPP countries accounted for over 20% of U.S. global FDI in 2014, with TPP covering more FDI than any other U.S. FTA. Despite bilateral FTAs with six TPP countries, U.S. investors are concerned about investment barriers in the region, such as sector restrictions and discriminatory treatment. Investment negotiations in TPP were challenging due to the balance between investor protection and national sovereignty. Supporters argue that investor protections in TPP are crucial for removing investment barriers and ensuring fair treatment. They claim that ISDS remedies are limited to monetary penalties and do not infringe on governments' ability to regulate in the public interest. Critics fear that ISDS could restrict governments from regulating for environmental or health reasons, leading to \"regulatory chilling.\" The U.S. has never lost a claim under ISDS in a U.S. investment agreement, but opponents worry that ISDS in TPP could increase litigation risks for the U.S. due to the presence of TPP companies' affiliates in the country. The presence of affiliates of companies from TPP countries in the United States may lead to more litigation, as seen in the ISDS claim brought by a Philip Morris subsidiary against Australia. The debate over ISDS in TPP is further complicated by TransCanada's intent to challenge the Keystone XL pipeline decision. The issue of whether investment rules treat U.S. and foreign investors equally is also a concern. Supporters argue that ISDS and other protections are reciprocal and modeled after U.S. law. Critics argue that ISDS in U.S. investment agreements provides foreign investors with an additional choice of venue, but do not afford them greater substantive rights than domestic investors. The fairness and transparency of ISDS procedures have been questioned, with most cases conducted under ICSID or UNCITRAL rules. The record on ISDS suggests procedures for disqualifying biased arbitrators. Critics express concern about bias in ISDS procedures, noting lawyers' dual roles as arbitrators and investor representatives. Transparency in ISDS proceedings is questioned, with limited third-party participation. Debate surrounds the need for an appellate mechanism to review tribunal decisions for coherence and certainty in investment agreements. Some argue for ISDS reforms to address bias and lack of transparency, including the EU's proposal for an Investment Court System with an appellate mechanism. US officials prefer ISDS to protect investors, while some businesses fear erosion of investor protections. The EU's proposal is being closely monitored in trade negotiations, such as with TPP partners like Vietnam and Canada. The finalized text of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) includes the main elements of the proposal. The investment chapter in TPP reflects core investor protections from the 2012 Model BIT and applies to State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). Unlike other U.S. FTAs, TPP lacks an appellate mechanism. TPP introduces new provisions that surpass KORUS and the model BIT, as well as WTO agreements, addressing investment issues more comprehensively. One notable provision is the Minimum Standard of Treatment (MST), which requires parties to adhere to customary international law when providing MST to investments. TPP clarifies that actions inconsistent with investor expectations do not automatically breach the MST. Some stakeholders criticize this change as weakening investor protections. The TPP introduces new provisions that surpass KORUS and the model BIT, addressing investment issues comprehensively. Stakeholders have concerns about the Minimum Standard of Treatment (MST) obligation being ambiguous and potentially expanding investor protections unduly. Performance requirements are prohibited, including exporting specific levels of goods or transferring technology. The TPP introduces new features compared to KORUS, including prohibitions on performance requirements related to technology. The denial of benefits article allows a party to deny investment benefits to enterprises with minimal business activities in certain territories. The denial of benefits article in TPP allows a party to deny benefits to \"shell companies\" to address concerns like the ISDS claim filed by Philip Morris under the Australia-Hong Kong BIT. TPP also includes provisions on nondiscriminatory regulatory action to protect public welfare objectives. The TPP Investment Chapter includes a provision allowing governments to regulate for health, environmental, and other objectives, as long as it is consistent with the chapter. Critics argue that the provision may not adequately protect a government's right to regulate due to vague provisions in the Investment Chapter. The TPP also includes ISDS proceedings similar to other U.S. FTAs. The TPP includes new provisions on ISDS proceedings, such as requirements for arbitrator expertise, a code of conduct, acceptance of amicus curiae submissions, rules for dismissing frivolous claims, and clarification on burden of proof. Supporters believe these provisions balance investor protections and public interest safeguards. The TPP includes new provisions on ISDS proceedings, balancing investor protections and public interest safeguards. Some argue that these provisions weaken investor protections, while others believe they do not go far enough in protecting the public interest. The TPP also includes a \"carve-out\" for tobacco control measures, allowing parties to deny ISDS to investors' claims challenging such measures. This carve-out is supported by some stakeholders as a way to protect public health interests. Some stakeholders support the carve-out in the TPP to protect public health interests and tobacco control measures. Others question its necessity due to existing rights to regulate for welfare objectives and potential precedents. The tobacco industry opposes the carve-out as discriminatory. TPP allows ISDS for breach of investment agreements, with limits on challenging investments. The TPP imposes limits on ISDS to challenge investment agreement breaches, with additional limitations in Mexico, Peru, and Canada. Mexico exempts ISDS for breaches inconsistent with certain laws. The Financial Services Chapter allows ISDS for disputes concerning financial services investments. The TPP includes a broad prudential exception allowing measures for financial system stability, with a state-to-state arbitration mechanism for disputes. KORUS and TPP have exemptions for certain regulations and state-to-state arbitration mechanisms. TPP also exempts specific countries from ISDS claims related to investment decisions. Multiple interests intersect in investor protections. Investor protections in TPP involve exemptions for certain regulations and state-to-state arbitration mechanisms. Parties apply core investor protections on a \"negative-list basis\" with Nonconforming Measures (NCMs) listed in Annex I. Parties agree to a \"standstill\" and \"ratchet\" for measures deemed necessary to maintain. The TPP agreement includes a \"ratchet\" mechanism for future liberalization, with exceptions for Vietnam in the first three years. New Zealand has raised the monetary threshold for screening investments from TPP countries, with the potential for further increases. Annex II outlines measures where parties retain full discretion. Nonconforming Measures (NCMs) vary by party and may limit the extent of investment liberalization in TPP. The TPP agreement includes provisions on worker rights, with concerns raised by labor unions and NGOs about the impact on wages and working conditions in other countries. NAFTA had labor provisions in a side agreement, evolving over time to include consultation mechanisms. The side agreement in FTAs includes a consultation mechanism and special labor dispute settlement procedure to enforce labor laws. Recent FTAs with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea require adoption and enforcement of core labor principles of the International Labor Organization. These provisions are enforceable under dispute settlement procedures. The TPP includes labor provisions enforceable under dispute settlement procedures, raising concerns about impacts on workers. Some fear it may incentivize moving jobs to countries with poor worker rights. Vietnam would need significant labor reforms to comply with TPP obligations. Concerns also exist for Brunei, Malaysia, and Mexico meeting labor standards. Supporters argue the TPP would benefit labor conditions. The TPP includes strong labor standards to support economic growth and high-paying jobs, particularly in tech sectors. The agreement allows the US to set rules in the Asia-Pacific region. Labor provisions are subject to dispute settlement mechanisms, including potential trade sanctions. Parties agreed to adopt laws consistent with ILO Declaration and govern acceptable work conditions. The TPP includes strong labor standards to support economic growth and high-paying jobs, particularly in tech sectors. Parties agreed to adopt laws consistent with ILO Declaration and govern acceptable work conditions, including minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and health. The agreement also establishes mechanisms for addressing concerns about labor commitments and provides transparency and access to fair administrative and judicial proceedings. The TPP includes strong labor standards to support economic growth and high-paying jobs, particularly in tech sectors. Parties agreed to adopt laws consistent with ILO Declaration and govern acceptable work conditions, including minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and health. The United States negotiated separate labor consistency agreements with Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei, committing them to specific legal reforms related to labor protections. These agreements are subject to labor consultations and dispute settlement provisions of the TPP agreement. The TPP agreement includes strong labor standards and dispute settlement provisions. The United States can suspend tariff reductions on Vietnamese products if Vietnam fails to establish grassroots labor unions. The environmental provisions in the TPP are also a subject of ongoing debate, aiming to ensure minimum standards of environmental protection in partner countries. Supporters of strong environmental provisions in FTAs argue that existing multilateral environmental agreements lack effective enforcement mechanisms, unlike FTAs which have dispute settlement mechanisms with penalties. Some stakeholders believe environmental provisions should not be included in FTAs, citing weak enforcement in existing agreements like the U.S.-Peru FTA regarding illegal logging in Peru. Countries in the TPP negotiations sought weaker disciplines and removal of commitments from dispute settlement. Environmental provisions in U.S. FTAs have evolved over time, with provisions originally placed in side-letters in the NAFTA agreement. The May 10th Agreement added an obligation for FTA partner countries to adhere to multilateral environmental agreements and allowed for environmental disputes to access full dispute settlement provisions. The TPP environmental chapter reflects aspects of recent U.S. FTAs but also addresses additional topics. The environmental chapter in recent U.S. FTAs obligates parties to enforce environmental laws effectively, not weaken protections for trade or investment, and strive for high levels of environmental protection. It also recognizes each party's right to set its own environmental protection levels and regulatory priorities, allocate enforcement resources, and resolve disputes. The TPP environmental chapter requires parties to affirm their commitment to implement multilateral environmental agreements, with specific language regarding CITES and measures consistent with the Montreal Protocol and MARPOL agreement. Other MEAs are not explicitly referenced, but some provisions address related protections. The TPP includes measures to combat overfishing, IUU fishing, and promote marine conservation. It requires countries to operate fishing management systems to prevent overfishing, reduce by-catch, and recover overfished stocks. It also prohibits specific subsidies that harm fish stocks and vessels engaged in fishing. The TPP includes measures to combat overfishing, IUU fishing, and promote marine conservation by prohibiting subsidies that harm fish stocks and vessels engaged in fishing. Parties are required to promote the long-term conservation of sharks, marine turtles, seabirds, and marine mammals, with specific measures for sharks including data collection, by-catch mitigation, and finning prohibitions. The agreement also commits parties to adopt laws and regulations to achieve compliance with the CITES treaty and combat illegal trade in wild flora and fauna. The TPP addresses the trade of wild flora and fauna in violation of other countries' laws, promoting measures to protect natural areas like wetlands. It also focuses on illegal logging, sustainable forest management, and cooperative measures for trade, biodiversity, and environmental goods. Cross-border data flows have significantly increased, with digital trade encompassing various products. Digital trade has been growing since 2005, encompassing not just end-products like movies and video games, but also essential services that enhance productivity and competitiveness. In 2014, the United States had a surplus of $158.9 billion in digitally-deliverable services, with half of all services imports and 56% of exports being digitally delivered. The U.S. is the largest producer of digital content consumed globally. Congress has set negotiating objectives in TPA-2015 on digital trade and cross-border data flows. The Industry Trade Advisory Council on Information and Communication Technologies Services and Electronic Commerce (ITAC 8) endorsed the TPP, stating that it promotes the economic interests of the United States and provides equity and reciprocity for the sectors represented by the ITAC. While most industry stakeholders support the digital trade provisions, some have concerns over certain exceptions, such as the exclusion of financial services from data localization provisions. The TPP's electronic commerce chapter aims to promote digital trade and the free flow of information, with provisions prohibiting cross-border data flow restrictions and source code disclosure requirements. It excludes government procurement and financial services, which have separate chapters. Other relevant provisions are found in chapters like Financial Services, IPR, Technical Barriers to Trade, and Telecommunications. The TPP's electronic commerce chapter aims to promote digital trade and the free flow of information. It prohibits requirements for source code disclosure or transfer for market access, with exceptions. It also requires online consumer protection, anti-spam laws, and privacy frameworks. The chapter clarifies rules for intellectual property rights enforcement and criminal penalties for trade secret cybertheft. It encourages cooperation on e-commerce, cybersecurity, and cross-border electronic card payment services. U.S. government and business stakeholders have raised concerns over competition with state-linked companies and support new TPP disciplines to address this issue. The TPP aims to address competition with state-linked companies by supporting new disciplines. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) may receive preferential treatment, distorting competition. The focus has been on SOE presence in Vietnam, Malaysia, and Singapore. In TPA-2015, Congress supported new rules and disciplines on SOEs in U.S. trade agreements as a principal negotiating objective to eliminate unfair trade advantages by state-owned enterprises. Reaction to the SOE provisions in TPP is mixed, with most groups seeing them as a positive first step in establishing international commitments on SOEs and their competition with private firms. Private sector Industry Trade Advisory Committees generally express support for the SOE commitments due to their potential impact on various industries. The Industry Trade Advisory Committees generally support the SOE commitments in the TPP, but some express concerns about exceptions and enforceability. Critics argue that the agreement's broad exemptions set a negative precedent and call for more restrictions on SOEs in certain sectors. Chapter 17 of the TPP contains the most comprehensive disciplines on SOEs compared to other U.S. FTAs. Australia, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and South Korea have minimal disciplines on state enterprises in their trade agreements. The U.S.-Singapore FTA has more extensive provisions on SOEs. The TPP goes beyond existing commitments to address potential commercial disadvantages to private sector firms. The TPP includes provisions on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and designated monopolies, with agreements for further negotiations after 5 years to reduce nonconforming measures. Key provisions cover SOE definition, delegated authority, and nondiscriminatory treatment/commercial considerations. The TPP includes provisions on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and designated monopolies, requiring them to make purchase and sale decisions based on commercial considerations and in a nondiscriminatory manner. It also prohibits noncommercial assistance that adversely affects other TPP parties or domestic industries. Transparency measures include providing a list of all SOEs and responding to requests for information on ownership, revenue, and management. Exceptions to the transparency commitments in the TPP include SOEs with revenue below a certain threshold, government procurement, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and trade and investment financing. Brunei, Malaysia, and Vietnam are exempt from certain transparency commitments for five years. The TPP includes general exclusions and country-specific exemptions, such as for SOEs owned by sovereign wealth funds, natural resources, development financing, and government actions to support indigenous peoples. Some Members of Congress are concerned about combating unfair exchange rate policies of other countries, like China and Japan, which they believe harm U.S. companies and jobs. Some Members advocate addressing currency manipulation in trade agreements like the TPP, while others question its significance, measurement, and effectiveness. Concerns include long-term effects on exchange rates, differentiation between manipulation and legitimate activities, and the impact on the U.S. economy. Aggressive measures could lead to a tariff war or restrictions on U.S. monetary policy. The June TPA-2015 included provisions on this issue. The June TPA-2015 included provisions addressing currency manipulation in trade agreements like the TPP. Monetary authorities from the 12 TPP countries initiated negotiations in response, releasing a declaration in November 2015 to combat unfair currency practices. The declaration reaffirms IMF commitments to avoid manipulating exchange rates for unfair competitive advantage. The November 2015 declaration aims to combat unfair currency practices by requiring countries to pursue exchange rate policies based on economic fundamentals, avoid misalignments, and refrain from competitive devaluations. It also mandates transparency in reporting relevant data, establishes a multilateral dialogue among TPP macroeconomic officials, and applies to future TPP countries with additional conditions. The Treasury Department's declaration in the TPP addresses unfair currency practices by promoting transparency and accountability, but lacks an enforcement mechanism for currency manipulation. Technical barriers to trade (TBT) aim to protect health and safety but may discriminate against imports. WTO members must adhere to the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade to minimize trade distortion. FTA provisions establish rules and procedures for member countries to follow regarding health and safety regulations and assessment procedures. They require transparency, non-discrimination, and recognition of equivalent domestic regulations. The TPP expands on the WTO TBT Agreement by providing opportunities for firms and enhancing standards. The TPP builds on the TBT agreement and prior U.S. FTAs by enhancing transparency, requiring nondiscriminatory treatment for conformity assessment bodies, extending transparency obligations, allowing stakeholder participation in developing regulations, mandating a \"reasonable interval\" between adoption and implementation of new standards, and establishing a Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade. The TPP includes a new stand-alone chapter on regulatory coherence to address nontariff barriers and regulatory processes that hinder market access for U.S. goods and services exports in the Asia-Pacific region. The TPP includes a new stand-alone chapter on regulatory coherence to address nontariff barriers and regulatory processes that hinder market access for U.S. goods and services exports in the Asia-Pacific region. The goal is to ensure a regulatory environment in the Asia-Pacific that mirrors the U.S. system, focusing on transparency, impartiality, due process, and coordination across government. The chapter recommends TPP partner countries to establish domestic regulatory structures similar to the U.S. Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to vet proposed regulations and ensure compliance with domestic law, policy, trade agreements, and international obligations. The TPP aims to ensure regulatory consistency among member countries through regulatory impact assessments, cost-benefit analysis, and transparency in the rule-making process. It establishes a regulatory coherence committee to review commitments and promote cooperation on regulatory activities. The self-enforcement of commitments is required among the 12 countries. The TPP requires self-enforcement among member countries for regulatory consistency. Each country determines regulations covered, not subject to dispute settlement. Access to medicines debate includes concerns over national formularies favoring generic drugs. US pharmaceutical industry worries about disadvantage for innovative products in national healthcare programs like New Zealand's PHARMAC. The TPP's Annex 26-A promotes transparent and fair procedures for listing new pharmaceutical products and medical devices for reimbursement. Countries must provide an independent or internal review process for applicants. This differentiates the TPP from KORUS, which required an independent review. The TPP's Annex 26-A establishes transparent procedures for listing pharmaceutical products and medical devices for reimbursement, differentiating it from KORUS. It does not affect government procurement or healthcare systems. Customs valuation and trade facilitation aim to streamline border procedures, reduce costs, and improve trade efficiency, with potential cost reductions of 10-15%, especially in lower income countries. Improvements in customs and logistical procedures, as outlined in the 2013 WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), aim to reduce costs by 10-15%, with the greatest impact in lower income countries. Industry stakeholders generally support the customs and trade facilitation commitments in the TPP, finding them \"fair and balanced\" with expanded provisions compared to recent agreements. Concerns have been raised about the lack of a fixed de minimis threshold for customs duties. The lack of a fixed de minimis threshold for customs duties in the TPP chapter on customs and trade facilitation is a concern for stakeholders. They urge the U.S. government to pursue a commercially relevant value and review the issue periodically. The chapter aims to ensure an efficient, timely, and transparent customs process, with a focus on publication and sharing of customs information, advance rulings, treatment of express delivery shipments, penalties for violations, and risk management techniques. Changes in customs procedures could have a significant impact on U.S. trade with TPP partners. The TPP chapter on customs and trade facilitation aims to improve customs procedures for efficient trade. It includes commitments similar to previous U.S. trade agreements but with more extensive provisions in some areas. Differences include automation, advance rulings, and advice/information. The lack of a fixed de minimis threshold for customs duties is a concern for stakeholders. The TPP chapter on customs and trade facilitation includes provisions for expeditious responses to information requests, special customs procedures for express shipments, and parameters on penalties imposed by customs administrations. These provisions go beyond previous U.S. FTAs and aim to improve customs procedures for efficient trade. The TPP chapter on customs and trade facilitation includes provisions for expeditious responses to information requests, special customs procedures for express shipments, and parameters on penalties imposed by customs administrations. It also requires the release of goods within a fixed time period and provides protections to importers. National competition laws aim to prevent market domination and promote competition, with some U.S. FTAs including provisions to limit trade-distorting effects of such laws. The TPP includes commitments on competition policy similar to previous U.S. FTAs, with provisions on protection of confidential business information, private rights of action, and consumer protection. It addresses issues related to State-Owned Enterprises in a separate chapter and goes beyond the recent KORUS FTA with additional commitments. The TPP includes provisions on competition policy, protection of confidential business information, private rights of action, and consumer protection. The competition provisions will not apply to Brunei until after 10 years or the establishment of a national competition authority. Transparency provisions require the publication of TPP-relevant measures with time for comments before they take effect. The TPP includes commitments for due process in administrative proceedings, anti-corruption measures, and additional commitments not found in the KORUS FTA, such as monetary sanctions for bribery offenses and prohibiting specific corrupt acts related to financial reporting. The TPP includes anti-corruption commitments such as enforcing anti-corruption laws, preventing corruption among public officials and the private sector, and requiring Japan to ratify the UNCAC. Dispute settlement applies to transparency and anti-corruption commitments with limitations on enforcement. Additional commitments for pharmaceuticals and medical devices are included in an annex. The KORUS FTA includes a provision on transparency that prohibits discouraging residents from purchasing goods and services from each other, not found in TPP. Trade remedies like antidumping and countervailing duties are important tools to mitigate adverse effects of imports on U.S. industries and workers. The WTO sanctions trade remedies like countervailing duty (CVD) and safeguard actions to counter unfair trade practices and import surges. The TPP preserves each party's rights under GATT for global safeguard measures. Congress insists on the use of trade remedies to enforce trade laws. TPP includes provisions on transparency and due process for safeguard and AD/CVD measures. It outlines terms for safeguard actions in case of injury from increased imports, including guidelines for addressing import injury from multiple parties. After an investigation and affirmative determination of injury, TPP allows for withdrawal of trade concessions for affected products. The agreement sets standards for safeguard measures, including duration and notification requirements among TPP parties. The TPP includes provisions for safeguard measures, with affected parties receiving additional liberalization or tariff concessions suspension. There is variation in economic development among TPP partners, with longer phase-in periods for some countries and extensive nonconforming measures. Two chapters address this economic variation, focusing on development and cooperation. These chapters are not subject to dispute settlement and mainly consist of hortatory commitments. The TPP includes provisions for safeguard measures and economic development, with commitments on broad-based growth, women's participation, and science and technology skills. Cooperation and capacity building require establishing contact persons and providing resources. The U.S. does not commit to specific funding levels but offers ongoing assistance to FTA partners. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provided $6.2 million to support the Dominican Republic in implementing the DR-CAFTA trade agreement. Trade Capacity Building (TCB) received $594 million in FY2014, with funding for trade-related agriculture, competition policy, trade-related labor, and customs operations. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make up 97% of firms involved in international trade but only contribute about 30% of the value. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) contribute indirectly to U.S. trade by supplying parts for larger products. While SMEs represent a small share of trade by value, they employ half of the U.S. nonfarm private sector workforce. Government efforts aim to improve SME access to international markets. Government efforts to improve SME access to international markets led to the USTR commissioning reports on barriers for SMEs in exporting. Suggestions included a focus on FTAs, leading to a stand-alone SME chapter in the TPP with few commitments. The chapter requires TPP countries to make the agreement and its SME-relevant provisions available online, with a committee established to assist SMEs in trade matters. The TPP's SME chapter focuses on trade facilitation for small businesses, with provisions on digital trade and customs procedures. Stakeholders support transparency measures but criticize the lack of a fixed de minimis threshold for customs shipments. The agreement includes dispute settlement and governance provisions as it is considered a \"living agreement.\" The TPP is a \"living agreement\" with procedures for new member accession, new provisions negotiation, and a Free Trade Commission for oversight. The Commission supervises agreement implementation, considers amendments, oversees committees, and resolves disputes. The TPP is a \"living agreement\" with a Free Trade Commission for oversight, which supervises implementation, considers amendments, and resolves disputes through cooperative consultations between parties. The TPP includes steps for dispute resolution such as initial consultations, mediation, and establishment of a dispute settlement panel composed of three arbiters. The unsuccessful party must remedy the issue or face compensation, suspension of benefits, or fines. Disputes common to both WTO and FTA rules can be brought to one forum. State-State dispute settlement under U.S. FTAs has been infrequent. The TPP includes dispute settlement procedures for resolving issues among parties, with certain provisions subject to dispute settlement while others are not, such as the regulatory coherence chapter, competition chapter, and certain commitments by Malaysia in the SOE chapter. The TPP is designed to be a dynamic agreement open to new members. The TPP is a \"living agreement\" open to new members willing to meet its standards. Amendments can be made by consensus through the TPP Commission, with each party completing their legal process. Accession is possible for any APEC member or state by consensus, with negotiations conducted by a working group and agreement required by all parties through domestic ratification. The TPP is open to new members willing to meet its standards, with potential candidates including countries like South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and the Philippines. Beyond APEC countries, Colombia and Costa Rica have expressed interest, and there is a possibility of additional countries or trade blocs joining in the future. China may also seek to join if it can adhere to the agreement's standards. The accession process for new members to the TPP raises questions about their input on existing agreements, especially for countries with political or economic influence. Reopening substantive provisions for each new entrant poses challenges, similar to the WTO accession process. The relationship of the TPP to previous agreements is also a point of discussion. The TPP aims to \"coexist\" with international agreements, resolving inconsistencies through mutual agreement. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties guides precedence between agreements, stating that the later treaty applies in case of conflict, but earlier provisions may apply if not addressed in the later agreement. The TPP aims to coexist with international agreements, resolving inconsistencies through mutual agreement. The later treaty applies in case of conflict, but earlier provisions may apply if not addressed in the later agreement. Exporters may choose to seek benefits under the old agreement or the new one, with the new agreement likely to achieve further liberalization. Congress has shown strong interest in the TPP since negotiations began in 2008, holding hearings and expressing views through letters and consultations. If considering implementing legislation, Congress may evaluate the agreement from various perspectives. The TPP, as the largest FTA negotiated by the United States, brings together a diverse group of countries with 30 comprehensive chapters. It includes provisions on digital trade and intellectual property rights but has some less ambitious aspects compared to previous FTAs. Concerns have been raised about issues like the 30-year tariff phase-out and limited data exclusivity for biologic drugs. The TPP raised concerns over issues such as limited data exclusivity for biologic drugs, exclusion of tobacco control measures from ISDS procedures, exclusion of financial services from data localization disciplines, and more flexible rules of origin for autos. Some NGO stakeholders were disappointed in certain environmental provisions. Negotiators argued these compromises were necessary for agreement. Key questions for Congress include assessing if the TPP meets the objective of a \"comprehensive, high-standard\" agreement. The TPP raised concerns over limited data exclusivity for biologic drugs, exclusion of tobacco control measures from ISDS procedures, and more flexible rules of origin for autos. Some NGO stakeholders were disappointed in certain environmental provisions. TPA-2015 sets U.S. negotiating objectives for trade agreements, including reducing trade barriers, protecting intellectual property rights, and ensuring environmental and worker rights protection. The U.S. trade remedy laws include goals on state-owned enterprises, regulatory coherence, digital trade, and green technologies. Negotiating objectives are flexible for agreements with other countries, but questions remain on TPP's progress in meeting TPA objectives. The debate over the TPP's impact on the U.S. economy includes discussions on employment opportunities, income distribution, and the well-being of the middle class. Economic theory supports lowering trade barriers for growth, but increased trade can lead to job loss and economic challenges for workers. Estimating the economic impact of the TPP is crucial for the congressional debate, but it is a complex and imprecise task. Estimating the economic impact of the TPP is crucial for the congressional debate, but it is a difficult and imprecise task due to various factors such as changes in tariffs and quotas, limitations in economic modeling efforts, and differing conclusions from studies. The USITC released an analysis estimating a small positive benefit to the U.S. economy from the TPP. Key questions for Congress include the adequacy of worker adjustment support programs for those disadvantaged by trade. The pursuit of the TPP and its impact on U.S. trade policy raise questions about worker retraining, skills needed in a globalized world, and criteria for evaluating economic impact estimates. With the Doha Round on hold, the U.S. is focusing on mega-regional FTAs like the TPP for trade liberalization. These agreements offer deeper liberalization potential and could influence further trade liberalization efforts. The TPP may lead to trade diversion and create a two-tier global economy, potentially impacting the WTO. Key questions for Congress include the future of WTO trade negotiations and the impact of the TPP on the institution. Supporters of the TPP highlight its potential strategic value for the United States in the Asia-Pacific region, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to lead in establishing international trade rules. China's absence from the agreement is a key factor in the debate, with proponents arguing that the TPP is part of a broader foreign policy strategy to counter China's influence in shaping trade norms. The TPP's potential strategic effects compared to its economic value are key questions for Congress. Analysts suggest that not passing the TPP could have significant implications for the U.S. economically and strategically. The regional and international trade architecture will continue to evolve with concluded trade agreements between major U.S. trading partners and progress in RCEP negotiations. The regional and international trade architecture will evolve with or without U.S. participation. Without the TPP, U.S. goods and services could be disadvantaged in foreign markets. The ratification of the TPP is tied to perceptions of U.S. credibility as a negotiating partner. Key questions for Congress include the impact on U.S. trade policy and leadership in the Asia-Pacific region if the TPP is rejected or delayed indefinitely. Congressional consideration of TPP could affect U.S. credibility in future trade negotiations. U.S. credibility in future trade negotiations may be impacted as Congress debates the TPP, focusing on issues like implementation, enforcement, and expansion. Concerns have been raised about ensuring compliance with TPP provisions, including IPR commitments, labor and environment provisions, and the removal of nontariff barriers. Congress may also review the institutional structure of the TPP agreement and its potential expansion, considering its role in the process. The largest U.S. FTA, the TPP, may require congressional approval for expansion and changes to U.S. law. Questions arise about funding for implementation and enforcement, ensuring compliance, and assessing new members. Congress debates on its role in negotiations and potential expansion of the agreement. The potential Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement has economic and strategic implications for the United States, being the largest U.S. FTA by trade flows. It aims to reduce barriers to trade in goods, services, and agriculture, establish rules on various topics, and evolve as a \"living agreement\" with expanding membership and rules. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) has economic and strategic implications for the United States, aiming to reduce trade barriers and establish rules on various topics. It has garnered interest from several countries and is seen as a symbol of U.S. commitment and influence in the Asia-Pacific region. Congress faces a complex set of issues as it debates potential implementing legislation."
