Programs like the Bracero program brought millions of Mexican workers during World War II. Today, the H-2A visa program imports agricultural guest workers in smaller numbers, sparking controversy over its necessity and potential exploitation. The H-2A program is seen as exploitative and in need of overhaul. Legislative proposals have been made to reform agricultural guest worker programs, including creating new programs. Bills in the 113th Congress have addressed the creation of new agricultural guest worker programs. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 lists nonimmigrant visa categories, including the H-2A visa for temporary agricultural workers. The H-2A program is overseen by the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The program operates under regulations issued in 2008 and 2010. The H-2A program allows for the temporary admission of foreign workers to the United States for agricultural labor or services of a seasonal or temporary nature, under regulations issued by DHS in 2008 and DOL in 2010. Participation is limited to designated countries, with work considered temporary if lasting no longer than one year. An approved H-2A visa is valid for up to one year, with the possibility of extensions up to three consecutive years. After three years, an alien cannot seek further extensions or readmission to the United States. States in H-2A status must wait three months outside the U.S. before seeking an extension or readmission. The H-2A program involves DOL, DHS, and DOS. Employers must apply to DOL for certification, showing a lack of U.S. workers and no adverse impact on wages. Recruitment of U.S. workers is required before filing a labor certification application. Employers must follow the \"fifty percent rule\" under the H-2A program. Under the H-2A program, employers must follow the \"fifty percent rule\" and offer required wages and benefits to H-2A workers and workers in corresponding employment. They must pay the highest of several wage rates and provide a \"three-fourths guarantee\" of employment. Under the H-2A program, employers must provide a \"three-fourths guarantee\" of employment, offer housing at no cost, provide transportation, and other benefits. The INA does not mandate health insurance coverage. Employers must comply with terms and conditions, submit a petition to DHS for foreign workers, who can then apply for an H-2A visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate. The H-2A program issues visas for workers to enter the United States, with accompanying family members receiving H-4 visas. The program has grown over the years, with 65,345 H-2A visas issued in FY2012. Growers criticize the program for being cumbersome and expensive, while labor advocates argue it lacks worker protections. In the late 1990s, the AgJOBS legislation aimed to address the foreign agricultural worker issue by granting lawful permanent resident status to eligible farm workers. Despite bipartisan support in the 106th Congress, the compromise fell apart after the 2000 election. AgJOBS titles were included in immigration reform bills in the 109th and 110th Congresses but were not enacted. In the 113th Congress, separate bills addressing foreign agricultural workers were considered by the House Judiciary Committee and the full Senate. The House Judiciary Committee and the Senate have acted on bills addressing foreign agricultural workers. The House bill would create a new H-2C nonimmigrant agricultural worker visa, while the Senate bill would establish new W-3 and W-4 nonimmigrant visas for agricultural workers. Both bills would sunset the existing H-2A visa program. Both the House and Senate bills propose replacing the H-2A visa program with new agricultural worker visa programs that allow for non-temporary or seasonal work, eliminate the need for labor certification, and provide for at-will employment. Both programs also offer pathways for unauthorized aliens to obtain legal immigration status. H.R. 1773 introduces the H-2C agricultural worker visa, requiring employers to recruit U.S. workers through the local state workforce agency. The H-2C agricultural worker visa program requires employers to recruit U.S. workers through the local state workforce agency for 30 days before hiring H-2C workers. Employers must file a petition with the USDA containing specified attestations regarding worker recruitment, benefits, wages, and working conditions. The employer must ensure equal benefits, wages, and working conditions for all workers in the same occupation. Wages must meet the prevailing wage rate or applicable federal, state, or local standards. The H-2C agricultural worker visa program requires employers to pay prevailing wage rate or minimum wage, offer employment for at least 50% of anticipated period, and provide up to 18-36 months of employment based on job nature. Housing and transportation costs are not required. Workers can extend stay for additional employment opportunities. The H-2C agricultural worker visa program allows employers to petition for extension of stay and change in employment for H-2C workers in the U.S. Workers can have a maximum continuous stay of 18-36 months based on job nature, with a required three-month break outside the U.S. before re-employment. The H-2C program would have a cap of 500,000 workers, with exemptions for those who perform 575 hours of agricultural labor in the U.S. H.R. 1773 would establish a trust fund for H-2C workers to incentivize their return to their home country upon visa expiration. Workers could apply for funds at a U.S. embassy, but they could not bring their families to the U.S. H.R. 1773 proposes the H-2C program for 500,000 workers in the U.S. with at-will employment for registered agricultural employers. USDA would designate these employers, who must meet specific requirements, for three-year terms extendable. The H-2C program proposed by H.R. 1773 would allow for 500,000 workers with at-will employment for registered agricultural employers. USDA would conduct investigations and audits for compliance, while DHS would remove violators. The bill also provides legal temporary status for certain aliens unlawfully present in the U.S. on April 25, 2013, and allows for continued agricultural labor for those meeting specific criteria. The bill passed by the Senate introduces W-3 and W-4 visas for agricultural workers under a new W nonimmigrant visa category. Employers must register as \"designated agricultural employers\" with USDA, with registrations valid for three years. Job opportunities must be posted on a DOL job registry for 45 days, offering the job to qualified U.S. workers first. Employers must submit a petition to DHS to import W-3 or W-4 workers, including attestations about contracts and compliance with employer requirements. The bill introduces W-3 and W-4 visas for agricultural workers under a new W nonimmigrant visa category. Employers must register as \"designated agricultural employers\" with USDA, with registrations valid for three years. Job opportunities must be posted on a DOL job registry for 45 days, offering the job to qualified U.S. workers first. Employers must submit a petition to DHS to import W-3 or W-4 workers, including attestations about contracts and compliance with employer requirements such as offering housing or a housing allowance and transportation costs. Required wages are based on agricultural occupational classifications, with certain wages specified and others to be determined by USDA. U.S. workers hired by DAEs must receive the same benefits, wages, and working conditions as W-3 and W-4 workers, except for housing or a housing allowance. Special Procedures Industries are identified, with separate regulations issued by USDA, DHS, or DOL regarding housing, pay, and application procedures. The W-3 and W-4 visas for agricultural workers under a new W nonimmigrant visa category have specific regulations for housing, pay, and application procedures. Workers can be admitted for a period of three years, with the possibility of extension. After completing a contract with a Designated Agricultural Employer (DAE), a worker can seek subsequent employment with another DAE. The visas are capped at 112,333 total visas per year for the first five years, with provisions for adjustments by USDA in consultation with DOL. Unemployment for more than 60 days could result in loss of nonimmigrant status unless granted a waiver by DHS. The W-3 and W-4 visas for agricultural workers have specific regulations for housing, pay, and application procedures. Workers can be admitted for three years, with the possibility of extension. The visas are capped at 112,333 total visas per year for the first five years, with provisions for adjustments by USDA in consultation with DOL. DOL would be authorized to investigate complaints against employers of W-3 or W-4 workers. USDA would be required to monitor W-3 and W-4 workers using electronic systems. A worker legalization program was established for farm workers who met specific requirements to obtain a \"blue card\" temporary resident status in 2011 and 2012. They could later apply for LPR status after fulfilling additional agricultural work and other conditions."
