    "content": "With the current economic downturn, Members of the 111th Congress are considering policy options for economic improvement, including foreign investor visas. These visas aim to attract capital and create jobs for U.S. citizens. However, extending these visas poses risks such as abuse and security concerns. The immigrant investor visa pilot program has been extended until September 30, 2012, prompting Members of Congress to evaluate the current policy towards foreign investors. The key question is whether the benefits of granting visas to foreign investors outweigh the costs of denying visas to other employment-based groups. The analysis provides a background and framework for considering foreign investor visa policy, including discussions on immigrant and nonimmigrant investor visas, comparison with Canadian programs, and the relationship between investment and visas. Since the Immigration Act of 1924, the United States has granted visas to foreign nationals for commerce. The nonimmigrant treaty trader visa was created in 1924, followed by the nonimmigrant treaty investor visa in 1952. These visas require the principal holder to be from a treaty country. The United States has visa classes for nonimmigrant treaty traders (E-1) and nonimmigrant treaty investors (E-2). Immigrant investors are admitted as LPRs through the EB-5 investor visa program, allowing for up to 10,000 admissions annually with a minimum $1 million investment. The Regional Center Pilot Program allows investors to invest in targeted regions and financially troubled enterprises. The pilot program for immigrant investors was extended to FY2008, aiming to boost the US economy through job creation and foreign capital influx. Critics argue that foreign investors may displace potential US entrepreneurs. There is one immigrant class specifically for foreign investors, falling under the employment-based immigrant visas. The EB-5 visa, also known as the immigrant investor visa, falls under the employment-based immigrant visas. Its purpose is to benefit the US economy through job creation and foreign capital influx. Proponents believe it will bring significant economic benefits, with predictions of 4,000 annual applications, $4 billion in investments, and 40,000 new jobs. The Immigration Act of 1990 amended the Immigration and Nationality Act to create an employment-based LPR investor visa program. This program requires individuals to invest $1 million into a new commercial enterprise in the United States, creating at least 10 full-time positions for U.S. citizens, LPRs, or other work-authorized aliens. The investment must be \"at risk\" and not include the investor's family members. The EB-5 investor visa program requires a $1 million investment in a new commercial enterprise, creating 10 full-time positions. Investors can reduce the investment to $500,000 in targeted areas. 7.1% of employment-based visas are reserved for EB-5 investors, with 3,000 visas for entrepreneurs in targeted areas. Multiple applicants can invest in the same enterprise, each creating 10 full-time jobs. Applicants can also combine investments with authorized workers. Maintenance of business and jobs for two years is required. The Regional Center Pilot Program, established to achieve economic activity and job creation goals, encourages investors to invest in Regional Centers approved by DHS's USCIS. Limited partnership is acceptable, allowing investors to live elsewhere or engage in additional economic activities. The Regional Center Pilot Program encourages foreign investment in specific geographic regions, especially those with high unemployment. Up to 5,000 immigrant visas are available annually for investors to qualify for conditional LPR status. The program was initially set to sunset in FY2008 but was extended through September 30, 2012. USCIS established a new unit to oversee LPR investor visas and investments following the 2003 legislation. The Investor and Regional Center Unit (IRCU) was created by USCIS in 2005 to govern LPR investor visas and investments. The IRCU aims to prevent EB-5 abuse and promote investment. Approximately 75-80% of EB-5 investors have used the pilot program, with limited partnerships being the most common. The number of LPR investor admissions peaked at 1,361 in FY1997 but declined in subsequent years before rising to 1,360 in FY2008. Despite the program's capacity for almost 10,000 visas annually, it has never reached full allotment. Since the implementation of the Regional Center Pilot Program expansion in 2004, the LPR investor visa program has seen a significant increase. From FY1992 to FY2004, $1 billion was invested in the US by LPR investor visa holders, with 6,024 visas issued. An additional 1,901 immigrant investor visas have been issued since FY2004. The distribution of visas between principals and derivatives has become more balanced in recent years, with derivatives historically receiving 66% of visas and principals 34%. In FY1992 through May 2006, authorities received 8,505 petitions for immigrant investor visas, with a 52.7% approval rate. 3,235 petitions were received for the removal of conditional status, with a 66.6% approval rate. The drop in admissions in FY1998 and FY1999 was due to altered interpretations of qualifying requirements. The 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Act (2002) provided remedies for those affected by the changes. The 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Act (2002) addressed issues from the former-INS' 1998 decision and clarified requirements to increase petitions. A 2005 GAO report identified factors contributing to low participation rates in the LPR investor program, such as the rigorous application process, lack of expertise among adjudicators, uncertainty in outcomes, negative media attention, and delays in processing. Potential investors may have opted for nonimmigrant visas or other investment pathways due to the two-year conditional status and less expensive alternatives for LPR status. Since FY2003, the number of immigrant investor visas issued has increased annually. A GAO study found that 653 LPR visas were issued to investors who invested around $1 billion collectively. Most investors kept their enterprises in the same state where it was established, with hotels/motels, manufacturing, real estate, and domestic sales being common businesses. California had the highest percentage of established enterprises, followed by Maryland, Arizona, and Florida. The states with the highest percentages of established enterprises were Maryland, Arizona, Florida, and Virginia. The number of LPR investor visas to the United States has fluctuated, with a notable recent upward trend in growth. 38.9% of visas issued were for individuals adjusting status, while 61.1% were issued to new arrivals, mostly in FY2006-FY2008. The E-1 and E-2 nonimmigrant visas allow foreign nationals to enter the United States for trade or investment purposes, requiring a treaty between the US and the individual's country of citizenship. These visas are based on commerce or navigation treaties, with other bilateral agreements also accepted. Currently, 75 countries offer treaty class visas, with 28 offering only the E-2 treaty investor visa and 4 offering only the E-1 treaty trader visa. Applicants can choose between the two visas based on their business nature, as each has different renewal criteria. All nonimmigrant investor visa categories have common requirements that applicants must meet. Nonimmigrant investor categories require the principal visa recipient to be a national of a treaty country, in an executive role with essential skills. The visa holder must intend to depart the US at the end of the visa's duration. The employer must be at least 50% owned by treaty country nationals. E-class visas allow a two-year stay and can be renewed indefinitely. The E-class visas can be renewed indefinitely in two-year periods as long as the individual still qualifies. Spouses and child dependents receive the same visa status and renewal, with children needing their own visa after turning 21. Individuals with E-class visas are generally restricted to specified employment but can engage in some other activities. To change employers, they must contact the Department of State for an adjustment of status. The E-1 visa is for individuals involved in substantial trade between the US and their country, tracing back to the 1924 Immigration Act. According to immigration regulations, substantial trade is defined as the exchange, purchase, or sale of goods and/or services between the United States and the individual's country of nationality. The term \"substantial trade\" is not explicitly defined in monetary value but indicates a necessary amount of trade to ensure a continuous flow of international trade items. Qualification for treaty trader status can be based on demonstrating that trading activities would generate sufficient income to support the trader and their family. The E-1 visa requires more than 50% of trade between the US and the treaty country, while the E-2 visa is for investors developing or directing an enterprise with at least 50% ownership. The E-2 visa requires at least a 50% interest in an enterprise, with the burden of proof on the applicant. There is no specific monetary amount for capital, but the investment must be proportionate to ensure success and involve some risk. Smaller investments require a higher percentage of enterprise value, while larger investments need to be substantial. Regulatory qualification for an E-2 investor visa is based on these investment principles. The E-2 investor visa requires a substantial investment in a non-marginal enterprise. The enterprise must be capable of providing a living for the investor and have a significant economic impact within five years. Failure to meet these criteria results in rejection. The E-3 visa is reserved for specialized workers, not investors. The E-class visa is mainly for specialized workers, not investors or traders. It is mostly given to foreign nationals from Asia and Europe, with the highest number of visas issued to the Asian region in FY2009. Japan had the most E-class visa holders in the Asian region. In FY2009, Japan had the highest number of E-class visa holders in the Asian region, accounting for 29.2% of the worldwide total. Europe and North America also had significant shares of E-Class visas, while South America and Africa had minimal representation. The admissions data provides detailed insights into the origins of the visa holders, with the Asian region contributing approximately 47.7% of the total. In FY2008, Asian region accounted for 47.7% of nonimmigrant investor visa admissions in the US. Japan had the highest number of admissions with 85,175, followed by South Korea with 13,801. China and India combined for less than 900 admissions. Europe had slightly more investors admitted than Japan, with 87,787 admissions. African countries had only 276 admissions, a small fraction of the total. In FY2008, California had the highest number of nonimmigrant investors with 46,835 admissions, followed by New York, Florida, and Texas. Michigan and New Jersey also had significant admissions. In FY2008, California had the highest number of nonimmigrant investors with 46,835 admissions, followed by New York, Florida, and Texas. Michigan and New Jersey attracted significant admissions, accounting for 5.3% and 5.1% of the total admissions in the United States, respectively. Historically, more investors apply as nonimmigrants due to less stringent visa requirements. Investor nonimmigrant admission levels are low compared to other categories, possibly due to investors choosing to invest in the US from abroad on temporary business visas or visa waivers. The Canadian investor program allows investors with a net worth of at least $800,000 (Cdn) to make a $400,000 (Cdn) investment through Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC). Additionally, there is an entrepreneurial visa for foreign nationals with a net worth of $300,000 (Cdn) who must invest in a business and create at least one new full-time job for a non-family member. Between 1986 and 2002, the Canadian investor visa program attracted over $6.6 billion (Cdn) in investments. The Canadian investor visa program was developed in 1986 to attract investors from Hong Kong before the transfer of the colony to Chinese control. Immigrant investors from Hong Kong and others have collectively invested over $3 billion in the Canadian economy. The annual number of immigrant investor visas issued in Canada has consistently been higher than in the United States. The Canadian immigrant investor visa program has consistently issued more visas than the United States over the past decade. In 1997, Canada issued 5,595 visas compared to the U.S.'s 1,361 visas. Both countries have seen an increase in immigrant investor visas since 2003, with Canada reaching a 13-year high in 2008. It is unclear if the competition between the two programs is a zero-sum game. Classical economic theory suggests that equalizing the financial requirements of the United States and Canada's immigrant investor visa programs may not significantly impact migration trends if investors are motivated by non-financial factors. Trade liberalization is theorized to have an inverse relationship between foreign direct investment and migration, with increased trade leading to decreased migration pressures. Increased FDI can reduce migration pressures by creating job opportunities in the targeted economy, but the impact may vary based on the skills demanded. While FDI promotes economic growth in the host country, it may not directly decrease migration pressures. Investor visas in the US aim to stimulate economic growth and potentially reduce migration pressures on US workers if investments align with their skill sets. Increased FDI can reduce migration pressures by creating job opportunities in the targeted economy, especially in capital abundant countries like OECD member states. This economic growth from FDI can lead to greater demand for trade and higher per capita income, improving the standard of living. However, the impact of potential migration on investment activity in the United States is less clear. Classical trade theory suggests that trade and migration are substitutes, and trade liberalization should reduce migratory pressures in the long term. Trade theory suggests little migration of investors from countries with liberalized trade arrangements with the United States. Investors would use conventional FDI instead. Critics argue that foreign investments can harm local businesses and exploit local labor, especially in the economic relationship between capital abundant countries and less economically developed countries. More powerful countries can leverage their power in these situations. Some scholars argue that foreign investments can disproportionately benefit capital abundant countries at the expense of less powerful countries. There is debate over the trade/migration relationship and whether economic growth in sending countries could influence migration patterns. Economic growth in sending countries could reduce migration costs for potential migrants. Factors like imperfect credit markets and currency fluctuations are push factors for migrants, especially in less economically developed countries. Investor visas issued to LEDCs are limited, leading to a potential brain drain. LEDCs have limited capital levels, making them susceptible to losing human capital through migration. LED countries have limited capital levels, making them vulnerable to losing human capital through migration. The United States could benefit from sending FDI to LEDCs to promote economic growth and job creation. Attracting investors from capital-abundant countries for sector-specific investments could stimulate US economic growth without negatively impacting the investors' home countries. The decision-making factors for potential temporary and permanent migrants differ. Temporary migrants consider employment prospects and wage differentials, while permanent migrants are motivated by professional and social mobility. The distribution of visas among Asian countries shows a trend of applicants substituting between immigrant and nonimmigrant visas. In FY2008, Japan accounted for 36.9% of nonimmigrant treaty trader and investor visas but only 1% of LPR investor visas since FY1992. Conversely, Taiwan represented 40% of immigrant investors since FY1992 but only 1.5% of nonimmigrant arrivals in FY2008. Japanese investors seek wage differentials, while Taiwanese, Chinese, and South Korean investors pursue professional and social mobility. No single explanation accounts for investor behavior. Japanese investors are choosing to temporarily migrate to the United States due to trade restrictions and weak economic performance in Japan. Despite various factors influencing their decision, they are predominantly opting for temporary migration. Investors from China, Taiwan, and South Korea are migrating to the United States not just for financial reasons but also for family and social network connections. These motives need further empirical testing. Investments can have multiplier effects on the economy by increasing demand for goods and services. The U.S. Department of Commerce quantifies these effects through the Regional Input-Output Modeling System. The U.S. Department of Commerce uses the Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II) to quantify the economic effects of foreign investments. The RIMS II multipliers show that foreign investment funds can significantly increase demand across various industries, resulting in a multiplied impact greater than the direct investment. Studies may not fully capture the economic impact of foreign investors on a region, leading to efforts by administrative agencies to promote these investments. In recent years, USCIS has made efforts to promote foreign investment in the US economy and address visa fraud concerns, particularly through changes to the Regional Center Pilot Program. Concerns about fraudulent applications for the LPR investor visa led to measures to prevent capital pooling schemes and the use of promissory notes. Observers feared investors could withdraw from their investments after being granted conditional LPR status. The USCIS has implemented a policy of not accepting promissory notes from investors to prevent potential collapse of enterprises. The creation of the Investor and Regional Center Unit (IRCU) has allowed for increased scrutiny of applications and requires extensive documentation to trace the source of funds. Prior to IRCU, the former-INS was criticized for delays in application reviews for Regional Center designation. The Regional Center Pilot Program has attracted significant capital and criticism for slow application processing. USCIS has expanded Regional Centers to address concerns and attract more foreign investments through the LPR investor visa. Using LPR investor funds is a cheaper option for domestic investors compared to bank loans. Limited partnerships of domestic investors with LPR investor visas offer a cheaper financing option without interest payments, allowing enterprises to turn a profit faster. USCIS is working with officials in New Orleans to establish it as a Regional Center for LPR investor visa investments, particularly in the rebuilding efforts post-Hurricane Katrina. USCIS is hopeful that the success of the Philadelphia Regional Center for LPR investor visa investments can be replicated in New Orleans. Philadelphia has attracted over 100 LPR investors, financing the renovation of a 1,100 acre shipyard. The Regional Center Pilot Program has been extended through September 30, 2012, but permanent reauthorization was not included in the legislation. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the Regional Center Pilot Program, with some members supporting its permanent authorization. Proposed legislation aims to modify qualifying criteria to lower investment thresholds in certain regions to attract more immigrant investors. The Danish government is lobbying for E-2 treaty investor visas for Danish nationals. The protocol for visa eligibility for Danish nationals under E-2 treaty investor visas was not ratified due to congressional objections. H.R. 3647 was introduced in the 109th Congress to allow Danish nationals to enter the US as investors. Currently, Danish nationals can only obtain E-1 treaty trader visas. Denmark is one of four countries eligible for E-1 visas but not E-2 visas. The South Dakota International Business Institute (SDIBI), Dairy Economic Development Region (DEDR) is the only regional targeting center currently run by a state government. Approved in June 2005, this Regional Center was the result of a state-wide effort to attract foreign capital to South Dakota through the EB-5 pilot investor program, offering investors LPR status and focusing on job creation from foreign investments. South Dakota's Regional Center focuses on job creation through foreign investments, particularly in attracting dairy farm investors. USCIS approved the designation with the condition of allowing limited partnerships between foreign investors and domestic farmers. This has led to enterprises fully owned by foreign investors and partnerships. 60 foreign investors have invested $30 million in the state's dairy industry, with an additional $6 million from local farmers. The total $36 million investment has leveraged almost $90 million in bank financing for dairy projects. Foreign investments from EB-5 immigrants in South Dakota's dairy industry have resulted in $90 million in bank financing, creating 240 jobs and bringing 20,000 cows to the state. This has led to a total of 638 additional jobs and over $360 million in economic impact. Director Joop Bollen sees significant spillover effects into the restaurant and meat packing industries, with plans to attract more investments for meat packing plants. Director Bollen emphasized the importance of USCIS having resources to quickly process EB-5 immigrant visa petitions to attract foreign investments for South Dakota's dairy industry. CanAm Enterprises collaborates with the City of Philadelphia to promote development in the shipyard area and transition the city's economy. Their strategy involves using collateralized loans to attract investments. The Philadelphia Naval Base was transformed for civilian use by PIDC after its closure in the 1970s. Despite initial struggles, the shipyard became economically viable again with investments from the federal government, the city of Philadelphia, and Norwegian shipbuilding companies. Over $400 million was invested to revitalize the shipyard. Norwegian shipbuilding companies invested in the shipyard, providing training and human capital. EB-5 investors are crucial for funding production bottlenecks, including advanced painting technology. Philadelphia's Regional Center has attracted 60 EB-5 visa investors, totaling $75 million. CanAm Enterprises emphasizes the importance of both funds and human capital brought by investors to the United States. The official highlighted the importance of highly competent entrepreneurs brought to the United States by investors, who not only make investments in the city but also boost economic activity through exchanges with their foreign networks."
