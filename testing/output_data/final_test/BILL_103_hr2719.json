The Defense Reuse Community Partnership Act allows the Secretary of Defense to contract independent Site Managers to assist in managing excess real property at military installations to be closed. Site Managers are selected in consultation with the local community and are barred from bidding on or acquiring real property during and after their contract term. The Secretary of Defense can contract Site Managers to manage excess real property at military installations to be closed. Site Managers must have experience in site planning, dealing with local authorities, managing hazardous waste cleanup, and resolving land use issues. They are prohibited from bidding on or acquiring property unless necessary for contract execution. The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 outlines qualifications for Site Managers tasked with analyzing land use potential, coordinating with authorities for reuse options, managing environmental remediation, and completing required reports for military installations. The Secretary of Defense is responsible for managing the maintenance, interim use, preparation for disposal, and sale of surplus military installations in accordance with relevant laws and procedures. Before incurring expenses, each proposed sale parcel must undergo an appraisal. The Secretary of Defense must appoint a Site Manager to appraise each proposed sale parcel at a military installation to determine its current value. The appraisal must follow land appraisal regulations issued under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989. Additionally, a detailed budget for each phase of site preparation and approval process must be jointly developed by the Site Manager and the Secretary of Defense. The Site Manager has the authority to manage the budget without adhering to Federal acquisition laws and regulations. The Site Manager appointed by the Secretary of Defense is authorized to engage contractors and professionals for site preparation and approval, including environmental remediation. The Secretary will reimburse the Site Manager for overhead costs and payments under contracts. Once a sale parcel is ready, the Site Manager will sell it on terms approved by the Secretary, with proceeds divided among the Department of Defense, Site Manager, and local authorities. The Secretary of Defense will receive an amount equal to the initial appraised value of the parcel, costs incurred under the contract with the Site Manager, and a portion of the proceeds from the sale. The Secretary of Defense will receive an amount equal to the initial appraised value of the parcel, costs incurred under the contract with the Site Manager, and a portion of the proceeds from the sale. Additionally, the Site Manager, applicable local authorities, and the State may receive portions of the remaining proceeds as determined by the Secretary. Site Managers are required to submit reports to the Secretary of Defense at specified intervals. The Secretary of Defense must submit reports to Congress on military installations covered by contracts for site preparation and disposal. The term \"base closure law\" includes specific legislative acts related to base closures and realignment."
