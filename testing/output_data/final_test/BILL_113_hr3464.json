Various types of discharges from a covered vessel include protection, controllable pitch propeller and thruster hydraulic fluid, distillation and reverse osmosis brine, elevator pit effluent, firemain system effluent, freshwater layup effluent, gas turbine wash water, motor gasoline and compensating effluent, refrigeration and air condensate effluent, seawater pumping biofouling prevention substances, boat engine wet exhaust, and sonar dome effluent.

The Administrator, in consultation with the Coast Guard, determines discharges subject to best management practices to mitigate adverse impacts on US waters. The determinations will be promulgated in accordance with section 553 of title 5, United States Code, considering the nature of the discharge, environmental effects, and effectiveness of the best practices. The Administrator, in consultation with the Coast Guard, considers various factors when determining best management practices for discharges, including effectiveness, practicability, impact on vessel operation, legal requirements, international standards, and economic costs. The timing of initial determinations is also specified. The Administrator, in consultation with the Coast Guard, makes initial determinations under subparagraph (A) within 1 year of enactment and reviews them every 5 years thereafter. The Secretary of the department operating the Coast Guard will regulate the use of best management practices for discharges.

The regulations will distinguish between new and existing vessels and provide waivers as needed. This subsection does not affect the application of section 311 to covered vessels. After the regulations are in effect, covered vessels cannot operate or discharge any incidental discharge. Covered vessels must not operate or discharge any incidental discharge into navigable waters if they are not using best management practices meeting standards established under this subsection."
