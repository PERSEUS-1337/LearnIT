    "content": "The \"Native American Education Opportunity Act\" aims to offer additional education options for Native American students in certain States served by Bureau of Indian Affairs-funded schools. This Act amends Part B of title XI of the Education Amendments of 1978 to include a Bureau funding provision for State-based education savings account programs. The Act authorizes reimbursements to States with education savings account programs for grants made to eligible students. The reimbursement applies to students who applied for the program on or after January 1, 2017. The Secretary will reimburse States for education savings account grants for ESA eligible students, capped at 90% of the amount provided to Bureau-funded schools. If the reimbursement exceeds the State grant, additional notification will be given to the States. The Secretary will notify States of higher reimbursement amounts for education savings account grants. States must request reimbursement within 30 days of grant submission, and the Secretary will reimburse them promptly. The Secretary will reimburse States for education savings account grants promptly. States must return any overpayments within 30 days. All eligible Indian students participating in an ESA program will be included in calculations. Any remaining reimbursement amount will be available for the Secretary to use. The Secretary will work with Bureau-funded schools in each State to inform parents of ESA eligible students about the education savings account program. Reimbursements provided through the program for eligible students will be considered assistance to the student, not the school. The amounts provided will not be treated as income for parents under Federal tax laws. The term 'ESA eligible student' refers to a student who attended a Bureau-funded school or will be eligible to attend one, for purposes of an education savings account program. To be eligible for an education savings account program, a student must be in kindergarten or higher, live on a tribal reservation, not attend a Bureau-funded or public school for the participating school year, and meet state program requirements. The education savings account program allows students to receive a grant from the state for educational expenses controlled by a parent until graduation or age 21. A parent is defined as a guardian, custodian, or other responsible person. The education savings account program allows students to receive a grant from the state for educational expenses controlled by a parent, guardian, or other person with authority to act on behalf of the student, who is a resident of the same state."
