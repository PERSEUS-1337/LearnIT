    "content": "In 2015, large trucks were involved in over 400,000 crashes in the U.S., causing injuries in nearly 100,000 cases and fatalities in around 3,600. The U.S. Department of Transportation, specifically the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, regulates safety practices for commercial motor carriers and drivers. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sets vehicle safety standards for an industry with over 500,000 motor carriers. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) oversee truck safety in the U.S. There are around 35,000 new carriers entering the industry annually, with 10,000 carriers and drivers facing FMCSA enforcement actions each year. Federal and state agents conduct over 3.5 million roadside inspections of trucks and buses annually. Freight rates and economic matters are not federally regulated. Truck safety regulations impact the profitability of companies and livelihoods of drivers. Analysts predict a significant increase in trucking activity due to economic growth. This could lead to more truck crashes despite safety technologies being developed. The report reviews heavy truck safety trends and FMCSA's role in promoting safety in the industry. It addresses issues related to motor carriers, vehicles, and commercial drivers. The crash rate for large trucks has declined over time, but typically rises during economic growth periods. The crash rate for large trucks increased from 2010-2014 after historic lows in 2007-2009. In 2014, the crash rate was still below pre-2007 levels. The number of people killed in crashes involving large trucks increased by 4% from 2014 to 2015. It is uncertain if the fatality rate per million vehicle miles traveled also increased. Only additional data will determine if the long-term decline in truck crash rates has ended, potentially indicating a decrease in safety performance. The fatal crash rate has remained steady, while rates of crashes with injuries and property damages have increased. Most fatalities in large truck crashes are occupants of other vehicles, mainly passenger vehicles. Safety improvements in cars, like more airbags, may be reducing fatalities in truck-car collisions. A study found that two-thirds of commercial truck crashes are caused by other drivers, not the commercial driver. Critics question the validity of this finding, as crashes between commercial and noncommercial vehicles often result in more fatalities for noncommercial drivers. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) was established by Congress in 1999 to regulate commercial vehicles and drivers engaged in interstate commerce. Critics argue that commercial drivers are involved in more crashes with noncommercial drivers, leading to an overestimation of noncommercial driver involvement in crashes. FMCSA's responsibilities include creating and enforcing safety rules and regulations for motor carriers, commercial vehicles, and drivers. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) has greater authority over commercial vehicles and drivers engaged in interstate commerce compared to those operating within a single state. Intrastate commercial transportation is generally regulated by states, with Congress setting age requirements for interstate commercial drivers. FMCSA indirectly influences intrastate carriers by encouraging states to adopt relevant laws. The FMCSA reviews trucking companies for compliance with federal requirements and audits safety practices. It relies on state law enforcement for roadside safety inspections. Congress mandated FMCSA to prioritize safety and develop a long-term strategy for improving commercial vehicle safety. FMCSA publishes updated strategic plans periodically and submits annual implementation plans to Congress. In 1999, Congress established safety requirements for new entrants to the motor carrier industry, including safety audits and minimum standards. In 2015, Congress tightened these requirements, directing audits within 12 months of entry. New entrants may be required to pass an exam on federal safety standards. The FMCSA has observed that new entrants to the motor carrier industry have lower compliance rates with safety requirements compared to experienced carriers. With over 35,000 firms entering the industry annually, a percentage of carriers go out of business between months 12 and 18, leading to increased audit workload for FMCSA. In response to a petition, FMCSA is considering requiring new entrants to pass an exam on federal safety standards. In September 2009, FMCSA's Motor Carrier Safety Advisory Committee recommended steps to ensure new entrant motor carriers are knowledgeable about safety requirements, including testing. The Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance suggested studying the costs and benefits of expanding the new entrant safety assurance program to include intrastate carriers. Congress may lack the authority to require states to conduct safety audits for intrastate carriers, but it could provide incentives for states to do so. In 1956, Congress set limits for the size and weight of motor vehicles on certain parts of the road network, impacting the costs of freight transportation. This has been a contentious issue as some states had already set limits allowing larger trucks than the federal limit. States determine size and weight limits for vehicles on roads not subject to federal limits, with calls to increase limits typically coming from the industry to boost productivity. However, opposition from highway safety groups and concerns about increased wear and tear on infrastructure are common. Some in the trucking industry also oppose heavier vehicles due to potential cost advantages for companies using them. Companies using larger vehicles have a cost advantage over those using smaller ones, leading competitors to invest in new equipment. Federal weight limits have remained unchanged since 1974, but Congress has granted waivers for certain vehicles in recent years. Truck length regulations apply on the National Network, with some exceptions for twin 33-foot trailers. In 2015, a provision was inserted into an appropriations bill to increase the maximum allowable length of trailers hauled in tandem on the National Network from 28 feet each to 33 feet each. Industry representatives argued for longer trucks to reduce freight costs, while opponents raised safety concerns. Data on the safety impact of 33-foot double trailers was lacking, and an analysis found they could cause additional pavement damage. A study on the potential impact of longer trailers on pavement performance found they could increase road damage and life-cycle costs. Fatal crashes involving large trucks often result from passenger vehicles rear-ending them, leading to head injuries. Despite regulations requiring underride guards on trucks, they have not been effective in preventing vehicles from going under the truck. The Institute for Highway Safety studied 115 crashes involving passenger vehicles rear-ending heavy trucks. About 80% of these crashes involved the passenger vehicle going under the rear of the truck, resulting in severe underride damage. Improved underride guards exceeding NHTSA regulations have been developed by some trailer manufacturers, possibly influenced by Canada's stricter standards. Electronic stability control technology helps drivers maintain control in challenging conditions. The NHTSA mandated electronic stability control for trucks over 26,000 pounds to prevent crashes and fatalities. They also proposed speed limiting devices for all heavy trucks to save lives annually. The proposal to require heavy vehicles to be equipped with speed limiters is supported by the American Trucking Associations and highway safety advocates. It is opposed by the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, citing unproven safety benefits and increased crash risks. Most heavy trucks already have technology for speed limiting, so a universal installation requirement would impact truck owners financially. Installing speed limiters on all trucks would have the most significant financial impact on owners of older trucks, who are often independent operators. Truck drivers, who are typically paid by the mile, face various constraints on how many miles they can drive, including speed limits, hours-of-service rules, and delays in loading and unloading cargo. These regulations conflict with drivers' financial incentives to drive more miles and earn more income. One solution to this issue is to change the driver's behavior. In 2015, DOT proposed changing driver incentives by allowing payment for on-duty time not spent driving. This provision was not included in the reauthorization legislation passed by Congress that year. In December 2016, FMCSA issued a final rule on training requirements for entry-level commercial drivers. FMCSA will certify completion of a course for CDL applicants, allowing state agencies to conduct skills tests. The new rule, effective February 2020, removed the 30-hour behind-the-wheel training requirement for new drivers. Skills proficiency will now be assessed by an instructor and state official during the test. The impact of behind-the-wheel training on new driver safety performance is uncertain. Improvements in vehicles and highway design have reduced truck crashes, but driver safety remains a challenge. Fatigue is a key factor in truck safety, leading to limitations on driving hours set by the FMCSA. Commercial drivers under the Hours of Service rule can drive a maximum of 11 hours in a 24-hour period. Commercial drivers are limited to driving a maximum of 11 hours in a 24-hour period and cannot be on duty for more than 14 hours. They are also restricted to driving for no more than 60 hours in a week, with a 34-hour break required to restart the work cycle. Recent regulations have focused on the \"34-hour restart\" provision, which now requires a consecutive 34-hour off-duty period covering two 1 a.m.-5 a.m. periods and can only be used once in a 168-hour span to reduce driver fatigue and promote highway safety. The amended rule aimed to reduce driver fatigue and promote highway safety by requiring a 34-hour restart period to cover two 1 a.m.-5 a.m. periods, allowing drivers to get more restorative sleep during the night hours. This change was made to prevent drivers from working up to 82 hours over a seven-day period, which was deemed insufficient rest. The 2013 changes to the restart rule aimed to reduce driver fatigue by requiring a 34-hour restart period to include two 1 a.m.-5 a.m. periods for more restorative sleep. Critics argued that the costs were higher than estimated, leading to increased congestion during daytime traffic hours. Congress suspended enforcement of the rule pending a study on its costs and benefits. The cost-benefit study mandated in the FY2015 DOT appropriations act did not find a net benefit from the two suspended provisions of the restart rule. FMCSA requires drivers to keep records of their hours of service to enforce the rule and deter driving while fatigued. To address driver fatigue, Congress mandated electronic logging devices (ELDs) for commercial drivers subject to hours-of-service rules. The ELDs track driving hours and prevent companies from harassing drivers. FMCSA issued a final rule on ELDs in 2015 with a two-year phase-in period, effective December 2017. Sleep apnea can cause fatigue by disrupting sleep with breathing issues. Sleep apnea is associated with a higher risk of highway crashes and health problems like high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. Risk factors include obesity, male gender, advancing age, large neck size, small throat, and family history. FMCSA can disqualify commercial drivers with obstructive sleep apnea. FMCSA regulations require commercial drivers to undergo an annual examination by an authorized physician to determine medical fitness. Sleep apnea is listed as a respiratory condition that may affect a driver's ability to drive safely. FMCSA aims to strengthen guidance for medical examiners to be alert for sleep apnea, with obesity being a key criterion. Studies show that 80% of individuals with a BMI of 35 or higher have sleep apnea. In 2011, FMCSA recommended testing drivers with a BMI of 35 or higher for sleep apnea. However, the proposed guidance was later withdrawn, and in 2013, Congress mandated formal rulemaking for screening commercial vehicle operators for sleep disorders. In 2016, FMCSA began considering requiring all commercial drivers to be screened for sleep disorders. The Federal Railroad Administration is considering requiring screening for obstructive sleep apnea in commercial drivers to eliminate medical examiner discretion. Alcohol or drug impairment is a minor factor in large truck crashes, but the consequences can be significant due to vehicle size. Commercial drivers have stricter impairment standards, with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.04 considered impaired. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) sets strict regulations for commercial drivers regarding alcohol and drug use. Drivers can be disqualified for driving under the influence or refusing drug and alcohol tests. Motor carriers must review drivers' test status at hiring and conduct tests before employment, after a crash, with reasonable suspicion, and randomly. In 1999, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended FMCSA develop a database to track test results and refusals. The FMCSA was recommended to develop a database to track drug and alcohol test results and refusals for commercial drivers. Congress directed the establishment of a national database in 2012, with the final rule issued in December 2016. The database is set to become operational in 2020. Federal regulations prohibit commercial drivers from texting or using handheld phones while driving, with researchers highlighting the cognitive distraction of conversations as the primary risk. Since 2010, FMCSA has used roadside inspections and crash data to rank carriers' safety performance and identify high-risk carriers for enforcement actions. Driver distraction laws are difficult to enforce, especially for drivers above patrol cars. Crashes may make drivers hesitant to admit violations. The Safety Measurement System (SMS) targets high-risk carriers with compliance and enforcement interventions. The Safety Measurement System (SMS) assesses carriers' safety performance through various interventions, including warning letters and Safety Fitness Determination ratings. However, issues with data availability and quality limit the system's effectiveness in predicting crashes for carriers with few trucks and limited inspections. This results in unreliable percentile rankings or rankings with a large margin of error. The Safety Measurement System (SMS) assesses carriers' safety performance through various interventions, including warning letters and Safety Fitness Determination ratings. However, issues with data availability and quality limit the system's effectiveness in predicting crashes for carriers with few trucks and limited inspections. GAO found that FMCSA unjustifiably identified many carriers as high risk due to unrepresentative results, suggesting limiting carriers with more information could better identify high-risk carriers and allocate resources efficiently. Data in the SMS comes from FMCSA inspectors and state safety personnel, with varying stringency and thoroughness in activities. In 2014, GAO found that most regulations used to calculate SMS scores are not violated frequently enough to determine their association with crash risk. FMCSA has reduced interventions over time, with 26% fewer investigations in FY2015 compared to FY2012. This change was made to focus on reviewing carriers' safety practices to address underlying safety issues. FMCSA aims to improve safety continuously. FMCSA aims to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of safety interventions, but GAO reported limitations in the design and methodology of their effectiveness model. The model does not assess individual intervention types, hindering FMCSA's ability to evaluate their effectiveness. Additionally, FMCSA lacks current cost estimates for interventions, limiting their ability to assess efficiency. The Safety Fitness Determination process is resource-intensive and reaches only a small portion of the industry annually, allowing carriers to receive ratings below \"safe.\" The National Transportation Safety Board recommended changes to the Safety Fitness Determination process, including using SMS rating scores and allowing FMCSA to rate carriers as \"unsatisfactory\" based on driver and vehicle performance data. FMCSA proposed amendments in January 2016, but no schedule for the next stage of rulemaking has been determined. Congress passed a surface transportation reauthorization act in December 2015 that directed the National Research Council to study the CSA program and FMCSA to give credit for improved SMS percentiles to carriers. The FMCSA was directed by Congress to implement safety measures in the SMS, remove carrier percentile rankings from public view, ensure accurate data input for the CSA program, and review treatment of preventable crashes. FMCSA's regulatory agenda is influenced by new laws and court decisions, with 13 rulemakings in progress as of December 2016. Concerns have been raised about the agency's slow regulatory progress. In the FAST Act, Congress directed FMCSA to complete outstanding rulemakings required by statute before starting new ones. FMCSA is also initiating 20 new rulemakings, including changes to truck safety grant programs, alternative drug testing methods, easier access to commercial driver's licenses for veterans, and exemptions for specialized vehicles from commercial regulations."
