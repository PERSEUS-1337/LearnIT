    "content": "One popular avenue of inquiry is mapping machine learning algorithms into realistic circuit implementations to understand biological learning. The focus is on learning in recurrent networks and evaluating learning algorithms in terms of their biological plausibility. It is suggested to identify core computational building blocks necessary for solving temporal credit assignment. In a principled framework for evaluating biological plausibility in recurrent networks, the focus is on solving temporal credit assignment. Novel solutions are proposed to address common issues across algorithms, such as representing the Jacobian of network dynamics. Biologically realistic approximations are validated to solve temporal credit assignment in synthetic tasks. The text discusses the computation of neural network outputs using firing rates updated in continuous time, with methods like BPTT and RTRL for gradient descent. It also mentions the focus on solving temporal credit assignment in recurrent networks for biological plausibility. The text discusses new online algorithms for neural networks, including RTRL, which updates an \"influence tensor\" to preserve long-term dependencies. These algorithms use tensor structures to summarize inter-temporal dependencies and avoid explicit network unrolling. The text discusses new online algorithms for neural networks, focusing on tensor structures and update equations. It explores the implementation challenges in biological neural networks and the encoding of vectors and matrices. The text discusses challenges in implementing neural networks in biological systems, focusing on encoding vectors and matrices as firing rates or synaptic strengths. Matrix-matrix multiplication is not feasible due to biological limitations, but independent additive noise can be leveraged for computation. Maintaining a \"noisy\" copy of the network for perturbation effects may be challenging, but there are potential workarounds. RFLO is simple but may not solve temporal credit assignment effectively. Other algorithms fail in different ways, such as matrix-matrix products in updates or awkward time-continuity requirements. Each algorithm presents its own challenges. The Jacobian is a recurring problem for credit assignment in algorithms. A proposed solution is to use an approximate Jacobian with perceptron-like learning rules. This approximation allows neural circuits to access their own Jacobian for learning purposes. The matrix-matrix-vector product in DNI can be implemented separately from the forward pass. The intermediate result must be represented as a firing rate to pass through the second matrix, requiring altering the original equations. A separate voltage u (t+1) m could drive neural firing in specific \"update\" phases. Branch-specific gating can filter information to drive spiking. RFLO and DNI(b) remain as viable candidates for neural learning with approximate Jacobian. Neural learning methods RFLO and DNI(b) are evaluated empirically, along with exact credit assignment methods BPTT and RTRL, on synthetic tasks involving temporal credit assignment. The tasks include mapping Bernoulli inputs to outputs with adjustable lags for task difficulty and reproducing responses of a separate RNN. Training loss for RFLO and DNI is worse than optimal solutions, but both outperform fixed-W algorithm. The loss for RFLO and DNI is worse than optimal solutions (BPTT and RTRL), but both beat the fixed-W performance lower bound. DNI(b) performs worse than original DNI due to further approximations, but still better than the fixed-W baseline. This shows that solving temporal credit assignment is possible within biological constraints, although the neural circuits' sophisticated learning mechanisms remain unclear. The study focuses on finding biologically sensible approximations to RTRL and BPTT, demonstrating that accessing the Jacobian for learning is achievable using a set of synapses trained to linearly approximate the network's own. Learning is possible through synapses trained to approximate a network's dynamics. Neural circuits require additional infrastructure to support learning, such as extra neurons and compartments. Implementing learning equations in parallel to the forward pass is challenging due to the high neural hardware usage. Connecting machine learning algorithms with biology can help understand the computational roles of complex circuit features. Implementing learning equations in parallel to the forward pass is challenging due to high neural hardware usage. Outsourcing update equations to separate neurons may not drive synaptic plasticity locally. RFLO or DNI solutions are contrived guesses at how neural circuits learn, but provide insights into biological learning. This work offers a blueprint for evaluating computational models as explanations for biological neural networks, aiding in the study of machine learning. Understanding the biological details necessary for implementing machine learning algorithms is crucial for studying ML algorithms in a biological context."
