    "content": "The Community Services Block Grant, originating from President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, aimed to empower local communities to address their unique barriers to poverty through a Community Action Program. Residents would identify needs and develop plans with support from government and private resources. The Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 established a network of local Community Action Agencies overseen by the Office of Economic Opportunity. President Johnson signed the act into law, leading to the creation of about 1,000 agencies. The modern-day program, Community Services Block Grant (CSBG), continues to fund these agencies. The report provides background information, legislative history, and details on how CSBG funds are used and who is served. It also discusses recent funding for CSBG. The CSBG Program, administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, provides federal funds to states, territories, and Indian tribes for antipoverty activities. The program dates back to 1964 and recent funding, as well as legislative proposals, are discussed. Appendices show historical funding and GAO reviews. The CSBG program, established in 1964 under the Economic Opportunity Act, aims to combat poverty by involving low-income individuals in community antipoverty activities. Community Action Agencies (CAAs) play a key role in administering the program at the local level. The program was initially under the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) and later transitioned to the Community Services Administration (CSA) before being replaced by the CSBG in 1981 under HHS administration. The CSBG Act was enacted in 1981 to replace the CSA and consolidate various social service programs into block grants to states. It was reauthorized multiple times, with appropriations expiring in FY2003. Appropriations for CSBG and related programs expired in FY2003, but funds have been appropriated annually since then. Reauthorization legislation was passed in the 108th Congress but not enacted. Similar bills in the 109th, 113th, and 114th Congresses did not progress. Various national activities like CED, RCF, and IDAs receive separate appropriations to aid low-income communities with economic development. The CSBG Act provides block grants to assist low-income communities with economic development, rural housing, water management, and asset development for individuals. Funding for related activities like CED, RCF, and IDAs has been consistent since FY2011. HHS reserves a portion of funds for training, technical assistance, and administrative activities, with a set-aside for state or local entities and outlying territories. The CSBG Act provides block grants to assist low-income communities with economic development, rural housing, water management, and asset development for individuals. Congress typically specifies annual appropriations for the block grant and related activities. Block grant funds are allocated among states based on FY1981 amounts, with the option for Indian tribes to receive funds directly. CSBG funds aim to impact poverty causes measurably. The CSBG Act provides block grants to assist low-income communities with economic development, housing, water management, and asset development. States must submit a plan to HHS outlining activities to help individuals achieve self-sufficiency, find employment, attain education, manage income, secure housing, and participate in community affairs. Funds must also address youth needs, coordinate with welfare reform efforts, and provide emergency food services. States designated a lead agency to develop the state application and plan for the CSBG Act. They must allocate at least 90% of their federal allotment to local eligible entities, with the option to use up to $55,000 or 5% for administrative costs. The remaining funds can be used for training, technical assistance, coordination activities, and supporting programs for low-income individuals. Additionally, states can use some funds to offset revenue losses from state charity tax credits. States must pass through at least 90% of their federal block grant allotments to eligible entities, primarily Community Action Agencies. The distribution of funds is at the state's discretion, but funding cannot be terminated or reduced disproportionately without cause. There are over 1,000 eligible entities, mostly private nonprofit organizations, that provide various services. Once designated, an agency retains its status unless it voluntarily withdraws or is terminated for cause. The Community Services Block Grant program requires eligible entities, primarily Community Action Agencies, to be monitored and visited regularly. States can only select a public agency if no qualified private nonprofit organization is available. Each entity is governed by a board of directors with representation from the low-income community, local elected officials, and other community interests. Community Action Agencies (CAAs) funded by the Community Services Block Grant program offer a variety of services tailored to local community needs, such as emergency assistance, home weatherization, youth and senior activities, transportation, credit counseling, domestic violence support, parenting education, food pantries, and more. These agencies also provide information and referral services for job training and vocational education based on individual client needs. Community Action Agencies (CAAs) funded by the Community Services Block Grant program offer various services tailored to local community needs, including emergency assistance, home weatherization, youth and senior activities, transportation, credit counseling, domestic violence support, parenting education, and food pantries. Additionally, CAAs may receive federal funds from other sources and administer programs like Head Start and energy assistance. The CSBG Act has authorized related activities funded and administered through the Office of Community Services (OCS) within HHS, targeting specific populations like migrant farmworkers and individuals experiencing homelessness. Many of these related activities no longer receive funding, with some not being funded for years. The Community Economic Development (CED) program, along with the Rural Community Facilities (RCF) program, have been funded consistently since FY1982. Another program, Individual Development Accounts (IDAs), was funded from 1998 until FY2017. CED supports local community development corporations to create employment opportunities for low-income residents. The Community Economic Development (CED) program supports projects in areas with high poverty rates, unemployment, and socioeconomic distress. In FY2016, HHS funded 39 grants, but funding was reduced in FY2017. Information on FY2017 grantees is not available. The Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI) receives approximately $10 million per year from the CED appropriation to address the lack of affordable healthy food in urban and rural communities. HHS partners with USDA and Treasury to provide a total of $400 million for this initiative, funding projects like grocery stores and farmers markets in low-income areas. Legislation authorizing the program was passed in the 2014 \"farm bill\" (P.L. 113-79). The USDA Rural Community Facilities (RCF) funds provide grants for rural housing and community development projects, including home repair, water facilities management, and low-income rental housing units. The Obama Administration proposed to terminate RCF from FY2010 to FY2017, suggesting that water treatment facilities assistance is available through larger EPA programs and USDA loans and grants. The FY2018 Trump Administration budget proposed to eliminate funding for RCF, stating that \"services provided are duplicative of other federal programs.\" Congress has continued to provide funding for this program despite Administration requests to stop funding RCF. HHS supported eight grants in FY2016, with one contract and one interagency agreement. In FY2017, the department expected to support eight grants, one contract, and one interagency agreement. HHS expected no program activity in FY2018 due to the program's proposed termination. The Assets for Independence Act, which encouraged low-income individuals to save through Individual Development Accounts (IDAs), expired in FY2003. Congress continued to fund the program until FY2016, but did not provide funding in FY2017. IDAs are savings accounts for specific purposes like buying a home or paying for college, with matched contributions and financial counseling. Grants are given to organizations to conduct the program, with a maximum federal grant of $1 million per year. The IDA program, which supports Individual Development Accounts for low-income individuals, received funding until FY2016 but was not funded in FY2017. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to reauthorize IDAs at a level of $75 million annually through FY2022. Data on the programs and people served by CSBG local eligible entities are captured in CSBG Annual Reports. The National Association for State Community Services Programs (NASCSP) collects data on CSBG through surveys of states, DC, and Puerto Rico. The most recent CSBG Annual Report from FY2015 shows a network of 1,026 local eligible entities, including Community Action Agencies, local government agencies, tribes, and migrant organizations, spending $13.6 billion with funding from various sources. In FY2015, local eligible entities spent $13.6 billion on various activities. Funding sources included federal CSBG allotment ($637 million), federal programs other than CSBG ($8.3 billion), state governments ($1.7 billion), private agencies ($1.5 billion), and local governments ($1.5 billion). Volunteer hours were valued at $298 million. Activities funded included emergency services, self-sufficiency promotion, community linkages, education, employment, housing, nutrition, income management, and health services. In FY2015, local eligible entities spent $13.6 billion on various activities, with funding from federal programs other than CSBG accounting for the bulk of funds. More than half of the funding was dedicated to Head Start or energy assistance, with 35% coming from Head Start or Early Head Start. LIHEAP fuel assistance made up 15% of federal funds spent, while Agriculture Department nutrition programs accounted for nearly 10%. Non-CSBG funds from various federal programs accounted for the majority of funding in FY2015. The CSBG network provided services to 15.6 million individuals in 6.5 million families, with over 70% having incomes at or below federal poverty guidelines. Nearly half of the families reported income from employment, and almost 88% included a worker, unemployed job-seeker, or retired worker. In FY2015, the CSBG network served 15.6 million individuals in 6.5 million families, with over 70% living at or below the federal poverty guidelines. Almost half of the families had children, with 58% headed by a single mother. The survey found that 37% of individuals served were children age 17 or younger, and 21% were age 55 or older. About 57% were white, 26% were African American, and 19% reported their ethnicity as Hispanic or Latino. Barriers to self-sufficiency included 27% without health insurance, 18% with disabilities, and 33% of adults older than 24 without a high school diploma. As of the date of this report, FY2018 funding for CSBG has been provided through continuing resolutions at FY2017 levels with a 0.6791% rescission. The Administration proposed to eliminate funding for CSBG, CED, and RCF, with IDAs receiving zero funding. HHS budget justifications cited constrained budget environment for funding decisions. The House Appropriations Committee approved a bill to fund LHHS on July 24, 2017. The House Appropriations Committee approved a bill on July 24, 2017 (H.R. 3358) to reduce funding for CSBG to $600 million, CED to $10 million, and maintain RCF funding at $7.5 million. The bill also excluded funding for IDAs. The full House passed a bill on August 16, 2017 (H.R. 3354) with the same funding levels for CSBG and related programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill on September 7, 2017 (S. 1771) to reduce CSBG funding by $15 million to $700 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee report (S.Rept. 115-150) proposes reducing CSBG funding by $15 million to $700 million, while maintaining funding for CED and RCF at approximately $20 million and $7.5 million, respectively. IDAs would receive no funding. The report emphasizes prioritizing CED funds for rural communities to improve services for low-income individuals and families. In FY2017, Congress allocated over $742 million for CSBG and related activities. Funding for CED was reduced from $30 million to $20 million in FY2016, while funding for RCF increased by $1 million to $7.5 million. IDAs received no funding for the first time since 1998. The House Appropriations Committee proposed level funding for IDAs at $19 million in FY2017. The House committee also recommended increasing funding for Rural Community Facilities by $1 million. The House committee proposed increasing spending for CSBG and related activities by $1 million in FY2017, totaling $771 million compared to $770 million in FY2016. Concerns were expressed about block grant funds not reaching local agencies promptly, urging HHS to ensure timely allocation and engage with stakeholders on data collection. Funding for CED was continued despite the Obama Administration's proposal to eliminate it, with a requirement that 75% of jobs created be filled by low-income individuals.

Funding for CED was continued despite the Obama Administration's proposal to eliminate it, with a requirement that 75% of jobs created be filled by low-income individuals. The committee also maintained and increased funding for RCF, emphasizing the program's importance for small rural communities not eligible for larger programs. Additionally, the committee required the Secretary to issue performance standards for states and territories receiving block grant funds, with implementation and reporting deadlines set for September 30, 2017. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $715 million for the block grant in the FY2017 Labor-HHS-ED spending bill, aligning with the House recommendation and FY2016 levels. No funding was allocated for related activities, as the committee deemed CED and RCF similar to programs in other departments. The committee did not recommend further funding for IDAs, which began as a demonstration program in 1998. Legislative language requested by the Obama Administration regarding issuance and implementation was not included in the bill. The Obama Administration requested legislative language related to performance standards for states and territories in the FY2017 budget, but it was not included in the Senate's appropriations bill. The requested amount for the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) was $693 million, with no funding for CED or RCF, and level funding for IDAs. This amount was the same as FY2015 but $41 million less than FY2016. The Obama Administration requested legislative language in the FY2017 budget to establish national standards for CSBG and allow states to exceed the 5% cap on administrative costs for data system modernization. Authorization for CSBG expired in FY2003, with no reauthorization attempts until 2014. In the 113th and 114th Congresses, legislation was introduced in the House to reauthorize CSBG and related activities. Representative Fitzpatrick introduced the Community Economic Opportunity Act in both Congresses, but no further action was taken on the bills. H.R. 1655, referred to the House Education and the Workforce Committee, aimed to make significant changes in language throughout the statute related to the roles and responsibilities of federal, state, and local agencies in distributing and monitoring federal funds. The bill included provisions for establishing performance requirements, increasing accountability, and authorizing appropriations of $850 million per year for FY2014-FY2018. The bill, authorized for FY2019-FY2023, would have increased funding for training and technical assistance. State allocations would have been adjusted, with a higher minimum allotment and the elimination of certain provisions from current law. States would have been required to reserve a portion of block grant funds for Community Action. The bill, authorized for FY2019-FY2023, would have required states to reserve 2% of block grant funds for a new Community Action Innovations Program. These funds would support innovative projects to reduce poverty and could be used for nonfederal matching requirements. State and local plans would require approval from the Secretary under H.R. 1655, allowing waivers for income eligibility levels. H.R. 1655 allows states to increase income eligibility levels for CSBG activities without waivers. It prioritizes Community Action Agencies and restricts public agencies from being designated as eligible entities. Merger of local entities is allowed with state approval. H.R. 1655 allows states to approve mergers and privatization proposals for agencies eligible for Merger Incentive Funds. It retains provisions for religious organizations' participation in CSBG-funded activities without discrimination based on their religious character. The bill H.R. 1655 allows states to approve mergers and privatization proposals for agencies eligible for Merger Incentive Funds, while also prohibiting discrimination by religious organizations providing assistance under the CSBG Act. It would authorize necessary funds for Community Economic Development and Rural Community Facilities from FY2014-FY2023, eliminating the requirement to set aside 9% of total appropriations for related activities. Additional funding information is provided in Appendix A. The funding information for Community Services Block Grants and related activities is detailed in tables showing amounts distributed from FY2013 to FY2017. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report in July 2006 on the CSBG program, focusing on program monitoring and training compliance. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the Office of Community Services (OCS) lacked effective policies and controls to ensure compliance with monitoring requirements for states receiving grants. OCS failed to issue mandated reports to states and Congress, lacked financial expertise in monitoring teams, lost documentation from visits, and was not systematic in selecting states to visit. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the Office of Community Services (OCS) did not effectively target its monitoring resources on states at highest risk of management problems. GAO visited five states and found wide variation in on-site monitoring frequency of local grantees. States had differing interpretations of the requirement to visit local grantees at least once in a three-year period, with no guidance from OCS. States reported varying capacities for on-site monitoring due to staff shortages, but all performed other forms of oversight. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the Office of Community Services (OCS) did not effectively target its monitoring resources on states at highest risk of management problems. OCS coordinated local oversight with other federal and state programs, using state associations of Community Action Agencies for technical assistance. GAO recommended OCS conduct a risk-based assessment of states and establish policies for strategic allocation of training and technical assistance funds. The Office of Community Services (OCS) did not effectively target monitoring resources on states at highest risk of management problems. Recommendations included conducting a risk-based assessment of states, issuing guidance for compliance with monitoring requirements, and implementing a strategic plan for training and technical assistance. HHS responded by issuing guidance to states on compliance and conducting on-site reviews of eligible entities. HHS issued guidance to states for compliance with monitoring requirements and conducted on-site reviews of eligible entities, selecting states based on vulnerability, size, poverty levels, past audit problems, and client numbers. HHS developed a CSBG state assessment tool to assist states in federal monitoring and issued a strategic plan for the program in 2007. Funding for economic development training and capacity building began in FY2009, with a new strategy for excellence announced in 2011."
