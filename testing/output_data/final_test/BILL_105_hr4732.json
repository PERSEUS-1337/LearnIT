    "content": "SECTION 1. TREATMENT OF BONDS ISSUED TO FINANCE ELECTRIC OUTPUT FACILITIES. Section 141 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a new subsection regarding bonds for electric output facilities. The determination of whether pre-effective date electric output facility bonds are private activity bonds is to be made without considering any competitive actions taken by the issuer. The term 'pre-effective date electric output facility bond' refers to a bond issued before the enactment of the Comprehensive Electricity Competition Act, used for an electric output facility, and not classified as a private activity bond as of the enactment date. The term 'permissible competitive actions' refers to actions taken by an issuer after the enactment of the Comprehensive Electricity Competition Act regarding transmission property owned by the issuer, subject to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission orders for open access to transmission facilities. The Comprehensive Electricity Competition Act allows issuers to take permissible competitive actions related to generation or distribution property if they implement retail competition or enter into contracts for electricity sale or distribution. The issuer must implement retail competition under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act before the bonds become effective. References to the Comprehensive Electricity Competition Act are treated as references to similar laws. Bonds issued after the enactment of the comprehensive act. The amendment made by this section applies to bonds issued as part of an issue where the proceeds are used for electric output facilities other than small distribution property operating at 69 kilovolts or less. The amendment made by this section applies to obligations issued on or after the date of the enactment of the Comprehensive Electricity Competition Act. The treatment of pre-effective date bonds will take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act. Refunding bonds are not subject to certain provisions for qualified refunding bonds. The term \"qualified refunding bond\" refers to a bond issued to refund a pre-effective date electric output facility bond, with specific conditions regarding maturity, amount, and use of proceeds. The net proceeds of the refunding bond must be used to redeem the refunded bond within 90 days of the refunding bond issuance. SEC. 2 amends section 468A of the Internal Revenue Code to limit the amount a taxpayer can pay into a fund for nuclear decommissioning costs. This amendment applies to taxable years starting after the enactment of the Act."
