Temporal difference models (TDMs) combine model-free and model-based RL for efficient learning with high performance. Temporal Difference Models (TDMs) offer efficient learning with high performance in reinforcement learning tasks, surpassing direct model-based methods. TDMs show significant improvement in efficiency compared to state-of-the-art model-based and model-free methods on continuous control tasks. Deep RL algorithms, when combined with rich function approximators like deep neural networks, can achieve impressive results in various tasks, but often require a large amount of experience to be effective. This limitation hinders their application in real-world problems where direct experience on a physical system is necessary. Model-based RL algorithms learn system dynamics to achieve near-optimal behavior through planning, providing more supervision than model-free methods. While model-based algorithms are more efficient, they may have larger asymptotic bias and produce suboptimal policies when dynamics cannot be learned perfectly. Model-free methods are less efficient but can achieve the best asymptotic performance. In this paper, the search for methods that combine the efficiency of model-based learning with the optimal performance of model-free learning is explored. Various techniques have been attempted to bridge the gap between these two approaches, such as synthetic experience generation and layering model-free learning on model-based estimation residuals. The goal is to smoothly transition from learning models to learning policies, gaining rich supervision from each sample to quickly reach proficiency while still converging to an unbiased solution. Goal-conditioned value functions combine model-free and model-based reinforcement learning by predicting the value function for every possible goal state, allowing for learning variable-horizon goal-conditioned value functions. This method provides insight into the underlying \"physics\" of reaching different states from the current state. The text chunk discusses a new RL algorithm that connects model-based and model-free learning to develop a goal-conditioned value function called a temporal difference model (TDM). This TDM can be efficiently learned and used with an MPC-like method to achieve desired tasks, with competitive sample complexities compared to model-based RL. Our method achieves better sample complexity than fully model-free learning on continuous control tasks and outperforms purely model-based methods in final performance. The connection between model-based and model-free learning may lead to future methods. Reinforcement learning formalism, temporal difference Q-learning methods, model-based RL methods, and goal-conditioned value functions are introduced in this section to develop temporal difference models (TDMs) in the next section. RL deals with decision-making problems involving state space, action space, transition dynamics, and reward functions. The learner is guided by a reward function in reinforcement learning tasks, aiming to maximize the expected sum of rewards. Q-learning algorithms focus on learning a Q-function to estimate future rewards. This is achieved through off-policy stochastic gradient descent using transition tuples collected from the environment. The optimal policy is derived from the Q-function by selecting the action that maximizes the expected total reward in a given state. Model-based RL takes a different approach to maximize the expected reward by training a model to predict the next state. Model-predictive control (MPC) generates a new action plan at each time step and executes the first action before replanning. Model-based RL involves training a model to predict the next state. Model-predictive control (MPC) generates action plans at each time step. Goal-conditioned value functions address the limitation of task-specific Q-functions by conditioning on a task description vector. Various methods have been proposed in the literature for goal-conditioned value functions. Goal-conditioned value function methods, such as universal value functions and Horde, predict an agent's ability to reach a specific state. These functions are closely related to understanding the environment's physics and can be learned for any goal using Q-learning. By relabeling states with rewards for different goals, data can be augmented effectively for solving multi-goal tasks with delayed rewards. Goal-conditioned value functions, like temporal difference models (TDMs), offer a direct link to model-based RL. By relabeling past experiences with different goals, these functions can learn more efficiently. Setting the reward function as the state (G = S) creates a connection to model-based RL, enhancing the model-free approach. By setting the reward function as the state, a connection to model-based RL emerges. This allows for model-free learning of goal-conditioned value functions to produce an implicit model for MPC-based planning. However, this connection alone lacks long-horizon capability, which will be addressed in the next section. In the next section, the temporal difference model (TDM) extends the connection to long-horizon settings by introducing a planning horizon \u03c4 in the Q-learning recursion. This mechanism aggregates long-horizon rewards differently than traditional discounted sums, allowing for optimization with off-policy data. The Temporal Difference Model (TDM) extends Q-learning by introducing a planning horizon \u03c4, optimizing with off-policy data. TDM efficiently trains by resampling new goals and horizons for each tuple, providing supervision for every possible goal and horizon. It predicts how close the agent will get to a goal state after \u03c4 time steps and can be interpreted as Q-values in a finite-horizon MDP. TDM learning interpolates between model-based and model-free approaches, allowing incorporation into planning and control schemes at test time. The Temporal Difference Model (TDM) learning involves an interpolation between model-based and model-free learning, with \u03c4 representing the planning horizon. By optimizing over every Kth state and action, a correspondence to models can be recovered. However, this approach limits the multi-step formulation to terminal reward problems but allows for accommodating arbitrary reward functions on the terminal state. The Temporal Difference Model (TDM) can be trained with off-policy Q-learning algorithms like DQN, DDPG, NAF, and SDQN. It allows for data-efficient learning of short and long-horizon behaviors for arbitrary goal states. Design decisions are necessary to make TDM algorithms practical. The design decisions needed to make practical a TDM algorithm involve optimizing scalar rewards with Q-learning, but TDMs allow for increased supervision by using vector-valued rewards. By training a vector-valued Q-function that predicts per-dimension distance, the algorithm can learn distances along each dimension separately, leading to improved sample efficiency. Additionally, if the task reward depends only on certain state features, further improvements can be made to TDMs. In experiments, TDMs are trained for specific tasks like pushing and locomotion, predicting distances without considering all arm joints. The TDM optimal control formulation simplifies planning but requires solving a computationally expensive constrained optimization problem. A specific architectural decision in the Q-function design can eliminate the need for constrained optimization. The Q-function approximator for Q(s, a, s g , \u03c4 ) is defined as - f (s, a, s g , \u03c4 ) - s g , where f (s, a, s g , \u03c4 ) outputs a state vector. By training the Temporal Difference Model (TDM) with Q-learning, f (s, a, s g , \u03c4 ) predicts the state reached by a policy aiming for s g in \u03c4 steps. This allows for explicit Model Predictive Control (MPC) for action selection. The algorithm can act based on any terminal reward function r c, unlike prior methods. The algorithm can act based on any terminal reward function r c, using exploration and Q-function fitting. It resembles iterative model-based RL for continuous tasks, using DDPG. The computation cost is determined by the number of updates to fit the Q-function per transition. The algorithm uses a task reward function and a parameterized Q-function for model-free methods like DDPG. It involves noisy exploration, storing transitions in a replay buffer, relabeling time horizons and goal states, and optimizing the model. In real-world applications like robotics, data collection efficiency is crucial for learning. Combining model-based and model-free reinforcement learning techniques can benefit from acceleration in computation. Prior methods focused on combining these techniques, but our method proposes an equivalence between them through a generalization of goal-conditioned value function. This approach achieves better sample efficiency in challenging reinforcement learning tasks compared to model-free alternatives. Our method proposes an equivalence between model-based and model-free reinforcement learning techniques, achieving better sample efficiency in challenging tasks with nonlinear function approximation. Unlike previous works, we aim to maintain the favorable asymptotic performance of model-free RL while reducing sample complexity. The value function approaches like Horde and UVF can reuse off-policy data to learn rich contextual value functions. TDMs predict future steps similar to multi-step models but condition on a policy reaching a goal. A related UVF extension is hindsight experience replay (HER), which retroactively relabels past experience with different goal states. Our approach achieves better sample complexity than HER in complex continuous control tasks by connecting model-based and model-free learning, offering a more flexible use of the learned Q-function. Other methods like Predictions and UNREAL also aim to enhance supervision signals for model-free RL. Our experiments compare the sample efficiency and performance of Temporal Difference Models (TDMs) to model-based and model-free RL algorithms. We aim for the efficiency of model-based RL with less model bias and study key design decisions in TDMs. The comparison includes DDPG for model-free RL and a model-based component from a recent work for model-based RL. The comparison involves highly efficient learning with neural network dynamics models on five simulated tasks involving arm reaching, puck pushing, cheetah and ant movements, and goal position and velocity tasks. Tasks require long-horizon reasoning, handling contact discontinuities, and dealing with challenging dynamics. The ant position and velocity task presents challenges for traditional RL methods due to the difficulty in maintaining both desired position and velocity simultaneously. Testing TDMs on real-world tasks like robot arm reaching positions shows their applicability. TDMs are trained on specific components for different tasks, such as hand and puck XY-position for pushing task, and velocity of the cheetah for the half cheetah task. Results are detailed in the Appendix and compared to model-free methods. The results in Figure 2 show that the pure model-based method learns much faster than model-free baselines on all tasks, but performs worse on harder tasks due to model bias. TDMs learn quickly and achieve policies as good as or better than model-free policies, requiring fewer samples on ant tasks and drastically fewer on other tasks. Using HER does not improve performance with model-based and goal-conditioned value functions. Our model-free learning method is more sample-efficient than alternatives. The curr_chunk discusses the efficiency of model-free learning compared to model-based methods, specifically focusing on the performance of HER in solving sparse tasks. It highlights that HER outperforms DDPG-Sparse baseline in these tasks. The study concludes that TDMs converge as fast or faster than model-based learning while achieving similar or better final performance than model-free methods. The algorithm outperforms DDPG in learning with fewer samples on a 7-DoF Sawyer robotic arm, showing that TDMs can scale to real-world tasks. Two key design choices for TDMs are discussed: the tradeoffs between vectorized and scalar rewards, and the impact of different horizon values on learning speed. The paper also presents a novel RL algorithm connecting model-based and model-free reinforcement learning. The paper introduces a novel RL algorithm that bridges model-based and model-free reinforcement learning, improving sample efficiency. Temporal difference models act as goal-conditioned value functions and implicit dynamics models, achieving asymptotic performance comparable to model-free algorithms with sample complexity similar to model-based methods. The experiments focus on the new RL algorithm, highlighting potential future research directions. Future research directions include exploring how Temporal Difference Models (TDMs) can be integrated into constrained optimization methods for model-predictive control or trajectory optimization. Additionally, investigating the application of TDMs to complex state representations like images, where traditional distance metrics may not be effective, is another avenue for exploration. TDMs could also be extended to stochastic environments to predict expected distances between future and goal states. The goal is to combine the sample efficiency of model-free reinforcement learning with the performance of model-based methods. The goal is to combine the sample efficiency of model-free reinforcement learning with the performance of model-based methods in real-world applications like robotics and autonomous systems. Different strategies for sampling goal states during training can impact learning efficiency. In experiments, the first strategy slightly outperformed others for sampling goals from valid states. The horizon \u03c4 is randomly sampled between 0 and \u03c4 max. DDPG is used as the base off-policy model-free RL algorithm. Experience replay has 1 million transitions, and soft target networks use a polyak averaging coefficient. Learning rates for the critic and actor are chosen from {1e-4, 1e-3}. Adam is used as the base optimizer with a batch size of 128. Networks are parameterized with neural networks with ReLU hidden layers. The policies and networks are parameterized with neural networks with ReLU hidden activation and two hidden layers of size 300. The critic has no output activation except for TDM. The planning horizon \u03c4 is concatenated as an observation and represented as a single integer. The TDM reward function uses L1 norm for consistency. A neural network dynamics model with ReLU activation and two hidden units of size 300 is trained to predict the difference in state. The dynamics model is trained to predict the difference in state using mean squared error. A minibatch of size 128 is sampled from a replay buffer after each state observation for gradient descent. Normalization of states and actions is done using statistics from 20 rollouts. MPC simulates 512 random action sequences through the dynamics model, while TDMs focus on important hyperparameters like reward scale and number of updates per observation. The hyperparameters for TDMs include reward scale, \u03c4 max, and number of updates per observation. Larger values of updates per observation benefit TDMs, but there are diminishing returns and potential negative impacts due to overfitting. Baselines did not benefit much, except for HER which benefited from larger update values. Grid search was performed for model-free algorithms over reward scale and updates per observation ranges. Additionally, tuning was done for HER and TDMs on specific parameters like policy pre-tanh-activation weight and \u03c4 max values. The Q-function for TDMs is parameterized to predict negative distances, incorporating prior knowledge. It outputs non-positive values and learns a goal-conditioned model. Benchmark tasks are designed on MuJoCo physics simulator and OpenAI Gym environments for policy extraction. The tasks involve using different horizons for policy extraction. The state includes joint angles, velocities, and XYZ observations. Rewards are based on Euclidean distance between tip and target XYZ. Targets are randomly sampled at the start of each episode."
