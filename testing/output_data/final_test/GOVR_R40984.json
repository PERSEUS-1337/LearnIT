    "content": "On December 15, 2009, the EPA published a significant action on climate change, determining that greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles in the US contribute to endangerment. This requires the EPA to establish standards to control these emissions. The controversy is not about the likelihood of standards, as they align with fuel economy standards proposed by the Department of Transportation. The controversy surrounds the EPA's endangerment finding for greenhouse gases and upcoming motor vehicle emission standards, with objections raised about potential regulatory consequences. Critics argue that these consequences could impose unattainable air quality goals and unreasonable burdens on the EPA and regulated entities. This report examines whether these legal consequences would likely occur and assesses the EPA's legal leeway in expanding greenhouse gas regulations. The report assesses EPA's legal leeway to limit GHG regulation beyond new motor vehicles under section 202(a). It is important if Congress does not enact climate change legislation that puts regulation of emissions beyond the reach of some CAA provisions. The bill H.R. 2454 prohibits using certain sections of the Clean Air Act to regulate air pollutants based on their climate change impacts. It also restricts the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources and provides insight into EPA's authority to regulate GHGs beyond new motor vehicles. Part Four of the bill H.R. 2454 discusses the impact of an \"endangerment\" finding under the Clean Air Act, specifically focusing on the standards that must be followed. In 1999, organizations and states petitioned the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases emitted by new motor vehicles, citing CAA section 202(a) which addresses air pollutants that may endanger public health or welfare. In 1999, organizations and states petitioned the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases emitted by new motor vehicles under CAA section 202(a). EPA initially rejected the petition in 2003, citing lack of authority and political opposition. The federal appeals court upheld EPA's decision, but in 2007, the Supreme Court reversed it in Massachusetts v. EPA, finding in favor of regulating GHGs as air pollutants endangering public health and welfare. In 2007, the Supreme Court in Massachusetts v. EPA ruled that GHGs are considered \"air pollutants\" under the Clean Air Act, giving EPA the authority to regulate GHG emissions from new motor vehicles. The Court stated that EPA cannot avoid regulating GHGs based on policy considerations, but must determine if they contribute to climate change and endanger public health or welfare. The Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA did not mandate EPA to make a positive endangerment finding, but to address a petition to regulate vehicle GHGs correctly under the CAA. In 2009, EPA proposed an endangerment determination for GHGs from new motor vehicles and emission standards for GHGs from new light-duty vehicles. EPA finalized GHG monitoring rule for large stationary sources and proposed a \"tailoring rule.\" EPA's endangerment determination for GHGs from new motor vehicles includes findings on atmospheric levels and emissions contributing to air pollution. The endangerment finding under section 202(a) of the CAA links to one specific source category and satisfies both the \"may reasonably be anticipated to endanger\" and \"contributes to\" components. This finding may limit EPA's discretion in dealing with GHGs under other CAA provisions with endangerment preconditions. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to address endangerment from pollutants that contribute to air pollution, potentially endangering public health or welfare. The EPA may be obligated to take action if an endangerment is found, regardless of the specific CAA section. An administrative law question arises regarding whether the EPA must respond to petitions for endangerment findings and standard setting under different CAA provisions. The EPA may not ignore petitions for regulating GHG emissions, as the Administrative Procedure Act requires agencies to consider such requests within a reasonable time frame. This obligation is not explicitly stated in the Clean Air Act, but courts limit agency discretion in responding to petitions. The EPA is required by the Administrative Procedure Act to respond to petitions for regulating GHG emissions within a reasonable time frame. Courts can compel agency action if there is an unreasonable delay in responding to such petitions. The EPA is required to respond to petitions for regulating GHG emissions within a reasonable time frame. The generic component of the agency's 202(a) finding may satisfy non-202(a) endangerment provisions, but differences in language and lower GHG emissions levels exist in other sections of the CAA. The EPA has leeway in regulating GHG emissions from sources other than new motor vehicles, despite the 202(a) finding. CAA section 211(c)(1) empowers EPA to regulate fuels and fuel additives for motor vehicles or nonroad engines based on endangerment provisions. Unlike section 202, section 211 focuses on standards for the composition of fuel that produces emissions. Section 211(c)(1) allows EPA to implement low-carbon fuel standards based on endangerment findings, but does not mandate action like section 202(a) does. It is unclear if a \"contributes to\" component finding under 211(c)(1) would be required. CAA section 108(a)(1) contains similar endangerment language to 202(a) and could potentially provide additional regulatory authority. CAA section 108(a)(1) mirrors the endangerment language of section 202(a) and could be used to regulate stationary sources of GHGs through national ambient air quality standards (NAAQSs). NAAQSs are set by the EPA to limit pollutant concentrations in the air for public health and welfare protection. The process for establishing NAAQSs involves EPA listing the pollutant, issuing air quality criteria, and then promulgating the standards, with states required to submit implementation plans to achieve and maintain compliance. The EPA Administrator must publish a list of air pollutants that endanger public health or welfare and are emitted from various sources to establish NAAQSs. Areas designated nonattainment for primary NAAQSs must attain the standards within five years, while no fixed deadline is set for secondary NAAQSs. Listing the pollutant is the first step in the process, leading to the establishment of criteria and NAAQSs. The EPA must publish a list of air pollutants that endanger public health or welfare and are emitted from various sources to establish NAAQSs. The endangerment finding under section 202(a) forces EPA to find conditions satisfied, including CO2 emissions from numerous sources. EPA may argue discretion in planning to issue air quality criteria. The EPA has discretion in planning to issue air quality criteria, but there is contrary authority denying such discretion. In NRDC v. Train, the Second Circuit held that EPA cannot avoid setting NAAQS for lead once conditions are satisfied. This ruling could be invoked to compel EPA to set NAAQS for GHGs after a positive endangerment finding under section 202(a). The Train case does not definitively resolve the issue of setting NAAQS for GHGs. The consequences of listing GHGs under section 108(a) could lead to impractical results, as achieving NAAQS for GHGs through state implementation plans may be unattainable. Courts may consider arguments that an endangerment finding under section 202(a) does not necessarily require EPA to establish NAAQS for GHGs. The Train case dealt with lead specifically, as expected by the 1970 CAA, while there is no legislative history indicating a similar expectation for GHGs. EPA notes that NRDC v. Train was decided before Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC, which established the principle of deferring to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes. The reviewing court is to ask whether the agency's interpretation is permissible, without substituting its own judgment. EPA argues that the Second Circuit might have deferred to its discretion post-Chevron, but overlooks that deference was established before Chevron. Congress has not set new NAAQSs for new pollutants since the 1970s, despite the requirement in CAA section 111(b)(1) for EPA to issue NSPSs for new sources of pollution. The EPA establishes NSPS for new stationary sources of air pollution that endanger public health or welfare. States must submit plans for existing sources in the same category under section 111(d). The term \"significantly\" in 111(b)(1) distinguishes it from a 202(a) endangerment finding. EPA has broad discretion to define \"significantly\" in 111(b)(1) to exclude many stationary source categories, but it is not unlimited. The harm GHGs may have on the environment is extensively documented in EPA's 202(a) endangerment finding, limiting the ability to eliminate obligations to deal with GHGs through NSPSs, especially for higher-emitting source categories like coal-fired power plants. The EPA has discretion in defining \"significantly\" in 111(b)(1) to exclude certain stationary source categories. The agency is likely to prioritize NSPSs for addressing GHGs under the existing Clean Air Act, considering feasibility and cost in emission reduction. The EPA has discretion in setting emission reduction standards under the Clean Air Act, considering costs, health, and environmental impacts. The agency can distinguish among different types of sources when establishing NSPSs, allowing for flexibility in achieving achievable emission levels. EPA has discretion in setting emission reduction standards under the Clean Air Act, considering costs, health, and environmental impacts. The agency can distinguish among different types of sources when establishing NSPSs, allowing for flexibility in achieving achievable emission levels. EPA's latitude in formulating standards for GHG emissions from new source categories makes burdensome standards unlikely. Active suits seek to compel EPA to promulgate NSPSs for GHG emissions from stationary sources, with petitioners' prospects potentially improved by EPA's endangerment finding. CAA section 213 applies to non-road engines and vehicles, allowing the Administrator to regulate emissions if they significantly contribute to air pollution endangering public health or welfare. EPA has discretion in setting emission reduction standards under the Clean Air Act, considering costs, health, and environmental impacts. The agency can distinguish among different types of sources when establishing NSPSs, allowing for flexibility in achieving achievable emission levels. CAA section 213 applies to non-road engines and vehicles, allowing the Administrator to regulate emissions if they significantly contribute to air pollution endangering public health or welfare, taking into account costs, noise, safety, and energy factors. EPA has great discretion in responding to GHG emissions from the non-road category, with the pivotal question being whether a \"contributes to\" component finding may have to be made for different source categories like aircraft. EPA is authorized to establish emissions standards for aircraft engines under CAA section 231. The pivotal question is whether a \"contributes to\" component finding may have to be made for aircraft GHGs, combined with a \"may reasonably be anticipated to endanger\" component finding from section 202(a), forcing EPA to make an overall endangerment finding for aircraft. This argument hinges on EPA's authority to set a de minimis threshold for aircraft GHG emissions. An endangerment finding for aircraft GHG emissions under section 231 does not automatically require regulations, as EPA must consider factors like noise and safety before changing aircraft engine emissions standards. Section 231 of the Clean Air Act grants the EPA broad discretion in determining regulations for aircraft emissions, considering factors such as cost, technology, and safety. The President can disapprove regulations that would pose a hazard to aircraft safety, and the Administrator can determine the necessary time for compliance with the regulations. The stringency level of the standards is not specified under section 231. EPA is required to regulate emissions from the loading and unloading of tank vessels that may endanger public health or welfare. This includes volatile organic compounds and potentially methane. The question arises whether EPA must make an endangerment finding for GHG emissions from these operations. The EPA is mandated to regulate emissions from tank vessel operations that could harm public health or welfare, including volatile organic compounds and possibly methane. The agency has discretion in setting standards for these operations, with the absence of certain phrases potentially impacting its flexibility. The Clean Air Act section 615 aims to protect the stratosphere from various threats, with broad language covering all potential dangers. Section 615 of the Clean Air Act aims to protect the stratosphere from threats, with a focus on ozone. If any substance or activity is anticipated to harm the stratosphere and endanger public health, regulations must be promptly established by the Administrator. This section differs from other endangerment provisions and indicates that a positive finding under a different section would not necessarily require EPA action under section 615. Section 615 of the Clean Air Act focuses on protecting the stratosphere from harm, specifically ozone depletion. It requires regulations to be established if a substance or activity is expected to endanger public health. This differs from other provisions in the Act and does not specify the form or strictness of the regulations. EPA action under section 615 is not necessarily required based on findings from other sections. Section 115 of the Clean Air Act requires notification to states if air pollutants emitted in the United States may endanger public health in a foreign country. States must revise their plans to prevent the endangerment if EPA finds that the same rights are granted to the United States by the affected country. Unlike other provisions, EPA does not need to determine if the pollutant endangers public health in the U.S. The Clean Air Act's Section 115 requires notification to states if air pollutants emitted in the United States may endanger public health in a foreign country. A positive endangerment finding for the United States under Section 202(a) could also apply to foreign countries due to uniform worldwide atmospheric concentrations of GHGs. The question arises whether the \"contributes to\" component finding should be made for the United States overall or for individual states. EPA must make an endangerment finding and consider reciprocity. The Clean Air Act's Section 115 requires EPA to notify states if US emissions may harm public health in a foreign country. This could lead to demands for plan revisions from many states. The implications of an endangerment finding under Section 115 are complex, as it would require states to revise their plans to address the foreign endangerment, which may be challenging due to the global nature of GHG emissions. EPA may need to interpret the statutory language to find a feasible solution. EPA may interpret Section 115 of the Clean Air Act to require states to incorporate measures related to NAAQSs into their implementation plans. This interpretation has varying degrees of legal persuasiveness and has not been tested in court. EPA's argument is based on the requirement for states to prepare implementation plans under Section 110 to achieve and maintain NAAQSs. EPA's argument is based on the requirement for states to prepare implementation plans under Section 110 to achieve and maintain NAAQSs. Section 115 may require states to include measures related to NAAQSs in their plans, but its legal persuasiveness is untested in court. EPA's interpretation hinges on the idea that Section 115 is dependent on Section 110(a)(2)(H)(ii) for effectuation, suggesting that it must be limited to measures for NAAQS attainment and maintenance. However, Section 110(a)(2)(H)(ii) appears to go beyond this scope by requiring plan revisions for substantial inadequacies in achieving NAAQSs or meeting additional requirements under the Act. EPA's argument may be vulnerable if Section 115 is found to have broader implications beyond NAAQS-related measures. Section 115 of the Act requires an EPA-notified state to revise its plan to eliminate endangerment for any air pollutant emitted in the United States, not just those affecting NAAQSs. EPA argues that Section 110(a)(2)(H)(ii) is limited to NAAQS-related measures, making it inappropriate for EPA to make the endangerment finding that triggers the process. This argument is based on the view that Section 115 establishes a single procedure where both endangerment finding and notification/plan-revision occur together. The arguments against judicial coercion of EPA action under section 115 include the absence of provisions for petitions and the discretion implied in the text. However, a positive endangerment finding for new motor vehicle GHG emissions could compel EPA to act against other GHG sources through new source review in Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) areas and Title V permitting. EPA is expected to promulgate regulations to control GHG emissions from new motor vehicles, triggering PSD and Title V applicability requirements for GHG emissions. The PSD portion of the CAA aims to prevent air quality in areas attaining health-based NAAQS from deteriorating. It requires review of new major emitting facilities or modifications in advance to ensure emissions do not cause harm. The PSD program under the CAA aims to prevent air quality in areas meeting NAAQS from worsening by reviewing new major emitting facilities to ensure emissions do not exceed limits. Facilities must demonstrate emissions will not cause more than one exceedance per year of the allowable concentration increase for any pollutant. The program applies to facilities with the potential to emit 100 tons/year of any air pollutant or 250 tons/year for unlisted sources. The PSD program under the CAA requires new major emitting facilities to use the best available control technology for regulated pollutants. The question of when CO2 became \"subject to regulation\" under the Act remains unclear, triggering debates on the requirement of BACT in PSD areas. The EPA's interpretation of \"subject to regulation\" under the CAA has been debated in recent decisions and memorandums. The Administrator's memorandum from the Bush Administration narrowly defines the phrase to include only pollutants with actual control of emissions. EPA has sought comment on this interpretation, but the dispute may soon be irrelevant for GHGs. The EPA's interpretation of \"subject to regulation\" under the CAA for GHGs may soon be moot. The expected GHG standard for new motor vehicles in 2010 will trigger PSD/BACT for significant new sources of pollutants like CO2. However, the low thresholds for applicability of the PSD program raise concerns for small entities and administrative practicality. The EPA has proposed a \"tailoring rule\" to adjust the thresholds for PSD new source review to reduce the number of covered sources. The rule would temporarily set the thresholds at 25,000 tons per year on a CO2 equivalent basis, with a significance level for GHG emissions between 10,000 and 25,000 tpy CO2e. EPA plans to conduct another rulemaking within six years to finalize these changes. The EPA proposed a \"tailoring rule\" to adjust thresholds for PSD new source review, setting temporary thresholds at 25,000 tons per year on a CO2 equivalent basis. The agency justifies this departure from statutory language with legal reasoning, citing \"absurd results\" and \"administrative necessity\" doctrines. These apply to both PSD/new source review and Title V permitting. Title V of the Clean Air Act establishes an operating permit program for major stationary sources of air pollution. The program consolidates existing requirements to simplify regulation and enforcement by EPA, states, and citizen suits. BACT requirements are flexible but must not exceed NSPS limits if applicable. The program does not add new emission controls but does impose costs on applicants. Title V of the Clean Air Act establishes an operating permit program for major stationary sources of air pollution. The program imposes costs on applicants by requiring them to identify emission regulations, develop compliance plans, monitor compliance, and pay permit fees. However, the act also allows for the issuance of general permits to simplify the process for facilities seeking coverage. The Clean Air Act's Title V establishes an operating permit program for major stationary sources of air pollution. Facilities can apply for coverage under a general permit if they meet the emission threshold of 100 tons per year. The program also includes BACT requirements for GHG emissions in PSD areas, which may require new major emitting facilities to seek Title V permits. EPA argues for narrowing the application of Title V permitting to avoid absurd results and administrative burdens. GHGs under PSD new source review will determine the scope of Title V permitting. EPA justifies its departure from CAA thresholds using \"absurd results\" and \"administrative necessity\" doctrines. These doctrines allow flexibility in statutory directives when adherence would be inconsistent or produce unreasonable results. EPA asserts this in the preamble to the proposed tailoring rule. EPA predicts significant disruptions in permitting programs due to the application of the 100/250 tons/year threshold for new source review in PSD areas. Permit applications could increase by 150-fold, causing delays in processing applications within the required 12 months. EPA's early years saw courts endorsing the agency's efforts to avoid senseless consequences of literal statutory readings, such as not requiring environmental impact statements under NEPA. This was based on the rationale that EPA's decision-making processes already incorporated environmental considerations and public participation. This approach may be seen as an early use of an absurd results principle. The EPA may use an \"absurd results\" defense in litigation over the tailoring rule due to the crushing burdens of a literal reading of PSD and Title V thresholds. The rule proposes a temporary phase-in period and cites \"administrative necessity\" as another legal justification. The \"doctrine\" of \"administrative necessity\" allows agencies to deviate from statutory commands when literal compliance is nearly impossible. EPA argues that strict compliance with PSD thresholds would overwhelm authorities, making the program unmanageable. The tailoring rule's survival in court depends on convincing judges of these burdens. Alabama Power Co. v. Costle is a leading case on administrative necessity, involving EPA and the PSD requirements of the CAA. The D.C. Circuit was addressing EPA's PSD requirements under the CAA. The court rejected EPA's attempt to expand a statutory exemption but acknowledged that limited exemptions can be created through the administrative process. The court emphasized that categorical exemptions from regulatory statutes are not favored but not always prohibited. EPA may have to meet strict judicial prerequisites to apply the PSD program to CO2 emissions, which are significantly higher than the pollutants the CAA was designed for. EPA's phased approach to reaching statutory thresholds may be justified by case law, although the tailoring rule situation is different. The endangerment finding for new motor vehicle GHG emissions forces certain regulatory actions by EPA, while leaving room for resistance in other areas. The new source review of major emitting facilities and major modifications falls into the category of forced regulatory action. EPA seeks comments on whether the case law truly supports the proposed tailoring rule. The EPA's regulatory actions include new source review for major emitting facilities and major modifications in PSD areas, subjecting GHGs to BACT. Title V permitting requirements may also be triggered, with potential NSPS regulations for stationary source categories emitting large quantities of GHGs. EPA has discretionary authority in shaping regulations for endangerment-triggered actions. The EPA has discretionary authority in shaping regulations for endangerment-triggered actions under the Clean Air Act (CAA), which include various authorities with different criteria than section 202(a). Stationary source categories emitting lower levels of greenhouse gases may not be subject to NSPS regulations if defined as not contributing \"significantly.\" The gray area exists between EPA being required to act and not, such as promulgating NAAQSs for GHGs under section 108 and international pollution abatement. The EPA has discretionary authority in shaping regulations for endangerment-triggered actions under the Clean Air Act (CAA), including promulgation of NAAQSs for GHGs under section 108 and international pollution abatement. Agency interpretation may allow for flexibility in enforcement due to awkward consequences and unattainable pollution-control goals. Ultimately, EPA's actions against GHG emissions under CAA provisions will likely be influenced by political desires rather than strict requirements. The EPA may not soon enact comprehensive climate change legislation to reduce emissions, citing reasons such as avoiding delays in addressing climate change, enhancing credibility in international negotiations, and pressuring Congress to act."
