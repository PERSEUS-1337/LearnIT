    "content": "The Dayton peace agreement, signed in November 1995 with U.S. leadership, ended a brutal ethnic conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina after the dissolution of Yugoslavia. It established a unified Bosnia and Herzegovina with two entities, the Bosniak-Croat Federation and Republika Srpska, governed by an international representative and NATO peacekeeping forces. Central government includes a three-member presidency, Prime Minister, and Parliament, with most governing functions at the entity level. The Dayton peace agreement in Bosnia established a unified country with two entities, the Federation and Republika Srpska. An Office of the High Representative oversaw international activities and had authority to impose decisions. NATO gradually reduced its presence and handed over peacekeeping duties to the EU in 2004. While Dayton ended the war and laid the foundation for peace, challenges remain in Bosnia's multi-layered governing structures for integration into the EU and NATO. The Bush Administration has supported Bosnia's development as a democratic state and its Euro-Atlantic aspirations. Political differences among Bosnia's leaders hinder efforts to strengthen central governing institutions. U.S. and international officials emphasize the regional importance of progress in Bosnia and reject divisive nationalist rhetoric. The 110th Congress retains interest in Bosnia's progress towards NATO and EU integration, with the Administration requesting increased foreign assistance for reforms. Efforts have been made to promote constitutional reform to improve governance effectiveness and overcome post-Dayton legacy issues. The Council of Europe's Venice Commission found Bosnia's current constitutional arrangements inefficient and irrational. Several political and economic reforms have been implemented in Bosnia over the years with input from the international community. Landmark agreements have expanded central state competencies and institutions, leading to significant economic growth. Unemployment remains high, but progress has been made towards EU integration. In November 2005, Bosnia's leaders signed a \"Commitment to Pursue Constitutional Reform\" to create stronger democratic institutions. Reforms included a single presidency, a stronger Prime Minister's office, and parliament. Despite broad consensus, the reform package failed in the lower house of parliament in April 2006. The failure of a constitutional reform bill in Bosnia was seen as a setback to state consolidation. Parties committed to continuing negotiations for reforms essential for EU integration. Elections in October saw a weakened hold on power by nationalist parties, with new hardline positions emerging. The nationalist parties in Bosnia faced challenges in building national consensus after the elections, with differing views on state centralization and federalism. A new coalition government was formed in 2007, led by Bosnia's first ethnic Serb Prime Minister, Nikola Spiric, but politicians maintained hardline positions, leading to a deteriorating political situation. In 2007, Bosnia faced political crises due to hardline positions of politicians, including the resignation of Prime Minister Spiric in protest. Police reform became a key issue tied to constitutional reforms and EU association agreement efforts. In late 2007, Bosnia's governing parties made progress on police reforms to meet EU conditions, but further implementation took months. In 2008, leaders faced challenges in fulfilling commitments and seeking consensus on constitutional reforms. Nationalist rhetoric and tensions rose after Kosovo's independence declaration, leading to protests in Banja Luka. RS President Dodik backed away from secession hints but defended RS's position within Bosnia. Bosnia and Herzegovina seeks full EU and NATO membership, facing difficulties in meeting conditions compared to other Balkan states. The EU committed to integrating all Western Balkan countries, creating new instruments like the Stabilization and Association Agreement. Bosnia encountered hurdles in meeting EU conditions, with progress on police reforms in late 2007 and challenges in constitutional reforms in 2008. Nationalist tensions rose after Kosovo's independence declaration, leading to protests in Banja Luka. RS President Dodik defended RS's position within Bosnia. Bosnia faced hurdles in negotiating a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU, with progress in defense and security sector reforms leading to the initialing of the SAA in December 2007. A compromise on police laws was reached in April 2008, allowing Bosnia to sign the SAA in June 2008. Despite concerns about EU enlargement fatigue, the EU reaffirmed its commitment to full membership for Western Balkan states. The EU has prioritized reforms in Bosnia's public administration, public broadcasting, and cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal. Despite improvements in cooperation with The Hague, the capture of wartime Bosnian Serb leaders remains a concern. NATO invited Bosnia, Serbia, and Montenegro to join its Partnership for Peace program in 2006, despite incomplete cooperation with The Hague. NATO took actions related to enlargement at its Bucharest summit in 2008. NATO took actions related to enlargement in April 2008, inviting Albania and Croatia to join the alliance. They also initiated an Intensified Dialogue with Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina. A residual NATO presence in Sarajevo provides advice on defense reform and assists in capturing war criminals. The international community has been transitioning towards giving more responsibility to Bosnian authorities in governance and security. The role of the Office of the High Representative and international security presence has evolved since the end of the war. Successive High Representatives have wielded considerable executive power under the \"Bonn powers\" authority to push reforms and remove obstructionist leaders. Lord Paddy Ashdown made binding decisions and took action against officials supporting Radovan Karadzic. The High Representative's office faced criticism for hindering Bosnia's political development. Christian Schwartz-Schilling took a more hands-off approach before being succeeded by Miroslav Lajcak in July 2007. The Peace Implementation Council decided to begin preparations to close the OHR in June 2006. The Peace Implementation Council decided to close the Office of the High Representative (OHR) by June 30, 2007, believing that the EU accession process could drive Bosnia's reforms. However, due to concerns about Bosnia's slow progress towards EU membership, the OHR's mandate was extended until mid-2008. In February 2008, the PIC indefinitely extended the High Representative's mandate to counter destructive tendencies. NATO concluded its SFOR mission in Bosnia in 2004 and handed over peacekeeping duties to EUFOR. EUFOR, initially with over 6,000 troops, was reduced to about 2,500 in 2007. NATO maintains a small headquarters in Sarajevo for assistance to the Bosnian government and counter-terrorism operations. The U.N. Security Council extended EU and NATO presence in Bosnia in 2007. EU took over the U.N. police mission in Bosnia in 2003. The EU Police Mission (EUPM) in Bosnia, established in 2003, comprises 150 international police officers with a mandate until 2009. Its goal is to help Bosnia develop a professional, multi-ethnic police force and combat organized crime and corruption."
