American Latinos, whether known as Hispanic or Latino, share a common heritage rooted in the mixture of indigenous, European, and African cultures. Latinos have been present in the United States for over 200 years prior to the Declaration of Independence, with Spanish colonists establishing the first permanent settlement in St. Augustine, Florida in 1565. Since before the Nation's founding, Latinos have come to the United States searching for opportunity and prosperity. Throughout history, Latinos have labored in fields, factories, and on battlefields, contributing to American society in various ways. Latinos have enriched the history, art, politics, economy, and culture of the United States since its founding. They have made significant contributions to various fields and have become the largest demographic minority group in the country according to the Bureau of the Census. The American Latino population, with an estimated 38.8 million in the US, is predominantly young, with one-third under 18 and four out of 10 under 25. Their rapid growth and dispersion throughout the country ensure a significant role in American life, from public policy to entertainment. The American Latino population, primarily immigrants, doubled between 1990 and 2000, contributing to the diverse culture of the South. Despite their significant contributions to American cultural life, there is a lack of awareness and understanding among other Americans about Latino culture and history, leading to stereotypes and misconceptions. National efforts are needed to educate and celebrate Latino arts and history for the benefit of all Americans. The Smithsonian Institution, with 16 museums in DC and NYC, educates visitors about US history and culture. It is recognized as the premier American museum showcasing cultural diversity. Collaboration among educators, scholars, and community leaders is essential for promoting awareness and understanding of cultural history. The task force appointed to examine the Smithsonian Institution's representation of American Latinos in its exhibits published reports criticizing the institution's historical poor record in this area. This led to the creation of the Smithsonian's Center for Latino Initiatives in 1998, which has since increased the profile of Latino arts and culture, promoting diversity and understanding among patrons. A commission is needed to create a National Museum of the American Latino within the Smithsonian Institution, reflecting the community's history and contributions.
