    "content": "There are approximately 150 ombudsman offices in the federal government, with a third being statutorily authorized and the rest created through executive action. These offices vary in origin, staffing, funding, and structure but share the common goal of impartially resolving disputes. Some focus on internal agency disputes, others on client disputes, and some handle both. The Office of the National Ombudsman, part of the U.S. Small Business Administration, stands out for its ability to resolve disputes from the public across federal agencies, established in 1996 under P.L. 104-121. The Office of the National Ombudsman, part of the U.S. Small Business Administration, was created in 1996 under P.L. 104-121.

The Office of the National Ombudsman was established in 1996 to assist small businesses facing unfair regulatory actions by federal agencies. It evaluates agency compliance and enforcement activities, reports to Congress, and a recent legislative effort aimed to enhance its authority. The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 established the Office of the National Ombudsman to assist small businesses with federal regulatory compliance. It authorized the evaluation of agency regulatory guides, customer service surveys, and outreach programs to promote awareness. The Act also created regional Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards. The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, which established the Office of the National Ombudsman and 10 regional Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards, was based on recommendations from the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business. Delegates at the conference voted on policy recommendations, with improving the Regulatory Flexibility Act and regulatory reform being key priorities addressed by SBREFA. The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 established the Office of the National Ombudsman and Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards to address federal regulatory reform recommendations. Proponents argued that the Office of the National Ombudsman would create a more cooperative regulatory environment for small businesses. Senator John Glenn supported the legislation but expressed concerns about the potential outcomes of the Office of the National Ombudsman and the Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards. Senator Carl Levin supported the legislation but suggested that more time should have been taken to consider placing an ombudsman in each regulatory agency instead of relying on a single ombudsman in the Small Business Administration. Initially, the Office of the National Ombudsman was based in Chicago with a three-person staff. The Office of the National Ombudsman, initially located in Chicago with a three-person staff, was established in November 1996. The Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards, consisting of 50 small business owners, were appointed in the same month and became operational by June 1997.

The annual report to Congress included a report card on federal agency regulatory performance, leading to congressional hearings due to low grades. The National Ombudsman also added a \"best practices\" section to encourage agencies to improve. In 2002, the Office of the National Ombudsman relocated to SBA's headquarters in Washington, DC for increased visibility. A memorandum of understanding was signed with the SBA Office of Advocacy for cooperation. In 2003, the Office of the National Ombudsman and small businesses collaborated to improve federal agency attendance at Small Business Regulatory Fairness Board hearings. The memorandum of understanding was renewed in 2006 to enhance cooperation for a more small business-friendly regulatory environment. The Office of the National Ombudsman and the SBA Office of Advocacy agreed to collaborate on improving the regulatory environment for small businesses by receiving and forwarding comments on regulations, promoting SBA programs, and including regional advocates in activities. The Office of the National Ombudsman and the SBA Office of Advocacy agreed to collaborate on improving the regulatory environment for small businesses by providing material for distribution and handling regulatory complaints from small business interests. Congress has focused on the National Ombudsman's effectiveness in resolving regulatory disputes rather than just the number of small businesses contacting the office. The National Ombudsman has limited investigative authority and cannot overrule federal actions. In FY2014, 10% of small businesses with regulatory disputes resolved by federal agencies received a favorable outcome. The office has seven authorized employees, with five currently in position.

Small businesses can file formal comments with the Ombudsman if they believe they have faced unfair regulatory actions. Small businesses can file formal comments with the Office of the National Ombudsman by providing specific details of the federal agency's actions, desired resolution, and relevant documentation.

The Office of the National Ombudsman helps small businesses with regulation compliance issues by serving as a conduit for grievances to be heard by Federal agencies. This crucial component of the rulemaking process is underfunded and relies on volunteers to spread awareness. If Congress wants to support small businesses with Federal regulations, more investment is needed. Invest more in small business outreach and support to help with Federal regulations. Some argue for giving the Office of the National Ombudsman additional authority to assist small businesses in resolving regulatory disputes with federal agencies. For example, S. 1146 in the 115th Congress aimed to expand the Ombudsman's authority to work with agencies on educating and assisting small entities in complying with regulations. The Office of the National Ombudsman is authorized to evaluate federal agency regulatory compliance guides, conduct small business customer service surveys, and develop an outreach program. Some Members argue that more government resources are not necessary to reduce small business regulatory burden. The Office of the National Ombudsman, housed within the SBA, serves as a liaison for small businesses facing unfair treatment in federal regulations. Challenges include its independence being influenced by the SBA through budget, proximity, and appointment processes.
