    "content": "The Durbin Amendment aims to regulate payment card interchange fees to ensure fair pricing for small businesses and prevent anti-competitive practices by payment card networks. In the past, interchange fees were paid without issue, but now they are a source of controversy. The Credit Card Fair Fee Act of 2009 was introduced in the 111th Congress to address this issue. The Credit Card Fair Fee Act of 2009 (H.R. 2695) introduced by House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers Jr. aimed to require voluntary interchange fee negotiations among merchants, Visa, MasterCard, and card-issuing banks. It would grant limited antitrust immunity for negotiation of access fees and terms for electronic transactions. Critics argue it could force negotiations. The Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-24) was enacted on May 22, 2009. The Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-24) was enacted on May 22, 2009, directing a study on interchange fees without mandating changes. Chairman Conyers established a task force in the 110th Congress to address complaints about interchange fees impacting merchants and consumers. U.S. families were reported to pay over $300 in hidden interchange fees in 2005, affecting both cardholders and non-cardholders. The United States will pay banks issuing Visa and MasterCard payment cards over $30 billion in interchange fees. Interchange fees have been increasing since the 1990s, despite lower fraud losses and technology advancements. Merchants argue that fees are presented as non-negotiable offers by card associations. Economists attribute higher interchange fees to the unique two-sided market structure of the payment card industry. The unique two-sided market structure of the payment card industry could lead to high interchange fees if payment card issuers have market power and merchants have an inelastic demand for accepting payment cards. Excessive interchange fees may result in government-imposed caps, as seen in Australia and the United Kingdom. Questions arise about how the government can incentivize merchants to lower prices and pass savings to cardholders, with voluntary fee pass-backs in these countries showing no formal evidence of price reductions. This report focuses on Visa and MasterCard cards. The report focuses on Visa and MasterCard, which account for the majority of the payment card market in the United States. It discusses the nontraditional structure of the market, analyzes the optimal level of payment cards for social welfare, and examines the Durbin Amendment and Credit Card Fair Fee Act. The curr_chunk discusses the cost components of a payment card transaction, including the merchant discount fee and interchange fee. The fees range from 1% to 3% but can be as high as 15% for high-risk merchants. The acquirer bank retains part of the fee, and the remainder is remitted to the network association. The interchange fee is remitted to the network association and the card issuer. The network association keeps a portion for authorization costs and remits the rest to the issuer bank. Interchange rates are set annually and are based on the merchant's type and reward points. The merchant discount fee includes the interchange rate plus an additional percentage taken by the acquirer bank. The interchange fee is determined by the merchant's type and reward points attached to a payment card. Interchange rates vary based on the merchant's risk profile and the acquirer bank profit component. Merchant discount fees include interchange rates and an additional percentage for the acquirer bank. Interchange rates are lower in stable industries like groceries and higher in high-risk businesses like adult Internet websites. Visa and MasterCard association rules prohibit merchants from imposing surcharges on card transactions, preventing them from passing on card costs to customers. Merchants absorb payment card transaction costs and are required to accept all cards from the card association. They cannot offer discounts on specific cards, leading to operating at a higher cost. The merchant discount fee is set at 2.6% by banks and the card association. In a card association network, the association serves as an umbrella organization for four parties: the acquiring bank, the merchant, the cardholder, and the card issuer bank. The merchant may attract cardholder customers with discounts, leading to higher sales volume and reduced costs. Card issuers no longer charge annual fees due to profitability from credit lines and related fees. The cardholder purchases goods or services for $100.00 with a payment card. The merchant's acquirer bank receives the accounting information as an account receivable. The acquirer bank credits the merchant's account $97.40, deducting a 0.5% fee. The card association authorizes the $100.00 payment, deducting its 0.1% fee. The issuer bank sends $98.00 to the card association, deducting a 2% interchange fee from the $100.00. The issuer bank deducts a 2% interchange fee from the $100.00 payment made with a credit card, providing the cardholder with a $100.00 float. If a debit card is used, the issuer bank may immediately deduct the $100.00 from the cardholder's deposit account. Interchange fees have led to proposed solutions by various parties involved in the process. Proposed solutions to rising interchange fees include regulating the cost used to calculate fees or allowing merchants to add a surcharge. Some argue for interchange fees based on card issuers' costs, while others suggest abolishing fees and covering costs through interest rates and annual fees. Price regulations based on costs have practical challenges, even in industries where theory predicts success. The optimal interchange fee in the credit card market is unlikely to be reached by setting it at zero or strictly based on costs due to the two-sided nature of the market where costs play a reduced role in determining prices. Setting the interchange fee at zero or strictly based on costs is unlikely to be optimal in the credit card market due to the two-sided nature of the market. Maximizing output requires issuers and acquirers to set prices that incentivize cardholders to use and merchants to accept payment cards, similar to revenue transfers in newspaper subscriptions and advertising. Some analysts suggest lifting the prohibition on merchants surcharging card transactions to shift the costs of interchange fees to cardholders. This could incentivize card issuers to keep interchange fees at optimal levels. However, practical concerns exist, as high-volume merchants may be reluctant to impose surcharges due to administrative costs. In a two-sided market, merchants may not impose surcharges to avoid losing customers to competitors. The elimination of the rule prohibiting surcharges makes the division of benefits between merchants and cardholders irrelevant. Surcharging card transactions could prevent issuers from stimulating card use. Merchant surcharging of card transactions could prevent issuers from increasing card use to optimize the payment system efficiency. The antitrust aspect of payment card associations, currently in court, may determine if Visa and MasterCard are monopolies. Since the 1970s, analysts argue that banks may collectively harm society by setting their own fees and dominating the association. Larger banks with lower costs can charge higher fees, benefiting smaller banks with higher cost structures. This allows smaller banks to piggyback on the marketing power of larger ones through card associations. The Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010 addresses regulatory failures that caused the financial crisis and includes provisions on interchange fees. Senator Durbin's Amendment mandates specific regulatory actions on debit cards to ensure small businesses pay a fair price and prohibits anti-competitive restrictions by payment card networks. The amendment mandates the Federal Reserve Board to establish rules on interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions, ensuring fees are reasonable and proportional to actual costs. Small issuers with assets under $10 billion are exempt, and businesses can offer discounts for using competing payment card networks. The Durbin Amendment mandates rules on interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions, allowing businesses to offer discounts for using competing payment card networks. However, the cost to consumers may not necessarily be lowered, according to Visa Inc's general counsel. The Reserve Bank of Australia found that lowering interchange fees led to consumers paying more for credit cards and receiving fewer rewards. In response, the Credit Card Fair Fee Act of 2009 was introduced to regulate interchange fee negotiations. The Credit Card Fair Fee Act of 2009 was introduced to regulate interchange fee negotiations. In the 110th Congress, H.R. 5546 granted limited antitrust immunity for negotiating access fees for electronic payment systems. The bill was reported as amended by the House Judiciary Committee but no further action was taken. The 2009 Credit Card Fair Fee Act aimed to authorize providers and merchants to negotiate access agreements voluntarily. The bill proposed that the U.S. Attorney General oversee these negotiations, a change from the 2008 version which suggested a panel of judges. The final version of H.R. 5546 required the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice to ensure negotiations took place and report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. The negotiations for access agreements are detailed in a report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. The Durbin Amendment exempts financial firms with assets under $10 billion, but credit unions and community banks oppose changes to interchange fees as they benefit from the current structure. The amendments and bills related to interchange fee regulation have garnered support from merchant and consumer groups but faced opposition from payment card companies and the banking community, including credit unions. The National Credit Union Association (NCUA) expressed opposition to H.R. 2695, stating that it would primarily benefit merchants. John J. Motley of the Food Marketing Institute praised H.R. 5546 for aiming to establish a fair and transparent credit card interchange fee system. The legislation aims to establish a fair and transparent credit card interchange fee system, allowing retailers to negotiate reasonable fees with Visa and MasterCard networks. Consumer groups and the U.S. Pubic Interest Research Group support the bill, citing concerns about the dominance of issuers in the marketplace. Visa's general counsel argues that the bill would stifle competition and innovation, leading to unintended consequences for consumers. The American Bankers Association and Credit Union National Association oppose a bill that could lead to less competition and higher costs for consumers. The Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department also oppose the bill due to antitrust concerns. The issue of whether merchants would pass on savings from lower interchange fees is a key point of discussion. The testimony suggests little evidence that customers benefitted from lower interchange fees, even in cases like Wal-Mart. In Australia, where interchange fees were regulated, there is no proof that savings were passed on to consumers. Merchant complaints focus on the rise of the merchant discount rate, indicating that acquirer banks' costs do not justify the fees collected from merchants. The merchant discount fee collected by acquirer banks may not fully account for the costs of issuing banks. Evidence suggests that the fee is competitively determined at around 0.5% of the transaction amount for most payment cards. However, increasing the acquirer fee did not reduce card acceptance, shifting focus to cardholders and issuing banks. Card pricing significantly impacts card usage, as cardholders may switch to avoid higher fees. This may justify card associations making larger payments to issuing banks. The interchange fee in the payment card industry may be the result of anti-competitive behavior, leading to a need for lower fees. Mechanisms to pass savings back to cardholders are not well-discussed, despite regulatory caps being able to lower interchange fees. The government's regulatory caps on interchange fees could lead to a redistribution of revenues from banks to merchants, potentially reducing the social benefit of the electronic payment card system. Lower revenues for banks may result in issuing fewer cards to cardholders, leading to a decrease in customers for merchants."
