    "content": "To be constitutional, a federal statute must be enacted pursuant to a power of Congress enumerated in the Constitution and must not contravene any provision of the Constitution. Congress has the power to regulate or ban pornography under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. This includes regulating pornography that crosses state or national boundaries, is imported or exported, or is mailed. The main concern is ensuring that these statutes do not violate the First Amendment's protection of freedom of speech and the press. Pornography, excluding obscenity and child pornography, can be regulated based on time, place, and manner of distribution. An outright ban on non-obscene or child pornography would violate the First Amendment unless it serves a compelling interest and is the least restrictive means. Obscenity and child pornography can be completely banned regardless of harm. Obscenity is the only type of speech denied First Amendment protection without considering harm. Obscenity, not protected by the First Amendment, can be banned based on the social interest in order and morality. To be considered obscene, pornography must depict offensive sexual conduct according to the Miller test. The Supreme Court clarified in Pope v. Illinois that determining whether material is obscene involves assessing its appeal to prurient interest, patent offensiveness, and lack of serious value. The Miller standard is used to define obscenity in relation to pornography. In Sable Communications of California, Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission, the Supreme Court recognized the compelling interest in protecting minors from non-obscene literature by adult standards. The government must use narrowly drawn regulations to achieve this without unnecessarily interfering with First Amendment freedoms. The Supreme Court in Stanley v. Georgia ruled that private possession of obscene material is protected under the First Amendment, stating that individuals have the right to decide what they read or watch in the privacy of their own homes. However, the Court later clarified that this does not extend to the distribution or acquisition of obscene material for private use. The Supreme Court in Stanley v. Georgia ruled that private possession of obscene material is protected under the First Amendment, stating that individuals have the right to decide what they read or watch in the privacy of their own homes. However, the right to possess obscene material does not imply the right to provide or acquire it, as seen in Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc. and Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc. where zoning and licensing requirements were upheld for adult establishments. In Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., the Court upheld an ordinance restricting adult theaters to specific areas, preventing them from being near residential zones, dwellings, churches, parks, or schools. The ordinance aimed to prevent crime, protect retail trade, and maintain property values, rather than suppress lawful speech. The Renton ordinance restricts adult theaters to specific areas to prevent crime and protect urban life, consistent with content-neutral speech regulations upheld by the Court. Unlike overbroad regulations in other cases, Renton's ordinance targets theaters causing unwanted secondary effects. The Court struck down a statute in Freedman v. Maryland that required film submission to the State Board of Censors for approval, stating that the burden of proof must rest on the censor and any restraint must be limited to preserve the status quo briefly. The Court emphasized the need for a prompt final judicial decision in constitutional procedures, citing examples from previous cases. In Kingsley Books, Inc. v. Brown, a New York injunctive procedure required a hearing within one day of joining the issue, with a decision within two days after the hearing. In FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, the Supreme Court considered a city ordinance regulating sexually oriented businesses through zoning, licensing, and inspections, with restrictions on individuals convicted of certain crimes from operating such businesses. The Court found that the licensing scheme for adult businesses lacked essential safeguards such as a time limit for decision-making and prompt judicial review, making it unconstitutional for businesses engaged in First Amendment activity. In contrast, in City of Littleton v. Z.J. Gifts D-4, L.L.C., the Court upheld a city's \"adult business\" licensing ordinance. The Court in Freedman emphasized the importance of a prompt judicial decision in cases involving subjective standards, while in City of Littleton v. Z.J. Gifts D-4, L.L.C., the Court upheld an ordinance with objective criteria for adult business licensing. In Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., the Supreme Court upheld a municipal ordinance prohibiting multiple adult entertainment businesses in the same building. The regulation focused on neutral criteria like tax compliance, not content censorship, allowing for individual challenges to undue delays in licensing decisions. The Supreme Court reversed a decision regarding a municipal ordinance in Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., allowing the city to rely on a study to demonstrate a link between adult establishments and reducing crime. The case was remanded for further evidence to be presented at trial. The Supreme Court upheld a municipal ordinance in Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., requiring a causal connection between speech and governmental interest, such as reducing crime. Justice Kennedy emphasized that the ordinance must not suppress speech and must maintain its quantity and accessibility. The dissenting justices argued that the city failed to show a causal relationship between the ordinance and its intended effects. The Supreme Court has previously upheld laws banning public nudity in adult entertainment establishments. In Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., the Supreme Court upheld a state statute requiring dancers to wear \"pasties\" and a \"G-string\" in adult entertainment establishments. The statute was found to only incidentally restrict expression and was upheld as long as it served a compelling governmental interest and was the least restrictive means to further that interest. In Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., the Supreme Court upheld a state statute requiring dancers to wear \"pasties\" and a \"G-string\" in adult entertainment establishments. The statute will be upheld if it is narrowly tailored to further a substantial governmental interest. Justice Rehnquist, joined by Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, found the statute no more restrictive than necessary to protect societal order and morality. Justice Souter identified the governmental interest as combating the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments. Justice Scalia believed the case did not raise a First Amendment issue as the restriction was on conduct, not speech. In Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., the Supreme Court upheld a state statute requiring dancers to wear \"pasties\" and a \"G-string\" in adult entertainment establishments. Justices dissented, finding the purpose of preventing nude dancing in theaters and barrooms is impermissible under the First Amendment as it aims to protect viewers from a harmful message. In Erie v. Pap's A.M., the Court upheld a statute prohibiting public nudity in an \"adult\" entertainment establishment. Justice O'Connor's opinion was joined by five Justices. In Erie v. Pap's A.M., Justice O'Connor's opinion, joined by five Justices, upheld a statute banning public nudity in adult entertainment establishments. Justice Souter, while agreeing with the decision, believed the city lacked sufficient evidence to justify the regulation and would have remanded the case for further proceedings. The plurality opinion found the ban's impact on the erotic message to be minimal due to allowing dancers to wear pasties and G-strings. In Erie v. Pap's A.M., the statute banning public nudity in adult entertainment establishments was upheld, allowing dancers to wear pasties and G-strings. Justice Scalia and Thomas believed the regulation aimed to foster good morals, while Justice Stevens and Ginsburg argued that the regulation was unprecedented in targeting the secondary effects of indecent entertainment. The Supreme Court's decision in Erie v. Pap's A.M. upheld a statute regulating public nudity in adult entertainment establishments. The Court ruled that even trivial effects on the neighborhood could justify censorship, but did not address whether similar statutes could apply to serious theater productions containing nudity. Justice Souter questioned the enforcement of such statutes in productions like 'Hair' or 'Equus' outside of adult theaters. Sections 3008 and 3010 of Title 39 allow individuals to stop receiving offensive mail. Section 3008 enables recipients to request the Postal Service to stop sending sexually provocative advertisements. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of this statute, emphasizing that vendors do not have a constitutional right to send unwanted mail. Section 3010 allows individuals to request to stop receiving sexually oriented advertisements through the mail. The Postal Service must maintain a list of individuals who do not wish to receive such ads, and it is illegal to mail them to those on the list for more than 30 days. Section 3011 allows the Postal Service to take legal action against violators, with potential criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1737. The federal law on dial-a-porn is covered under section 223(b) of the Communications Act of 1934. The federal law on dial-a-porn, section 223(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, was amended in April 1988 to ban obscene and indecent content in interstate and foreign communications, regardless of age. However, in June 1989, the Supreme Court ruled this amendment unconstitutional for indecent messages that are not obscene. The Supreme Court ruled section 223(b) unconstitutional for indecent messages that are not obscene, stating that it violated the First Amendment by not being narrowly drawn to protect children. The Court suggested using credit card, access code, and scrambling rules as effective ways to achieve this goal. The Supreme Court found Congress's ban on indecent but not obscene dial-a-porn unconstitutional. In response, Congress passed the Helms Amendment in 1989 to ban indecent dial-a-porn for persons under 18 nationwide. The amendment also prohibited telephone companies from providing access to such content without prior written request. The Helms Amendment, passed in 1989, prohibits indecent dial-a-porn for individuals under 18 and requires providers to inform telephone companies in writing. Federal law does not ban all obscenity, leaving it to state law. The federal statutes prohibit obscenity in various forms and locations, including federal land, buildings, mail, radio, television, interstate commerce, and transportation. It is a crime to sell or possess with intent to sell any obscene visual depiction in specific jurisdictions. Additionally, mailing obscene material is considered nonmailable matter and is prohibited by law. The federal statutes prohibit obscenity in various forms and locations, including federal land, buildings, mail, radio, television, interstate commerce, and transportation. It is a crime to sell or possess with intent to sell any obscene visual depiction in specific jurisdictions. Additionally, mailing obscene material is considered nonmailable matter and is prohibited by law. Section 1462 prohibits importation and transportation of obscene material, including printed matter, film, sound recordings, and other indecent content. The Supreme Court has clarified that the terms used in this section should be limited to patently offensive representations of specific \"hard core\" sexual conduct. In 1996, the law was amended to include any \"interactive computer service.\" The federal statutes prohibit obscenity in various forms and locations, including federal land, buildings, mail, radio, television, interstate commerce, and transportation. It is a crime to sell or possess with intent to sell any obscene visual depiction in specific jurisdictions. Additionally, mailing obscene material is considered nonmailable matter and is prohibited by law. Section 1462 prohibits importation and transportation of obscene material, including printed matter, film, sound recordings, and other indecent content. The provision also covers postal cards with indecent or obscene language written or printed on them. Broadcasting obscene, indecent, or profane language through radio communication can result in fines or imprisonment. This statute has broader application compared to others due to the limited First Amendment protection for broadcasting. In Co. v. Federal Communications Commission, the Supreme Court upheld the FCC's power to regulate indecent but not obscene radio broadcasts. Broadcasting is uniquely pervasive and accessible, leading to limited First Amendment protection compared to other media. The Court emphasized the narrowness of its holding regarding broadcast media and First Amendment protection. The FCC's regulation of indecent language on broadcasts is connected to exposure and accepted standards of morality. The FCC regulates indecent language on broadcasts to protect children from exposure to offensive content. Congress has passed laws requiring the FCC to ban such broadcasts during certain hours, but court rulings have limited the extent of these regulations. Public radio and television stations are subject to regulations on broadcasting indecent material, with a ban on airing such content between 10 p.m. and midnight. Court rulings have upheld these regulations, citing the government's interest in protecting children from indecent broadcasts. The court ruled that the ban on broadcasting indecent material between 10 p.m. and midnight is unconstitutional. This decision was made after the FCC overturned a ruling regarding Bono's use of the word \"f[***]ing\" during the Golden Globe Awards. The FCC considered the word to have a sexual connotation, leading to a finding of profanity. The FCC's ban on broadcasting indecent material between 10 p.m. and midnight was ruled unconstitutional after the court overturned the FCC's policy on \"fleeting expletives\" in response to Bono's use of a profane phrase during the Golden Globe Awards. The court found the FCC's new policy arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. The FCC's ban on broadcasting indecent material between 10 p.m. and midnight was ruled unconstitutional after the court overturned the FCC's policy on \"fleeting expletives\" in response to Bono's profane phrase during the Golden Globe Awards. The court found the FCC's new policy arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. The Supreme Court later reversed the Second Circuit's decision regarding the FCC's explanation of its decision, leaving open the question of whether censorship of fleeting expletives violates the First Amendment. Section 1465, as amended by P.L. 109-248, makes it a crime to produce, transport, or distribute obscene material using interstate or foreign commerce. The term \"facility of commerce\" includes federal highways and railroads. The President's message accompanying the 1988 amendment clarifies the scope of this provision. The amended Section 1465 criminalizes the production, transportation, or distribution of obscene material using interstate or foreign commerce, including federal highways and railroads. The term \"means of interstate commerce\" encompasses motor vehicles, boats, and airplanes. In a 1994 case, a couple from California was convicted under this law for transmitting obscenity over interstate phone lines through a computer bulletin board. The Sixth Circuit upheld the conviction, ruling that the law applies to computer transmissions. The court found that BBS operators may need to censor materials to comply with community standards. In 1996, the law was amended to criminalize the production and distribution of obscene material through interactive computer services. The PROTECT Act, P.L. 108 - 21 (2003), makes it a crime for individuals involved in producing or selling obscene material to receive or possess such material with intent to distribute. Offering to sell two or more copies of obscene publications creates a presumption of being \"engaged in the business.\" Section 1466A of the PROTECT Act criminalizes the production, distribution, receipt, or possession of any visual depiction, including drawings or sculptures, depicting a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct that is obscene or lacks serious value. It applies even if no actual minor is involved, but only covers specific sexual activities, not lascivious exhibition of genitals. Criminal forfeiture is provided for in obscenity cases under this section. In 2006, P.L. 109-248 repealed subsections of section 1467 and made the Controlled Substances Act applicable to criminal forfeiture of property. It is a crime to distribute obscene material through cable television or subscription services, with distribution including transmissions by wire, microwave, or satellite. The section defines \"distribute\" to include transmissions by \"wire, microwave, or satellite.\" 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0559 makes it a crime to transmit obscene material over any cable system. Section 1468 clarifies federal enforcement of obscenity laws and states that states have the power to regulate obscene language and material distribution. The section creates a presumption that items transported across state lines or from outside the US were done so in interstate or foreign commerce. It is a crime to knowingly transfer obscene material to a person under 16 using mail or interstate commerce. The Communications Act of 1934, codified in title 47 of the U.S. Code, regulates obscenity and indecency on cable television. In Turner Broadcasting System v. Federal Communications Commission, the Supreme Court affirmed cable television's full First Amendment protection. However, in Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission, the Court's position on cable regulation was revisited. In Denver Consortium opinion, a plurality of Justices upheld \u00a7 10(a) of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, allowing cable operators to prohibit indecent material on leased access channels. The Court noted that cable television is as accessible to children as broadcast television and has a pervasive presence in Americans' lives. The Court upheld \u00a7 10(a) of the 1992 Act, allowing cable operators to prohibit indecent material on leased access channels, citing the pervasive presence of cable television in American lives. In contrast, the Court struck down \u00a7 10(b) for not being narrowly tailored to protect children from objectionable content. In Part IV, the Court struck down \u00a7 10(c), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 531 note, which allowed cable operators to ban indecent material on public access channels. The justices found that the government failed to show that the statute was necessary to protect children or appropriately tailored for that purpose. Another relevant statute is 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 544(d)(1), which allows franchising authorities and cable operators to restrict obscene or constitutionally unprotected cable services. The Communications Decency Act of 1996 included provisions regarding cable television, such as allowing cable operators to provide devices for subscribers to restrict viewing of obscene or indecent programming. Additionally, cable operators are required to fully scramble or block audio and video programming upon request by a subscriber. Section 505 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 requires multichannel video programming distributors to fully scramble or block sexually explicit adult programming on channels primarily dedicated to such content to prevent non-subscribers from accessing it. Additionally, distributors must limit children's access to this programming during certain hours until compliance is achieved. The Supreme Court declared \u00a7 505 of the Communications Decency Act unconstitutional in 2000, applying strict scrutiny to content-based speech restrictions on cable television to shield children from inappropriate content. Cable operators were required to implement more effective scrambling or time channel programming to comply with the statute. The Supreme Court found \u00a7 505 of the Communications Decency Act unconstitutional in 2000, ruling that cable operators had to restrict sexually-oriented programming only from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. to protect children. The Court noted that the statute needed to pass strict scrutiny as it was a content-based speech restriction. The Supreme Court ruled in 2000 that \u00a7 505 of the Communications Decency Act, which required cable operators to restrict sexually-oriented programming, was unconstitutional. The Court emphasized that any speech regulation based on content must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. The focus was on whether \u00a7 505 was the least restrictive means to protect children, highlighting the difference between cable television and broadcasting media in terms of blocking unwanted channels. This targeted blocking was seen as a way to support parental authority without infringing on First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court ruled in 2000 that \u00a7 505 of the Communications Decency Act, requiring cable operators to restrict sexually-oriented programming, was unconstitutional. The Court emphasized the need for narrow content-based speech restrictions to protect children while preserving First Amendment rights. The Court found that \u00a7 504 provided a less restrictive alternative to \u00a7 505, allowing cable operators to fully block unwanted programming upon subscriber request. Additionally, \u00a7 506 permitted cable operators to refuse to transmit \"obscenity, indecency, or nudity.\" The Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA) allows cable operators to refuse to transmit \"obscenity, indecency, or nudity\" on public access and leased access channels. Section 502 of the act aimed to limit indecent material transmitted by telecommunications devices and interactive computer services, but was deemed unconstitutional in Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union. The Supreme Court struck down certain sections of the act, including 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 223(a) and (d). Prior to its amendment by the PROTECT Act, \u00a7 223(a)(1)(A) and (B) made it a crime to transmit obscene or indecent communications via telecommunications devices. Section 223(a)(2) criminalizes knowingly allowing telecommunications facilities to be used for prohibited activities. The CDA defines \"telecommunications\" but not \"telecommunications device.\" The CDA defines \"telecommunications,\" but not \"telecommunications device.\" Section 223(a)(1)(A) and (B) now bans only obscenity and child pornography, both of which are unprotected by the First Amendment. Section 603 of the PROTECT Act amended \u00a7\u00a0223(a)(1)(B) to ban only obscenity and child pornography, removing the constitutional issue raised by ApolloMedia Corp. v. Reno. Prior to the amendment, \u00a7\u00a0223(d) prohibited the transmission of indecent material to minors, which was deemed unconstitutional in Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union. Section 603 of the PROTECT Act amended \u00a7 223(d)(1) by substituting \"is obscene or child pornography\" for the words italicized above, removing the constitutional issue raised by Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union. The Supreme Court found the CDA to be a content-based blanket restriction on speech, which must serve to promote a compelling interest and be the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest. The Court acknowledged the congressional goal of protecting children from harmful materials but suggested less governmental interest in protecting older children from indecent material with artistic or educational value. The Supreme Court found the CDA to be a content-based restriction on speech, stating that the government failed to show why a less restrictive provision would not be as effective. The Court emphasized that the burden on adult speech is unacceptable if there are less restrictive alternatives available. It did not rule out the possibility of a narrower, constitutional version of the CDA. Arguments were made for alternatives like tagging indecent material for parental control. President Clinton signed the Child Online Protection Act (COPA) into law in 1998, aiming to regulate internet content for parental control. However, COPA was deemed unconstitutional and never enforced due to legal challenges. The Child Online Protection Act (COPA) was deemed unconstitutional and never enforced due to legal challenges. It differs from the Communications Decency Act (CDA) by prohibiting communication of material harmful to minors on publicly accessible websites for commercial purposes. It defines harmful material as appealing to prurient interest and depicting offensive sexual content. The Child Online Protection Act (COPA) prohibits communication of material harmful to minors on commercial websites, requiring serious value for minors and excluding non-commercial websites. The Child Online Protection Act (COPA) was challenged by civil liberties groups before taking effect on November 20, 1998. Judge Reed issued a temporary restraining order against enforcement of the law on November 19, 1998. The court issued a preliminary injunction against enforcing the law, which applies to all Internet users and prevents retroactive prosecution. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the injunction, and the Supreme Court later affirmed it after further proceedings. On June 29, 2004, the Supreme Court affirmed a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of COPA. A federal district court later found COPA unconstitutional and issued a permanent injunction on March 22, 2007. The Third Circuit affirmed this decision on July 22, 2008. The district court noted Congress's interest in protecting minors but questioned if COPA was the least restrictive means to achieve this goal. The court suggested that filtering technology could be as effective as COPA in protecting minors online without restricting adult speech. It also proposed that the prohibited content under COPA could have been more narrowly defined to target specific types of material, such as images used as teasers on adult websites, to avoid excessive criminal penalties. The Third Circuit affirmed that COPA's standard for determining material harmful to minors imposes an impermissible burden on First Amendment speech by applying community standards to a nationwide audience. The Third Circuit concluded that the government's compelling interest in protecting children does not justify regulating speech if even the least restrictive means of regulation is still unreasonable. The Supreme Court found that COPA's use of 'community standards' to identify harmful material to minors is not facially unconstitutional, but remanded the case to consider its overall constitutionality. The Third Circuit considered whether the use of community standards in COPA was unconstitutional. Justice Stevens dissented, believing it was a problem. The Court stated that COPA's use of community standards alone does not make the statute unconstitutional, but it could be a factor. Justice Thomas, in the opinion for the Court, argued that any variance caused by community standards is not substantial enough to violate the First Amendment. Justice Stevens dissented, suggesting that the burden should be on parents to use mediums to avoid objectionable material before requiring speakers to find another forum. Justice Kennedy, in a concurring opinion, emphasized the need to assess the extent of speech covered by COPA and variations in community standards before determining if the act is overbroad. The Third Circuit should consider questions regarding the extent of material prohibited by COPA, differences in community standards, evaluating Internet material 'as a whole,' and the venues for prosecuting violations. Justices O'Connor and Breyer wrote separate concurring opinions, with O'Connor agreeing with Kennedy on lack of substantial overbreadth and Breyer suggesting a national standard for 'community standard.' The Third Circuit reaffirmed the district court's preliminary injunction, finding certain provisions of COPA not narrowly tailored to protect minors from harmful material. The Third Circuit found that certain provisions of COPA failed the strict scrutiny test due to issues with the definitions of 'material that is harmful to minors,' 'commercial purposes,' and the 'affirmative defenses' for publishers. The court specifically noted problems with judging material 'as a whole' and the lack of context in determining if it appeals to minors' prurient interests. The court found issues with the definitions of 'material that is harmful to minors,' 'commercial purposes,' and the 'affirmative defenses' for publishers in COPA. The definitions were deemed not narrowly drawn and not tailored to proscribe commercial pornographers, leading to a wide range of protected expression being prohibited. The affirmative defense was also seen as likely deterring adults from accessing restricted content. The court found that COPA's requirements for publishers may deter adults from accessing restricted content. The Third Circuit suggested that voluntary blocking and filtering techniques could be less restrictive in preventing minors' access to harmful material. The Supreme Court affirmed a preliminary injunction in 2004, stating that COPA may be substantially overbroad. The Court found that the government failed to prove that alternatives to COPA would be less effective. Filters were highlighted as a primary alternative to COPA, being less restrictive and potentially more effective in preventing minors from accessing harmful content on the internet. The District Court found that filters are more effective than age verification screens in preventing minors from accessing harmful content online. Justice Breyer argued that COPA's burden on protected speech is modest and that it does not censor material but requires age verification. He also stated that blocking and filtering software is not a less restrictive alternative as it is already in use. Justice Breyer argued that filtering software is not a less restrictive alternative to COPA as it is already part of the status quo. He highlighted four inadequacies of filters and noted that COPA applies to a significant portion of commercial pornography on the internet. Justice Scalia also dissented, stating that material harmful to minors is not protected by the First Amendment. The district court later found COPA to be unconstitutional. The district court found COPA unconstitutional due to its lack of narrow tailoring to Congress' compelling interest, failure to be the least restrictive alternative, and being vague and overbroad. COPA was deemed overinclusive, covering more speech than necessary, and underinclusive as it didn't apply to foreign-origin sexually explicit material. The Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) amended federal statutes to require schools and libraries to enforce technology protection measures for minors' Internet access. The Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) mandates the use of technology protection measures in schools and libraries to block access to obscene, child pornography, or harmful content for minors, and to block obscene or child pornography for adults. The act allows for disabling the blocking technology for lawful purposes or research. The definitions of \"minor,\" \"obscene,\" \"child pornography,\" and \"harmful to minors\" are outlined in the legal context. A minor is defined as a person under 17, while obscene content is referred to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1460. Child pornography is defined as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor, as per 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256. Child pornography does not need to meet the Miller test for obscenity to be considered illegal. The legal context outlines definitions of \"minor,\" \"obscene,\" \"child pornography,\" and \"harmful to minors.\" \"Material that is harmful to minors\" is defined as content that appeals to prurient interest, is patently offensive, and lacks serious value. In United States v. American Library Association, CIPA was declared unconstitutional for applying to libraries. CIPA, similar to CDA but unlike COPA, allows the government to appeal directly to the Supreme Court. In 2003, the Supreme Court upheld CIPA as constitutional. The decision included opinions from Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justices Kennedy and Breyer concurring, and Justices Stevens and Souter dissenting. The Court examined whether public libraries violate the First Amendment by using the filtering software required by CIPA. The majority concluded that CIPA does not infringe on library patrons' rights. The Supreme Court upheld CIPA as constitutional in 2003, ruling that Internet access in public libraries is not a designated public forum. The government did not have to prove a compelling interest for CIPA, despite acknowledging the tendency of filtering software to overblock. The Supreme Court upheld CIPA as constitutional in 2003, ruling that Internet access in public libraries is not a designated public forum. The plurality found that CIPA does not impose an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of federal assistance for public libraries. It does not penalize libraries that choose not to use filtering software, but simply requires public funds to be spent for their authorized purposes. The Supreme Court upheld CIPA as constitutional in 2003, ruling that it does not impose an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of federal assistance for public libraries. The plurality viewed CIPA as addressing the issue of overblocking adequately through its disabling provisions. Justice Kennedy suggested that any challenges regarding specific website blocking or burdening adult users' access to constitutionally protected material should be made through an as-applied challenge. Justice Breyer proposed a form of heightened scrutiny to assess CIPA's constitutionality. Justice Stevens and Justice Souter disagreed on the constitutionality of CIPA. Stevens believed CIPA was constitutional, while Souter found it unconstitutional due to the issue of overblocking. Stevens argued that the harm to speech-related interests was not disproportionate, while Souter raised concerns about patrons not knowing what was being hidden by the filters. The Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002, P.L. 107 - 317, directs the NTIA to establish a \"new domain\" for minors, with a focus on suitable content and unblocking policies at local libraries. The statute allows for unblocking but does not mandate it, leaving the decision to the library's discretion. The Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002 established a new domain for minors, focusing on appropriate content and unblocking policies at local libraries. The provision in the child pornography statute criminalizes the use of misleading domain names to deceive individuals into viewing obscene or harmful material. It defines \"harmful to minors\" based on the Miller test for obscenity as applied to minors. The provision in the child pornography statute criminalizes embedding words or digital images into website source code to deceive individuals into viewing obscenity or harmful material. It defines \"harmful to minors\" based on the Miller test for obscenity as applied to minors. The Act of 2003, P.L. 108-187, prohibits sending sexually oriented commercial emails to a \"protected computer\" without prior consent or proper markings. The FTC-prescribed marks must be included in the subject heading or initial viewable message. The Act of 2003 prohibits sending sexually oriented commercial emails without consent or proper markings. The FTC-prescribed marks may be in the body of the email if the sender complies with specific requirements, including clear identification as an advertisement, notice to decline future messages, and a valid physical address. The final rule by the Federal Trade Commission excludes sexually oriented material from the subject heading of spam emails. The Act of 2003 prohibits sexually oriented spam without proper markings. The rule requires the subject heading to start with \"SEXUALLY-EXPLICIT:\" and the message to include specific information like clear identification as an advertisement and a way for recipients to opt-out. The Video Voyeurism Prevention Act of 2004 prohibits capturing images of private areas without consent in certain jurisdictions. It defines private areas as genitals, pubic area, buttocks, or female breast below the top of the areola. The act includes actions like videotaping, photographing, filming, recording, or broadcasting electronically. The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was amended in 1984 to include obscenity crimes as racketeering activity. This allows prosecution under RICO for engaging in at least two acts of racketeering activity within ten years, including obscenity offenses. The Supreme Court ruled in Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana that pretrial seizure of expressive materials under the Indiana RICO statute was unconstitutional. The Federal RICO statute does not allow for pretrial seizure, and the presumption of First Amendment protection for books and films must be rebutted in an adversary proceeding. The inclusion of obscenity violations as predicate offenses under RICO was upheld as constitutional. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of including obscenity violations as predicate offenses under a RICO statute. The Court ruled that prior convictions for obscenity are not required for prosecution under RICO, as long as the standard of proof for all elements of the RICO allegation is met. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of including obscenity violations as predicate offenses under a RICO statute, ruling that prior convictions for obscenity are not required as long as all constitutional requirements are met. The jurisdiction where the predicate offenses occurred does not need to be the same as where the RICO charge is brought, as long as each offense was measured by the appropriate community's standard. In Alexander v. United States, the Court addressed First Amendment limitations to RICO forfeitures of assets involving expressive materials protected by the First Amendment. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of including obscenity violations as predicate offenses under a RICO statute. The defendant was convicted under RICO for selling obscene materials and sentenced to prison, fined, and ordered to forfeit his businesses and assets. The Court rejected the argument that the forfeiture of expressive materials constitutes prior restraint. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of including obscenity violations as predicate offenses under a RICO statute, allowing for stringent criminal sanctions and forfeiture of assets related to racketeering activities. The Court remanded the case to determine if the forfeiture was an excessive fine under the Eighth Amendment. Additionally, the Court ruled that the Excessive Fines Clause applies to property forfeitures imposed by criminal statutes. Federal judges can approve wire or oral communications interception to gather evidence of federal obscenity and child pornography violations. The PROTECT Act amended the statute to allow for authorization in child pornography cases. The statute at 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1305 prohibits the importation of obscene material and allows for civil forfeiture. Customs officers coordinate seizures with criminal prosecutions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1462. Some obscene material seized by Customs is forfeited under section 1305. The amendment to section 1305 allows for criminal prosecution of obscene material seized by Customs. Customs officers must transmit seizure information to the US Attorney for further action."
