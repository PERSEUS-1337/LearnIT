    "content": "The country's immigration laws have been controversial since America's founding. Unauthorized migration became an issue in the early 20th century, declined during the Great Depression and after WWII, and increased sharply in the 1970s. Congress responded in 1986 with the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which included a 50% increase in Border Patrol staffing. Border security has remained a persistent congressional concern since then. Despite a growing enforcement response, unauthorized migration continued to increase over the next three decades. Apprehensions of unauthorized migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border fell to a 41-year low in 2011 but then climbed again in subsequent years. The number of unauthorized migrants living in the United States also declined after 2007. In 2014, the Obama Administration announced executive actions to address immigration issues, including a security plan at the southern border. The report reviews efforts to combat unauthorized migration across the Southwest border since the 1990s, taking stock of current border security and lessons learned about enhanced enforcement. Some Members of Congress argue for securing the border before considering additional immigration reforms. The report summarizes the history of U.S. Border Patrol, which was created in 1924 to enforce immigration restrictions, focusing initially on Chinese migrants and gun trafficking. It also discusses the costs and benefits of current migration control strategies. The U.S. Border Patrol was established in 1924 to enforce immigration restrictions, initially targeting Chinese migrants and gun trafficking. It later became part of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in 1933, focusing on the northern border. During World War II, the focus shifted to the Southwest border. Unauthorized migration from Mexico increased after 1965 due to legislative changes and economic factors. Congress began holding hearings on unauthorized migration in 1971, leading to debates and eventual legislation. The U.S. Border Patrol was established in 1924 to enforce immigration restrictions, focusing on Chinese migrants and gun trafficking. Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which emphasized border enforcement and increased funding for the Border Patrol. Subsequent laws addressed unauthorized migration, with the Border Patrol developing its first national border control strategy in 1994. The INS changed its approach to focus on preventing unauthorized migrants' entry by placing personnel, surveillance technology, and infrastructure on the border. This strategy, known as \"prevention through deterrence,\" aimed to disrupt traditional entry routes and deter illegal traffic. The plan had four phases starting with high-migration border patrol sectors in San Diego, CA, El Paso, TX, Tucson, AZ, Del Rio, TX, Laredo, TX, and McAllen, TX. The INS implemented a strategy called \"prevention through deterrence\" to prevent unauthorized migrants' entry by placing personnel, surveillance technology, and infrastructure on the border. This strategy had four phases targeting different border patrol sectors and included initiatives like Operation Gatekeeper, Operation Safeguard, and Operation Hold the Line to stem unauthorized migration and interdict drug trafficking. Operation Rio Grande was initiated at the McAllen Border Patrol Sector to increase the number of border patrol agents and implement innovative resources like IDENT terminals. The initiative also included the installation of fences and other infrastructure improvements. Apprehensions in the San Diego and El Paso sectors decreased sharply in 1994-1995, indicating the success of the operation. In 1994-1995, San Diego and El Paso sectors saw a sharp decline in apprehensions, leading to a shift in traffic patterns to Tucson and South Texas sectors. A 1997 GAO report was cautiously optimistic about the strategy, supported by Congress. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 authorized the construction of fencing and barriers along the Southwest border. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, USBP refocused its efforts. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the USBP refocused its priorities on preventing terrorist penetration and illicit trafficking. The National Border Patrol Strategy was created to reflect the post-9/11 security landscape, emphasizing interdicting terrorists and improving enforcement through technology. The National Border Patrol Strategy (NBPS) aims to deter smugglers of humans, drugs, and contraband by leveraging \"Smart Border\" technology. It focuses on achieving \"operational control\" over the border through a hierarchical command structure and the use of intelligence and surveillance systems to assess risk and target enforcement efforts. Rapid deployment of USBP agents is emphasized to respond to emerging threats. The Border Patrol Strategic Plan (BPSP) in 2012 shifted focus to strategic resource allocation against high threats and rapid border response. It emphasized information collection, integration of planning across sectors and agencies, and quick response to specific threats. This approach aligns with broader DHS policies. The Department of Homeland Security announced the Secure Border Initiative (SBI) in November 2005 to secure U.S. borders and reduce unauthorized migration. SBI aimed to obtain operational control of the northern and southern borders within five years by increasing staffing and improving detention and removal capacity. DHS announced plans in October 2005 to detain all non-Mexicans at the border for removal, increasing bed space by 2,000. By August 2006, the \"end catch and release\" policy was successfully implemented, along with the expansion of surveillance technology and tactical infrastructure. CBP's approach to border control includes expanding enforcement within the United States through various partnerships and programs to locate fugitive migrants. Since 2005, CBP has limited voluntary returns for unauthorized Mexicans apprehended at the border in favor of \"high consequence\" outcomes to deter unauthorized flows. CBP has designed the Consequence Delivery System to evaluate and deter further illegal activity by apprehended migrants. USBP agents use laminated cards with matrices to determine enforcement actions based on immigration and criminal histories. The goal is to ensure that nearly all apprehended individuals face consequences other than voluntary return. The Border Patrol has implemented the Consequence Delivery System to estimate the deterrent effect of different enforcement outcomes. They track recidivism rates for 10 enforcement consequences, taking into account migrants' migration histories. Secretary Johnson has commissioned three Joint Task Forces to bring together personnel from CBP, USCG, ICE, and USCIS. The Department of Homeland Security has commissioned three Joint Task Forces to integrate personnel from various agencies like CBP, USCG, ICE, and USCIS. The task forces will have geographically based and functionally focused responsibilities, with a 90-day timeframe to realign personnel and establish headquarters capabilities. Strategic changes since 1986 have influenced border enforcement appropriations and CBP's assets at the border. The U.S. Border Patrol appropriations have steadily increased from $263 million in FY1990 to $3.8 billion in FY2015, with the largest growth seen after the formation of DHS in FY2003. These appropriations are a subset of all border security funding and do not include additional CBP sub-accounts. The U.S. Border Patrol appropriations have increased significantly over the years, reaching $3.8 billion in FY2015. This funding includes accounts for Ports of Entry, Border Security Fencing, Automation Modernization, Air and Marine Operations, and Construction and Facilities Management. Congress has passed laws authorizing increased Border Patrol personnel, leading to a doubling of USBP staffing multiple times since 1986. In FY2015, the U.S. Border Patrol had 20,273 agents, with 17,522 stationed at the Southwest border. The National Guard is authorized to support law enforcement agencies at the border under Title 10 of the U.S. Code. They can assist in counterterrorism, counterdrug, immigration, and customs enforcement operations. National Guard personnel can also serve federal purposes like border security under Title 32 of the U.S. Code. National Guard troops can support border security and receive federal pay while under state governors' command. They have been deployed to the border since 1988, with a significant deployment in 2006-2008 for \"Operation Jump Start.\" In 2010, President Obama announced an additional deployment of up to 1,200 troops to support the Border Patrol in intelligence work and combating drug and human trafficking. In 2010, President Obama deployed up to 1,200 National Guard troops to support Border Patrol in intelligence work and combating drug and human trafficking. The deployment was extended multiple times until December 2013. In 2014, Texas Governor Greg Abbott sent 1,000 troops to the Southwest border in response to child migrant influx. Governor Abbott extended their deployment in December 2015 to address increasing numbers of child migrants in FY2016. Alabama Governor Robert Bentley ordered Alabama National Guard support to the Southwest border in April 2016, deploying one helicopter and three pilots to Marana, AZ. Border tactical infrastructure, including roads, lighting, fencing, and barriers, aims to impede illicit activities and apprehend terrorists. The construction of fencing and barriers was authorized by Congress under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) mandated the construction of a triple-layered fence near San Diego. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 required double-layered fencing along 850 miles of the Southwest border. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2008 further amended IIRIRA to mandate reinforced fencing along at least 700 miles of the border, along with additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors for operational control. As of May 2015, DHS installed 653 miles of primary pedestrian and vehicle fencing along the international border. Border Patrol identified 653 miles of the border as suitable for fencing and barriers. Annual appropriations for tactical infrastructure increased significantly from $25 million in FY1996 to $1.5 billion in FY2007. Annual appropriations for tactical infrastructure increased significantly from $25 million in FY1996 to $1.5 billion in FY2007, with BSFIT appropriations decreasing for seven consecutive years before increasing to $447 million in FY2016. The Border Patrol utilizes advanced technology, with its border surveillance system originating from the INS's Integrated Surveillance Information System (ISIS) in 1998, which later became part of the America's Shield Initiative (ASI) in 2005 and then the Secure Border Initiative (SBI) in 2006. The border surveillance system, initially known as ISIS, later became ASI and then SBI. It included remote video surveillance systems, sensors, and an ICAD database. The system aimed to provide seamless coverage of the border by combining feeds from cameras and sensors into a central control room. However, deployment timelines were challenging for all three systems. DHS faced criticism for non-competitive contracting practices, oversight issues, and cost overruns with the ASI and SBI net border surveillance systems. Secretary Napolitano ordered a review of SBI net in 2010, leading to its termination in 2011 due to technical problems and delays. The Border Patrol now uses a mix of surveillance technologies under the Arizona Surveillance Technology Plan to meet specific border region needs. CBP's acquisitions strategy focuses on flexible equipment and mobile technology for border surveillance. They deploy manned and unmanned aircraft, as well as marine vessels, to patrol inaccessible regions. As of October 2015, CBP's Air and Marine Operations deployed 19 types of aircraft and three classes of marine vessels from over 91 locations. CBP reported increased flight hours and decreased underway hours in marine vessels for FY2014. They operated 9 UAS as of March 2016, with 5,502 flight hours in FY2015. CBP evaluated unmanned aerostat systems in 2012 with support from DOD, finding them useful for border operations. CBP is working with DOD to transfer ownership of aerostats for border operations. Border Patrol records deportable migrant apprehensions as primary indicator of immigration enforcement. Additional measures include unique apprehensions, recidivism, turn backs, and got aways. Apprehensions are correlated with unauthorized flows, as shown in Figure 4 depicting historical trends from FY1960-FY2015. The data in Figure 4 shows historical trends in unauthorized migration, with apprehensions reaching a peak in 1986 and 2000. From 1983-2006, over 1.2 million apprehensions were recorded annually. However, apprehensions have significantly decreased since 2000, with 2011 and 2012 seeing the lowest levels since the 1970s. This decline may be due to reduced unauthorized inflows, possibly influenced by enforcement efforts or economic factors. Apprehensions along the Southwest border increased from FY2012 to FY2014, reaching 486,651 in FY2014 before dropping to 337,117 in FY2015. The majority of apprehensions occurred in the Rio Grande Valley Sector, with 44% of them taking place there. Enforcement efforts in certain Border Patrol sectors have led to fluctuations in apprehension numbers, aligning with the 1994 National Strategic Plan. Border enforcement in San Diego and El Paso sectors was effective, with apprehensions remaining low throughout the following decade. However, apprehensions in Tucson, Laredo, and Del Rio sectors increased in the late 1990s. By FY2014, apprehensions in Tucson fell to their lowest level since 1993, while apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley increased before falling in FY2015. Despite this, apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley now make up over a third of Southwest border apprehensions. Success in border enforcement has been seen since the mid-1990s. Since the mid-1990s, border enforcement success was observed in San Diego and El Paso sectors, while Tucson and other sectors experienced challenges. Apprehensions data record events and unique subjects apprehended per year, tracking recidivism rates since 2005. The Consequence Delivery System aims to reduce recidivism, with rates slightly increasing between FY2005 and FY2007. Recidivism rates have fluctuated over the years, increasing slightly between FY2005 and FY2007 but falling to 14% in FY2015. Border Patrol estimates unauthorized entrants who successfully reach the U.S. interior, including \"got aways\" and \"turn backs.\" These data are used for tactical decision making and resource allocation, although challenges exist in measuring these metrics across different border sectors. Border Patrol enforcement data do not accurately measure overall border security or unauthorized inflows due to reliance on resources. Current metrics are insufficient, leading to the development of alternative methods to estimate unauthorized border flows and describe security. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) uses metrics to assess border security at strategic and operational levels. They are developing a new metric using the capture-recapture method to estimate unauthorized migrant flows. DHS also tracks recidivism rates and interdiction effectiveness along the Southwest border in their annual performance reports. The USBP conducts risk assessments at the sector level using the \"State of the Border Risk Methodology\" to estimate the magnitude of risk through intelligence information. These assessments help make day-to-day resource decisions, monitoring metrics like recidivism rate and effectiveness rate. Analysts agree that unauthorized border crossings decreased significantly around 2005. The number of unauthorized border crossers fell sharply between 2005 and 2011, with some rise in unauthorized flows from 2012 to 2014, and a decrease in 2015. This conclusion is supported by key Border Patrol enforcement data, including a drop in total apprehensions and estimated entries. Survey data also confirm a drop in unauthorized inflows, with a significant decrease in the percentage of Mexican men initiating unauthorized trips to the United States since 2002. Estimates show a decrease in unauthorized trips to the United States from 1970 to 2007. The unauthorized population dropped by 1 million from 2007 to 2014. Net migration between Mexico and the US resulted in a net loss of 140,000 from 2009 to 2014. Border Patrol sectors showed improved effectiveness rates between FY2006 and FY2011, with the Tucson sector improving from 67% to 87%. Border enforcement effectiveness rates varied across different sectors in FY2011, with some sectors achieving rates above 80% and others between 60% and 70%. Factors such as the U.S. economic downturn since 2007 and changes in Mexico and other countries of origin also influence unauthorized migration, making it difficult to determine the sole impact of enforcement efforts. Border enforcement measures have been implemented during the severe recession since the 1930s, leading to a drop in recidivism rates and deterring migrants. Studies show that enforcement affects the likelihood of migrants making additional trips, with surveys indicating a decrease in future immigration. Academic research from 2012 also supports the reduction in unauthorized flows due to border enforcement efforts. Recent academic research suggests that recent immigration enforcement efforts at the border and within the United States have had a greater deterrent effect on unauthorized migration compared to earlier efforts. However, uncertainty remains about the true level of border security as long as U.S. employment demand remains low. The discussion includes estimates of the primary costs and benefits of border enforcement, such as congressional appropriations and migrant apprehensions. Unauthorized border crossing is associated with border-area crime, violence, and migrant deaths. This unauthorized migration may also lead to environmental impacts, affect border communities, and influence U.S. foreign relations. The costs and benefits of border enforcement policies should consider these potential unintended consequences. Unauthorized border crossing is linked to border-area crime, violence, and migrant deaths. Enforcement policies may exacerbate adverse outcomes by increasing reliance on smugglers, leading to a rise in border violence. However, successful deterrence of unauthorized crossers could reduce these risks. Border enforcement aims to deter unauthorized crossers, potentially reducing crime and mortality. Law enforcement presence near the border can enhance public safety and protect vulnerable populations. Border cities like El Paso, TX, and San Diego, CA, are among the safest in the country. The specific impact of border enforcement on crime in border areas is unclear due to data limitations. Available data on migrant deaths along the Southwest border is also discussed. Data on migrant deaths along the Southwest border between 1985 and 1998 is presented, sourced from academic research, Mexican foreign ministry, Mexican media counts, and DHS. The figures likely underestimate actual deaths as some bodies may not be found, and data from the Mexican side is not included, further undercounting fatalities. Known migrant deaths decreased from 344 in 1988 to 171 in 1994 according to the Center for Immigration Research. Known migrant deaths along the Southwest border have fluctuated over the years, with a high of 344 in 1988, a low of 171 in 1994, and a peak of 492 in 2005. The average number of deaths per year was 431 in 2005-2009, dropping to 240 in FY2015. From FY1998 to FY2015, a total of 6,571 migrants have died, with an average of 365 deaths per year. The ACLU noted an increase in migrant deaths from 80 per year in 1994-1997 to 481 per year in 1998-2008. These trends suggest that border crossings have become more hazardous despite a decline in unauthorized entries. Border enforcement measures implemented in the 1990s have led to increased dangers and costs for unauthorized migrants crossing the border. This has resulted in some migrants settling permanently in the United States instead of returning home, a phenomenon known as the \"caging\" effect. Studies show that unauthorized migrants are staying longer in the US and starting families here, rather than making regular trips back to their home countries. In 2006, the probability of return for authorized migrants increased to 1.0, while unauthorized migrants' probability of return dropped to .21. Border enforcement has been a factor behind longer stays for migrants. Enhanced border enforcement may have led to an increase in unauthorized entries through ports of entry and other means. In 2009, a community in Mexico used six methods to enter the United States, with one in four unauthorized migrants passing through a port of entry using borrowed or fraudulent documents. UCSD researchers found that the probability of being apprehended at a port of entry without authorization was half as high as crossing between ports. Unauthorized migrants have turned to maritime routes as alternative strategies to cross the U.S.-Mexican border. Border enforcement also has potential unintended consequences on the environment. Border enforcement has complex effects on the environment due to changes in migrant behavior and enforcement actions. Unauthorized border crossers can damage sensitive environmental areas by cutting vegetation, causing wildfires, increasing erosion, and discarding trash. While enforcement can deter these behaviors, the construction of fencing and roads may harm border-area ecosystems, especially in remote and environmentally sensitive areas. Some environmental groups oppose border infrastructure projects in remote areas due to threats to rare species and ecosystems. Unauthorized migration may impose costs on local communities and undermine the rule of law. Successful border enforcement can benefit border communities by reducing unauthorized inflows, but some business owners have complained about certain border issues. Some business owners on the Southwest and Northern borders have complained about border enforcement efforts disrupting farming, ranching, and commercial activities. Concerns include barriers dividing communities, civil rights violations, racial profiling, wrongful detentions, and inadequate legal protections for migrants during fast-tracked criminal procedures. Some have raised concerns about mistreatment and abuse in CBP detention facilities, as well as the focus on high consequence enforcement potentially diverting resources from more serious crimes. Studies have shown a significant increase in immigration-related cases in federal courts, with immigration offenders accounting for a large portion of federal arrests. Additionally, short-term funding has been provided to courts to address the rise in immigration cases. The U.S. courts are facing a shortage of suitable facilities in some border locations due to increased prosecutions. U.S. border enforcement policies have effects on relations with Mexico and Canada, with collaborative efforts between the U.S. and Canada, including the Beyond the Border declaration signed by President Obama and Prime Minister Harper. Some Canadians have raised objections to information sharing and joint law enforcement efforts. Some Canadians have raised objections to information sharing and joint law enforcement provisions in the agreement, but border enforcement between ports is not a significant source of tension. The United States and Mexico cooperate extensively on border enforcement at the Southwest border, although immigration enforcement has occasionally caused bilateral tension. Mexicans are often targeted in U.S. immigration enforcement efforts, leading to concerns about border fencing, migrant deaths, and the protection of vulnerable groups. The U.S. has focused resources on its land borders since the 1980s to prevent unauthorized migration. Since the 1980s, the U.S. has focused resources on its land borders to prevent unauthorized migration, with investments in personnel, fencing, and surveillance assets increasing significantly post 9/11. The Border Patrol's apprehensions fell sharply in 2007-2011, reaching a 42-year low in FY2011, before increasing from 2012 to 2014 and falling in 2015. Recidivism rates have decreased, and unauthorized inflows were below levels observed in the two decades after IRCA's passage in 2009-2011, but increased somewhat in 2012. Unauthorized inflows increased somewhat in 2012 despite a decrease in recidivism rates and below-average levels observed after IRCA's passage. Migrants have adapted to tougher border conditions by finding alternative entry methods and staying longer. Congress members overseeing border security and immigration policy may need to consider potential unintended consequences on civil rights, human rights, quality of life, environment, and U.S.-regional relations when evaluating future border enforcement investments. Border infrastructure investments at the Southwest border may face diminishing returns, as additional miles of fencing become more expensive and less effective in deterring unauthorized migrants. Deploying more sophisticated surveillance systems across the northern and southern borders may also be questioned, as vast regions lack sufficient personnel to respond to unauthorized entries. Clear goals for border security allocation are necessary, as zero unauthorized migrant admissions may not be a realistic target. The report focuses on migration control at U.S. borders, which includes detecting weapons of mass destruction, narcotics, and combating human trafficking. Different border security goals require different investments and standards for successful enforcement outcomes. Debates on immigration control and border security could benefit from better metrics and a more analytical approach. The Border Patrol is analyzing recidivism data to improve enforcement outcomes. Various metrics for measuring border security have advantages and disadvantages. In immigration policy, focusing on the total number of unauthorized migrants in the U.S. is important, along with border flows and other factors like interior enforcement and visa policies. Members of Congress may consider these metrics in a possible immigration reform bill."
