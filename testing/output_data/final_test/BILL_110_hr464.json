    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Compassionate Assistance for Rape Emergencies Act of 2007\". It includes findings related to the act. The Congress finds that emergency contraception could help rape survivors avoid unintended pregnancies, as 50% of rape-related pregnancies end in abortion. Many hospitals do not routinely provide emergency contraception to sexually assaulted women, despite a 4.7% risk of pregnancy in survivors without contraception. Emergency contraception is deemed safe and effective by the FDA within 72 hours of sex. Early administration increases prevention likelihood. Medical associations support wider access for all women. Emergency contraception should be offered as standard care to female patients after sexual assault to prevent unintended pregnancy. Many women are unaware of emergency contraception, making it crucial for hospitals to provide it as a treatment option for sexual assault survivors. Hospitals should provide emergency contraceptives free of charge to sexual assault survivors. Federal funds for hospitals under title XVIII or XIX of the Social Security Act are contingent on meeting conditions for providing emergency contraception to sexual assault survivors. This includes offering medically accurate information about emergency contraception to women who report or are suspected victims of sexual assault. Emergency contraception is FDA-approved for women 18 and over as an over-the-counter medication to prevent pregnancy after unprotected intercourse. It is more effective when taken sooner and does not cause abortion or interrupt an established pregnancy. Hospitals must offer and provide emergency contraception promptly upon request. The information provided must be clear, concise, and easily understood, with provisions for translations. Services cannot be denied based on financial inability. Emergency contraception is FDA-approved to prevent pregnancy after unprotected intercourse. Hospitals must offer emergency contraception promptly upon request. In section 1861(e) of the Social Security Act, critical access hospitals are included. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. \"Sexual assault\" is defined as non-consensual coitus. This section becomes effective after 180 days from the enactment of the Act, with the Secretary required to publish criteria for implementation 30 days prior in the Federal Register."
