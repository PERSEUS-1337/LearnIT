    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Accounts Receivable Insurance Program Act\". Congress finds that small manufacturers are disproportionately affected by delays in payments of accounts receivable, especially during economic slowdowns. This leads to disruptions in the supply chain and hinders their ability to purchase raw materials, hire workers, and access credit. Additional assurance is needed to ensure customers pay their accounts on time. Small suppliers face cash flow issues due to delayed payments from downstream suppliers, particularly in financially troubled industries like the auto sector. Lenders view these suppliers as high risk, making it difficult for them to access credit. Government-backed receivables insurance could help middle-market companies secure the necessary credit lines for their daily operations. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
