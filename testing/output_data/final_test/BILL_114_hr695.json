    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Healthy Forest Management and Wildfire Prevention Act.\" The table of contents for this Act is provided. The \"Healthy Forest Management and Wildfire Prevention Act\" includes definitions and provisions for addressing bark beetle epidemic, drought, deteriorating forest health, and wildfire risks in high-risk areas of National Forest System and public lands. It allows for emergency hazardous fuels reduction projects and stewardship end result contracting projects. The Act defines terms like \"emergency hazardous fuels reduction project\" and \"high-risk area\" in the context of addressing bark beetle epidemic, drought, and deteriorating forest health conditions to prevent devastating wildfires in National Forest System and public lands. The term \"System\" refers to the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, while \"public lands\" is defined by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System and the Secretary of the Interior for public lands. The term \"State\" includes states with National Forest System land or public lands, including Puerto Rico. Congress declares bark beetle epidemic, drought, and deteriorating forest health conditions as imminent threat, leading to high risk of wildfires in States. States can designate high-risk areas on National Forest System and public lands. The Governor of a State may designate high-risk areas in the National Forest System and public lands to address deteriorating forest health conditions due to bark beetle epidemic or drought, and prevent future insect infestations or disease outbreaks. Consultation with county governments and affected Indian tribes is required, and certain areas like National Wilderness Preservation System components are excluded from designation. Designation of high-risk areas in the National Forest System and public lands must adhere to standards and guidelines in land management plans. Initial designations should occur within 60 days of enactment, with a duration of 20 years unless terminated earlier by the State Governor. The Governor can redesignate a high-risk area in the National Forest System or public lands after 20 years if it still meets the criteria. Designation of a high-risk area does not limit access for hunting, fishing, or other activities, nor does it affect valid existing rights on the land. SEC. 5. DESIGNATION OF HIGH-RISK AREAS BY THE SECRETARY CONCERNED. The Secretary concerned may designate high-risk areas of the National Forest System and public lands to address deteriorating forest health conditions due to bark beetle epidemics, drought, and the risk of wildfires. Consultation with Governors, county governments, and Indian tribes is required. Certain areas like National Wilderness Preservation components are excluded from designation. Designation of high-risk areas in the National Forest System and public lands is required to address forest health issues. The first areas should be designated within 60 days of the enactment of the Act, and the designation expires after 20 years unless terminated earlier by the Secretary concerned. The expiration of the 20-year period specified in subsection (f) does not prevent the Secretary from redesignating a high-risk area if it continues to meet the criteria. Such redesignation requires consultation with relevant stakeholders. The designation of a high-risk area does not limit access or existing rights to the land. SEC. 6. USE OF EMERGENCY HAZARDOUS FUELS REDUCTION PROJECTS FOR HIGH-RISK AREAS. Upon designation of a high-risk area in a State, the Governor or the Secretary concerned may develop emergency hazardous fuels reduction projects. These projects must consider managing rights of way, protecting watersheds, wildlife habitats, water resources, and local communities from wildfires. Thinning the forest for optimal health and longevity is emphasized. The Governor or Secretary may develop emergency hazardous fuels reduction projects in high-risk areas, consulting with county governments and Indian tribes. Proposed projects must be submitted to the Secretary for implementation within 60 days. The Governor or Secretary may develop emergency hazardous fuels reduction projects in high-risk areas, consulting with county governments and Indian tribes. The Secretary shall implement proposed projects within 60 days of receiving the proposal. SEC. 7. APPLICABILITY OF EXPEDITED PROCEDURES AND AUTHORITIES OF HEALTHY FORESTS RESTORATION ACT OF 2003 TO EMERGENCY HAZARDOUS FUELS REDUCTION PROJECTS. Title I of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 applies to emergency hazardous fuels reduction projects under section 6, with required modifications by the Secretary concerned. The authority extends to the entire high-risk area, including land outside wildland-urban interface areas. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 applies to emergency hazardous fuels reduction projects, authorizing the Secretary to carry out necessary actions without extensive environmental assessments. The Secretary can evaluate recommendations from a community wildfire protection plan for an emergency hazardous fuels reduction project in at-risk communities. Forest management plans for projects in high-risk areas must align with land management guidelines. The Secretary can modify land management guidelines for high-risk areas. NEPA responsibilities cannot be delegated for emergency hazardous fuels reduction projects. Categorical exclusion may apply for projects involving insect-infected tree removal in high-risk areas. In high-risk areas, the removal of insect-infected trees or hazardous fuels near infrastructure exempts the project from environmental assessment requirements under NEPA, as long as it follows agency procedures and land management plans. SEC. 8. Authorized duration of stewardship end result contracting project contracts is extended from 10 years to 20 years under the Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003."
