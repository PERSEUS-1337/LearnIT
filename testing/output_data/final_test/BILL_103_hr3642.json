The Act \"Commercial Mortgage Capital Availability Act of 1993\" sets accounting principles and capital requirements for insured depository institutions transferring mortgage loans with recourse. The principles must align with generally accepted accounting principles, and institutions must establish a reserve to cover liabilities and only consider the maximum amount at risk as an asset for capital standards. The Act \"Commercial Mortgage Capital Availability Act of 1993\" establishes accounting principles and capital requirements for insured depository institutions transferring mortgage loans with recourse. Qualified insured depository institutions must be well capitalized or adequately capitalized with approval from the appropriate Federal banking agency. The total outstanding amount at risk for transfers of mortgage loans shall not exceed 15 percent of the risk-based capital of the institution, or a greater amount established by the appropriate authority. (g) Regulations Required.--Each appropriate Federal banking agency must establish final regulations implementing this section within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Alternative systems are permitted. (h) Alternative System Permitted. The appropriate Federal banking agency may exempt this section if their regulations ensure that the required capital and reserves for transferring mortgage loans with recourse do not exceed what is needed under subsection (b). Existing transactions are not affected by this exemption. Definitions for \"adequately capitalized\" apply to this section. In this section, terms like \"adequately capitalized,\" \"appropriate federal banking agency,\" \"capital standards,\" \"Federal banking agencies,\" and \"insured depository institution\" are defined in reference to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The curr_chunk defines terms like \"other capital measures,\" \"recourse,\" and \"mortgage loan,\" with specific meanings related to banking regulations. The term \"well capitalized\" in the curr_chunk has the same meaning as in section 38(b) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to include commercial structures on real estate for mortgage related securities. Authority is granted to exempt commercial mortgage related securities transactions from prohibited transaction rules. The Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, may exempt transactions involving commercial mortgage related securities from certain restrictions and taxes. This is to safeguard the integrity of the securitization process and the safety of federally insured institutions. Any security under this Act must comply with federal securities laws, including disclosure, registration, reporting, and anti-fraud provisions. Bank-issued or purchased mortgage-backed securities must maintain minimum capital requirements if they represent liabilities on the balance sheet of an insured depository institution. The Act requires insured depository institutions to maintain minimum capital levels for mortgage-related securities in accordance with banking regulations."
