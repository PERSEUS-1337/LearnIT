Proceeds from the guaranteed loan must offset the Administration's cost of guaranteeing loans. The Small Business Loan Revitalization Act allows small businesses to receive combination financing up to $4,000,000. The net amount of the deferred participation share cannot exceed the maximum net guarantee provided. Loans guaranteed under this act may be secured by a subordinated lien, and combination financing is available without any loan limitation imposed by the Administration.
