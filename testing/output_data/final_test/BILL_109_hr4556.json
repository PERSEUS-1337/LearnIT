Congress finds that women are paid 80 cents for every dollar men earn, with the earnings gap persisting for the past two decades. The gap is widest among working parents, as some women prioritize family responsibilities over career advancement or higher earnings. According to a 2001 Government Accountability Office study, female full-time managers earned less than male counterparts in 1995 and 2000. The earnings gap between female and male full-time managers widened in 7 out of 10 industries between 1995 and 2000. Women make up 46% of the workforce but only 12% of corporate officers.
