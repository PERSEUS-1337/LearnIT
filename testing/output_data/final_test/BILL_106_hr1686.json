SEC. 201 of Title II introduces an amendment for the accelerated deployment of broadband services under the Communications Act of 1934. Within 180 days of SEC. 201 of Title II, local exchange carriers must submit plans to provide broadband services in all local exchange areas where they have customers, once economically and technically feasible. Plans must include terms, conditions, and pricing, with certification after 45 days unless the State objects. The carrier's broadband service plan must be certified within 45 days of submission, with successive plans submitted if rejected. Implementation must occur within 180 days in feasible areas. The carrier is bound by the plan's terms but is exempt from price regulations. If another provider serves an exchange, the carrier is not obligated to provide services. An incumbent local exchange carrier must submit a broadband service plan, which, once certified, binds the carrier to its terms. The State commission cannot modify the plan without carrier request, and the FCC has no authority over the plan's terms or approval. If 70% of access lines in an exchange have broadband services available, the carrier is no longer obligated to follow the plan. The exchange carrier's provision of broadband local telecommunications services is exempt from certain Act requirements in a State if the carrier meets specific conditions regarding providing loops to other carriers promptly, offering loops in economically feasible areas within 120 days, and agreeing on prices and terms for conditioned loops. The parties will agree on terms and conditions, or in case of disagreements, a commercial arbitrator will determine the price based on the cost of loops and conditioning incurred by the local exchange carrier plus a reasonable profit. SEC. 202. ACCELERATED DEPLOYMENT OF INTERNET BACKBONE. The amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 excludes Internet-based data transmission from the definition of interLATA service. Bell operating companies and affiliates are prohibited from offering two-way voice-only interLATA services over Internet Protocol-based networks. The Federal Communications Commission must approve interLATA telecommunications services in-region States before a company can offer them, as per the Communications Act of 1934."
