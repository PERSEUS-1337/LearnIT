    "content": "In this paper, a new generative model called WiSE-ALE is introduced for learning latent embeddings. Unlike traditional models, WiSE-ALE uses a global latent variable to generate all observed data points, leading to better reconstruction quality in the auto-encoding process. Through examples and comparisons with other VAE models, WiSE-ALE demonstrates excellent performance. WiSE-ALE is a generative model with superior information embedding properties compared to other VAE models. Unsupervised learning aims to capture statistical regularities in data through representation learning. Deep generative models like WiSE-ALE estimate joint probabilities between input and latent variables for compact data representation. The fully stochastic nature of the network requires layer-by-layer pre-training using MCMC-based sampling algorithms, resulting in heavy computation cost. BID9 introduce the Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes (AEVB) algorithm, which optimizes parameters in an auto-encoder network by deriving an analytic solution to a variational lower bound of the log likelihood of the data. They apply a reparameterization trick to simplify the training procedure and reduce instability, leading to a compact and smooth learned representation. The smoothness constraint in the posterior distribution of 64 random samples in the 2D embedding space can lead to information loss between input samples and latent embeddings. The \u03b2-VAE BID6 algorithm increases the weighting on the regularizing term for a smoother representation, causing an information bottleneck and high distortion rates. In contrast, WAE (Tolstikhin et al., 2017) achieves perfect reconstruction but results in severely learnt embedding distributions. WiSE-ALE is proposed as a wide sample estimator to improve the smoothness of learnt embedding distributions in the latent space. It does not penalize individual embeddings as long as the aggregate distribution does not violate the prior significantly. The objective of WiSE-ALE is derived through variational inference in a latent variable model, resulting in an efficient learning algorithm. The learning objective is efficiently derived in WiSE-ALE, resulting in smooth, compact, and separated latent representations. The model uses a single global latent variable and imposes prior constraints on embedding distributions. In WiSE-ALE, the learning algorithm efficiently derives the learning objective, resulting in smooth, compact, and separated latent representations. The model uses a single global latent variable and imposes prior constraints on embedding distributions. The paper reviews directed graphical models, derives variational lower bounds, discusses related work, analyzes experiment results, and concludes with comparisons to the AEVB algorithm. The generative process is modelled by a directed graphical model BID8, representing the joint probability distribution. The goal is to estimate the optimal set of parameters \u03b8 to explain the data well. Both AEVB and WiSE-ALE use variational methods to approximate the target distribution, with the primary difference lying in their approach. The AEVB model and WiSE-ALE model differ in how they model the joint probability distribution. AEVB assumes individual random variables for each latent code, while WiSE-ALE uses a single random variable for the entire dataset. This difference leads to distinct approaches in estimating the latent distribution. The WiSE-ALE model breaks down the joint probability in a more flexible way compared to the AEVB model. It assumes independence between input samples given the latent distribution of the dataset, allowing for a better quality of information preservation. Neural networks parameterize the generative and inference models in this approach. The WiSE-ALE model utilizes neural networks to parameterize generative and inference models, breaking down joint probability more flexibly than the AEVB model. It defines the aggregate posterior distribution p(z|D N) for the entire dataset, deriving a variational lower bound for efficient optimization of model parameters through the auto-encoder network. The WiSE-ALE model uses neural networks to parameterize generative and inference models, defining the aggregate posterior distribution for the entire dataset. Variational inference minimizes the KL divergence between estimated and true aggregate posterior distributions. The derived lower bound includes a reconstruction likelihood term for dataset generation by the latent posterior distribution. The WiSE-ALE model utilizes neural networks to define the aggregate posterior distribution for the dataset, aiming to balance reconstruction likelihood and compliance with prior assumptions through optimization of model parameters. Analytic approximations are derived for efficient parameter optimization. The WiSE-ALE model uses neural networks to define the aggregate posterior distribution for the dataset, balancing reconstruction likelihood and compliance with prior assumptions through parameter optimization. The reconstruction likelihood is simplified to reach convergence during learning, losing the lower bound property of the objective function. Jensen inequality is applied to obtain an upper bound on the reconstruction likelihood term. The approximation of the reconstruction likelihood term in the WiSE-ALE model allows for efficient convergence during learning, but sacrifices the lower bound property of the objective function. The prior constraint term evaluates the KL divergence between the approximate aggregate posterior distribution and a Gaussian distribution. The curr_chunk discusses modelling sample-wise posterior distributions with a factorial Gaussian distribution and computing the KL divergence between a mixture of Gaussians and N(0, I) using an analytic upper bound. The expectations are computed analytically, leveraging the Gaussian assumption for q \u03c6 (z|x(i)) and p(z). The curr_chunk discusses maximizing the objective function L WiSE-ALE to approach the true KL divergence D KL q \u03c6 (z|D N ) p(z) and imposing prior constraints on the overall aggregate posterior distribution. It presents an analytic approximation for efficient learning, comparing WiSE-ALE with the AEVB estimator. The curr_chunk discusses learning a model that balances between good data embedding and preferred properties of latent distributions. A comparison is made with the AEVB algorithm, highlighting differences in prior constraints. The curr_chunk discusses the WiSE-ALE learning objective, which imposes a prior constraint on the aggregate posterior distribution to allow flexibility for each sample posterior. This prevents large mean values and ensures smoothness in the learnt latent representation. The comparison with the AEVB algorithm shows differences in prior constraints. The WiSE-ALE learning objective imposes a prior constraint on the aggregate posterior distribution for flexibility in sample posteriors, preventing large mean values and ensuring smoothness in the latent representation. This contrasts with the AEVB algorithm's prior constraints. The WiSE-ALE algorithm aims to maintain good reconstruction quality by deriving a variational lower bound for a mini-batch subset of the dataset. It utilizes an alternate objective function compared to AEVB and focuses on learning a meaningful internal representation efficiently. The algorithm details are provided in the appendix. The WiSE-ALE algorithm prioritizes reconstruction quality while maintaining globally desirable properties, unlike the AEVB algorithm which sacrifices reconstruction quality due to the significant influence of the prior constraint on the solution space. WiSE-ALE prioritizes reconstruction quality while incorporating globally desirable properties. Other algorithms like Gaussian Mixture VAE, Adversarial Auto-Encoder, WAE, and Sinkhorn Auto-Encoder also use alternate priors to improve sample posteriors and match latent variables with prior distributions through various methods. Our work differs from these approaches. Our WiSE-ALE algorithm offers an efficient optimization process and balances reconstruction quality with preferred latent representation properties. It differs from other algorithms that sacrifice smoothness and compactness for improved reconstruction quality. The learned latent representation properties are essential for tasks requiring optimization over the latent space. Our WiSE-ALE algorithm outperforms AEVB, \u03b2-VAE, and WAE on three datasets: Sine Wave, MNIST, and CelebA BID12. The implementation details are provided in Appendix E.1. Our method consistently shows superior reconstruction quality compared to other algorithms. Graphical comparisons in FIG6 demonstrate the effectiveness of WiSE-ALE on the sine wave and CelebA datasets. Our WiSE-ALE algorithm outperforms AEVB, \u03b2-VAE, and WAE on the Sine Wave and CelebA datasets. WiSE-ALE achieves almost perfect reconstruction on the sine wave dataset, while AEVB and \u03b2-VAE struggle with low-frequency signals. For the CelebA dataset, WiSE-ALE predicts sharper human faces compared to AEVB. WAE reaches a similar level of reconstruction quality in some images but struggles with discovering the right angles. WiSE-ALE learns a latent representation that balances minimizing information loss with preserving preferable qualities. Our WiSE-ALE algorithm achieves the highest ELBO values compared to AEVB and \u03b2-VAE on the Sine dataset, with lower reconstruction error and good performance in KL divergence loss. It learns a high-quality representation closest to the true latent distribution of the data. The model uses a global latent variable to generate the dataset and imposes a prior constraint on the aggregate posterior distribution. The WiSE-ALE algorithm achieves high ELBO values compared to AEVB and \u03b2-VAE on the Sine dataset, with low reconstruction error and good performance in KL divergence loss. It learns a high-quality representation closest to the true latent distribution of the data, using a global latent variable and imposing a prior constraint on the posterior distribution. The algorithm proposes an analytic approximation for the learning objective, demonstrating excellent reconstruction quality and forming a smooth, compact latent representation. Future work aims to understand the properties of the learned latent embeddings and apply them to relevant applications. The AEVB objective involves substituting DISPLAYFORM0 into the reconstruction term DISPLAYFORM1 and decomposing the marginal likelihood of the dataset. The reconstruction term evaluation in the lower bound requires drawing samples, evaluating latent code distribution, reconstructing input samples, and computing reconstruction errors. The sampling process can be simplified using the reparameterisation trick. The reparameterisation trick simplifies the reconstruction errors in the AEVB objective. The upper bound of the reconstruction error term is obtained by rearranging the expression and dropping zero posterior distributions. Jensen inequality is applied to omit a constant in the gradient updates of the parameters. The upper bound of the reconstruction error term is simplified using the reparameterisation trick and Jensen inequality, which does not affect gradient updates. The expression for the first term is derived by expanding the expectation w.r.t. the aggregate posterior, while the second term involves examining the prior distribution of the latent code. The prior distribution p(z) is a zero-mean unit-variance Gaussian. By evaluating integrals and using properties, an upper bound expression is obtained. Experiments on various datasets compare the latent representation learned from the WiSE algorithm with \u03b2-VAE. The WiSE algorithm is compared with \u03b2-VAE on smoothness and disentanglement of the learnt representation, and with WAE and AEVB on reconstruction quality. A 2D embedding of the MNIST dataset is used to visualize latent embedding distributions. Implementation details for learning a latent representation in R 4 for a sine wave dataset are provided. The network aims to learn a 2D embedding of the MNIST dataset using hyper-parameters for training. The encoder network takes input from a unit Gaussian to estimate a sample from the embedding distribution q(z|x), while the decoder network reconstructs the input."
