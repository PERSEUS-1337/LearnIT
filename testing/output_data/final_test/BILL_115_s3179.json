In 2016, the Center for Disease Control reported 64,000 drug overdose deaths in the United States, with fentanyl and its analogs being the main cause of over 20,000 of these deaths. The United States Department of the Treasury estimated that $64 billion is generated annually from drug trafficking sales in the country, with illegal fentanyl primarily originating from China and being easily accessible through online marketplaces. SEC. 3. GAO STUDY. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used for sex and drug trafficking, focusing on the dark web, financial payment methods, and trafficking of opioids and synthetic opioids within the United States. The study will focus on how virtual currencies are used for sex and drug trafficking within the United States, including the involvement of online marketplaces and the repatriation of illicit funds into the formal banking system. It will also examine the participants in the supply chain benefiting from these activities. The study will explore the use of virtual currencies in sex and drug trafficking in the United States, including efforts to impede these activities and prevent illicit funds from entering the banking system. It will also investigate how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter illicit activities, as well as their role in tracking and prosecuting illicit funding. The study will focus on sex trafficking involving virtual currencies, with a definition provided for \"sex trafficking.\" The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report to Congress within a year of the Act's enactment, summarizing the study's results and providing recommendations for legislative or regulatory action to combat the use of virtual currencies in illicit activities. The study aims to hinder the use of virtual currencies and online platforms in facilitating sex and drug trafficking."
