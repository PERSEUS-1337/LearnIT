    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Military Energy Security Act\" or the \"MESA Act.\" It establishes a pilot program on collaborative energy security. The \"Military Energy Security Act\" establishes a pilot program for collaborative energy security involving military installations and national laboratories. The program aims to evaluate and validate secure microgrid components and systems for deployment. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy will jointly select the participants based on their commitment to participate and relevant energy security assessments. The pilot program under the \"Military Energy Security Act\" evaluates renewable energy sources, synergies with national laboratories, and feasibility of selling excess electricity from military installations to local communities. Under the pilot program, the Secretaries will evaluate new energy technologies for operating environments in collaboration with the Department of Energy and the Environmental Security Technical Certification Program of the Department of Defense. The Secretary of Defense will explore selling excess electricity from military installations to local communities based on the pilot program results. The pilot program, starting by July 1, 2011, will test innovative energy technologies in military installations for at least three years. The Secretary of Defense aims to use the military as a test bed for new energy components and designs. Initial reports are due by October 1, 2011 to relevant committees. The Secretary of Defense will provide initial and final reports to relevant committees on the implementation and findings of the pilot program testing energy technologies in military installations. The Secretary of Defense will provide reports on the pilot program testing energy technologies in military installations. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the program, with definitions of \"microgrid\" and \"national laboratory\" included. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorizes a pilot program testing energy technologies in military installations or national security laboratories."
