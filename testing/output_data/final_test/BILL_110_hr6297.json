Changes in precipitation patterns will affect water availability for drinking and domestic needs, leading to concerns about extended droughts. Providing water is energy-intensive and will become more so as climate change continues. Energy production consumes a significant percentage of fresh water resources in the United States. Studies sponsored by the drinking water industry since 2003 assess the impacts of climate change on water supplies, highlighting the need for comprehensive research on utilities and customers. The nonprofit water research foundation collaborates internationally on research projects with European and Asian counterparts. The curr_chunk discusses the need for international workshops to develop a unified research agenda on adaptive strategies for addressing climate change impacts on water resources. It also emphasizes the importance of summarizing scientific evidence on climate change, identifying implications for the water cycle, and providing guidance on planning and adaptation strategies for water utilities. Additionally, it highlights the need for drinking water utilities to prepare for a wider range of possibilities in managing and delivering water due to uncertainties about specific climate changes. Research on the effects of climate change on drinking water utilities is emphasized. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in collaboration with other government departments, will fund a research program through a nonprofit foundation to help drinking water suppliers adapt to climate change impacts. Research areas will focus on water quality issues such as erosion, turbidity, and changes in watershed vegetation. The research program funded by the Environmental Protection Agency will focus on mitigating damage to watersheds and water quality caused by climate change impacts. This includes evaluating extreme events like wildfires and hurricanes to develop management approaches to address permanent watershed damage, impacts on source waters, and increased water treatment costs. Additionally, the program will assess the impacts on groundwater supplies from carbon sequestration to understand potential water quality consequences. The research program funded by the Environmental Protection Agency focuses on mitigating damage to watersheds and water quality from climate change impacts. This includes evaluating extreme events like wildfires and hurricanes to develop management approaches for permanent watershed damage, impacts on source waters, and increased water treatment costs. The program also assesses the impacts on groundwater supplies from carbon sequestration to understand potential water quality consequences. Additionally, it addresses water quantity impacts and solutions, infrastructure impacts, and solutions for water treatment facilities and underground pipelines. The research program funded by the Environmental Protection Agency focuses on evaluating and mitigating the impacts of sea level rise on near-shore facilities, soil drying, subsidence, and reduced flows in water and wastewater pipelines. It also focuses on increasing the resilience of existing infrastructure and developing new design standards. Additionally, research includes improving membrane technologies for desalination, water reuse, and alternative supply technologies. The research program funded by the Environmental Protection Agency aims to improve water treatment practices, enhance technologies for managing desalination and reuse concentrate streams, minimize environmental impacts of seawater intake, optimize energy efficiency in water supply, and develop renewable energy sources. Research funded by the Environmental Protection Agency aims to improve water treatment practices, enhance technologies for managing desalination and reuse concentrate streams, minimize environmental impacts of seawater intake, optimize energy efficiency in water supply, develop renewable energy sources, promote regional water management solutions, and enhance utility management models for climate change adaptation. Research funded by the Environmental Protection Agency focuses on improving water treatment practices, managing desalination and reuse concentrate streams, minimizing environmental impacts of seawater intake, optimizing energy efficiency in water supply, developing renewable energy sources, promoting regional water management solutions, and enhancing utility management models for climate change adaptation. This includes strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, manage energy demand, and improve energy efficiency in water collection, production, transmission, treatment, distribution, and disposal for sustainability. The curr_chunk discusses water conservation and demand management strategies, including developing approaches to manage water demand efficiently through various tools, incentives, and technologies. These efforts aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the entire water cycle. The curr_chunk focuses on water-saving technologies and efficiencies in water management through integrated water resource management. This includes supply-side and demand-side processes, continuous adaptive management, and stakeholder involvement in decision-making processes. Additionally, it addresses communications, education, and public acceptance related to climate change implications on water supply. The curr_chunk focuses on developing communication approaches to gain public acceptance of alternative water supplies, new policies, conservation, and increased costs. $25,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2009 through 2019."
