The research focuses on fault tolerance to small random neuron crashes, providing provable guarantees on network robustness. The main contribution is a bound on output error under Bernoulli crashes, using a Taylor expansion in the continuous limit. This research is relevant to neuromorphic hardware technology for accelerating artificial neural networks. The study focuses on fault tolerance in neural networks due to random neuron failures, providing guarantees on network robustness. The research introduces theoretical bounds to compare fault tolerance in different architectures and design regularizers to improve fault tolerance. An algorithm achieving fault tolerance with a reasonable number of neurons is developed, along with experimental validation. The study also suggests a connection to the generalization capacity problem in artificial neural networks. Neural networks vulnerabilities have been highlighted in recent years, leading to reported mistakes. Understanding fault tolerance in complex systems, like biological networks, is crucial for system robustness. Biological systems are known for their fault tolerance, which is essential for mathematical models' biological plausibility. Current Machine Learning systems face computational power limitations, prompting the development of Neuromorphic hardware (NH). Neuromorphic hardware offers a significant improvement in computational power over traditional CPUs/GPUs, with each neuron being a physical entity. However, the small and unreliable components of this hardware can lead to random weight perturbations, posing a challenge for AI safety. Research on neural network fault tolerance has been motivated by the development of neuromorphic hardware in the 1990s and the 2000s. Research on fault tolerance in neuromorphic hardware has focused on Taylor expansion and robustness conditions, with studies addressing worst-case scenarios and experimental approaches like neuron removal by DeepMind and error propagation by NVIDIA. Existing neural network approaches lack guarantees for fault tolerance, relying on heuristics and experimental evaluation. Theoretical papers emphasize the need for more robust guarantees in fault tolerance. Theoretical papers focus on worst-case scenarios and robustness in fault tolerance, aiming to guarantee a low probability of loss exceeding a threshold. This is crucial for ensuring safety in applications like self-driving cars. Existing fault tolerant architectures rely on heuristics and experimental evaluation, lacking robust guarantees. Current fault-tolerant architectures use mean aggregation for redundancy, which is costly compared to the median approach. A theoretical bound on NN output error due to random neuron crashes is provided, with a focus on realistic assumptions for neuromorphic hardware and a probabilistic approach. The Taylor expansion is applied under the assumption of network smoothness. The Taylor expansion is used to prove properties of neural networks by assuming network smoothness. The obtained bounds lead to an algorithm that enhances fault tolerance using median aggregation at a low cost. These bounds are applied to various architectures, including VGG, to evaluate fault tolerance experimentally. In Section 6, the algorithm for certifying fault tolerance is presented, followed by an experimental evaluation in Section 7. Section 8 discusses the consequences of the findings. Definitions and notations for fault tolerance and fully-connected networks are provided. The matrix \u03b3-norm and q-balanced vectors are defined. The Hessian matrix H_ij is defined as a matrix of second derivatives in a neural network with L layers. Weight matrices, biases, and activation functions are used to define the network, with the last layer being linear. The activation function is required to be 1-Lipschitz, and if it is K-Lipschitz, the weights are rescaled accordingly. The Hessian matrix H_ij is defined as a matrix of second derivatives in a neural network with L layers. Weight matrices, biases, and activation functions are used to define the network, with the last layer being linear. The weights are rescaled to make K = 1, and the network is defined as (\u03b5, \u03b4)-fault tolerant over an input distribution and a crash distribution. The fault tolerance of a neural network is evaluated by computing the first moments of \u2206 L+1 and using tail bounds to ensure (\u03b5, \u03b4)-FT. This means that with high probability, additional loss due to faults does not exceed \u03b5. The expectation over crashes can be interpreted for networks with permanent or intermittent faults. Definition 2 covers all types of faults - permanent, transient, and intermittent. The task of evaluating fault tolerance in neural networks is challenging, as it is NP-hard and even small perturbations can lead to unacceptable errors in the output. To assess fault tolerance accurately, one would need to consider every possible failure scenario, which is impractical due to the exponential number of possibilities. In the context of evaluating fault tolerance in neural networks, overcoming NP-hardness is addressed by providing an approximation dependent on the network. The fault tolerance assessment involves considering weight perturbations and loss changes, with known spectral bounds on the Lipschitz coefficient for input perturbations. The Lipschitz coefficient for input perturbations is bounded by the spectral norm of the matrix \u00b7 2, with exponential growth in the number of layers. Adversarial examples show high output changes with small input changes. Evaluating fault tolerance is challenging, requiring additional assumptions based on neuromorphic hardware properties. In this section, realistic simplifying assumptions are introduced for neuromorphic hardware characteristics. The study focuses on weight perturbation and applies a Taylor expansion to the most probable case. Assumptions are based on neural network internal structure and the number of neurons at each layer. The best and worst fault tolerance scenarios are considered for a 1-layer neural network. The most robust network has all neurons interchangeable, while the worst case has all but one neuron unused. The worst fault tolerance scenario in a neural network involves all but one neuron being unused, leading to a lack of decay in variance with the number of neurons. Under certain regularity assumptions, perturbation of weight norms is shown to be small. Error calculation with weight perturbation is done using a Taylor expansion, with a focus on favorable and unfavorable cases. Precise bounds on Taylor approximation are necessary for fault tolerance certification, especially in cases where ReLU functions cause the Taylor approximation to fail. The Taylor expansion of an NN is challenged, but conditions for the Taylor approximation to hold are provided. As the width of networks increases, a continuous limit is reached, with globally bounded operator derivatives. The network maintains the same internal structure but becomes more fine-grained. The continuous limit is valid for explicit duplication, convolutional networks, and explicit regularization. The derivative bound for order 2 contrasts with the worst-case spectral bound. The derivative bound for order 2 is in contrast to the worst-case spectral bound, consistent with experimental studies and generalization properties. Under certain conditions, derivatives are equal to the operator derivatives of the continuous limit. The mean and variance of the error can be approximated for crashes at layer l and output error \u2206 L at layer L. The full proof of the theorem is in the supplementary material. Our result provides conditions for simplifying neural networks, identifying fault-tolerant architectures. A necessary condition for bounded Dk is a reasonable bound on derivatives of the ground truth function. This function is assumed to be sufficiently smooth. The proposition is illustrated in proof-of-concept experiments with explicit regularization in the supplementary material. Networks may not hold the conclusion of P4 if certain conditions are not met. The derivative \u2202yL/\u2202\u03be l is interpreted as if \u03be i was a real variable. The dependency Var\u2206 \u223c 1/n l is valid only under certain conditions. Aggregating multiple copies with a mean can make the network more robust. Tighter remainder conditions are possible but complicate the equation. The text discusses the fault tolerance of neural networks, emphasizing the importance of balancing the number of neurons in each layer to prevent single points of failure. It also mentions the use of Chebyshev tail bounds for certifying fault tolerance. Additionally, it highlights the need for multiple forward passes to assess fault tolerance accurately. The text discusses fault tolerance in neural networks, emphasizing balancing neurons in each layer to prevent single points of failure. It introduces loss minimization under fault tolerance, emphasizing the importance of network continuity and q-balancedness. The use of a smoothing regularizing function and the application of the median trick technique for increased fault tolerance are also mentioned. The text discusses fault tolerance in neural networks, emphasizing balancing neurons in each layer to prevent single points of failure. Techniques are developed to assess and improve fault tolerance, culminating in Algorithm 1 for achieving (\u03b5, \u03b4)-fault tolerance guarantee through median aggregation. Smooth pooling and activations with large kernel sizes lead to better approximation in Conv-Activation-Pool networks. The algorithm (Algorithm 1) aims to achieve (\u03b5, \u03b4)-fault tolerance by training with a regularizer and duplicating the network logarithmically in hardware for independent faults. It works for a single input x and can be extended for inputs. Estimating the required number of neurons involves using bounds from T1 and P5, with a fast exponential decrease in failure probability. The time complexity is O(D 12 + C l p l /\u03b5 2 ) and space complexity is equivalent to one training call. See supplementary material for proofs of resource requirements and correctness. In this section, the theory developed in previous sections is tested in proof-of-concept experiments. The first moments of fault tolerance are estimated using T1 for small and larger networks. Predictions such as decay of variance, the effect of regularizer, and variance decay as 1/n are tested. The algorithm is tested on the MNIST dataset for specific parameters and the tail bound is evaluated experimentally. The paper presents a probabilistic fault tolerance framework for neural networks, addressing the issue of fault tolerance in AI safety. Experimental results confirm the validity of the algorithm's guarantee. The approach simplifies the problem by assuming low crash probabilities in neuromorphic hardware, allowing for polynomial computation time. Tail bounds are used to justify small weight perturbations, enabling error computation using Taylor expansion. Smoothness of the network is required for bounding the remainder, utilizing a continuous limit approach. The framework ensures fault tolerance in neural networks by guaranteeing smoothness and using tail bounds to analyze loss. It compares fault tolerance across architectures and optimizes for it. Experimental tests on various network sizes validate the approach for deployment on neuromorphic hardware. The study focuses on fault tolerance in neural networks, using Bernoulli noise instead of Gaussian noise. The tools developed for fault tolerance could also be applied to generalization. Notations and abbreviations are provided for clarity. Future research directions are mentioned for stronger guarantees.

The matrix \u03b3-norm is defined for the standard scalar product, and q-balanced vectors are defined. The network is trained using input-output pairs for a loss function, and the last layer is linear. Rescaling weights to make \u03d5 1-Lipschitz is discussed, along with extending the definition of \u03b5-fault tolerance to the probabilistic case.

Rescaling weights to ensure \u03d5 is 1-Lipschitz is discussed, along with extending \u03b5-fault tolerance to the probabilistic case. For a specific network, the proof shows how a problem can be proven NP-hard by reducing it to the Subset Sum problem using a neural network with specific characteristics. The final neuron in the network acts as a linear identity function. The output is 1 only if both inputs are 1, with a threshold activation function. The network is fed the entire set S as input x, where y(x) = 1 if the sum of inputs is 0. If y(x) = 0, an algorithm is used to calculate E\u2206 k > z for any finite-precision z. The final neuron in the network acts as a linear identity function, outputting 1 only if both inputs are 1. The threshold neuron outputs a value > 0 when the sum of inputs is greater than 1.5. By setting z = 0, the subset sum problem is solved using an algorithm to determine if 67 E\u2206 k > 0. If there is a solution, E\u2206 k > 0, else E\u2206 k \u2264 0. An algorithm is proposed to output an additive approximation to E\u2206 k within a certain range. The distribution of \u2206 for one neuron with binary input and weights, and a threshold activation function is known as noise sensitivity in theoretical Computer Science. There is an exact assessment for some cases, but for w i = 1 the exact distribution is unknown. The error at the last layer on input x can be upper-bounded for any norm, with failures in input considered. In the context of noise sensitivity in theoretical Computer Science, the proof involves applying arguments for underlying layers and addressing failing input. Bounds on matrix norms are discussed, with a focus on average case scenarios rather than worst case. Additionally, a corollary connects infinity norm to norm bounds for input failures. The proof involves showing equivalence to a previous result, setting parameters for maximal values and weights, and considering network crash configurations. The expectation is defined for binary strings with a specific configuration, and the focus is on network crash scenarios at different layers. The text discusses network crash configurations at different layers, with a focus on the quantity f(p, n, |s|) and the upper-bound error on input x. The expression for E \u2206 \u221e is compared to a previous result, with emphasis on absolute values of matrices and vectors in the calculations. The text discusses network crash configurations at different layers, focusing on error calculations and properties of neuromorphic hardware. It provides sufficient conditions for small probability of large weight perturbation under a crash distribution. The text discusses properties of neuromorphic hardware and weight perturbation in neural networks. It provides conditions for small weight perturbation probability under certain assumptions. The text discusses Chernoff bounds for Binomial distribution and the concentration of Bernoulli successes around its mean. It also mentions developing a more precise expression for E\u2206 and Var\u2206 in the context of neuromorphic hardware and weight perturbation in neural networks. In this section, a more precise expression for E\u2206 and Var\u2206 is developed for complex neural networks. The goal is to obtain a Taylor expansion of E\u2206 in terms of p and q, and for Var\u2206 to decay as n \u2192 \u221e. The expansion includes first-order terms behaving as expected, but also contains a remainder that requires additional assumptions for it to be small. An example is provided where the first term is zero, but the error is non-zero, showing that weights are not like their neighbors. In complex neural networks, a Taylor expansion of E\u2206 in terms of p and q is developed to show that weights can be non-zero, unlike their neighbors. The network's fault tolerance is discussed, with a focus on continuity and the behavior of the network as n \u2192 \u221e. The fault tolerance of neural networks is analyzed by considering the impact of failed input neurons. The expectation remains constant as n grows, but the variance decreases as 1/n. Increasing the width of the network can enhance fault tolerance, but if most neurons are unused, the probability of failure remains constant. Utilizing neurons to their maximum capacity is crucial for improving fault tolerance. In analyzing fault tolerance in neural networks, the difference between all neurons performing the same task and having most neurons unused is formalized. A class of \"good\" networks is defined for which fault tolerance is sufficient. Functions, functionals, and operators are categorized, with a focus on real-valued functions with bounded piecewise-continuous domains. The approximation error and minimal width of discrete networks are also discussed. The summary discusses the minimal width of discrete networks and their ability to approximate continuous quantities. It presents a proof that discrete networks are universal approximators and introduces a condition for the error to approach zero as the network size increases. The text also mentions the use of piecewise-discontinuities in defining continuous networks and the bounded nature of functions due to finite weights. The text discusses the bounded nature of functions in discrete networks and their ability to approximate continuous quantities. It presents a proof that discrete networks are universal approximators and introduces a condition for the error to decrease as the network size increases. The text also mentions the use of piecewise-discontinuities in defining continuous networks. Neurons in a discrete network become redundant for fault tolerance, with gradient descent converging to the same function representation regardless of network size. The distribution of activations remains constant as the number of nodes changes, with neurons becoming ordered beyond a certain threshold. The derivative bound part of A3 enforces a good fit with the ground truth function, extending previous assumptions. Input data vectors are normalized in some cases, but in this analysis, it is better to preserve the magnitude of outputs and pre-activations to prevent gradient issues. To prevent gradient issues, it is important to maintain the magnitude of outputs and pre-activations. Normalizing input data vectors can help achieve this, but other approaches like keeping the norm constant as n grows can also be effective. Weight decay plays a role in fault tolerance, with less weight decay leading to lower fault tolerance. In the NTK limit, there is a decay in variance, but this is not directly related to fault tolerance. The \"lazy\" regime in the NTK limit implies characteristics of hidden neurons. The NTK limit in the \"lazy\" regime implies that hidden neurons are close to their random initialization, leading to a lack of continuity in the network. A network with constant pre-activations variance is not fault-tolerant, even with standard initialization. To harness the benefits of a continuous limit, we aim to bound higher-order derivatives using operator derivatives. The operator derivative of functions is defined point-wise with the RHS being a functional derivative. The functional derivative at a point is similar to a component of the gradient of an ordinary function. It is defined via the Euler-Lagrange equation for functionals of the form F t [x] = Y [x](t). The integral expression depends explicitly on the function x, not on its derivatives. The functional derivative at a point is defined as the component of the gradient, reconciled with the full gradient definition using the Dirac delta-function. The operator derivative at a point is characterized similarly to standard vector-functions derivatives, with rules for differentiating operators being the same. The derivatives of a discrete neural network are discussed, showing that with more neurons, each becomes less important. The importance of neurons decreases as the number of neurons in a neural network increases. The derivatives in a neural network are independent of the number of neurons. The weight matrix plays a crucial role in the calculations. The text discusses the impact of weight matrix duplication on fault tolerance in neural networks. It explores how duplicating neurons can improve fault tolerance, but highlights the suboptimal fault tolerance of non-regularized networks. The importance of duplicating neurons efficiently for fault tolerance is emphasized. To improve fault tolerance in neural networks, it is more efficient to duplicate only the important neurons. Explicit regularization techniques are used to make adjacent neurons compute similar functions, ensuring redundancy. This includes using a \"number of changes\" metric and Gaussian smoothing to enforce similarity among neighboring neurons. The text discusses enforcing a continuous limit in neural networks by adding a regularization term. The experiment is repeated 10 times to report mean and standard deviation. The condition of the regularization term being small is necessary but not sufficient for the continuity assumption. It is noted that even if networks are smooth, they may not have a limit, as they could implement functions in different ways. Our approach provides a formal guarantee of fault tolerance by ensuring constant derivatives. Different smoothing techniques were considered, such as using clustering loss or regularizing weights with a likelihood of a Gaussian process. The condition of the regularization term being small is necessary but not sufficient for the continuity assumption in neural networks. The second derivative, \u03ba = y /(1 + (y ) 2 ) 3/2, is connected to the curvature of a curve in 2D space. Convolutional networks for images require a large enough kernel size to maintain smoothness. Convolutional networks for images require a large enough kernel size to maintain smoothness. Specifically, for CNNs, a small C1 is needed as neighboring neurons have similar receptive fields. In contrast, a large C2 can be used with a small kernel size to avoid high discontinuity. The notebook ConvNetTest-VGG16-ManyImages.ipynb investigates this, which is a future research direction. The paper gives a qualitative description of techniques for convolutional networks, such as using a big kernel size for a small C2 and smooth activation and pooling for T1 to work. When the number of neurons increases in a network trained with gradient descent, permutations are ignored, different ways to represent the same function exist, and output layer magnitude is preserved. Intermediate layers require non-vanishing pre-activation values to avoid gradient issues. Input limits may be enforced, and gradient descent leads to a discrete network that converges to a critical point with globally bounded derivatives. Each critical point corresponds to a set of initializations, partitioning the space into regions. Each fixed point with low loss corresponds to continuous networks passing through a discrete network. Different implementations can exist in networks of larger size. Derivatives decay along paths in networks of different sizes, denoted by probability s_n. If s_n approaches 0, a particular network N_c may not appear. Derivative decay is used to show fault tolerance using a Taylor expansion. The text discusses the use of Assumption 3 through Proposition 4, focusing on crashes at layer l in a neural network. The Taylor theorem is used to compute \u03be, with a focus on variance and correlation terms. The text emphasizes the decay of expectation with p, but not with n. The text discusses the use of Assumption 3 through Proposition 4, focusing on crashes at layer l in a neural network. The Taylor theorem is used to compute \u03be, with a focus on variance and correlation terms. The text emphasizes the decay of expectation with p, but not with n. Another approach is considered to compute the correlation between \u03be i \u2206 i (t(\u03be)) and \u03be j \u2206 j (t(\u03be)), but was unsuccessful. The median trick is then introduced as a standard technique to guarantee a certain probability threshold.

Another approach is considered to compute the correlation between \u03be i \u2206 i (t(\u03be)) and \u03be j \u2206 j (t(\u03be)), but was unsuccessful. The median trick is then introduced as a standard technique to guarantee a certain probability threshold. In order to guarantee a specific threshold, Chebyshev's inequality is applied along with additional propositions for a C 2 network at a stationary point after training. The text discusses the probability of a binary string having a specific configuration with k ones in a neural network. It focuses on network crash configurations at layer l and the importance of sets of crashing neurons with one crash in total. The proof for variance is similar, and Algorithm 418 from the main paper guarantees a small probability for every example. The total variance is related to the expectation of variance. The text discusses the probability of network crashes and high errors in neural networks. It applies Chebyshev's inequality to analyze the likelihood of encountering a high error. Median aggregation of copies is used to assess input distribution. The inner probability can be bounded by Var\u2206(x) exp(\u2212R). The algorithm trains networks to guarantee fault tolerance by repeating a good network a logarithmic number of times. Conditions on q and \u03b4 0 are necessary for fault tolerance, as they imply more strict conditions on R, E\u2206, and \u03b4. Space requirements are considered after each iteration of the main loop. Space requirements are minimal in the algorithm, with the previous network being deleted after each iteration of the main loop. Only changes in weights need to be stored, with the total number of iterations being dependent on the function being approximated and the continuous limit. The algorithm's asymptotic behavior is not affected by specific constants chosen for simplicity in the proof. The algorithm's space requirements are minimal, with changes in weights being the only data stored. The total number of iterations depends on the function being approximated. The algorithm's asymptotic behavior is not affected by specific constants chosen for simplicity in the proof. In order to ensure robustness, the function being fitted should not have too high second derivatives, as failure of a fraction of neurons would be too large to begin with. There is no complete theory explaining the generalization behavior of neural networks, so a sufficient trade-off between accuracy and fault-tolerance cannot be guaranteed without understanding the complete properties of NNs capacity. The algorithm can achieve fault tolerance by ensuring small first-order terms and smoothness of the discrete function. This allows for the approximation error to be small, with the number of changes being less than the number of neurons at a layer. In image recognition tasks, the problem is assumed to be smooth. Modern CNNs use non-robust features, making them sensitive to small changes in input. Approaches to resolve this issue theoretically include considering the infinite depth limit. Infinite depth limit can create regularities in network layers. Operator decomposition into hierarchical composition can improve image classification. Enforcing continuous limit makes features more robust in experiments. Experiments show that without regularization, hidden layer weights appear noisy with many unused neurons and noisy patterns in used ones. Continuity-regularized networks exhibit first-layer weights similar to input images, suggesting a potential research direction. The study focuses on properties of hierarchical functions and neural networks optimized by gradient descent. Experiments were conducted on a machine with 12 cores, 60GB RAM, and 2 NVIDIA GTX 1080 cards. Dropout experiment results show no visible change after a threshold of p < 0.03. In experiments, dropout with p < 0.03 shows no visible change. Sigmoid networks are compared using different inputs on a single network and single input on different networks. The comparison is based on bounds and rank loss to determine network resilience to crashes. The experimental results in ConvNetTest-ft.ipynb show that the network's resilience to crashes improves as the algorithm increases continuity and the number of neurons. Initially, the network is not continuous enough due to a lack of neurons, leading to higher empirical probability of outputting a loss > \u03b5. However, as the number of neurons increases, the gap between theoretical and experimental variance decreases, improving network performance. The experimental results show that as the network becomes more continuous and increases the number of neurons, its resilience to crashes improves. The empirical probability decreases as the network iterates to guarantee robustness. The expected error is predicted to decay with the gradient of the loss. Testing on the Boston dataset with sigmoid networks and ReLU networks confirms this prediction. The results are depicted in Figure 12, showing a decay in error as expected. The network's output depends on the weight matrix and input to the layer, with the output decaying as predicted. The text discusses the relationship between weights and activations in a neural network, the impact of skip-connections on fault tolerance, and a method to compensate for hardware faults by adjusting neuron outputs. The text discusses the impact of weights and activations in a neural network, skip-connections on fault tolerance, and a method to compensate for hardware faults by adjusting neuron outputs. A proposition on variance bounds was presented, but it was not included in the article due to lack of significant experimental results. The computation speed theoretically surpasses CPU/GPU cycles. The surge in performance in neuromorphic computing could exceed that of training on CPUs to GPUs and TPUs. Recent successes include milliwatt image recognition and vowel recognition using nano-oscillators. Fault tolerance in neural networks is crucial due to small and unreliable components leading to crashes and performance degradation. Failure in a neuromorphic architecture for mission-critical applications could be disastrous, making fault tolerance an important AI safety problem. The unit of failure in these architectures is fine-grained, such as an individual neuron or synapse. In neuromorphic computing, fault tolerance is crucial due to small and unreliable components leading to crashes. The unit of failure is fine-grained, such as an individual neuron or synapse, contrasting with traditional neural network failures on a larger scale. Fine-grained fault tolerance in neural networks is an overlooked AI safety problem."
