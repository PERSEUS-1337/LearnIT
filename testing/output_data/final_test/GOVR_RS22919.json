    "content": "The increasing number of mortgage foreclosures poses a financial threat to local housing markets, financial institutions, homeowners, and state and local governments. The impact of the foreclosure crisis on financial institutions and homeowners has been well documented, and has been the focus of congressional debate in the formulation of policy options. The impact on state and local governments, as well as neighborhoods, also has garnered the attention of federal policy makers. In 2007, the U.S. Conference of Mayors projected that in 2008, mortgage foreclosures would displace up to 1.4 million households from their homes; result in $1.2 trillion in lost property values; and potentially lead to the loss of more than $1.4 trillion in projected real estate tax revenues\u2014important sources of financing local government operations. Given the prospect of declining revenues, falling property values, and blighted neighborhoods. Several bills were introduced during the 110th Congress to address the mortgage foreclosure crisis, including reducing foreclosures due to rising interest rates, reclaiming vacant housing, and assisting states and local governments in dealing with blight in neighborhoods with high concentrations of foreclosed properties. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) addressed problems in neighborhoods with high concentrations of foreclosed properties and declining tax revenues. Despite objections, HERA, including Title III authorizing NSP, passed in 2008, allocating $3.92 billion in supplemental CDBG assistance to states and local governments. HUD established an allocation formula to distribute funds to states and local governments based on the number and percentage of foreclosed homes, subprime mortgages, and homes in default or delinquency. Nonprofit entities could participate as sub-grantees but not receive direct funds. Recipients had 18 months to allocate funds, prioritizing areas with the highest percentage of home foreclosures. HUD developed a formula to allocate NSP funds based on factors like home foreclosures, subprime loans, and potential rise in foreclosures. The formula distributed $3.92 billion to states and territories using a weighted two-tiered approach with nine factors. The formula developed by HUD allocated NSP funds based on factors like foreclosure starts, subprime loans, default rates, and vacancy rates. Nine factors were used with specific weights for each variable to calculate state allocations, which were then distributed to local governments. The NSP funds were allocated to local governments based on factors like foreclosure rates and abandoned homes. Communities receiving a minimum of $2 million could directly administer their share, while others had to request funds from the state. Approximately 250 communities met the threshold and received direct allocations, which was 900 fewer than the regular CDBG program. The HERA restricted grant recipient use of NSP funds to housing and foreclosure-related activities such as financing instruments for purchase and redevelopment of foreclosed properties, demolition of blighted structures, land banks, and redevelopment of vacant properties. The ARRA made changes to eligible activities, limiting funds for land banks and demolition. Purchase and Resell Price Restrictions under HERA limited the amount NSP grant recipients could pay for a residential property, ensuring it was below market value. The resale price for foreclosed properties purchased as primary residences was also capped at the acquisition cost. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) initially required reinvestment of profits from foreclosed properties for five years, with recapture by the federal government after that unless approved by HUD. The five-year recapture provision was removed with the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). HERA's Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) has similar requirements to the regular Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, with alternative requirements issued by HUD for expedited fund use. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) includes provisions related to fair housing, nondiscrimination, labor standards, and environmental review. It prohibits the use of funds in economic development projects involving eminent domain, limits assistance to individuals and families with incomes not exceeding 120% of the area's median income, and requires a minimum allocation for each state. HUD data shows the distribution of NSP-1 funds by state, with grantees obligating 101.6% of their program funds within the specified time frame. HUD reported that NSP-1 grantees expended 49.1% of their grant funds by November 2010, with 14% used to benefit households below 50% of the area's median income. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $2 billion for NSP activities, requiring funds to be spent within two years. Under ARRA, $1.93 billion from NSP-2 was competitively distributed to eligible recipients, who must spend at least half within two years and 100% within three years. Funds were allocated based on foreclosure rates and project quality factors like ability to carry out activities, leveraging other funds, and neighborhood stabilization. This differed from NSP-1, which distributed funds by formula to states and local governments. HUD was required to establish grant selection criteria for NSP-2 within 75 days of ARRA passage. Applications were due within 150 days, with a minimum grant size of $5 million. Grantees had to return at least 100 abandoned homes to the housing stock within one year. $1.93 billion was awarded to 56 NSP-2 recipients on January 14, 2010. ARRA made modifications to NSP funds, including land bank establishment for foreclosed homes and limiting grant use for demolition. Redeveloped properties must be housing-related. HUD can allocate 10% of funds for capacity building. HUD allocated $50 million for technical assistance grants (NSP-TA) to help NSP grantees with underwriting, fiscal controls, and capacity building. NSP-TA grants were awarded to 9 national and 10 local organizations. ARRA allowed HUD to use up to 1% of NSP funds for staffing, training, and monitoring until September 30, 2012. HUD was granted authority to waive NSP requirements, except for fair housing, non-discrimination, labor standards, and environmental requirements. ARRA established protections for renters in federally and state-assisted housing, including prohibiting refusal to lease to Section 8 recipients. Grantees acquiring foreclosed properties with NSP funds must give tenants 90 days notice to vacate. A bona fide lease requires the mortgagor not be the tenant, rent not significantly below market rate, and no familial or common interests between renter and tenant. Eligible individuals for federal housing vouchers can benefit from NSP funding. NSP funding benefits eligible individuals with federal housing vouchers. Grantees cannot terminate leases solely based on Section 8 status. ARRA prohibits using funds to demolish public housing. Additional $1 billion allocated for NSP-3 under Dodd-Frank Act. The Wall Street Reform Act, P.L. 111-203, signed into law on July 21, 2010, allocated $5 million for states and $1 million for non-state grantees for NSP-3 funds. HUD published a Notice on October 19, 2010, detailing program requirements and allocation methods. Funds were distributed based on the percentage of homes in foreclosure with subprime loans or in delinquency. HUD established targeting thresholds for communities to receive direct allocations. HUD allocated funds based on foreclosures and vacancies in neighborhoods with high rates of subprime mortgages. Every state receives a minimum of $5 million. Approximately 283 grantees may receive funds, with a deadline for program plans submission on March 1, 2011. NSP-3 funds will be obligated by HUD by March 31, 2011. On March 1, 2011, Representative Gary Miller introduced the Neighborhood Stabilization Termination Act, H.R. 861, to rescind the $1 billion in NSP-3 funds. The House Financial Services Committee considered and approved the bill on March 9, 2011, requiring HUD to publish a notice of termination of the NSP program on its website within five days of enactment. The notice to be posted within five days of the bill's enactment directs citizens to contact their representatives if concerned about foreclosures. Representative Miller criticized the NSP-3 program as ineffective and a waste of taxpayer dollars, arguing for its funding to be rescinded due to the need to reduce federal debt. Other Members defended the program's success in helping communities combat the negative impacts of the foreclosure crisis on neighborhoods and property values. HUD's NSP program is expected to impact 100,000 properties in hard-hit markets, with 36,000 units already under construction. It is estimated to support over 93,000 jobs nationwide and helps reduce abandoned and foreclosed housing stock. A companion bill to H.R. 861 has not been introduced in the Senate."
