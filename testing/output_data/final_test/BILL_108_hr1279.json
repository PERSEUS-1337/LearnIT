    "content": "Incentives for biodiesel include a new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for biodiesel used as fuel. The biodiesel fuels credit under section 38 is determined by the biodiesel mixture credit, which is based on the biodiesel mixture rate for each gallon of biodiesel used in a qualified biodiesel mixture. The rate is 1 cent for each whole percentage point of biodiesel in the mixture, up to 20 percentage points. The term 'qualified biodiesel mixture' refers to a blend of diesel and biodiesel sold or used by the taxpayer in their trade or business. Biodiesel used in the production of such mixtures is eligible for the biodiesel fuels credit under section 38. The biodiesel used in the production of a qualified biodiesel mixture must be certified by the producer. No credit is allowed for casual off-farm production. Coordination with the exemption from excise tax is required. The credit for biodiesel is reduced to account for benefits from certain tax exemptions. Biodiesel is defined as monoalkyl esters of fatty acids from specific vegetable oils for diesel engines. Registration requirements apply. The term 'biodiesel' must meet registration requirements set by the EPA and ASTM D6751. If biodiesel is used in a qualified biodiesel mixture, a tax credit may be imposed. A tax is imposed on a person who separates biodiesel from a mixture or uses the mixture other than as a fuel. All applicable laws and penalties apply to this tax as if imposed by section 4081. Taxpayers can elect to not apply the biodiesel fuels credit for any taxable year. The credit is treated as part of the general business credit under Section 38(b) of the tax code. Regulations similar to those in subsection (d) of section 52 apply to pass-thru in the case of estates and trusts. The biodiesel fuels credit under the tax code can't be carried back before January 1, 2004. Amendments were made to sections 39(d) and 196(c) of the Code. The biodiesel fuels credit under the tax code is subject to certain amendments, including the addition of a new paragraph and changes to section 6501(m) and the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The tax code amendments include a reduction in motor fuel excise taxes on biodiesel mixtures, with changes to Section 4081 and the addition of a new subsection for biodiesel mixtures. The amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2003. The tax code amendments include a reduction in motor fuel excise taxes on biodiesel mixtures, with changes to Section 4081 and the addition of a new subsection for biodiesel mixtures.

The tax code amendments include a reduction in motor fuel excise taxes on biodiesel mixtures, with changes to Section 4081 and the addition of a new subsection for biodiesel mixtures.

The amendments made by this subsection reduce motor fuel excise taxes on biodiesel mixtures. The effective date for these changes is after December 31, 2003. Amounts equivalent to reductions in Highway Trust Fund receipts are transferred from the Commodity Credit Corporation funds to offset the impact of these amendments."
