Congress finds that the Secretary of Agriculture administers the National Forest System for multiple uses, including grazing by livestock through term permits. Currently, there are approximately 9,000 term grazing permits issued for 90,000,000 acres of National Forest System land. Approximately half of the 9,000 term grazing permits issued by the Secretary of Agriculture have expired or will expire by the end of 1996. Holders of expiring permits who have complied with the terms and conditions are preferred applicants for new permits if grazing is still deemed appropriate. Additionally, an estimated 1,600 term grazing permits may be waived by holders in favor of a purchaser of their permitted livestock or base property by the end of 1996. The Secretary of Agriculture must comply with environmental laws to issue new term grazing permits for expiring permits by the end of 1996. A strategy is in place for timely compliance with laws for most permits, but a small percentage may not receive new permits promptly. The purpose of this Act is to ensure uninterrupted grazing on National Forest System land by issuing new term grazing permits in a timely manner. This will provide long-term environmental protection and improvement of rangeland resources while also giving short-term certainty to permit holders and purchasers of permitted livestock or base property. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"expiring term grazing permit\" refers to grazing permits that expire in 1995 or 1996, or expired in 1994 without being replaced due to incomplete environmental analysis. The term \"final agency action\" denotes agency actions where all administrative remedies have been exhausted. \"Term grazing permit\" refers to permits issued by the Secretary under section 402 of the Federal Land Policy. The Secretary issues grazing permits under various laws, including the Federal Land Policy Act and the Granger-Thye Act. The Secretary issues new term grazing permits. The Secretary issues new term grazing permits without requiring completion of environmental analysis or final agency action, to expiring permit holders or purchasers of permitted livestock/base property from holders who waived their permits between 1995 and 1996. New term grazing permits issued to eligible individuals shall have the same terms and conditions as the expired or waived permits, and expire within 3 years of issuance or upon final agency action related to environmental analysis and laws. The Secretary shall cancel a new term grazing permit if final agency action is taken within 3 years of issuance, and may issue a term grazing permit for up to 10 years with necessary conditions for proper administration of rangeland resources. The Secretary will issue a new term grazing permit within 15 days of expiration for permits that expired before the enactment of the Act, and upon expiration for permits that expire after the enactment. For waived permits between 1995 and 1996, a new permit will be issued within 60 days. The holder must apply for a new grazing permit within 60 days of waiving the current permit to the Secretary. The issuance of a new term grazing permit under section 3(a) is not subject to administrative appeal or judicial review. This Act is repealed as of January 1, 2001."
