    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Payday Loan Consumer Protection Amendments of 2000\" aims to provide consumer protection in the payday loan industry. The Congress finds that payday lending targets individuals with limited access to affordable credit, with average APR of 474% nationally. State laws have been revised to exempt payday loan transactions from traditional usury limits and small loan interest caps. Payday lenders partner with insured depository institutions to avoid interest rate regulations. Lending practices that do not assess borrowers' ability to repay, encourage perpetual debt, or violate state laws are deemed unacceptable. Congress intended for Truth in Lending Act protections to apply to all credit transactions, including payday loans. The provision of Truth in Lending credit disclosures should be a more explicit requirement in Federal statutes and regulations to ensure fair lending practices in payday loan transactions. The purpose of the Act is to prohibit insured depository institutions from engaging in payday lending and to clarify that appropriate interest rate disclosure and consumer protections apply to all payday loans. SEC. 3. FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT AMENDMENT. Section 18 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act is amended to prohibit insured depository institutions from making payday loans directly or indirectly, or financing payday loans for other lenders. A payday loan is defined as a short-term cash advance in exchange for a consumer's personal check or share draft plus a fee. The amendment to Section 18 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act prohibits insured depository institutions from making payday loans directly or indirectly. This includes deferring presentment or negotiation of a consumer's personal check or share draft for a designated future date, or authorizing a debit from the consumer's transaction account on or after a designated future date. The Truth in Lending Act is being amended. The Truth in Lending Act is being amended to clarify that payday loans fall under the definition of credit and to prohibit certain unsafe lending practices related to payday loans from insured depository institutions. The Truth in Lending Act is being amended to prohibit unsafe lending practices related to payday loans from insured depository institutions. This includes ensuring that the personal check or account used for the loan is from an insured depository institution or credit union. Definitions for \"insured credit union\" and \"insured depository institution\" are provided. The term 'payday loan' is defined as a short-term cash advance to a consumer in exchange for a personal check or authorization to debit the consumer's account. The Truth in Lending Act is amended to increase civil liability limits for payday loans, with the consumer's account debited for the advance plus a fee on a future date. The Truth in Lending Act is amended to increase civil liability limits for payday loans, with changes to technical and conforming amendments. The requirements of this Act and its amendments will take effect 90 days after enactment, applying to payday loans initiated or renewed after that date."
