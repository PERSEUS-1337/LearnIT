    "title": "SB 890",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 6356.11 of the Revenue and Taxation Code exempts gross receipts from the sale of firearms, ammunition, and hunting supplies purchased by individuals with a valid hunting license during specific two-day periods in September and October. For the purposes of Revenue and Taxation Code Section 6356.11, \"firearms\" refer to legally sold guns, \"ammunition\" is designed for firing from firearms, and \"hunting supplies\" include archery items, off-road vehicles for hunting, vessels for hunting, and hunting accessories. Accessories, animal feed, apparel, shoes, bags, float tubes, binoculars, tools, firearm and archery cases, accessories, range finders, knives, decoys, and tree stands are considered hunting supplies for tax purposes. The exemption for hunting supplies includes decoys, tree stands, blinds, chairs, optics, hearing protection gear, holsters, belts, slings, and other miscellaneous gear primarily used for hunting. The exemption does not apply to certain taxes levied by counties, cities, or districts. The exemption for hunting supplies does not apply to specific taxes levied in California. A tax levy within the Insurance Code is amended to standardize fire policies in the state. A policy providing coverage against fire only, or in combination with other perils, does not need to comply with the standard form if the coverage is substantially equivalent or more favorable to the insured."
