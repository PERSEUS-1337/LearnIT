    "content": "In 1973, the Supreme Court issued landmark abortion rulings in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, finding that Texas and Georgia statutes regulating abortion were unconstitutional. The Texas statute only allowed abortions to save the mother's life, while the Georgia law permitted abortions in cases of serious threats to the woman's health, severe birth defects, or rape. The Court's decisions, delivered by Justice Blackmun, stated that states cannot categorically ban abortions. The Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton that states cannot ban abortions, citing the Fourteenth Amendment's right to personal privacy. The Court stated that this right includes a woman's decision on pregnancy termination and extends to activities related to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education. The Court held that states cannot make abortions difficult to obtain through procedural guidelines. The Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton ruled that states cannot ban abortions due to the right of personal privacy. The Court emphasized the need for a \"compelling State interest\" to limit this right, allowing for restrictions only during specified stages of pregnancy. The Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton established a framework for regulating abortion based on trimesters and fetal viability. The state's interest in protecting maternal health becomes compelling at the end of the first trimester, while the interest in the potential life of the fetus is at viability. After viability, the state can regulate or prohibit abortion except when necessary for the woman's life or health. This framework is grounded in the concept of fetal viability. In Doe v. Bolton, the Court extended Roe by striking down Georgia's requirements for abortions, stating that states cannot make abortions unreasonably difficult to obtain. The Court also addressed the question of whether a fetus is a person under the Constitution, noting that the term \"person\" is not specifically defined. The Court in Roe v. Wade emphasized that the word \"person\" in the Fourteenth Amendment does not include the unborn, focusing on the concept of viability as the point at which a fetus can potentially live outside the womb. This decision led to a wealth of post-Roe litigation addressing various federal and state requirements related to abortion. Following Roe, the Court examined federal and state requirements related to abortion, including informed consent, waiting periods, spousal and parental consent, reporting requirements, and restrictions on federal funding for abortion counseling in Rust v. Sullivan. The Court upheld the Title X regulations on both statutory and constitutional grounds, emphasizing free speech rights rather than the substantive right to abortion. The Court's decisions in cases like Maher v. Roe and Harris v. McRae found that a woman's right to abortion was not burdened by Title X regulations. Cases like Webster v. Reproductive Health Services and Planned Parenthood v. Casey show a shift in the Court's constitutional analysis post-Roe. Recent cases like Stenberg v. Carhart and Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood have implications for future legislative actions and court judgments. In Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, the Court upheld Missouri's restrictions on public employees and facilities for abortions, indicating a willingness to apply a less stringent standard of review to state abortion regulations. The Court criticized Roe's trimester framework and questioned the identification of viability as the point for state regulation to protect potential life. In Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, the Court upheld Missouri's restrictions on public employees and facilities for abortions, indicating a willingness to apply a less stringent standard of review to state abortion regulations. The State's interest in protecting potential human life was questioned, leading to a shift in direction with the Court's 1992 decision in Casey. This energized legislative activity at both federal and state levels, with some state legislative proposals later challenged in the courts. In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, the Court rejected the trimester framework of Roe v. Wade and introduced the \"undue burden\" standard to balance the government's interest in potential life with a woman's right to choose. This standard considers whether an abortion regulation creates a substantial obstacle for a woman seeking an abortion. In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, the Court introduced the \"undue burden\" standard to balance the government's interest in potential life with a woman's right to choose. The standard considers whether an abortion regulation creates a substantial obstacle for a woman seeking an abortion. Casey reaffirmed the essential holding of Roe, stating that a woman has a right to choose to have an abortion before viability without undue interference from the state, while the state can restrict abortions after viability with exceptions for life or health endangerment. The Pennsylvania law's 24-hour waiting period, informed consent, parental consent, and recordkeeping requirements were upheld under the undue burden standard. The Supreme Court upheld the Pennsylvania law's provisions on informed consent, parental consent, and recordkeeping, stating they did not impose an undue burden. However, the spousal notification requirement was deemed to impose an undue burden due to concerns about spousal abuse and discouraging women from seeking abortions. The spousal notification requirement in seeking an abortion was found to be a significant obstacle for many women, as it could prevent them from obtaining an abortion. The Supreme Court's decision in Casey allowed for more state restrictions on abortion, with the state's interest in protecting human life throughout pregnancy. Roe v. Wade, which considered abortion a fundamental right, allowed for a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy with minimal state involvement in the first trimester. The Casey Court's decision allowed for greater state restrictions on abortion, overturning previous rulings like City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health and Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. This led to the upholding of regulations such as 24-hour waiting periods and informed consent provisions under the \"undue burden\" standard. The impact of Casey was felt most in Pennsylvania, prompting other states to enact similar restrictions. The Court's decision in Stenberg v. Carhart in 2000 found a Nebraska statute banning \"partial-birth\" abortions unconstitutional due to lack of a health exception and vague language, impacting common abortion procedures during the second trimester. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 was passed by Congress to prohibit physicians from performing a partial-birth abortion, except in cases where it is necessary to save the life of the mother. Physicians who violate the act face fines and imprisonment. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 prohibits physicians from performing a partial-birth abortion, with penalties of fines, imprisonment, or both for violators. The act lacks a health exception, as argued by Senator Rick Santorum, who stated that such abortions pose significant health risks and are never necessary to preserve the mother's health. Federal courts in Nebraska, California, and New York quickly faced legal challenges to the act after its signing. The Court upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, stating it is not unconstitutionally vague and does not impose an undue burden on a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy. The federal statute provides doctors with clear guidelines on prohibited conduct, unlike the Nebraska law. The Court upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, stating that the inclusion of a scienter requirement alleviates vagueness concerns. The act only applies when a doctor deliberately delivers the fetus to specific anatomical landmarks, limiting prosecutorial discretion and not imposing an undue burden on a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy. The Court determined that the federal statute of 2003 does not impose an undue burden on a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy. It clarified that the statute does not encompass the D&E procedure, as it involves the removal of fetal parts, not the delivery of a living fetus. The act's requirement of an \"overt act\" that kills the fetus further demonstrates its inapplicability to the D&E procedure. The Court concluded that the federal statute of 2003 does not impose an undue burden on a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy, as it does not apply to the D&E procedure. The absence of a health exception was also deemed not to result in an undue burden, with the Court considering medical uncertainty regarding significant health risks. The Court upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 without a health exception, citing medical uncertainty as a basis. Exceptions may be considered in specific cases, and as-applied challenges allow for better quantification of medical risks. Justice Ginsburg dissented, joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Breyer. Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Breyer, criticized the Court's decision to uphold the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 without a health exception. She argued that the prohibited procedure has safety advantages for women with certain medical conditions and questioned the lack of consideration for medical uncertainty. The Supreme Court's refusal to invalidate the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 on facial grounds was criticized by Justice Ginsburg. In Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, the Court remanded a case involving New Hampshire's Parental Notification Prior to Abortion Act for narrower relief, finding only a few applications raised constitutional concerns. The law required written notice to parents or guardians before performing an abortion on a pregnant minor or woman under guardianship. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England and other abortion providers challenged the New Hampshire statute for lacking a waiver allowing abortions to protect women's health. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit invalidated the statute, citing vagueness in the life exception and the risk it posed to patients' lives. The Court declined to revisit prior abortion decisions and focused on the question of remedy in the Ayotte case. They determined that a more narrow remedy, rather than wholesale invalidation of the act, was appropriate to address the constitutional flaw in the statute. The Court emphasized limiting the solution to the problem and identified three principles guiding their approach to remedies. The Court emphasized the importance of legislative intent in determining remedies for unconstitutional statutes, stating that it cannot rewrite laws to conform to constitutional requirements. The touchstone for any decision about remedy is legislative intent, and the Court cannot circumvent the intent of the legislature. On remand, the lower courts were expected to determine the intent of the New Hampshire legislature when enacting the parental notification statute. The New Hampshire legislature repealed the Parental Notification Prior to Abortion Act in response to a federal court order. The Court's decision in Ayotte showed a willingness to invalidate abortion regulations only in certain circumstances. Federal courts may save a statute from invalidation by severing unconstitutional provisions. In Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, the Court invalidated two Texas requirements for abortion providers and physicians. Physicians were required to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, and abortion facilities had to meet ASC standards. This decision was seen as expanding federal judicial power over the states. The Supreme Court invalidated Texas requirements for abortion providers and physicians, including admitting privileges at a nearby hospital and meeting ASC standards. Supporters argued for higher care standards, while opponents viewed the requirements as unnecessary and costly. The Court rejected the Fifth Circuit's grounds for upholding the requirements, with Justice Breyer emphasizing evidence and arguments in the decision. The Supreme Court invalidated Texas requirements for abortion providers and physicians, including admitting privileges at a nearby hospital and meeting ASC standards. Justice Breyer emphasized the importance of considering evidence and arguments in judicial proceedings when assessing the constitutionality of abortion regulations. The Court heavily relied on evidence collected by the district court in examining the admitting privileges and ASC requirements, disputing the state's assertion that the purpose of the admitting privileges requirement was to ensure easy access to a hospital in case of complications. The Supreme Court invalidated Texas requirements for abortion providers and physicians, including admitting privileges at a nearby hospital and meeting ASC standards. The Court emphasized that the admitting privileges requirement and ASC standards imposed substantial obstacles on women seeking abortion, citing evidence of facility closures and increased driving distances. The Court concluded that these requirements did not benefit patients and were unnecessary, ultimately placing an undue burden on women's access to abortion. The Supreme Court invalidated Texas requirements for abortion providers and physicians, including admitting privileges at a nearby hospital and meeting ASC standards. The Court found that these requirements posed a substantial obstacle for women seeking abortions, leading to facility closures and increased driving distances. The Court clarified the undue burden standard by emphasizing the importance of record evidence in balancing the benefits and burdens of abortion regulations. The Fifth Circuit's dismissal of similar evidence was noted in the case of Whole Woman's Health. The Supreme Court addressed funding restrictions for abortions, including the Hyde Amendment, which limited the use of federal funds for Medicaid abortions. Two categories of public funding cases were heard: restrictions for nontherapeutic abortions and limitations for therapeutic abortions. The Supreme Court ruled that states are not obligated to fund elective abortions or provide public facilities for such procedures. In Beal v. Doe, the Court stated that Medicaid does not require states to fund all medical procedures and that it is not inconsistent to refuse funding for unnecessary services. However, states are free to include coverage for nontherapeutic abortions if they choose. Similarly, in Maher v. Roe, the Court held that states participating in Medicaid are not required to pay for expenses related to nontherapeutic abortions. The Supreme Court ruled that states are not obligated to fund elective abortions or provide public facilities for such procedures. In Beal v. Doe, the Court stated that Medicaid does not require states to fund all medical procedures and that it is not inconsistent to refuse funding for unnecessary services. Connecticut's policy of favoring childbirth over abortion was held not to impinge upon the fundamental right of privacy recognized in Roe. Poelker v. Doe upheld a municipal regulation denying indigent pregnant women nontherapeutic abortions at public hospitals. Staffing hospitals with personnel opposed to abortions did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The 1977 Supreme Court decisions left open the question of whether the Hyde Amendment and similar state laws require states to pay for nontherapeutic abortions. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment's abortion funding restrictions in Harris v. McRae, ruling 5-4 that it did not violate due process or equal protection guarantees. In a companion case, Williams v. Zbaraz, a similar Illinois funding restriction was also deemed constitutional. These rulings indicate that states participating in Medicaid can choose to fund only medically necessary abortions without federal reimbursement. The Supreme Court's rulings in McRae and Zbaraz affirmed that there is no obligation for the federal government or states to fund medically necessary abortions. The decisions in Roe and Doe sparked debates and various governmental actions at different levels to restrict their impact. Congress has seen over 1,000 legislative proposals related to abortion since 1973, showcasing the significant influence of the Court's decisions on legislative action. The Court's 1973 decisions spurred congressional action, leading to proposals to restrict or secure the right to abortion. Various legislative initiatives, including the Freedom of Choice Act and the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, have been introduced with differing success. Initially, efforts focused on a constitutional amendment to overrule Roe v. Wade, but this approach faced challenges. Following Roe v. Wade, several constitutional amendments were proposed to overturn the decision, but none have been passed. Interest in a constitutional amendment peaked in the 94th Congress with nearly 80 amendments introduced, but by the 98th Congress, the number had significantly declined. The only constitutional amendment on abortion debated and voted on in either chamber was S.J.Res. 3 during the 98th Congress, which was sent to the Senate floor without recommendation after subcommittee hearings and a tied Judiciary Committee vote. S.J.Res. 3, a proposed constitutional amendment on abortion, was defeated in the Senate on June 28, 1983, with a vote of 50-49. The amendment aimed to remove federal institutions from abortion policymaking and reinstate state authorities as decision-makers. Despite its defeat, opponents of abortion have introduced alternative bills to achieve similar objectives without amending the Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment empowers Congress to enforce due process and equal protection guarantees through appropriate legislation. S. 158, introduced in the 97th Congress, aimed to declare human life begins at conception, allowing states to enact laws protecting human life. Controversy arose over the constitutionality of this declaration and the withdrawal of federal court jurisdiction over challenges to state laws. A modified version, S. 1741, was approved in subcommittee but not further considered. Opponents of abortion also sought to ban the use of federal funds for abortion. Opponents of abortion sought to ban federal funds for abortion, focusing on Medicaid. The program initially did not cover abortions but started reimbursing states during the Nixon Administration influenced by Roe v. Wade. Congress has since attached abortion funding restrictions to various appropriations bills. The Hyde Amendment, part of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1973, restricts Medicaid funding for abortions under the Department of Health and Human Services. Initially only allowing exceptions for the life of the mother, it was later expanded to include cases of rape and incest in 1993. Efforts have been made to revert to the original language. Efforts to restore the original language (providing only for the life of the woman exception) failed in the 104th Congress. Hyde-type abortion limitations were added to Department of Defense appropriations measures starting in 1978 and eventually made permanent in 1985. The Hyde Amendment process was extended to the Department of the Treasury and Postal Service Appropriations Act in 1983, prohibiting the use of funds for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) to pay for abortions, except in cases where the life of the woman was in danger. This restriction followed an attempt by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to eliminate nonlife-saving abortion coverage, which was challenged by federal employee unions. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) attempted to eliminate nonlife-saving abortion coverage, which was challenged by federal employee unions. A federal district court later ruled that OPM acted outside its authority. The 104th Congress reinstated the restriction on using Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) funds for abortions, except in cases of endangerment to the mother, rape, or incest. Funding for abortions in prisons is also restricted, except in cases of endangerment to the mother, rape, or incest. Since 1979, restrictive abortion provisions have been included in appropriations measures for the District of Columbia (DC). The Dornan Amendment prohibited DC from using funds for abortions, but in 2009, Congress lifted the restriction on DC funds. However, the Dornan Amendment has been reimposed, restricting only federal funds for abortions. Various permanent abortion restrictions have been enacted since 1970. Various permanent abortion restrictions have been enacted in a variety of contexts since 1970. For example, the Family Planning Services and Population Research Act of 1970 bars the use of funds for programs involving abortion as a method of family planning. The Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974 prohibits lawyers in federally funded legal aid programs from providing legal assistance for nontherapeutic abortions. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act allows employers to not pay health insurance benefits for abortion, except to save the mother's life. The Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1988 clarifies that it neither prohibits nor requires individuals or entities to provide or pay for abortion-related services. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes provisions on abortion coverage by qualified health plans available through exchanges, which has been controversial due to the use of premium tax credits for nontherapeutic abortion services. The ACA refers to the Hyde Amendment in addressing this issue. The ACA distinguishes between two types of abortions for health plans offered through exchanges: abortions for which federal funds may be used and elective abortions. Individuals receiving premium tax credits can choose a plan covering elective abortions, but strict payment and accounting rules are in place to prevent federal funds from being used. Plan issuers can decide whether to cover elective abortions or only abortions permitted by federal funds. States have the option to prohibit abortion coverage. The ACA allows states to prohibit abortion coverage in exchange plans and requires separate payments for elective abortion coverage in qualified health plans. Premium tax credits or subsidies cannot be used to pay for elective abortions, and strict payment and accounting rules are in place to ensure compliance. State health insurance commissioners enforce segregation requirements for payments used exclusively for specified services, following accounting standards and government guidance. Plan issuers estimate the cost of coverage for elective abortions based on average actuarial basis, with a minimum cost of $1 per enrollee per month. The estimate cannot consider cost reductions from services like prenatal or postnatal care. Under the ACA, qualified health plans must provide notice of coverage for elective abortions to enrollees. The ACA also includes conscience protection and prohibits discrimination against healthcare providers unwilling to provide or refer for abortions. President Donald J. Trump signed H.R. 244, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, on May 5, 2017. The measure provided FY2017 funds for various federal agencies, including restrictions on the use of federal and local DC funds to pay for abortions. Funding restrictions on abortion and abortion-related services were retained, and foreign operations funds could not be used by organizations supporting coercive abortion programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, signed by President Trump, prohibited the use of funds for coercive abortion programs or involuntary sterilization. Appropriated funds were not available for abortions as a method of family planning or to lobby for or against abortion. Funds were only available for voluntary family planning projects that offered a range of services and methods. Contributions to the UNFPA were conditioned on not funding abortions, and funds had to be kept separate from other accounts. The UNFPA and other entities were restricted from using funds for abortions, except in cases of endangerment to the mother's life, rape, or incest. Funds from H.R. 244, Department of Justice, and HHS could not be used for abortions, except in specific circumstances. The House passed H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2017, by a vote of 238-183. Introduced by Representative Christopher H. Smith, the bill would permanently prohibit the use of federal funds for abortion, imposing additional restrictions on its availability. The House passed H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2017, which would amend the Internal Revenue Code to disqualify health plans covering elective abortions from receiving premium tax credits. It would also make the Dornan Amendment permanent, restricting the use of local DC funds for abortions, and require disclosure of abortion services coverage in health plan marketing materials. The bill was received in the Senate on January 30, 2017, but no further action has been taken. On October 3, 2017, the House passed H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would prohibit abortions after 20 weeks postfertilization age, with exceptions for saving the life of the mother or in cases of rape. Violators would face fines or imprisonment. The bill was received in the Senate on October 4, 2017, but no further action has been taken. The House passed H.R. 4712, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, requiring care for a fetus \"born alive\" after an abortion. Introduced by Representative Marsha Blackburn, the bill mandates health care practitioners to provide necessary care to preserve the life and health of the fetus. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act mandates care for a fetus \"born alive\" after an abortion. Failure to provide necessary care could result in fines, imprisonment, or both. H.R. 4712 was received in the Senate but no further action has been taken. A companion measure, S. 220, has also not been considered. The bill H.R. 1628 aims to exclude coverage of elective abortions in qualified health plans, impacting individual health coverage choices. It also restricts federal funds for nonprofit organizations offering elective abortions. Similar provisions were included in Senate discussion drafts BCRA and ORRA. Representative Diane Black introduced H.R. 354, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2017, which aims to restrict federal funds for Planned Parenthood Federation of America and its affiliates unless they certify not to perform abortions. H.R. 644, the Conscience Protection Act, was also introduced by Representative Black. Representative Black introduced H.R. 644, the Conscience Protection Act of 2017, establishing a private right of action for healthcare providers facing retaliation for not participating in abortions. A companion measure, S. 301, was introduced in the Senate. Additionally, H.R. 656, the Women's Public Health and Safety Act, allows states to set criteria for entities performing abortions under Medicaid. President Trump signed H.R. 1625, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, maintaining funding restrictions on abortion services in Medicaid."
