    "content": "The United States views the Caribbean Basin as strategically important due to its geographic location, sea-lanes, resources, and historical defense role. U.S. foreign policies have aimed to promote stability while protecting American interests. CARICOM consists of 12 islands and 3 larger coastal nations. CARICOM is a group of 12 island and 3 larger coastal nations in the Caribbean Sea, with diverse cultural influences. Some members are designated as less developed countries for special treatment. The region is united by the sea but divided by differences in population, land size, economies, and social indicators. The tension between unity and division in Caribbean society is a common theme, known as the \"CARICOM challenge.\" CARICOM was established in 1973 with the Treaty of Chaguaramas, learning from the failed West Indies Federation. Despite challenges, the region's hope for economic integration led to the formation of CARIFTA in 1965. In 1965, the Caribbean Free Trade Association (CARIFTA) was formed, paving the way for deeper commitment under CARICOM five years later. CARICOM, comprising the Caribbean Community and the Common Market, aimed at regional integration without supranational authority, allowing for easier ratification. However, full regional integration was not achieved. CARICOM, a regional structure created by national governments, aimed at making national policies more effective within a regional framework. The Common Market focused on trade and investment integration but did not evolve much beyond a loose trading regime. CARICOM successfully brought together a diverse group of states, leading to the formation of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) in 1981. In 2001, CARICOM adopted the CSME concept in the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas, replacing the Common Market. The Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas replaced the Common Market with the aim of achieving economic integration, coordination of foreign policies, and functional cooperation within CARICOM and the CSME. Overcoming the challenges of small scale has been a key focus, including seeking scale economies, greater intraregional trade, shared costs in public sector goods provision, and unified policy responses in the international arena. Despite some successes, CARICOM has faced challenges in maintaining momentum. CARICOM faced external challenges in the 1970s and 1980s, leading to slow growth, rising debt, and political division. Despite ties to Europe and the US through trade preferences, deeper integration was discouraged. By the 1990s, the region's economies improved, but CARICOM struggled to diversify economic activity. In the 1970s and 1980s, CARICOM faced external challenges leading to slow growth, rising debt, and political division. By the 1990s, the region's economies improved, but CARICOM began to experience declining growth in output and productivity. The World Trade Organization pressed the European Union to eliminate trade preferences for CARICOM exports, and the US entered into free trade agreements with Western Hemisphere countries, eroding the benefits of CBI preference programs. This led to a shift in CARICOM's trade patterns and incentives to move beyond a customs union. CARICOM, a trade-related development strategy from the 1970s, did not significantly boost intraregional trade as expected. Intraregional trade peaked in 1998 but remained low, with Trinidad and Tobago's oil exports dominating. Structural factors and slow implementation of CARICOM policies hindered trade growth within the region. Future growth in trade within CARICOM is limited due to structural factors and a high concentration of export products. To boost trade, focus should shift to exchanges outside of CARICOM, requiring careful management of small-state volatility. There are asymmetries in trade performance among countries, with Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados showing the largest export growth. Smaller countries, with reduced agricultural output and increased tourism, are experiencing smaller export growth. Jamaica has seen a decline in exports within CARICOM. Jamaica has experienced a decline in exports within CARICOM due to macroeconomic instability, particularly affecting the manufacturing sector. Despite limited real growth in intraregional trade, CARICOM has seen gains in integration outside the trade area, such as shared institutional responsibilities and efficiency gains from complementary production structures. The CSME aims to move beyond a limited customs union approach to capitalize on non-trade benefits like efficient factor allocation and improved competitiveness. The OECS has shown higher growth due to macroeconomic stability, while larger states like Guyana and Jamaica have struggled with economic volatility. The CSME was established in 2006 with 12 member countries embracing deeper economic integration. The CSME, established in 2006 with 12 member countries, aims for deeper economic integration by 2015. The vision includes a \"single economy\" with new commitments to national policy consolidation. Sovereignty debates persist, but economic performance and policy coordination are crucial for success. The CSME aims for deeper economic integration by transforming CARICOM into a common economic space with market-oriented approaches, policy coordination, and free movement of goods, services, investment, and labor. The goal is to enhance competitiveness and overcome challenges such as reliance on tariff revenue and economic restructuring. The challenges to deeper integration within CARICOM include a high reliance on tariff revenue, resistance to relinquishing national decision-making authority, diverse priorities among countries, incongruent macroeconomic policies, and divergent trade and economic growth performance. Developing institutional, financial, and technical capacity within CARICOM remains a challenge, with limited intra-CARICOM investment and geographically constrained labor mobility. The World Bank identifies five key issues for the CSME: increasing productivity. The World Bank highlights five important issues for the CSME: increasing productivity, expanding trade openness, improving public investment in infrastructure and education, reducing the size of government, and maintaining macroeconomic stability. The CARICOM countries have narrow production structures from their colonial past, focusing on sugar, banana, minerals, and tourism. The CSME aims to bring trade benefits and efficiency gains to the public sector by eliminating redundancies and enhancing cooperation. The Caribbean economies have historically relied on sugar and banana production, with later developments in minerals extraction and tourism. The region's trade regime remained undiversified and sheltered from competition, hindering broader-based development. As trade preferences eroded, the Caribbean faced challenges due to high production costs and lack of competitiveness. The global economy forced changes on CARICOM's trade relationships, leading to a declining importance of trade in the region. The trade regime in the Caribbean is shifting away from preferences with the EU and the US towards reciprocal agreements. Intra-regional trade within CARICOM is stagnant, while trade with Latin America and Asia is growing. This trend suggests a decline in manufacturing and agricultural exports in favor of services like tourism and finance. The Caribbean trade regime is transitioning towards reciprocal agreements, with a shift towards services like tourism, finance, and education. However, these alternatives are not developing fast enough to address income, employment, and migration issues. The economic transition poses the greatest challenge for the CSME, with changing economic relations with major partners being explored. CARICOM trade policy is formulated by Heads of State and implemented through the Caribbean Regional Negotiating Mechanism (RNM) in Jamaica and Barbados. The RNM was established in 1997 to coordinate regional trade policy and address external trade matters. The Caribbean trade regime is transitioning towards reciprocal agreements, with a focus on services like tourism, finance, and education. The Regional Negotiating Mechanism (RNM) in Jamaica and Barbados coordinates trade policy for CARICOM, dividing negotiations into three \"theatres\" with the European Union, the United States, and multilateral agreements. Institutional challenges include the need for compromise among 15 countries with diverse priorities and economic structures. The RNM is seen as understaffed and underfinanced but provides valuable trade expertise. Despite evolving trade patterns in CARICOM, intraregional exports and imports have stagnated or declined as a percentage of total trade. Intraregional exports peaked at 21.5% in 1998 but have since decreased to less than 15%. Intraregional imports have remained between 10% and 12% over the past decade, highlighting a high dependency on foreign markets for various goods. This reliance on external markets emphasizes the importance of completing the CSME. The United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean are CARICOM's major trade partners. The major trade partners of CARICOM are the United States, Latin America, and the European Union. CARICOM exports have shown growth, with the United States ranking first. Latin America is also emerging as a significant trade partner. Canada and Asia have opposite trends in export growth, with Canada expanding slowly and Asia rapidly growing. However, aggregate export data can be misleading due to a large portion of petroleum-related products from Trinidad and Tobago. Subtracting energy exports reveals smaller growth in extraregional exports, especially to the United States. CARICOM imports, mainly from the United States, have been growing at a below-average rate compared to other countries. Imports from the EU, LAC, and Asia are growing above average, while imports from Canada are below average. CARICOM runs a trade deficit with the world, with recent export growth driven by energy-related products from Trinidad and Tobago. Services exports have also increased due to tourism. 13 out of 15 CARICOM members have signed PetroCaribe Energy Cooperation Agreements with Venezuela for oil purchases on deferred payment terms. The CARICOM region's dependence on foreign capital has steadily increased over the past decade, with the top three investors being the United States, Europe, and Canada. The stock of foreign direct investment is concentrated in the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago. Implementing the EPA with the EU is a key trade policy challenge for CARICOM. The Lom\u00e9 Convention, a trade agreement between Europe and its former colonies, provided duty-free preferences for sugar, bananas, and rum. However, it required waivers to the GATT nondiscrimination clause, leading to confrontations and challenges in the WTO. Countries are now replacing these arrangements with WTO-compatible reciprocal trade agreements. The WTO ruled against the EU in 1997, leading to a new banana agreement in 2000. The Cotonou Agreement of 2000 aimed to replace unilateral trade preferences with a WTO-compatible arrangement by January 1, 2008. This transition was crucial for Caribbean countries heavily reliant on protected banana, sugar, and rum trade with the EU. The EPA replaced discriminatory trade rules under the Cotonou Agreement to comply with WTO standards. The agreement allows CARICOM products to enter the EU duty-free, except for sugar and rice, which face tariffs until 2010. The EPA requires reciprocal trade liberalization to meet WTO guidelines. The EPA requires CARICOM to reciprocate with full trade liberalization to meet WTO guidelines. The EU has granted a grace period of up to 25 years for certain \"sensitive\" products, with tariffs on EU exports of these goods being phased out gradually. Aid for business and export capacity development will also be provided by the EU. The EPA must be provisionally applied by April 15, 2008, and each country's legislature needs to ratify the agreement, which could be controversial due to dissatisfaction from industries like banana production. CARICOM is a small trade partner of the United States, ranking 23rd in U.S. exports and 30th in U.S. imports in 2006. U.S. exports to CARICOM have been weak, lagging behind average growth of U.S. exports globally. The Bahamas, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago absorb 70% of U.S. exports to the region. U.S. imports from CARICOM have shown uneven growth, with a sudden rise after 2002 due to energy-related goods. The skewed nature of U.S.-CARICOM trade is evident in the highly concentrated trade patterns. The dominance of energy goods in U.S. imports from CARICOM countries has led to lackluster growth in non-energy goods. This trend has implications for U.S.-CARICOM trade, with only 20% of U.S. merchandise imports coming from 14 out of 15 countries in the region. The shift towards services-based economies in CARICOM countries, along with stagnant growth in non-energy imports, suggests that U.S. merchandise trade may not be a significant growth area for most countries in the region. The U.S. economy's importance as a trade partner with CARICOM countries will depend on U.S. trade policy responses. U.S. foreign investment in the region has doubled in the past five years, with most concentrated in the Bahamas, Barbados, and Trinidad and Tobago. Jamaica has seen a decline in U.S. investment since 2004. The United States has bilateral investment treaties with Grenada, Haiti, and Jamaica, and trade policy discussions are conducted through a Trade and Investment Council. The United States and CARICOM conduct trade talks through a Trade and Investment Council (TIC). The U.S. has proposed transitioning from a TIC to a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) to prioritize trade relations. CARICOM has not responded to this suggestion yet. The main U.S. policy issue is whether to continue unilateral trade preferences or negotiate a reciprocal free trade agreement with CARICOM. CARICOM has supported U.S. trade initiatives like the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) but is less enthusiastic about a bilateral agreement. Discussions on trade policy options are ongoing in the TIC. The Trade and Investment Council (TIC) is discussing trade policy options, including renewing and expanding unilateral preferences, negotiating a reciprocal FTA, or letting preferences expire. The current trade relationship is covered by the CBERA program and the CBTPA, which is set to expire in FY2008 and is being challenged in the WTO. U.S. and CARICOM policymakers are considering their options for future trade agreements. The CBTPA preferences are set to expire, and U.S. trade policy is shifting towards reciprocal FTAs. A permanent FTA with the U.S. offers predictability in trade rules and eliminates uncertainties for foreign investors. FTAs cover a wider range of goods compared to unilateral preferences. The issue of special and differential treatment is a policy question, and CARICOM countries are divided on the desirability of an FTA with the U.S. Smaller Caribbean countries are less interested due to limited exports to the U.S. CARICOM is highly skeptical about a reciprocal FTA with the United States due to concerns about opening the economy to greater competition and potential challenges in meeting obligations. Many countries in CARICOM prefer to discuss extending unilateral preferences instead of pursuing a comprehensive agreement. CARICOM has deferred a decision on a U.S. FTA, focusing on completing the EPA with the EU and lobbying for trade preference extensions with the United States. A trade dispute between the U.S. and Antigua and Barbuda over Internet gambling services has also been a major issue. Antigua and Barbuda requested WTO consultations over U.S. laws discriminating against foreign cross-border gambling. The United States was found to be in violation of its commitments under the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) regarding Internet gambling. Despite initially disagreeing with the ruling, the U.S. eventually agreed to comply but later decided to modify its services commitments to exclude Internet gambling. This decision was made under a provision in GATS Article XXI. The U.S. argued that it never intended to include Internet gambling in its GATS commitments, but it is required to compensate affected WTO members for these modifications. Under GATS, the United States must compensate affected WTO members. Settlements are being negotiated with the EU, Japan, Canada, India, Costa Rica, and Macao. Antigua and Barbuda requested WTO authorization to suspend concessions and obligations equal to $3.4 billion annually. The WTO ruled in favor of Antigua and Barbuda, allowing them to impose $21 million in trade sanctions against the United States. The WTO ruled in favor of Antigua and Barbuda, allowing them to impose $21 million in trade sanctions against the United States due to the small economy's dependency on U.S. services imports. The compensation was controversial as the methodology for determining financial loss was questioned, the amount was considered low, and it raised concerns about smaller countries' recourse under the WTO. The United States argued against suspending TRIPS obligations as a poor cross-retaliation precedent. The CARICOM countries, except for the Bahamas and Montserrat, are members of the WTO but struggle to finance a permanent office in Geneva. The RNM serves as the main negotiating body for CARICOM, aligning their perspectives with developing country groups within the WTO framework. They are negotiating to find a bilateral solution to render the WTO ruling moot and uphold intellectual property rights. CARICOM, as part of developing country groups in the WTO framework, seeks special treatment for small vulnerable economies. They face challenges in trade liberalization and have less influence in negotiations compared to larger developing countries like Brazil and India. CARICOM is concerned about the treatment of their key exports in trade agreements like the EPA and the Doha Round. They are seeking differentiated provisions to extend their adjustment time to trade barriers reduction. CARICOM has initiated limited bilateral trade agreements with various countries, but these are still in early stages of negotiation and not as comprehensive as those undertaken by the United States. CARICOM has initiated limited bilateral trade agreements with various countries, such as Canada and Costa Rica, but these are not as comprehensive as those undertaken by the United States. Both Canada and CARICOM are interested in expanding to a reciprocal trade agreement, with CARICOM having received a mandate to commence negotiations. Costa Rica and CARICOM signed a limited product reciprocal trade agreement in March 2003, focusing on reducing tariffs and other trade barriers for specific products. CARICOM has engaged in limited bilateral trade agreements with countries like Canada, Costa Rica, Colombia, and Venezuela. These agreements focus on incremental market access and selective product-based commitments. Negotiations have faced challenges in deepening commitments due to fundamental differences. CARICOM's agreement with Cuba is limited in market access, allowing for some expansion of products with reduced tariffs. The CSME is seen as crucial for addressing economic issues like unemployment and poverty. Intraregional integration is incomplete, but efforts are being made to deepen cooperation and tighten trade rules. Identifying new revenue sources and addressing macroeconomic challenges are key priorities for the region. CARICOM is focused on managing the process of integrating into the global economy, emphasizing the need for increased productivity and trade liberalization. However, the region is hesitant to adopt rapid changes and insists on a gradual transition with special treatment. Historical trade relationships with Europe and the United States have not adequately prepared CARICOM for global trade liberalization. This cautious approach could potentially delay necessary policy reforms for the region's success. Trade liberalization may delay policy reforms crucial for the success of the CSME in a region attempting to unify economic policies of 15 countries. Decisive collective action is needed to move forward meaningfully. Challenges include adjusting to the EPA with the EU and potential redefinition of U.S.-CARICOM trade relations. Lack of clear action on trade policy could have costly consequences, raising important questions for the United States. The United States views trade policy as crucial for supporting economic development and political stability in the CARICOM region. Growth and stability are believed to foster cooperation in countering illicit drug trafficking, immigration, and terrorist activity. Congress has a broad policy agenda in mind for formulating U.S. trade policy towards CARICOM."
