    "content": "Close to 75 million people in 39 states face earthquake risks, with the greatest hazards in the western United States. The federal government supports efforts to assess and monitor earthquake hazards under the NEHRP. Congress is evaluating the effectiveness of federally supported earthquake programs in the US. The United States has federal programs supporting earthquake monitoring and research to reduce vulnerability. All 50 states and the District of Columbia face earthquake hazards, with the western states at the greatest risk. Alaska is the most earthquake-prone state, experiencing frequent high-magnitude earthquakes. Alaska has low risk for economic losses from earthquakes due to its low population and infrastructure density. In contrast, California faces high risk with its frequent seismic activity and large population. Figure 1 shows earthquake hazard levels in the United States based on frequency and potential ground shaking. It indicates the likelihood of earthquake occurrence and strongest shaking areas. The USGS released National Seismic Hazards Maps in 2008, showing earthquake hazard levels in the United States. The maps indicate high earthquake hazard in the Rocky Mountain region, South Carolina, and the New Madrid Seismic Zone. 75 million people in 39 states are at significant risk, with lower ground motions in the central and eastern US compared to the 2002 version. The 2008 National Seismic Hazards Maps show lower ground motions in the western United States for long-period seismic waves affecting taller buildings. Higher estimates for ground motion in western Oregon and Washington are due to new models for the Cascadia subduction zone. The USGS gave more weight to the probability of a catastrophic magnitude 9 earthquake in the region. California has a 99% chance of experiencing a magnitude 6.7 or larger earthquake. In April 2008, California has a 99% chance of a magnitude 6.7 or larger earthquake in the next 30 years. The likelihood of a magnitude 7.5 or greater earthquake is 46%, with the highest probability in the southern part of the state. The San Andreas fault in southern California has a 59% probability of generating a major earthquake, while the Hayward-Rodgers Creek fault in northern California has a 31% probability. These earthquake forecasts are part of the \"Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast (UCERF)\" produced by a working group including the USGS and the California Geological Survey. Since 2000, only two deaths in the US were directly caused by earthquakes, while over 685,000 fatalities occurred in other countries. Most deaths were from the 2004 Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The National Earthquake Information Center detects mostly small earthquakes, with only a few strong earthquakes exceeding magnitude 6.0 each year. Since 2000, only two deaths in the US were directly caused by earthquakes, while over 685,000 fatalities occurred in other countries. The National Earthquake Information Center detects mostly small earthquakes, with only a few strong earthquakes exceeding magnitude 6.0 each year. Larger earthquakes cause the most damage and deaths, with the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 claiming an estimated 3,000 lives. Estimating seismic hazard and assessing risk is crucial in preparing for potential losses due to earthquakes. The 1994 Northridge earthquake was the most damaging in the US in the past 100 years, followed by the Loma Prieta earthquake. Comparing losses between earthquakes and other disasters like hurricanes is challenging due to different calculation methods. The US faces risks from earthquake hazards, and estimating potential losses involves assigning value to at-risk infrastructure. The United States faces potentially large total losses due to earthquake-caused damage to buildings and infrastructure, with estimates of over $500 billion for a severe earthquake in Los Angeles and approximately $900 billion for one in the New Jersey-Philadelphia corridor. Concerns are increasing about the exposure of the built environment to potential earthquake damage as urban development continues in earthquake-prone regions. Estimating earthquake losses involves adjusting past damage estimates for inflation, wealth, and population changes. Studies combine seismic risk with building and income losses to estimate economic losses. FEMA reported an average annualized loss of $5.3 billion nationwide, with California, Oregon, and Washington accounting for $4.1 billion. The annualized earthquake loss (AEL) in the U.S. amounts to nearly $4.1 billion, with metropolitan areas like Los Angeles and Memphis showing varying levels of seismic risk and building resilience. AEL allows for comparisons between regions with different seismic hazards and building types, annualizing expected losses for better risk assessment. While a single large earthquake can cause more damage than the average annual estimate, AEL helps in comparing infrequent high-impact events like earthquakes with more common hazards like floods and hurricanes. The annualized earthquake losses in the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island metropolitan area are $30 million, despite no recent destructive earthquakes. This area, with low seismic hazard but extensive infrastructure and dense population, faces significant risk to people and structures. In 2008, FEMA estimated nationwide annualized earthquake losses at $5.3 billion, a 21% increase from the previous report in 2001. Despite a 50% growth in building inventory, the estimate decreased to $5.6 billion when adjusted for inflation. Factors leading to the decreased estimate included a slight decrease in earthquake hazard in the western United States, except for parts of Washington and Utah. The distribution of building inventory in California changed with a 17% increase in wood frame buildings and reductions in masonry (-6%), steel (-5.8%), and concrete (-3%) buildings. Wood frame buildings are less vulnerable to earthquake damage. FEMA attributed 78% of loss reduction between 2001 and 2008 to this change, with 22% to decreased earthquake hazard in California. The New Madrid Seismic Zone in the central US is vulnerable to large but infrequent earthquakes. The New Madrid earthquakes in 1811-1812 struck the Mississippi Valley, centered near New Madrid, MO, with tremors felt as far as Charleston, SC, and Washington, DC. The mechanism for these earthquakes is poorly understood, and no similar events have occurred since. Estimating earthquake damage depends on factors like ground motion probability and building construction quality, making it challenging to predict damage for low-frequency, high-impact events in the New Madrid region. The uncertainty in predicting earthquakes in the New Madrid region has implications for policy decisions on building codes and structures to withstand seismic hazards. Some researchers question the cost-benefit of conforming structures to earthquake probability estimates due to the uncertainty involved. This raises doubts about the accuracy of ground motion estimates in the New Madrid Seismic Zone. The uncertainty in estimating earthquake hazard in the New Madrid Seismic Zone is due to the small amount of ground motion measured across major faults, compared to faster motions in California. Seismologists measure ground motion to estimate stress buildup on faults, with faster motion indicating quicker stress buildup. This stress may be released in an earthquake, with fast-moving faults like the San Andreas Fault having shorter earthquake recurrence periods compared to slower-moving faults. The USGS attributes seismic hazard to the New Madrid Seismic Zone comparable to California, despite the current lack of ground motion. The zone's hazard is based on past major earthquakes, causing confusion for scientists. The earthquake in Haiti caused more damage and fatalities compared to the earthquake in Chile, which was deeper and farther offshore. Japan's earthquake in 2011 was even larger and more destructive, with a significant portion of the damage caused by a tsunami. Chile and Japan had better infrastructure to withstand earthquakes due to their history of seismic activity, unlike Haiti which had not experienced a large earthquake since 1860. Haiti's vulnerability to earthquake shaking exceeded Chile's and Japan's due to seismic hazard and lack of infrastructure. Despite Japan's 2011 earthquake being 100 times larger, Haiti faced greater risk of fatalities from the 2010 earthquake. The earthquake in Haiti occurred along the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault system, a major strike-slip fault system between the Caribbean and North American tectonic plates. It caused widespread damage in the region. The January 12, 2010 earthquake in Haiti caused extensive damage in the Port-au-Prince area, resulting in approximately 223,000 deaths and 300,000 injuries. A series of aftershocks followed the main earthquake, with some reaching magnitudes greater than 5. The USGS warned that buildings in the area remain at risk of strong earthquake shaking, as the fault responsible for the earthquake still holds enough strain to potentially cause another damaging event. The USGS estimated earthquake probabilities in the United States, with a 5-15% chance of a magnitude 7 or greater quake near Port-au-Prince and a 15% chance along the Hayward-Rodgers Creek fault. A magnitude 8.8 earthquake hit Chile in 2010 at a depth of 22 miles, deeper than the Haiti quake. The earthquake in Haiti on January 12, 2010, caused $30 billion in economic damage, over 500 deaths, and affected 1.8 million people. It also generated a tsunami that hit parts of the Chilean coastline, causing additional damage and fatalities. Tsunami warnings were issued for Hawaii, Japan, and other Pacific Ocean regions. The 1960 tsunami caused significant damage in Hilo, Hawaii, Japan, and the Philippines, while the 2010 earthquake did not. The magnitude 8.8 earthquake occurred along the Nazca and South American tectonic plates, which converge at a rate of 3 inches per year. A 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck off Japan's northeast coast near Honshu on March 11, 2011, triggering a tsunami that caused widespread devastation to coastal regions. The epicenter was located about 80 miles east of Sendai and 230 miles northeast of Tokyo, occurring at a depth of approximately 20 miles beneath the seafloor. The 9.0 magnitude earthquake near Honshu on March 11, 2011, occurred at a depth of approximately 20 miles beneath the seafloor. It resulted from thrust faulting along the subduction zone plate boundary between the Pacific and North America plates, similar to the motion described for the 2010 Chile earthquake. The convergence zone between the plates creates the Japan Trench, triggering multiple large earthquakes since 1973. The Cascadia Subduction Zone megathrust fault has a history of large offshore earthquakes, with records dating back to 1611, 1896, and 1933. The 1896 earthquake generated tsunami waves over 100 feet high, resulting in a death toll of 27,000. This fault, stretching from mid-Vancouver Island to northern California, has the potential to produce a very large earthquake similar to those in Chile in 2010 and Japan in 2011. The fault's proximity to the northwestern U.S. coastline poses a significant tsunami hazard, with destructive waves reaching Oregon and Washington in less than an hour. The Cascadia Subduction Zone fault could trigger a megathrust earthquake near magnitude 9, similar to past devastating earthquakes. The last major event occurred in 1700, generating a tsunami that reached Japan. The fault's history includes large offshore earthquakes dating back to 1611, with the potential to produce destructive waves along the coast of Oregon and Washington in a short amount of time. The 1700 Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake generated a tsunami that reached Japan. Scientists study seismic hazard in the Pacific Northwest by analyzing ground motion recordings from the 2010 Chilean and 2011 Japan earthquakes. The USGS monitors seismic activity in the US through the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) and Global Seismic Network (GSN) with over 140 stations worldwide. The Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) aims to provide accurate data for seismic events, with over 7,000 earthquake sensor systems covering vulnerable areas. The system includes dense urban networks, regional networks, and backbone stations, with 6,000 stations planned for high-risk urban areas. Currently, five high-risk urban areas have instruments deployed to generate real-time ShakeMaps for emergency response during earthquakes. The Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) consists of approximately 100 instruments forming the backbone network, providing broad coverage across the United States. The USGS operates the National Strong Motion Program (NSMP) with around 1,280 strong-motion instruments for recording seismic data from damaging earthquakes in urban areas. The NSMP includes data acquisition, data management, and research components, with near real-time measurements used for emergency response. The ANSS program aims to deploy 3,000 strong-motion instruments, replacing older designs with modern seismometers. If fully implemented, 1,000 new instruments would replace aging stations in seismically active regions. Regional networks currently consist of a mix of modern and older instruments, with universities typically operating them. The Global Seismographic Network (GSN) is a system of broadband digital seismographs around the globe, with 140 stations in 80 countries. It provides data for earthquake reporting, research, and monitoring nuclear explosions. The Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) coordinates and manages the large amounts of data generated from the network. The Global Seismographic Network (GSN) consists of 140 stations in 80 countries, managed by the USGS and University of California-San Diego. IRIS supports stations not funded by USGS, with funding from NSF. USGS and NSF provide annual appropriations for GSN, with additional funding from ARRA to replace obsolete equipment. Unlike hurricanes, predicting earthquakes remains a scientific challenge. The timing of earthquake landfall is becoming more accurate, but precise prediction is still not possible. Instead, notification and warning involve communicating the location and magnitude of earthquakes to emergency response providers. Probabilistic earthquake forecasts, like those for California, provide a 24-hour probability of aftershocks to increase public awareness and improve emergency response. These forecasts are not predictions but aim to enhance scientific understanding of seismic hazards. The NEIC, part of the USGS, provides rapid earthquake location and magnitude reports. ShakeMap products are quickly assembled for emergency response and damage estimation. Other organizations may also contribute earthquake information post-event. The NEIC, established in 1966 as part of the National Ocean Survey and later incorporated into the USGS in 1973, determines the location and size of destructive earthquakes worldwide. It disseminates this information to various agencies, media, scientists, and the public. Through the USGS Earthquake Notification Service, notifications of earthquakes detected by the NEIC are provided to interested parties for free, allowing users to customize their notification preferences. The NEIC has agreements with emergency response groups and authorities to send automated alerts for earthquakes in the United States. Alerts include location and magnitude, sent by email and pager within minutes of an event. Staff confirm and update data before triggering notifications to key recipients via email, pager, fax, and telephone. For earthquakes outside the U.S., alerts are sent to the State Department and American embassies. The USGS sends alerts to various organizations and embassies following destructive earthquakes, providing information on ground motion and shaking intensity through ShakeMap. This tool helps in assessing damage and guiding emergency response efforts. ShakeMaps are available for various regions like northern California, southern California, the Pacific Northwest, Nevada, Utah, Hawaii, and Alaska. They are now triggered automatically and made available within minutes of an earthquake via the web. Improved understanding of ground motions and damage intensity has led to better maps. ShakeMaps can combine building inventories with shaking intensity data to estimate damage. Limitations exist, especially in the first few minutes after an earthquake. The USGS produces preliminary earthquake maps that are automatically generated and may not have been reviewed by experts initially. These maps are considered a work in progress but are improving with modern seismic instruments and technology. The PAGER system provides real-time earthquake information to emergency responders and government agencies, assessing the impact of earthquakes within 30 minutes. The PAGER system calculates ground shaking intensity, estimates population exposure, and assesses vulnerability after determining earthquake location and magnitude. It provides rapid reports for emergency planning, especially in cases where traditional communication networks are disabled. FEMA developed HAZUS-MH software to estimate losses from earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods before disasters occur. The program combines scientific knowledge, engineering data, and GIS software to produce maps displaying hazards data and economic loss estimates. Loss estimates include physical damage to buildings, schools, and critical facilities. HAZUS-MH software provides estimates of physical damage, economic loss, and social impacts from disasters like earthquakes. It supports emergency response efforts and is used by various user groups across the United States. USGS conducts research to improve understanding of earthquake processes under NEHRP. The USGS earthquake research program covers six categories: Borehole geophysics, rock mechanics, crustal deformation, earthquake geology, earthquake hazards, and regional structure analysis. NSF supports research on understanding the earth's dynamic crust through its Earth Sciences Division. In 2003, NSF initiated the EarthScope project in partnership with USGS and NASA to study the structure and evolution of the North American Continent and investigate the physical processes causing earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. EarthScope project, in partnership with USGS and NASA, aims to study the four-dimensional structure of North America. It consists of three main programs: SAFOD, PBO, and USArray. SAFOD is a deep borehole observatory on the San Andreas fault, PBO measures the boundary between tectonic plates, and USArray deploys seismometers across the US for continuous seismic measurements. SAFOD and PBO are operational, while USArray is still in progress. The USArray project is progressing across North America, providing real-time seismic data to seismologists. The portable array has covered most of the conterminous United States, with remaining stations to be installed in New England, upstate New York, and southern Quebec by the end of 2013. The NEES project, funded by NSF, aims to understand the effects of earthquakes on structures and materials through experiments and computer simulations. Over 160 multiyear projects have been completed or are in progress under NEES since 2004. Since 2004, 160 multiyear projects have been completed or are in progress under NEES. The effectiveness of earthquake mitigation strategies and research activities may become clearer with advancements in seismic hazard mapping, understanding of ground motion and building safety, and the development of tools like ShakeMap and PAGER. Congress may continue to face challenges in determining the most effective federal approach to increasing the nation's resilience to major earthquakes."
