    "content": "The U.S. cosmetic industry has around 13,000 establishments with $10 billion in annual revenue. Globally, the cosmetics industry has over $250 billion in retail sales. The market includes various personal care products beyond facial makeup, with sales concentrated in cosmetics, face cream, and perfume (75%), hygienic products (20%), and small appliances (4%). The typical consumer is a woman aged 25 to 55, but there is a growing focus on marketing to men and tweens. There is a growing focus on marketing to men and tweens in the cosmetic industry. Sales of basic personal items like soap and shampoo are less impacted by economic conditions. The FDA regulates $62 billion worth of cosmetics to ensure they are not adulterated or misbranded. The report focuses on FDA regulation of cosmetics, discussing the differentiation between cosmetics and drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Manufacturers are concerned about product classification as cosmetics do not have the same approval requirements as drugs, saving time and expense. The term \"cosmetics\" covers a broad range of FDA-regulated products that may be used externally, orificially, and internally, including products for the eyes, face, nails, hair, skin, and mouth. This distinction allows manufacturers of cosmetics to market their products with less regulatory oversight compared to drugs. The FFDCA defines cosmetics as products for cleansing, beautifying, or altering appearance, excluding soap. Coal tar hair dye has a limited exemption. Drugs are for disease treatment or affecting body functions. Unlike cosmetics, drugs have stricter regulations. Unlike cosmetics, drugs are subject to FDA approval before entering interstate commerce. They must receive premarket approval or conform to FDA regulations known as monographs. Monographs govern the manufacture and marketing of over-the-counter drugs, specifying conditions for safety and effectiveness. Labeling requirements include a Drug Facts panel with active ingredients, purposes, uses, warnings, directions, and contact information. Drug manufacturers must comply with good manufacturing practices (GMP) rules for drugs, register their facilities, list their drug products with the FDA, and report adverse events. Combination cosmetic-drug products must meet both OTC drug and cosmetic labeling requirements. There is no FDA definition for \"cosmetic drugs\" or \"cosmeceuticals.\" The determination of whether a cosmetic is also a drug is based on the distributor's intent or the intended use. If a cosmetic contains ingredients with known therapeutic use, it will be regulated as a drug. For example, a lipstick containing sunscreen will be considered a drug. The FFDCA regulates cosmetics as drugs based on their intended use. Cosmetics can be considered adulterated or misbranded if they contain harmful substances or have misleading labeling. Before the FFDCA, cosmetics were regulated by state laws. The FFDCA established regulations for cosmetics to prevent the sale of adulterated or misbranded products in interstate commerce. Cosmetics are also regulated under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) for packaging and labeling of consumer commodities. The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) regulates the sale of consumer commodities through retail sales agencies for personal use. The FFDCA addresses cosmetics regulations, with exceptions for color additives, which have remained largely unchanged since 1938 despite the industry's evolution. Consumer and industry groups have similar concerns to those prior to the FFDCA enactment. If a cosmetic is found to be adulterated or misbranded, FDA can take enforcement actions, including seeking injunctions, seizing products, or imposing criminal penalties. FDA also has the authority to prevent imports of violative cosmetic products. Inspections of cosmetic establishments can be conducted without prior notice. FDA conducts inspections of cosmetic facilities to ensure product safety and compliance with regulations. Inspections can be triggered by consumer complaints, compliance history, or surveillance initiatives. The agency may collect samples for analysis and follow up on adverse event reports. There is no set schedule for inspections, and manufacturers can voluntarily comply with FDA regulations for cosmetics. The FDA regulates cosmetic products, with voluntary registration and reporting requirements for ingredients and adverse reactions. Unlike other product manufacturers, cosmetic manufacturers do not have to file data on ingredients or report injuries to the FDA. They can voluntarily report ingredients and adverse reactions. The FDA does not have mandatory recall authority for cosmetics but can request a voluntary recall. The FDA regulates cosmetic products with voluntary recalls outlining expectations for manufacturers. FDA can take action against adulterated or misbranded cosmetics but lacks comprehensive authority compared to other regulated products. Cosmetic producers are not required to use GMP unless their products are also drugs. FDA does not require premarket notification, safety testing, or approval for cosmetic chemicals. Cosmetic products do not have to meet FDA safety requirements like drugs. The FDA regulates cosmetic products with voluntary recalls and can take action against adulterated or misbranded cosmetics. Unlike drugs, cosmetic products do not need to meet FDA safety and effectiveness requirements. Adulterated cosmetics may be subject to FDA enforcement actions if they contain harmful substances or were prepared under unsanitary conditions. The FDA regulates cosmetic products to prevent them from being adulterated or misbranded. Adulterated cosmetics may contain harmful substances or be prepared under unsanitary conditions, making them unsafe for use. Compliance with FDA regulations is necessary to ensure the safety of cosmetic products for consumers. Under the FFDCA, cosmetics can be considered misbranded if labeling is false or misleading, lacks required information, is not prominently placed, or if the container is misleading. Consumer commodity cosmetic products subject to the FPLA must have a label with product identity, manufacturer information, and net quantity. The FFDCA and FPLA regulations require cosmetics to have accurate labeling with manufacturer information, net quantity, and ingredient listing in descending order of predominance. Citizen petitions can be submitted to FDA to determine if a cosmetic is adulterated, and FDA may take enforcement actions if a product is found to be misbranded or adulterated. If a cosmetic is deemed adulterated or misbranded, the FDA may take enforcement actions such as seeking an injunction, seizing the product, or pursuing criminal penalties. While the FDA cannot mandate a recall for cosmetics, manufacturers may voluntarily recall products that are hazardous, defective, or deceptive. The FDA has authority to order recalls for food, infant formula, medical devices, human tissue products, and tobacco products. The FDA can take enforcement actions against hazardous, defective, or deceptive cosmetics, including seeking injunctions or seizing products. While the FDA cannot mandate recalls for cosmetics, manufacturers may voluntarily recall products. The FDA has the authority to order recalls for various products like food, medical devices, and tobacco. If a manufacturer or distributor refuses to remove dangerous products, the FDA may issue a recall request and monitor the recall process to ensure effectiveness. The FDA does not have the authority to require premarket approval of cosmetics or their ingredients, except for color additives. Manufacturers are responsible for proving the safety of their products before marketing them, and failure to do so can result in the product being considered misbranded. The warning label stating \"The safety of this product has not been determined\" is rarely used, leading consumers to believe that cosmetics are safe. The Government Accountability Office has noted that FDA's regulation requiring warning labels is not effectively enforced. The FDA's regulation requiring warning labels on cosmetics is not effectively enforced due to a lack of authority to require safety testing by manufacturers. However, the FDA has restricted certain ingredients and issued rules banning substances like methylene chloride due to potential health risks. If a cosmetic contains banned substances, it would be considered adulterated, and the FDA could take enforcement action. The FDA allows ingredients in cosmetics as long as they are proven safe, properly labeled, and do not violate regulations. Cosmetic firms are advised to conduct testing to ensure product safety, but the testing methods are not specified by the FFDCA. Manufacturers are responsible for proving the safety of both ingredients and finished products before marketing, traditionally using animal testing for safety evaluation. The FDA allows ingredients in cosmetics if they are proven safe and properly labeled. Cosmetic firms are advised to conduct testing for product safety, traditionally using animal testing. Animal rights advocates seek to end animal testing, while the FDA follows laws like the Animal Welfare Act and supports alternatives to whole-animal testing. The FDA advocates for the humane care and use of laboratory animals in research and testing, promoting the use of alternative methods to whole-animal testing when possible. They support the development of alternatives to animal testing and strive to reduce, refine, and replace animal tests with more humane methodologies. The Personal Care Products Council (PCPC) established a Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) program to review the safety of cosmetic product ingredients without animal testing. The program aims to determine the safety of ingredients under their conditions of use through expert panel reviews based on a priority list of ingredients used in commercially available cosmetics. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) program evaluates the safety of cosmetic ingredients without animal testing. Panelists assess ingredients for safety, determining if they are safe for use, unsafe, safe with conditions, or lacking sufficient data. CIR has found 1,398 ingredients safe, 987 safe with qualifications, 43 with insufficient data, and 11 unsafe. The Research Institute for Fragrance Materials (RIFM) also reviews fragrance ingredient safety for cosmetic use. The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics was formed in 2004 due to concerns about the safety of cosmetics. They are worried about the potential health effects of certain chemicals like nitrosamines, lead, parabens, and phthalates. The Campaign asked cosmetic companies to sign a pledge for safe cosmetics, which included disclosing all ingredients and ensuring product safety with publicly available data. Over 1,500 companies have signed the pledge. More than 1,500 companies have signed a pledge to remove hazardous chemicals from cosmetic products and replace them with safe alternatives within three years. The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics issues reports on contaminants in children's bath and personal care products, while the Environmental Working Group maintains a database of cosmetic ingredients and safety information. Concerns have been raised about ingredient accuracy, safety warnings on product labels, and the use of coal tar hair dyes and nanomaterial ingredients. The FDA regulates color additives in cosmetics differently than other ingredients, requiring them to be listed in a regulation before use. Failure to comply with FDA regulations for color additives can result in a cosmetic product being considered adulterated. Some color additives must be certified by the FDA before use, and failure to do so can also lead to a product being deemed adulterated. Color additives used in cosmetics must be approved as safe-for-use and comply with FDA regulations. Some additives are subject to certification, while others are exempt. Regardless, all additives must meet specific requirements outlined by the FDA to ensure safety and prevent adulteration of cosmetic products. The FDA regulates the use of color additives in cosmetics, specifying composition, impurity limits, and usage restrictions. Certain colors are prohibited in lip products, and there are specific regulations for glow-in-the-dark, fluorescent, and liquid crystal color additives. Restrictions also apply to color additives used in the eye area, injections, and surgical sutures. Coal tar dyes, a controversial group of color additives, are synthetic-organic colors made from petroleum. They are used in hair dyes and are either listed and certified or not approved. The FDA, GAO, policymakers, and consumer groups have raised concerns about the potential health risks of coal tar dyes. FDA has unsuccessfully argued for the repeal of the exemption for coal tar hair dyes. The GAO recommended that FDA evaluate safety data on coal tar hair dye ingredients and require cancer warning statements on product labels. FDA found that some coal-tar hair dye ingredients can cause cancer in animals. Coal tar dyes are excluded from use in eyelash or eyebrow products. Coal tar hair dyes must contain a warning statement about potential risks to avoid adulteration. The cosmetic industry has been using nanotechnology in products for over two decades, with nanomaterials being used as UV filters and for delivery purposes. There is debate over the safety of nanomaterials in cosmetics, with concerns about potential skin irritation and blindness if used on eyelashes or eyebrows. The global market for cosmetics using nanotechnology was projected to reach $155.8 million in 2010. Nanomaterials are used in cosmetic products as UV filters and delivery systems. The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies maintains a database of consumer products, including cosmetics, containing nanomaterials. Concerns exist about potential health effects of these particles, such as skin damage or entering the bloodstream. Nanomaterials in cosmetic products raise concerns about potential health effects, including skin penetration, toxin release, and long-term exposure. Consumer groups have petitioned the FDA for regulation of products containing nanomaterials. FDA created a Nanotechnology Task Force in 2006 to determine regulatory approaches for safe development of innovative products. The FDA and Nanotechnology Task Force are working to regulate products with nanomaterials, but have not adopted a specific definition of nanotechnology. FDA believes current safety tests are sufficient for most nanotechnology products and has not required labeling for products with nanomaterials due to lack of evidence showing increased safety concerns. The FDA has not mandated specific labeling for products containing nanomaterials but recommends addressing the need for labeling on a case-by-case basis. The Nanotechnology Task Force suggested building expertise within the agency and collaborating with other entities to enhance scientific understanding and data assessment for regulated products. FDA issued draft guidance for industry on nanotechnology in 2011. The FDA issued draft guidance in 2011 on considering the implications of using nanomaterials in FDA-regulated products, including cosmetics. The guidance aims to help industry identify potential regulatory and safety considerations related to nanotechnology. The agency emphasizes the need to evaluate the unique properties of nanomaterials for safety, effectiveness, and public health impact. The FDA issued draft guidance on the safety of nanomaterials in cosmetic products in 2012, highlighting the need to assess the unique properties of nanomaterials and their impact on safety, effectiveness, and public health. Nanomaterials may alter the bioavailability of cosmetic formulations, requiring considerations for toxicology testing. The inclusion of nanomaterials in FDA-regulated products could affect quality and safety, prompting manufacturers to discuss test methods and data with the FDA. The FDA collaborates with the cosmetic industry through the Voluntary Cosmetic Registration Program (VCRP) to facilitate registration of cosmetic establishments, which helps determine inspection priorities and ingredient safety reviews. Under the Voluntary Cosmetic Registration Program (VCRP), FDA encourages cosmetic establishments to register their facilities within 30 days of starting operations, regardless of interstate commerce. Foreign manufacturers exporting to the US should also register. Certain establishments are exempt from registration, including beauty shops, retailers, and pharmacies. FDA does not charge a fee for registration. The FDA's Voluntary Cosmetic Registration Program (VCRP) encourages cosmetic establishments to register their facilities within 30 days of starting operations, including foreign manufacturers exporting to the US. Certain establishments like beauty shops and retailers are exempt from registration. Consumer safety organizations support including \"for professional use only\" products in the VCRP, but FDA disagrees, stating it does not apply to products not in commercial distribution. The FDA disagreed with the consumer group's proposal to determine participation rates in the VCRP and estimate ingredient submissions, citing lack of statutory authority and cost concerns. They also disagreed with creating a certification program for cosmetic companies to indicate VCRP participation, citing the need for consumer research and enforcement considerations. The FDA advises consumers to report adverse events related to cosmetic products through MedWatch or their local FDA complaint coordinator. Consumers are encouraged to report reactions like rashes, hair loss, infections, bad smells, or unusual colors, even if they didn't follow product directions. The agency uses these reports to detect product issues and may take enforcement actions. Reported adverse events include reactions to henna/mehndi and certain tattoo ink shades. The FDA has received reports of adverse reactions to henna/mehndi, tattoo ink shades, and keratin hair treatment products. Temporary tattoos and certain ink shades used for permanent makeup have been associated with allergic reactions. Some hair treatment products labeled as \"formaldehyde-free\" may still release formaldehyde when used. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulates workers' exposure to these products. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and state agencies have issued hazard alerts about formaldehyde exposure in hair salons. The cosmetic industry has self-regulated with a Consumer Commitment Code, encouraging reporting of serious adverse events to the FDA. The Cosmetic industry has a Consumer Commitment Code that encourages reporting serious adverse events to the FDA. Consumers may choose cosmetics based on specific labeling, like organic ingredients or not tested on animals. FDA does not define terms used by manufacturers on cosmetic products, leading to differences in marketing claims. Not all cosmetic products are labeled the same way, especially those used by professionals. Terms like \"natural\" and \"organic\" may not have standardized definitions. The FDA does not regulate the use of the terms \"natural\" and \"organic\" on cosmetic products, leading to consumer confusion. The USDA regulates \"organic\" claims on cosmetics. Consumers may have different expectations for products labeled as \"natural\" or \"organic,\" with some believing they have health benefits. FDA notes that many plants, regardless of being organically grown, may contain toxic substances. The FDA does not regulate the use of the terms \"natural\" and \"organic\" on cosmetic products. The USDA oversees \"organic\" claims on cosmetics. Some natural ingredients may cause adverse reactions, and 'natural' ingredients may be harder to preserve against microbial contamination than synthetic raw materials. Cosmetic products meeting USDA's National Organic Program regulations can be certified as \"organic.\" The USDA regulates the use of the \"organic\" label on products containing agricultural ingredients. The label does not indicate safety, as the National Organic Program is a marketing program. There are four organic labeling categories based on the percentage of organic ingredients used in the product. The USDA regulates organic labeling on products with agricultural ingredients, but some personal care products may not use the USDA organic seal even if ingredients are certified organic. The Certification, Accreditation, and Compliance Committee of the National Organics Standards Board highlighted issues with mislabeled organic personal care products in 2009, noting that the USDA is not enforcing organic claims in this area. Consumers may not be assured of consistent review and application of organic claims on personal care items. The Certification, Accreditation, and Compliance Committee of the National Organic Standards Board recommended amending regulations to clarify the use of \"organic\" in personal care products and restrict the USDA Organic Seal. Other entities like NSF International and ANSI have created their own standards for organic personal care products. The NSF/ANSI 305-2009e standard allows labeling claims of \"contains organic ingredients\" for personal care products with 70% or higher organic content. Manufacturers must list the exact percent of organic content and comply with certification requirements. The standard applies to various personal care products and allows limited chemical processes not permitted under USDA NOP regulations. According to NSF International, compliance with the NSF/ANSI 305-2009e standard may provide a competitive advantage to certified products containing organic ingredients. Cosmetic products may claim to have no animal testing, but manufacturers may still rely on suppliers or contract laboratories for testing. This can be confusing for consumers trying to differentiate between products that have never been tested on animals and those that may use animal testing at some point. Some companies promote their products as not tested on animals. Some companies promote their products as not tested on animals, using terms like \"cruelty free\" or \"no animal ingredients.\" Animal rights groups offer certification for companies to use their logo on products. Certain information not required in cosmetic labeling may be of interest to consumers and professionals. The FDA requires cosmetic products for retail sale to list their ingredients, but \"for professional use only\" products used in salons are exempt. However, if a \"for professional use only\" product is sold at retail, the ingredients must be listed to avoid being considered misbranded. Ingredients in these products are not included in the Voluntary Cosmetic Registration Program (VCRP). Ingredients in \"for professional use only\" cosmetic products are not part of the VCRP. The FDA does not specify which products fall under this category. Manufacturers may restrict distribution to salons, but some distributors have sold these products to retail stores, potentially violating agreements and misbranding laws. FDA's regulations for cosmetic products are less comprehensive compared to other FDA-regulated products, leading to uncertainty in regulation. The FDA has regulations for cosmetics, but oversight of ingredients is questioned. Keratin hair treatments, like \"Brazilian Blowouts,\" smooth and straighten hair, costing hundreds of dollars and lasting up to six months. Keratin hair treatments can cost several hundred dollars and last from six weeks to several months. Many products contain formaldehyde or other chemicals that can convert into formaldehyde gas, altering protein structures in the hair to maintain straightness. Concerns have been raised about the accuracy of ingredient statements and safety warnings on product labels. The safety warnings on product labels for keratin hair treatment products containing formaldehyde are inadequate. Despite being labeled \"formaldehyde-free,\" investigations have shown that these products may still contain unsafe levels of the chemical. FDA regulates cosmetic products with formaldehyde, while OSHA oversees worker safety. Congressional members have urged FDA to take enforcement actions against these products. The FDA has issued a warning letter regarding Brazilian Blowout products violating safety standards. OSHA has found that air quality tests exceeded acceptable limits. EPA states that formaldehyde exposure can cause eye and throat irritation. Formaldehyde exposure can cause various health effects including eye, nose, and throat irritation, wheezing, coughing, fatigue, skin rash, and severe allergic reactions. It has been linked to cancer in animals and may also cause cancer in humans. The ATSDR warns that exposure to formaldehyde can lead to neurological effects, increased risk of asthma and allergies, eczema, changes in lung function, decreased body weight, gastrointestinal ulcers, and liver and kidney damage. Formaldehyde exposure at 50\u2013100 mg/kg/day can lead to decreased body weight, gastrointestinal ulcers, and liver and kidney damage in animals. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reclassified formaldehyde as a known human carcinogen in 2011 based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. This classification means that some individuals exposed to formaldehyde at sufficient levels may develop cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified formaldehyde as a carcinogen in 2006. OSHA regulates workers' exposure to formaldehyde in various industries, with rules on exposure limits, protective equipment, and cancer warning labels for products containing formaldehyde. Short-term exposure to formaldehyde can be fatal, while long-term exposure may cause respiratory difficulty, eczema, and sensitization. OSHA's formaldehyde standard sets a permissible exposure limit of 0.75 ppm for formaldehyde in the workplace, with short-term limits and triggers for increased monitoring. An airborne concentration above 0.1 ppm can cause respiratory tract irritation. Employers must monitor employee exposure and communicate health hazards. Employers must ensure products with formaldehyde levels above 0.1 ppm have hazard warning labels. Products with levels above 0.5 ppm must include \"Potential Cancer Hazard\" on labels. Manufacturers must provide safety data sheets for formaldehyde-containing products. Brazilian Blowout products now have Material Safety Data Sheets available. The Brazilian Blowout products now contain a Material Safety Data Sheet for Brazilian Blowout Acai Professional Smoothing Solution, classified as hazardous. Hair salon stylists in Oregon reported adverse effects after using a \"formaldehyde-free\" product, leading to an investigation revealing significant formaldehyde levels in hair smoothing treatments. Oregon's Occupational Safety and Health Division issued alerts about the formaldehyde levels. The Health Division issued alerts to hair stylists regarding high formaldehyde levels in hair smoothing products, despite being labeled \"formaldehyde-free.\" Adverse effects reported included eye and throat irritation, breathing problems, hair loss, and more. FDA also received reports of similar issues. The FDA and Health Canada received reports of adverse reactions to hair products containing formaldehyde, including eye irritation, breathing problems, headaches, fainting, bronchitis, and vomiting. NIOSH conducted an investigation in 2010 on a hair smoothing solution with high formaldehyde levels, leading to various health issues reported by hair stylists and customers. The concentration of formaldehyde in hair smoothing products exceeded OSHA limits, leading to health hazards for salon workers. OSHA issued citations and a Hazard Alert to salons regarding the dangers of using these products. In 2011, OSHA disagreed with Brazilian Blowout CEO's claims of air quality tests meeting standards, leading to corrective actions. Health Canada also identified high formaldehyde levels in hair smoothing products. Hair smoothing products with formaldehyde levels above 0.2% are banned in Canada and have been warned against in France and Germany. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel recommends a 0.2% limit for formaldehyde in products. The safety of formaldehyde and methylene glycol in cosmetic products has been re-evaluated by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) program analyzes the safety of ingredients in cosmetic products. In a final report, CIR stated that formaldehyde is an irritant at low concentrations and can cause sensitization reactions. The expert panel also expressed concerns about formaldehyde exposure in salons and its potential link to nasopharyngeal cancers. Ventilation controls in salons were found to be ineffective in reducing formaldehyde levels. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) panel found that hair smoothing products containing formaldehyde and methylene glycol are unsafe due to inadequate ventilation. However, they stated that formaldehyde and methylene glycol can be safe in cosmetics if formulated correctly, with formaldehyde concentration not exceeding 0.2%. Some members of Congress and industry experts have urged the FDA to take action on this issue. The FDA has been urged by members of Congress and industry experts to take action on keratin hair treatment products. FDA does not have authority to regulate salons or cosmetology practices, nor does it ban formaldehyde in cosmetic products. The safety of formaldehyde as a cosmetic ingredient depends on its concentration and how it is used. FDA could potentially issue a rule restricting the use of formaldehyde in cosmetic products. The FDA may issue a rule prohibiting formaldehyde in cosmetic products if deemed poisonous or deleterious, making the product adulterated under the FFDCA. Introducing an adulterated product into interstate commerce is a prohibited act with potential criminal penalties. While FDA does not mandate warning labels on products containing formaldehyde, they have the authority to require them if necessary to prevent health hazards. The FDA may take enforcement actions against cosmetic products with misleading labels, such as those that claim to be \"formaldehyde-free\" but actually contain formaldehyde. In August 2011, FDA issued a warning letter to the CEO of Brazilian Blowout for selling adulterated and misbranded products under the FFDCA. The FDA warned a CEO about misleading labeling on a product containing formaldehyde, stating it was misbranded. Corrective actions were advised to avoid potential enforcement actions, including seizures and injunctions. The Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general could also take action for deceptive advertising. The California Attorney General's office filed a lawsuit against a company for labeling violations, resulting in a settlement requiring various corrective actions. This included adding a \"CAUTION\" warning on products, producing a Material Safety Data Sheet, ending deceptive advertising, retesting products, reporting to the California Department of Public Health, disclosing refund policies, and more. The FDA does not have authority to require premarket approval for cosmetic products, except for color additives. The FDA cannot mandate recalls for cosmetic products that violate regulations, but can request voluntary recalls. They also cannot require adverse event reports for consumer interactions with products, but encourage reporting. Professional use cosmetic products like Brazilian Blowout are not required to list ingredients if not for retail sale under the FPLA. The FDA does not have the authority to mandate recalls for cosmetic products that violate regulations but can request voluntary recalls. Professional use cosmetic products like Brazilian Blowout are not required to list ingredients if not for retail sale under the FPLA. However, if a cosmetic product labeled \"for professional use only\" is sold at retail, the ingredients must be listed to avoid being considered misbranded. FDA is investigating whether Brazilian Blowout is marketed directly to consumers, and failure to comply with ingredient declaration would constitute misbranding."
