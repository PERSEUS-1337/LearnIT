    "content": "The Federal Renewable Portfolio Standard requires electric utilities to obtain a percentage of electricity from new or existing renewable sources, with a minimum specified amount each calendar year. The Federal Renewable Portfolio Standard mandates electric utilities to acquire a percentage of electricity from renewable sources annually, with minimum percentages increasing each year from 2010 to 2025. Electric utilities must comply with the Federal Renewable Portfolio Standard by submitting renewable energy credits, making alternative compliance payments, or a combination of both. The Secretary will establish a renewable energy credit trading program for utilities to certify their compliance. The Secretary will issue renewable energy credits to generators of electric energy from new and existing renewable sources, as well as to electric utilities for compliance with State renewable portfolio standards. Each kilowatt hour and its associated credit can only be used once for compliance with the Act. The Act allows for double credits for generation from facilities on Indian land and triple credits for generation from small renewable distributed generators. The credits can only be used for compliance within a 3-year period. The Act allows for double credits for generation from facilities on Indian land and triple credits for generation from small renewable distributed generators. Credits can be transferred between electric utilities within the same utility holding company system. The Secretary may delegate the administration of a national tradeable renewable energy credit market. Electric utilities failing to meet compliance requirements may face civil penalties. The civil penalty for violating subsection (a) is determined by multiplying the kilowatt-hours sold by 2 cents or 200% of the average market value of renewable energy credits. The Secretary can mitigate or waive penalties if the utility couldn't comply due to reasons beyond their control. Penalties can be reduced by amounts paid to a State for non-compliance. The Secretary can assess civil penalties for failure to comply with State renewable energy requirements, following procedures from the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. A State renewable energy account program must be established by the Secretary by December 31, 2008, with funds from alternative compliance payments and penalties being deposited into the account. The State renewable energy account, held by the Secretary, is used for grants to promote renewable energy production and technologies that reduce electricity use. The Secretary can issue guidelines for grants awarded under this program. The Secretary will issue rules for grants awarded under the State renewable energy account, with preferences given to certain states and programs promoting innovative renewable energy technologies. Electric utilities selling less than 4,000,000 megawatt-hours are exempt from this section. The Secretary will adjust the price of renewable energy credits and civil penalties for inflation annually starting in 2008. State laws on renewable energy are not overridden by this section, but individuals must still comply with the requirements outlined. The Secretary will work with States to coordinate Federal and State renewable energy programs. Regulations will be established to ensure electric utilities receive renewable energy credits for compliance with State standards. The regulations will ensure that electric utilities or customers pay for renewable energy generation or purchase through certificates or credits. Double counting of renewable energy credits for compliance is prohibited. The Commission will enforce regulations for the recovery of costs related to renewable energy. The regulations aim to ensure electric utilities recover costs for complying with renewable energy requirements. A study on increasing transmission capacity for wind energy will be conducted. Definitions include terms like 'base amount of electricity'. The curr_chunk discusses definitions related to renewable energy, including distributed generation facilities and existing renewable energy sources like solar, wind, geothermal, ocean energy, biomass, and landfill gas. Geothermal energy is energy derived from a geothermal deposit, defined as incremental geothermal production which is the excess of electricity produced from a facility using geothermal energy over the average annual production for 5 of the previous 7 years. The term 'incremental hydropower' refers to additional energy generated from efficiency improvements or capacity additions made after January 1, 2001. Facilities meeting certain criteria will see a reduction in calculated amounts over a 7-year period, not exceeding 30 percent. The term 'new renewable energy' refers to electric energy generated at a facility placed in service on or after January 1, 2001, under a State renewable portfolio standard program. Operational changes not directly related to efficiency improvements or capacity additions are excluded. The water flow information used to determine historic generation baseline must be certified by the Secretary or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The term 'new renewable energy' includes electric energy generated from solar, wind, geothermal, ocean energy, biomass, landfill gas, or incremental hydropower for facilities placed in service after January 1, 2001. It also covers additional energy above the average generation in the 3 years before the enactment date for facilities in service prior to that date. The section defines 'ocean energy' as current, wave, tidal, and thermal energy. It also includes provisions for the expiration of the section on December 31, 2040. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is amended to include provisions related to ocean energy. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is amended to include provisions related to ocean energy, including a Federal renewable portfolio standard."
