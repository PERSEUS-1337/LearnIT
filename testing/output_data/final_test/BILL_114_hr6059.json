    "content": "The Act titled \"Transparency in Energy Production Act of 2016\" requires online publication of carbon emissions. The Secretary of the Interior must provide online information on fossil fuel production, resources on Federal lands, and energy production from solar, wind, and geothermal projects. The Secretary of the Interior must provide online information on energy production from solar, wind, and geothermal projects on Federal lands under lease for renewable energy production. The information must be presented in a format that includes greenhouse gas emissions estimates and allows for downloading in a machine-readable format without any charge. Data made available under this section must be updated at least annually. SEC. 3. ACCURATE MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING OF METHANE EMISSIONS FROM FEDERAL LANDS. The Secretary of the Interior must initiate a process to promulgate regulations requiring accurate measuring and reporting of methane gas produced on Federal land by holders of fossil fuel production leases. Rules will include reporting requirements for vented, flared, and fugitive gas releases. The Secretary of the Interior will require accurate measuring and reporting of methane gas produced on Federal land by fossil fuel production lease holders, including reporting on vented, flared, and fugitive gas releases. Every 2 years, the Secretary of the Interior must report to Congress on efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from operations on Federal lands and waters, as well as future plans for further reductions. The Act defines \"covered operations\" as all fossil fuel operations subject to mineral leasing laws or title V of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, including production, storage, gathering, processing, transportation, and handling. It also defines \"flaring\" as the intentional burning of gas in oil, gas, or coal operations, \"fossil fuel\" as natural fuels like oil, gas, natural gas liquids, and coal, and \"fugitive release\" as the unintentional release of gas into the atmosphere during these operations. The term \"Global Warming Potential-weighted emission\" refers to the ratio of radiative forcing from the release of a trace substance compared to carbon dioxide. \"Resources\" include oil, gas, and coal that are technically and economically recoverable. \"Venting\" is defined as the intentional release of gas into the atmosphere during fossil fuel operations. Venting is the intentional release of gas into the atmosphere during oil and gas operations. Produced and production refer to various activities related to extracting, mining, storing, and releasing gas during production."
