    "content": "This report summarizes recent analyses by the State Department, NCTC, and independent analysts on trends in terrorism. It identifies potential issues for Congress and defines trends as changes in terrorist attacks, attitudes of groups, and infrastructure capabilities. The curr_chunk discusses the capabilities and changes in expertise of terrorist groups, including their leadership strength, recruitment base, and ideological shifts towards causing widespread damage. Identifying trends in terrorist activity can help prioritize counter-terror resources, target terrorists to prevent attacks, and show progress in anti-terror efforts. Government responses and anti-terrorism strategies may also influence terrorism trends, leading to shifts in tactics and targets. Trends in terrorism may be influenced by various factors such as new delivery methods like IEDs and suicide bombers, changes in entry document evaluation at U.S. ports, responses from governments, media coverage, and U.S. policies affecting popular support and recruiting of terrorists. Some analysts question the ability to analyze trends in terrorism due to the diverse nature of individual terrorists and networks. Using past trends as predictors of future activity can be misleading, as a lack of violent conflict may indicate a shift in focus rather than a decrease in threat. Linear projections of trends may overlook qualitative changes in tactics, potentially missing new types of terror. Trends are typically identified by the executive branch and independent analysts. The challenge facing the counter-terrorism community is how to incorporate new data to identify and track terrorism trends while maintaining continuity of earlier data. Anticipating and preventing sinister trends with accurate intelligence is crucial for effective deterrence and preemption. Different perspectives can be presented based on the inclusion of data related to terrorism. The National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC) provides statistical data on global terrorism incidents, excluding Iraq, which shows a relatively stable number of higher casualty terror attacks. The Department of State's annual report on global terrorism for 2005 is based on NCTC data and offers a strategic assessment of terrorism trends. The 262-page report from the National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC) provides an annual strategic assessment of terrorism trends worldwide, focusing on state sponsors of terrorism, foreign terrorist organizations, individual countries' terrorist situations, potential acquisition of weapons of mass destruction, and U.S. anti-terrorism coalition building efforts. The report emphasizes building international capacity for counterterrorism and highlights the threat from radical Jihadists becoming more widespread, diffuse, and homegrown. The State Department report highlights the emergence of a global-homegrown terror movement, characterized as a \"glocal\" phenomenon. This trend is seen in various attacks such as those in Morocco, Madrid, London, and Ontario. The report also discusses the evolution of terrorism, including the rise of micro-actors. The report discusses the emergence of micro-actors in terrorism, influenced by the internet, militant preachers, and Arabic television. Al Qaeda's operational role has decreased, with small autonomous cells and individuals taking on more responsibility. These new actors are technologically savvy, decentralized, and difficult to track due to their lack of communication with other groups. The report highlights the increasing use of traditional bombs and bullets by micro-actors in future terrorist attacks. Terrorists are exploiting global information and financial networks, improving their technological sophistication in planning, communication, and propaganda. There is a growing overlap between terrorism and international crime, creating vulnerabilities for law enforcement. The report warns of a major vulnerability for law enforcement as terrorists engaging in non-terror criminal activities are more likely to be detected and prosecuted under general criminal and specific terror laws. Iraq's unrest is linked to global terrorism, with a significant number of terror incidents and deaths in 2005. Concerns arise about Iraq exporting terrorists, weapons, and tactics like IEDs to neighboring regions and Europe. The report highlights Iran as the most active state sponsor of terrorism, with Syria providing support to terrorist groups. Cuba and North Korea are noted for lack of anti-terror cooperation. Saudi Arabia is commended for capturing or killing wanted terrorists. The 2006 report praised Pakistan for capturing or killing terrorists and emphasized President Musharraf's efforts to combat extremism. However, some critics argue that the report downplays the role of countries like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in curbing terrorism. Libya and Sudan were also recognized for their cooperation in the global war on terror. The NCTC revised its methodology for reporting terrorism incidents in 2005, leading to more accurate and comprehensive data. Reported terror-related deaths in 2005 numbered 14,602, a significant increase from previous years. In 2005, there were 14,602 terror-related deaths, with 11,111 reported terrorist attacks. The majority of fatalities were from armed attacks and bombings. Approximately 40,000 people were killed or wounded, with a significant number being Muslim. Various groups, including police, children, government officials, clergy, teachers, and journalists, were targeted by terrorists. In 2005, there were numerous deaths and injuries from terrorist attacks. Independent analysis aligns with State Department trends, with additional trends including homegrown terrorism, decentralization of international jihad, radicalization through local networks, and online incitement of jihad. RAND Corporation's study highlights a focus on civilian targets, economic attacks, suicide attacks, desire for WMD attacks, and an increase in homegrown attacks. The trends in terrorism include a desire for WMD attacks but limited execution capability, an increase in homegrown attacks, and potential future attacks from far-right, anarchists, and radical environmentalists. Other trends noted are a decrease in the average age of terrorist recruits, more roles for women and non-Muslims, potential backlash attacks against globalization, coordinated attacks with follow-ups on first responders, and an overall rise in terrorist attacks by a diverse range of groups and individuals. The Department of State highlights trends in terrorism, including weak legal systems enabling terrorist networks, Internet communication facilitating terrorism, and potential spillover of skills from Iraq. Questions arise about the reliability of data from the NCTC for assessing terrorist activity trends. Some argue that fluctuations in terrorist incidents may not be critical in the long-term fight against terror. The Department of State report raises questions about the operational weakening of al Qaeda despite capturing key leaders. There is debate on whether al Qaeda's role has shifted to ideological inspiration and guidance due to its diminished command and control capabilities. Policymakers are warned against complacency even if data shows a decrease in terrorist incidents. Some believe al Qaeda is focusing on planning the next major attack rather than smaller operations. Operational involvement before the next major attack could jeopardize their plans. However, ongoing engagement is seen in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. Radical Islamist political parties are gaining influence globally. Some radical Islamist fundamentalist political parties worldwide may serve as fronts for terrorist activity or create a climate accepting terrorism as a tactic. Examples include groups in Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Somalia. The rise of terror-linked political parties, such as the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam faction led by Maulana Fazlur Rehman (JUI-F), poses a policy dilemma for the United States due to the conflict between supporting democracy and combating terrorism. Other examples include Hizballah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian Authority. The State Department report raises concerns about international anti-terrorism cooperation and the effectiveness of U.S. counter-terror policy. Critics argue that the report lacks a comprehensive analysis of trends in foreign nation support for U.S. anti-terror efforts. The State Department report highlights concerns about international cooperation in counter-terrorism efforts, particularly focusing on the potential breeding grounds for terrorist ideology in schools teaching radical Jihadism. The report also raises questions about the overlap of terrorist activity with international crime and the possibility of terrorist organizations evolving into criminal networks driven by profit rather than ideology. Terrorist groups may shift towards criminal activities for profit rather than ideology, as seen with FARC's evolution from protection to drug cultivation. Micro-terror actors are likely to focus on terrorism but turn to crime for funding. Department of State and experts predict this trend. The Department of State and non-government specialists highlight Jihadist-inspired terror groups seeking to inflict major damage with little moral constraints. While low-tech terror attacks are increasing, there is a dilemma on whether to focus resources on preventing these attacks or catastrophic mass-casualty events. The growing trend of unattributed terrorist attacks poses a challenge in identifying the true perpetrators and their motives. Terrorists may prioritize inflicting damage without specific goals or seeking publicity for their group. This could lead to increased recruitment and support for terrorism after successful attacks, regardless of publicly identifying themselves. The trend of unattributed terrorist attacks poses challenges in identifying perpetrators and their motives, making it difficult for law enforcement to target them effectively. Some refer to this as \"stealth terrorism,\" with examples including train wrecks, explosions, and virus outbreaks. Research suggests that in 2001, about 20% of attacks were unattributed. The trend of unattributed terrorist attacks is increasing, with a significant percentage of attacks in recent years not claimed by any terrorist organization. This trend challenges current anti-terror policies based on identifying perpetrators, indicating terrorists are becoming more indiscriminate in their targeting. The threat from small terrorist groups or lone terrorists is also on the rise. The trend of unattributed terrorist attacks is increasing, with a significant percentage of attacks in recent years not claimed by any terrorist organization. The threat from small terrorist groups or lone terrorists is rising in frequency, with the potential for these micro-actors to inflict deadly harm and economic damage. Concerns include near-simultaneous multiple attacks aimed at causing economic damage, such as attacks on transportation, tourism, and oil-related targets. The website claimed responsibility for a terrorist attack, and arrests in Saudi Arabia thwarted a second attack on a refinery. The United States may need to adjust its anti-terror strategy to focus more on international law enforcement. This approach could involve sharing information between agencies to disrupt ties between terrorist and criminal groups, potentially cutting off funding for terrorist activities. Policymakers may consider expanding programs supporting foreign law enforcement training, joint training exercises, and creating law enforcement task forces to disrupt ties between terrorist and criminal groups. Observers suggest more robust public diplomacy initiatives to counter terrorist recruitment efforts. Strengthening data collection and analysis on terrorist motivations and tactics could benefit the United States and its allies. Greater participation in counterterrorism efforts by industry, governments, and academia is crucial. Terrorists are targeting economic infrastructure and tourism, emphasizing the need to enhance security measures and response capabilities. Data sharing remains a challenge, but improving technology and detection equipment is essential.
