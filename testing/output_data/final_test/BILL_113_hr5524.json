    "content": "The Act titled \"Access to Contraception for Women Servicemembers and Dependents Act of 2014\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that women in the Armed Forces are crucial to national security, with over 350,000 serving on active duty or in the Selected Reserve. Additionally, nearly 10,000,000 members of the Armed Forces and their families, including 5,000,000 female beneficiaries, are eligible for health care through the Department of Defense. Contraception is essential for women's health and is highly effective in preventing unintended pregnancies, recognized as a significant public health achievement. Contraception is considered one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the twentieth century. It has led to increased participation of women in education and employment, resulting in higher wages and more control over reproductive decisions. Studies show that removing cost barriers to contraception and providing comprehensive counseling can significantly reduce unintended pregnancies. Additionally, investing in effective contraception has been proven to save public and private dollars. The 2011 recommendations of the Institute of Medicine and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act require health insurance plans to cover all FDA-approved contraception methods, sterilization procedures, and counseling for women without cost-sharing. This mandate also applies to Federal Employees Health Benefits Program plans. Studies show that servicewomen in the TRICARE program need comprehensive counseling for pregnancy prevention, especially before deployment, as the lack of it contributes to unintended pregnancies. Female servicemembers on active duty have full coverage for all prescription drugs, including contraception, without cost-sharing, but those not on active duty or dependents do not have the same coverage. An analysis by Ibis Reproductive Health found a high unintended pregnancy rate among servicewomen in the military, higher than the general population. The Department of Defense has the technology to develop clinical decision support tools integrated into electronic medical records for better patient care. The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services recommends implementing family planning initiatives in the Armed Forces to increase readiness and quality of life. Family planning for survivors of sexual assault in the military is a critical issue. Servicewomen on active duty report significantly higher rates of unwanted sexual contact compared to the general population of women in the United States. The Department of Defense already supports a policy to provide emergency contraception to servicewomen who are sexually assaulted. The Tricare program will now provide contraception coverage parity. Tricare program updates include coverage for contraception without cost-sharing for female beneficiaries. The Tricare program now covers contraception without cost-sharing for female beneficiaries, including all FDA-approved methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education. Amendments were made to ensure compliance with the new coverage. Members of the armed forces and military dependents have access to a broad range of FDA-approved contraception methods at military treatment facilities. The Secretary of Defense must ensure that every military treatment facility has a sufficient stock of FDA-approved contraception methods for women in the Armed Forces and covered beneficiaries. The purpose of this section is to provide current evidence-based standards of care for contraception to healthcare providers in the Department of Defense who treat female members of the Armed Forces. The Secretary of Defense is required to compile clinical practice guidelines on contraception within one year of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary is mandated to compile clinical practice guidelines on contraception from various health agencies and professional organizations, including the United States Preventive Services Task Force, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and others. Updates to these guidelines will be made periodically. The Secretary will update the list of clinical practice guidelines on contraception to include new standards of care. The guidelines will be disseminated to healthcare providers promptly after compilation, with updates provided as necessary. The Secretary will rapidly disseminate updated clinical practice guidelines to healthcare providers, along with developing administrative protocols for dissemination. Additionally, clinical decision support tools will be developed to assist healthcare providers within one year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will develop and implement clinical decision support tools based on current evidence-based guidelines for contraception. Updates to these tools will be made as new guidelines emerge, and dissemination will follow administrative protocols set by the Secretary. The Secretary will ensure access to contraception counseling for women in the Armed Forces during various health care visits, including predeployment, deployment, and annual physical examinations. Additionally, servicewomen's experiences with family planning services and counseling will be incorporated into surveys. The Secretary will integrate questions into Department of Defense surveys to gather information on women in the Armed Forces' experiences with accessing family planning services, using preferred methods, and determining if pregnancies were intended. The Secretary will integrate questions into Department of Defense surveys to gather information on women in the Armed Forces' experiences with accessing family planning services and determining if pregnancies were intended. The surveys to be integrated include the Health Related Behavior Survey of Active Duty Military Personnel and the Health Care Survey of Department of Defense Beneficiaries. Members of the Armed Forces will receive education on family planning. The Secretary of Defense will establish an education program on family planning for all members of the Armed Forces, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive family planning for their health and readiness. The program will use the latest technology to efficiently deliver information. The Secretary of Defense will establish an education program on family planning for all members of the Armed Forces, providing current, clear, and user-friendly information on contraception methods, laws, policies, confidentiality rights, and unique circumstances faced by service members. SEC. 7. Pregnancy prevention assistance at military treatment facilities for sexual assault survivors. The purpose of this section is to enhance regulations at military treatment facilities for sexual assault survivors by providing emergency contraception and follow-up care. Assistance must be provided to women who are victims of sexual assault or are believed to be survivors. Assistance for sexual assault survivors at military treatment facilities includes prompt provision of emergency contraception, unbiased information on contraception methods, and notification of confidentiality rights. The provision of information pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) must be clear, concise, and easily understood, meeting conditions set by the Secretary, including language requirements."
