The Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1993 recognizes the tribal right of self-governance as stemming from the inherent sovereignty of Indian tribes. It acknowledges a government-to-government relationship with tribes and aims to strengthen tribal control over Federal funding and programs. The Act was created to address the erosion of tribal self-governance by the centralized Federal bureaucracy. The Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1993 aims to transfer control to tribal governments over funding and decision-making for Federal programs benefiting Indians, in line with government-to-government relations and Indian self-determination policy. The Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1993 aims to transfer control to tribal governments over funding and decision-making for Federal programs benefiting Indians, in line with government-to-government relations and Indian self-determination policy. SEC. 3 declares the policy. The Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1993 aims to establish Self-Governance to maintain the relationship with Indian tribes, allow tribes to choose participation, co-exist with the Indian Self-Determination Act, ensure trust responsibility, and transition to tribal authority over programs and services. The Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1993 aims to establish programs, services, functions, and activities that meet the needs of tribal communities and provide for an orderly transition through a planned reduction in the Federal bureaucracy. The Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1993 establishes a program known as Tribal Self-Governance within the Department of the Interior, allowing tribes to govern themselves in accordance with the Act. The Secretary of the Interior will carry out this program, selecting tribes to participate. Under the Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1993, tribes participating in the program at the Department of the Interior must transition to Self-Governance under this title and cease participation in the demonstration project. The Secretary can also select up to 20 new tribes annually to participate in Self-Governance from a qualified applicant pool. To begin participation in Self-Governance, tribes must complete a planning phase, demonstrate financial stability, and have no audit exceptions for the previous 3 fiscal years. The planning phase includes legal and budgetary research, as well as internal tribal government planning and organizational preparation. \"SEC. 403. FUNDING AGREEMENTS.\" The Secretary must negotiate annual funding agreements with tribal governments, allowing them to administer programs and services available to Indian tribes. This includes the Johnson-O'Malley Act and the Snyder Act. The Secretary negotiates annual funding agreements with tribal governments, enabling them to manage programs and services for Indian tribes. These agreements allow tribes to redesign and reallocate funds for various activities, with certain exceptions like funds for education and specific agency divisions. Annual funding agreements between the Secretary and tribal governments specify services, functions, responsibilities, and fund reallocation procedures. Tribes are not entitled to contract for funds under section 102 but can access new programs like other tribes. The Secretary is responsible for administering programs under agreements with tribes, and cannot waive the trust responsibility of the United States. Agreements must be submitted for review 90 days before the effective date to tribes, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, and others. The Secretary provides funding to tribes for programs under agreements, based on what they would have received under contracts and grants. The amount is determined by the tribe's eligibility and related program costs. Under agreements with the Secretary, tribes provide trust services to individual Indians equivalent to what the Secretary would have offered. Civil actions under this title include professional contracts during the agreement period. Under Self-Governance, certain federal laws do not apply to professional contracts by Indian tribal governments. The Secretary is required to interpret laws in a way that facilitates inclusion of programs in agreements and tribes can request waivers for certain provisions. The Secretary must approve or deny a tribe's request for a waiver of a Federal regulation within 60 days. A denial can only occur if the Secretary finds that the regulation cannot be waived due to Federal law. The tribe can request a hearing within 60 days of a denial. The Secretary must approve or deny a tribe's request for a waiver of a Federal regulation within 60 days, with the option for the tribe to request a hearing on the record and an opportunity for an appeal. The Secretary must include funds for Self-Governance in the annual budget request to Congress. A report on Self-Governance administration must be submitted to Congress annually, detailing costs, benefits, related funds, and tribal views. The legislation also addresses the impact on other agreements and laws. SEC. 406 states that the legislation will not limit services, contracts, or funds for other Indian tribes or tribal organizations under section 102 or any other Federal law. SEC. 407 addresses negotiated rulemaking. Within 90 days of enactment, the Secretary will negotiate regulations with Indian tribes under this title. A committee with Federal and tribal representatives will be established for this purpose. The procedures will be adapted to the unique context of Self-Governance and the government-to-government relationship. The lack of promulgated regulations will not limit the effect of this title on the United States and Indian tribes. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out this title."
