    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Mercury Emissions Control Act.\" Congress finds that mercury pollution is a serious hazard to human health and the environment in the United States, with a significant portion coming from coal-fired power plants. Human exposure to methylmercury, the most toxic form of mercury, primarily occurs through consuming fish and shellfish. Mercury released into the atmosphere eventually accumulates in fish tissue at concentrations much higher than in surrounding water. Exposure to methylmercury in the womb poses neurological risks for children, impacting fine motor function, attention, language, visual-spatial abilities, and memory. Methylmercury exposure also affects cardiovascular health, blood pressure regulation, heart-rate variability, and contributes to heart disease. Reducing coal-fired power plant mercury emissions by 90% could result in billions of dollars in health benefits. Reducing coal-fired power plant mercury emissions by 90% using current methods like activated carbon injection technology and fabric filters is feasible by 2010 and could lead to annual financial benefits of up to $5.2 billion. Adding a scrubber can further reduce mercury emissions by up to 98% from bituminous coal-fired power plants. Activated carbon injection technology has successfully reduced mercury emissions from municipal waste incinerators from 45.2 tons in 1990 to 2.2 tons in 2000, with minimal capital costs of less than $3 per kilowatt. The final rules of the Environmental Protection Agency aimed at reducing mercury emissions by 50% by 2020 were vacated by the United States Court of Appeals. This was in response to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 included a list of 188 hazardous air pollutants, such as mercury, to be regulated under section 112 of the Act. The Act requires the regulation of hazardous air pollutants using maximum achievable control technology. The purposes of the Act are to control hazardous air pollutant emissions from electric utility steam generating units and ensure that regulations reflect the availability of highly effective controls. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 regulate hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from electric utility steam generating units using maximum achievable control technology. Section 112(n)(1) of the Clean Air Act is amended to propose regulations for controlling emissions of hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from electric utility steam generating units. The Clean Air Act is amended to require a 90 percent reduction in mercury emissions from electric utility steam generating units."
