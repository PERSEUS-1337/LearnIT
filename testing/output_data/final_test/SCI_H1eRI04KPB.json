    "content": "Deep generative modeling using flows has gained popularity due to tractable exact log-likelihood estimation and efficient training. Flow models face challenges with high dimensional latent space, addressed by a multi-scale architecture proposed by Dinh et al. (2016). Our novel multi-scale architecture performs data-dependent factorization to determine dimensions passing through more flow layers based on their contribution to total log-likelihood. Our proposed heuristic is integrated into the flow training process for a likelihood contribution based multi-scale architecture in generic flow models. Implementation for the original flow model by Dinh et al. (2016) shows improved log-likelihood scores and sampling quality on image benchmarks. Ablation studies compare our method with other dimension factorization options. Deep Generative Modeling focuses on learning embedded distributions in input data without human labeling, crucial for utilizing unlabelled data effectively. Deep generative modeling involves learning representations that can be used for various tasks like semi-supervised learning, data augmentation, and text analysis. It includes likelihood-based models such as autoregressive models, latent variable models, flow-based models, and implicit models like generative adversarial networks (GANs). Autoregressive models achieve high log-likelihood scores but have slow sampling processes, while latent variable models like variational autoencoders are used for efficient modeling of data distributions. Deep generative modeling involves various models like autoregressive models, latent variable models, GANs, and flow-based models. Latent variable models like variational autoencoders capture global features but lack exact density estimation. GANs synthesize realistic data but lack a suitable latent space for downstream tasks. Flow-based models offer exact density estimation and an information-rich latent space but have the same dimension as the input space. Flow-based models face a bottleneck in scaling with increasing input dimensions due to computational complexity. A solution is the multi-scale architecture introduced by Dinh et al. (2016), which performs iterative gaussianization of dimensions at regular intervals. Our proposed multi-scale architecture uses data-dependent factorization to determine which dimensions pass through more flow layers, improving computational efficiency and training effectiveness. The research introduces a heuristic based on log-likelihood contributions of dimensions in a multi-scale architecture, aiding decision-making on flow layers. The method is applicable to generic flow models, showing improvements in affine/additive coupling and ODE-based models through quantitative and qualitative analysis. A log-determinant based heuristic is presented, highlighting individual dimension contributions towards total log-likelihood in the architecture.

The research introduces a heuristic for flow models, focusing on log-likelihood contributions of dimensions in a multi-scale architecture. It involves data-dependent splitting of dimensions and aims to enhance decision-making on flow layers by highlighting individual dimension contributions to total log-likelihood. In a multi-scale architecture for flow models, the log-likelihood contributions of dimensions are split based on data, optimizing computation and memory usage. Different types of flows can be constructed for the reverse path from z to x, involving inverse flows and dimension factorization. In a multi-scale architecture for flow models, log-likelihood contributions of dimensions are split based on data to optimize computation and memory usage. A heuristic is introduced to estimate the contribution of each dimension towards the total log-likelihood, allowing for the decision of which dimensions to be factored. Our approach in building an efficient multiscale architecture involves factoring dimensions at each flow layer to capture local variance in the input space and maximize log-likelihood. The design of flow layers plays a crucial role in maximizing the log-determinant, which contributes to the overall likelihood. The total log-det term is the sum of log-det terms contributed by each dimension in the input space. The log-det term at each flow layer encompasses contributions from all dimensions, decomposed to show individual contributions towards the total log-det. The log-det term at each flow layer is a tensor corresponding to each dimension, with entries having higher value contributing more towards the total log-likelihood. This can be used as a heuristic for deciding which variables should be gaussianized early in a multi-scale architecture, providing more power to variables with meaningful representation. The log-det term at each flow layer helps decide which variables to gaussianize early in a multi-scale architecture for improved density estimation performance. Factors to consider include exposing variables with higher log-det to more flow layers and capturing local variance for qualitative reconstruction. Hybrid factorization techniques can be implemented to meet these requirements in different types of flow models. LCMA is a method for multi-scale flow models to improve density estimation and qualitative performance by decomposing the log-det of the jacobian. In Algorithm 1, dimensions with varying log-det are grouped and split to preserve local spatial variation in image reconstruction. The decision of dimension factorization is fixed before training, enhancing both density estimation and reconstruction quality. LCMA is a method for multi-scale flow models to improve density estimation by decomposing the log-det of the jacobian. The decision of dimension factorization is fixed before training, allowing for the use of non-invertible operations for efficient factorization. The dimension factorization phase involves computing the individual contribution of dimensions towards the total log-likelihood, shaping tensors using local max and min-pooling. LCMA is a method for multi-scale flow models to improve density estimation by decomposing the log-det of the jacobian. The decision of dimension factorization is fixed before training, involving shaping tensors using local max and min-pooling operations. Dimensions are split into two parts based on log-det comparison, with some contributing more towards likelihood and others early gaussianized. This process is repeated for all layers until the latent space. Training involves keeping the fixed decision of dimension factorization. Some flow models offer direct decomposition of jacobian, while others use indirect estimation. Methods for obtaining individual likelihood contribution of dimensions in flow models are described. RealNVP uses affine coupling layers to calculate per-dimensional likelihood components, while Glow employs 1x1 convolution blocks with non-diagonal log-det terms for channel dimensions. Glow utilizes 1x1 convolution blocks with non-diagonal log-det terms for channel dimensions to decompose the log determinant of weight matrices into individual contributions from each channel. Singular values of the weight matrix are used to calculate the individual log-det terms for channels. Affine blocks in Glow follow a similar method as RealNVP. A new method is introduced to determine per-dimensional likelihood contributions for i-ResNet, a residual network with invertibility and efficient jacobian computation properties. Multi-scale architecture and variants, successful in prior works in deep generative modeling, utilize invertible neural networks with keepChannel for selective feed forward of channels. In the spectrum of generative flow models, multi-scale architecture has been effective. In generative flow models, multi-scale architecture is utilized for dimensionality reduction and enhanced training. Our proposed method factors dimensions based on their likelihood contribution, determining important dimensions for density estimation and reconstruction. Prior works in generative flow models involve multi-scaling and permutation among dimensions. In generative flow models, multi-scale architecture is used for dimensionality reduction and training enhancement. Kingma & Dhariwal (2018) introduced a 1 \u00d7 1 convolution layer to capture interactions among dimensions. This layer redistributes dimension contributions to total likelihood, treating dimensions as equiprobable for factorization. Our approach focuses on the individuality and importance of dimensions based on their log-likelihood contribution. The log-det score is obtained from the jacobian in flow training, providing a heuristic for free. Our method focuses on individual dimensions, making it versatile for multi-scale architectures. Previous works have explored invertible convolutions and permutations, but lack discussion on multi-scaling. Flow models like Behrmann et al. (2018) use ODE based density estimators with static channel-wise splitting. Our proposed factorization method for flow models with a multi-scale architecture focuses on preserving spatiality and improving density estimation. This approach considers the individual contribution of dimensions towards the total log-likelihood, unlike previous models. The detailed results of the proposed LCMA for the flow model of RealNVP are presented, along with comparisons to Glow and i-ResNet. Experimental settings and data preprocessing are kept consistent for direct comparison. Experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10, Imagenet, and CelebA datasets with dimension factorization at each flow layer according to Section 3 methods. LCMA scaling is compared with RealNVP on CIFAR-10, Imagenet, and CelebA datasets. LCMA shows better density estimation results compared to the baseline, with significant improvement on CelebA due to facial features containing high redundancy. Ablation studies are conducted for LCMA vs. other dimension splitting options, showing improvements in bits/dim scores. The proposed LCMA enhances flow models by emphasizing key facial features, leading to improved code length. The impact is more pronounced on datasets with distinct features like CelebA.

Affine coupling layers are used in the flow model architecture, with a cascade connection of 3 coupling layers at different resolutions. For CIFAR-10, each coupling layer has 8 residual blocks, while other datasets use 4 or 2 residual blocks depending on image size.
