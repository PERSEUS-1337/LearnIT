    "content": "The Coastal State Climate Change Planning Act of 2008, also known as the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, is amended to include climate change adaptation planning. The Secretary will establish a coastal climate change adaptation planning program to assist coastal states in developing plans to minimize climate change impacts and prepare for consequences. Financial and technical assistance will be provided to implement these plans. Guidelines will be developed within 180 days in consultation with coastal states. The Secretary, in consultation with coastal states, will issue guidelines for a grant program to help coastal states develop climate change adaptation plans. Plans must identify facilities and resources likely impacted by climate change. The grant program aims to assist coastal states in developing climate change adaptation plans, including strategies for land use, monitoring environmental changes, and aligning with state hazard mitigation plans. Grants will be allocated accordingly. Grants under this section are available to coastal states with approved management programs and will be allocated based on regulations. Priority may be given to states that have received grant funding for program changes. The Secretary can provide technical assistance to ensure timely plan development. Coastal states must have federal approval to be eligible for grants. To be eligible for a coastal adaptation project grant, a coastal state must have its climate change adaptation plan approved by the Secretary. The Secretary can make grants to states with approved plans to support projects implementing strategies within those plans. Program requirements will be published within 90 days of the first plan approval, outlining application procedures, eligible activities, and grant terms. The Secretary may award grants to coastal states for projects addressing stress factors in the coastal zone to improve climate change adaptation. Eligible activities include addressing physical disturbances, monitoring, control, and eradication efforts. The Secretary may award grants to coastal states for projects addressing stress factors in the coastal zone to improve climate change adaptation, including monitoring, control, or eradication of disease organisms and invasive species, establishment of marine and terrestrial habitat buffers, preservation of migratory wildlife corridors, and implementation of projects to reduce impacts from natural hazards. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 is amended to provide technical training and assistance to local coastal policy makers on climate change adaptation strategies. Authorization of appropriations is also included for grants under specific sections. Congress clarifies that coastal states are not required to amend their management programs or extend enforceable policies beyond the coastal zone. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 is amended to provide technical training and assistance to local coastal policy makers on climate change adaptation strategies. Coastal states are not required to extend enforceable policies beyond the coastal zone."
