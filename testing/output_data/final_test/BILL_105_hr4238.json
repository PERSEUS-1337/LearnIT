    "content": "The Act titled \"Small Business Employee Retirement Protection Act of 1998\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 outlines the findings and purposes of the Act. The Congress finds that millions of American workers lack employer-provided pensions, with billions of dollars invested in the private pension system, including plans for small businesses. Public confidence in the system is at risk when workers lose their retirement savings. The Congress aims to improve private pension security for employees of small businesses by protecting the assets of small plans from fraud, embezzlement, or mismanagement. This Act seeks to provide enhanced protection for the assets of small pension plans while balancing regulatory burdens that may discourage small businesses from offering pension plans. The Congress aims to protect the assets of small pension plans, provide tools for small business owners and employees to secure their retirement assets, increase public confidence in the private pension system, ensure employees have access to accurate information about their pension plans, and establish clear standards for financial disclosure by custodians of small pension plans. SEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS FOR SMALL PENSION PLANS RELATING TO HOLDERS OF PLAN ASSETS AND ANNUAL ASSET STATEMENTS. Requirements for small pension plans regarding holders of plan assets and annual asset statements are outlined in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The act specifies conditions under which annual reports must be filed by plan administrators, including the criteria for entities holding plan assets and the obligation to provide asset information to participants and beneficiaries upon request. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 requires entities holding plan assets to provide written statements of asset listings and values to participants and beneficiaries upon request. The act also mandates entities to provide the Secretary with a statement upon request, certifying the authenticity and accuracy of the information. Regulations may be prescribed for the format of these statements. Additionally, administrators of pension plans must notify participants of their right to request asset statements. The administrator of pension plans must notify participants of their right to request asset statements from entities holding plan assets. Failure to ensure prompt distribution of requested statements may result in liability for the administrator. The administrator of a pension plan may be personally liable if they fail to provide requested asset statements to participants within 30 days. Liability can amount to $100 a day from the date of failure, with the court having discretion to order additional relief. The Secretary can establish alternative methods to meet this requirement. The plan administrator may face civil penalties of up to $100 a day if they fail to provide asset statements to the Secretary within 30 days. No penalty will be imposed for failures beyond their control. The plan administrator may face civil penalties for failure to provide asset statements within 30 days, with no penalty for failures beyond their control as determined by the Secretary.
