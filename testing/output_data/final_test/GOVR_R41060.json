    "content": "This report examines congressional activity related to recent NFL and MLB work stoppages in 1982, 1987, 2011, and 1994. It explores how Congress responded to previous sports labor disputes. Work stoppages in professional sports, whether due to player strikes or owner lockouts, are often contentious and prolonged. The four major US sports leagues - MLB, NBA, NFL, and NHL - have had a total of 21 work stoppages. MLB has had the most (eight), followed by NFL (five), NHL (four), and NBA (two). MLB has had five strikes and three lockouts, while the NHL had one strike and three lockouts. The NFL is unique with two of its five stoppages starting as lockouts. The NFL has had two work stoppages that began as lockouts and ended as strikes. The average length of work stoppages for each league is as follows: MLB, 46 days; NBA, 139 days; NFL, 31 days; and NHL, 138 days. The medians for the four leagues are as follows: MLB, 17 days; NBA, 149 days; NFL, 24 days; and NHL, 103 days. This report describes congressional responses to the 1982 and 1987 NFL strikes and the 1994 MLB strike, including legislative measures and Members' comments. On September 20, 1982, NFL players voted to strike after negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement broke down. The NFL Players Association sought 55% of the owners' gross revenues, but the NFL rejected their demands. The dispute was resolved when the NFL offered to share $1.6 billion with the NFLPA over five years. The NFL players went on strike in 1982 after failed negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement. The owners offered to share $1.6 billion with the NFLPA over five years. The dispute was resolved with the players accepting $1.28 billion over five years and $60 million in compensation. The season resumed on November 21, 1982, with a new five-year CBA signed on December 5, 1982. Congressional involvement was proposed but no hearings were held. Senator introduced S. 3003, highlighting Congress's history of promoting public interest in professional sports through various legislative actions, such as telecasting sold-out home games and ensuring financial stability of sports leagues. The 1982 CBA expired in 1987, leading to a strike by NFL players over free agency. Replacement players were used until the striking players returned to work on October 15, 1987, despite no CBA in place. The 1987 NFL players' strike resulted in replacement players being used until the regular players returned to work on October 15, 1987. Team owners banned players who did not return by October 14, resulting in lost pay. The season ended on January 31, 1988, with the Super Bowl. A legislative measure, S.Res. 294, called for negotiations between the players association and the NFL Management Council. During a hearing on the resolution regarding the NFL players' strike, the subcommittee's chairman questioned Pete Rozelle about why he, as the Commissioner, had not taken a more active role in mediating the issue. Rozelle mentioned having meetings and phone conversations with the President of the Players' Association, Gene Upshaw, and staying informed on the situation through the owners' Management Council. There has been a strong disagreement hindering negotiations between NFL management and players. Both sides are under pressure to resume talks promptly. Direct negotiations are crucial to resolving the strike, with the American people closely following the issue. The NFL strike has caused a strong interest among the American people. Senator Specter urged the NFL commissioner to help settle the strike to avoid it being a top news issue every night. The NFL commissioner, who has been in the position for 27 years, is praised for his leadership in the National Football League. Senator Specter urges him to use his talents to settle the football strike, expressing frustration over the situation. The NFL commissioner, in his role for 27 years, is seen as a neutral figure by players. Senator Specter believes the strike could have been avoided if players accepted him as such. Despite ongoing substitute player games, public dissatisfaction is growing. The strike began in August 1994 due to failed CBA negotiations, with players voting to strike. In September 1994, Major League Baseball cancelled the season after a strike. The Clinton Administration tried to mediate negotiations between the parties. The strike ended in early 1995 due to an injunction by Judge Sonia Sotomayor. Owners accepted players' offer to return to work. The 1995 MLB season started on April 26 instead of April 3 due to a delayed commencement after a strike. The postseason and World Series were completed without interruption. Legislative measures were introduced in response to the strike, including S. 2380 and H.R. 4649 proposed by Senator Howard Metzenbaum to address the issues between players and owners in Major League Baseball. The bill allows antitrust laws to be used if owners impose a salary cap or other conditions on players, removing their incentive to be unfair. It gives players a tool to avoid striking and forces owners to deal fairly. This aims to prevent work stoppages like strikes or lockouts that have occurred in baseball negotiations. Senator Orrin Hatch, co-sponsor of S. 2380, urged both sides in baseball labor disputes to resolve differences without resorting to a strike or lockout. He opposed the blanket repeal of baseball's antitrust immunity, citing it as a legal anomaly. If antitrust laws applied to baseball, players could challenge unreasonable demands through lawsuits instead of halting the season. Senator Orrin Hatch opposes the repeal of baseball's antitrust immunity, advocating for resolving labor disputes without strikes or lockouts. He expresses concern about the delay caused by the unique legal roles in baseball and introduces the Baseball Fans Protection Act to address this issue. Representative Major R. Owens introduced H.R. 4965 without remarks, while Senator Dennis DeConcini's S. 2401 aimed to establish a commission on professional baseball. Senator DeConcini proposed a commission for professional baseball to address labor disputes through binding arbitration, citing the need for government intervention due to baseball's antitrust exemption. The text discusses the issue of baseball's antitrust exemption and the need for government intervention to regulate the industry. Senator DeConcini proposed a commission for professional baseball to address labor disputes through binding arbitration. Representative Mike Synar introduced H.R. 4994 to spur negotiations between players and owners and allow players to return to the field. The bill H.R. 4994 aims to protect players' rights and bargaining positions in baseball by subjecting owners and players to antitrust laws to prevent anticompetitive actions. This legislative response addresses the urgent competitive problem in Major League Baseball. The legislation H.R. 4994 aims to address the competitive issue in Major League Baseball by repealing the nonstatutory antitrust exemption, giving players more rights in bargaining. This move is the first step in ending the Supreme Court-created legal fiction that has given owners complete power over the sport. The Committee acts to end the economic consequences of the illusion in baseball by partially repealing the nonstatutory exemption, subjecting players and owners to antitrust laws in case of anticompetitive actions. Some members of the Judiciary Committee oppose congressional involvement in the matter. Some members of the Judiciary Committee oppose congressional intervention in the ongoing baseball dispute, arguing that it should only occur for national security reasons. They suggest revisiting the issue of baseball's antitrust exemption next year when emotions have calmed down. The dissenting members also point out that other professional sports leagues do not have the same antitrust exemption as baseball. Labor strife in professional sports, including baseball, is more related to economics than the applicability of federal antitrust laws. A 1994 hearing on H.R. 5095 revealed the House Committee's opposition to binding arbitration but supported congressional intervention in the baseball strike. The Labor Committee, historically against binding arbitration, now supports it for baseball. Representative Williams introduced a bill addressing the need for effective collective bargaining in baseball. Other subcommittee members echoed his sentiments. Several subcommittee members, including Representative Donald M. Payne, Representative Matthew G. Martinez, and Representative Eliot L. Engel, expressed support for using binding arbitration to settle the baseball strike when voluntary negotiations fail. They believe in the importance of collective bargaining but see arbitration or congressional intervention as acceptable alternatives. Payne specifically mentioned his support for Chairman's initiative and H.R. 5095 to address issues resulting from the baseball strike. Several subcommittee members, including Representative Donald M. Payne, Representative Matthew G. Martinez, and Representative Eliot L. Engel, expressed support for using binding arbitration to settle disputes like the baseball strike. They believe in the importance of collective bargaining but see arbitration or congressional intervention as acceptable alternatives. Representative Major R. Owens also supported the bill, suggesting a long-term solution of repealing baseball's antitrust exemption. While fully supporting the bill, the Congressman emphasizes the need for stronger action by Congress to address baseball's antitrust exemption, which has led to multiple work stoppages. Urging all Members to support the current effort and take further steps to address the issue in the Judiciary Committee. The Judiciary Committee is urged to address baseball's antitrust exemption, with some members suggesting resolving the strike through collective bargaining. Representatives encourage staying out of the situation and returning to the bargaining table. The Judiciary Committee is considering the use of binding arbitration to prevent work stoppages among public schoolteachers. They question whether a similar approach should be taken in resolving labor disputes in baseball, asking about the national interest and conditions for an alternative remedy. The concept of binding public arbitration is not opposed if there is an overriding public interest, and they seek to understand what that interest would be in the case of baseball. The United States Congress is discussing the use of final and binding arbitration to resolve labor disputes in baseball. Some members believe that the strike should be settled by the players and owners without government intervention. Antitrust laws are not a factor in this situation. Some subcommittee members are concerned about the financial impact of the strike. The financial impact of the strike on stadium or team employees is a concern raised during a hearing on Major League Baseball's antitrust exemption. Representatives highlighted the economic disaster for those reliant on baseball for their livelihood, such as concession workers and small business owners in the community. Brooks, chairman of the subcommittee, emphasized the need for legislation regarding baseball's antitrust exemption in light of the strike. Congress, as policymakers, can respond to the lost games and economic impact, urging the owners to consider the consequences of their actions. In response to the recent spectacle and concerns for the future of baseball, legislation is needed to restore competition and fair play. Congress may not have enough time to pass a standalone bill before adjourning, but could consider attaching a limited repeal of the exemption to other legislation. Representative John Conyers Jr. emphasized the importance of upholding antitrust laws. Representative Patricia Schroeder criticized Congress for not taking action on baseball's antitrust exemption, implying a connection between Congress and major league baseball. She argued that by allowing the exemption to continue, Congress was giving owners special privileges. Representative Sherwood Boehlert also discussed Congress's responsibility in the matter. Representative Sherwood Boehlert emphasized Congress's responsibility for professional baseball, highlighting the need to ensure the game endures. He, along with other subcommittee members, encouraged the players union and Major League Baseball to resolve their differences through collective bargaining. In Congress, members often realize the need for compromise and alternative solutions during discussions. The chairman and others hope the parties involved can resolve their dispute and move forward. The hearing suggests negotiations may resume, emphasizing the importance of finding a resolution. Representative Conyers introduced H.R. 45 to address baseball's antitrust exemption, which he believed was the root cause of the current strike. He urged Congress to intervene and rescue the national pastime from its current state. The bills introduced were aimed at either resolving the baseball strike or reflecting general interest in professional baseball. Several bills were introduced to address baseball's antitrust exemption, with sponsors including Representatives Bilirakis, Schumer, and Bunning. Representative Bunning emphasized the need to remove the exemption for the good of fans and the game. Representative Traficant believed that ending the exemption could save the 1995 season. Several bills were introduced in response to the 1995 baseball season strike, including the Professional Baseball Antitrust Reform Act of 1995. Representatives proposed different solutions, such as binding arbitration and regulating baseball to protect fans' interests. The need to remove baseball's antitrust exemption was emphasized to save the season. The legislation introduced seeks to create an independent National Commission on Professional Baseball to oversee the conduct of baseball until its legal status is redefined. It argues that baseball's antitrust exemption is a government-granted monopoly and calls for Congress to take steps to return baseball to the American people. The proposed National Commission on Professional Baseball would provide oversight during a period of deregulation to ensure public interests are protected in the baseball market, similar to other regulatory bodies overseeing monopolies. The Commission's authority is temporary and aims to address the current antitrust exemption in baseball, advocating for government regulation to safeguard the public's interests. Representative Estaban Edward Torres introduced legislation to repeal baseball's antitrust exemption to protect the public's interests and accelerate the end of the baseball shutdown. President Clinton forwarded proposed legislation to Congress in 1995, with H.R. 870 introduced by Representative Pat Williams and S. 376 introduced by Senator Edward M. Kennedy. Congress generally prefers parties involved in labor disputes to reach a settlement on their own. Senator Kennedy highlighted Congress's authority to regulate interstate commerce and the special status of baseball in America as reasons for intervening in the baseball strike. While Congress typically avoids involvement in labor disputes, there are rare instances where intervention is necessary, and this may be one of those times. The constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce gives Congress the ability to enact legislation to settle the dispute. Senator Kennedy argues that Congress should intervene in the baseball strike due to the special status of baseball in America as our national sport. He believes that Congress, as representatives of fans, should not remain silent while baseball is damaged by the ongoing dispute between owners and players. Kennedy emphasizes that legislation to end the strike would not set a precedent for Congress to intervene in other labor disputes. He urges for action to be taken before it is too late for the owners and players to resolve the issue themselves. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan introduced bill S. 15 to repeal baseball's antitrust exemption, citing the cancellation of the 1994 World Series as a result of this exemption. He argued that without legal restraints, baseball team owners act as a cartel, and Congress must remove the exemption to subject the game to the same rules as other sports. Senator Orrin Hatch also supports repealing the exemption. Orrin Hatch, the new chairman of the Judiciary Committee, supports repealing baseball's antitrust exemption and is ready to move a bill quickly through his committee. In February 1995, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee held a hearing on the exemption and two bills, S. 415 and S. 416, that would apply antitrust laws to professional baseball. Senator Strom Thurmond introduced S. 416 but did not link the repeal of the exemption to the ongoing strike. The Thurmond-Leahy legislation addresses baseball's antitrust exemption without specifically addressing the current strike. Senator Thurmond believes that Congress should consider baseball's antitrust exemption as a matter of public policy, separate from the current baseball strike. The purpose of the February 1995 hearing was to focus on the policy implications of the exemption, rather than the details of the strike. Thurmond intends to continue working on this issue regardless of the strike. Senator Thurmond believes Congress should consider baseball's antitrust exemption as a public policy issue, separate from the current strike. He emphasized the need to limit government intervention in private matters, but acknowledged Congress's involvement due to the special exemption in place for baseball. Senator Orrin G. Hatch introduced a bill to eliminate baseball's antitrust exemption, linking it to the ongoing baseball strike. He argued that removing the exemption would help facilitate labor negotiations between owners and players by allowing players to have legal recourse if owners violate antitrust laws. Senator Orrin G. Hatch introduced legislation to eliminate baseball's antitrust exemption, which he believes gives owners unfair leverage in negotiations and discourages them from accepting reasonable terms. The bill aims to remove a barrier to settlement in the ongoing baseball strike, without imposing specific terms on the parties involved. Senator Patrick Leahy, a cosponsor of the bill, also acknowledged the role of the antitrust exemption in the strike. Senator Orrin G. Hatch introduced legislation to eliminate baseball's antitrust exemption, which he believes gives owners unfair leverage in negotiations and discourages them from accepting reasonable terms. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan also identified two other factors contributing to the ongoing dispute: the lack of a regulatory framework to protect the public and the absence of a strong, independent commissioner in baseball. competing financial interests continue to clash, with no resolution in sight. Senator Moynihan favored resolving the labor-management dispute through collective agreement. Interstate commerce and antitrust laws should apply to baseball like any other industry. The strike should be settled through good-faith bargaining, without Congress interfering in the collective bargaining process. The antitrust exemption has been interfering with baseball for fifty years. Senator Arlen Specter and Senator Howell Heflin expressed reservations about Congress intervening in labor disputes, questioning their ability to make decisions and the role of economic pressures in settlements. They emphasized the importance of allowing the collective bargaining process to proceed without Congressional interference. Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum opposes Congress intervening in the baseball labor dispute, citing concerns about setting a dangerous precedent and disrupting the collective bargaining process. Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum opposes Congress intervening in the baseball labor dispute, expressing concerns about disrupting the collective bargaining process. She believes that any legislation, such as Hatch-Moynihan, would impede negotiations and decrease the likelihood of a settlement. Senator Hatch and Senator Thurmond introduced a new bill, S. 627, in March 1995, maintaining their positions on the issue. Senator Hatch and Senator Thurmond's positions on legislation regarding the baseball strike remained unchanged. The Senate Committee on the Judiciary discussed reasons for Congress not to intervene, including concerns about disrupting collective bargaining and appearing biased towards one party. Senator Specter, Senator Paul Simon, and Senators Hank Brown and Dianne Feinstein also expressed their views on the matter. Given the current labor situation in baseball, Congress should refrain from intervening in the antitrust exemption. It is best for Congress not to act at all, allowing the parties to resolve their issues through voluntary collective bargaining. Enacting the bill would only disrupt the current situation and hinder the parties from reaching a resolution on their own. The Committee has approved a repeal of major league baseball's antitrust exemption, but Congress should not interfere in the ongoing labor dispute between millionaires. There are more pressing issues for Congress to address, and professional sports leagues' problems should be considered carefully and not on an ad hoc basis. The current bill intervenes in a labor dispute in professional sports, but Congress should carefully reexamine the issue in a broader context to avoid criticism of playing favorites. President Clinton and mediator William Usery emphasized resolving baseball's problems at the negotiating table, not through legislative intervention. On October 14, 1994, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich announced that former Labor Secretary William Usery would mediate the labor dispute between Major League Baseball players and owners. President Clinton later asked Usery to intensify mediation efforts to bring the parties back to the negotiating table. President Clinton asked mediator William Usery to intensify efforts to bring MLB players and owners back to the table, aiming to speed up negotiations. Despite believing in good-faith bargaining, Clinton called for urgent action due to the strike's prolonged nature. A last-ditch White House meeting on February 7, 1995, failed, leading Clinton to consider legislation for binding arbitration. President Clinton proposed legislation for binding arbitration of the baseball dispute to Congress, seeking a neutral solution through neutral parties. The bill, \"Major League Baseball Restoration Act,\" was introduced by Representative Williams and Senator Kennedy in the House and Senate, respectively. Clinton emphasized the importance of allowing the American people to have a say on the legislation. The ongoing dispute between the National Football League and the NFL Players Association could result in substantial economic damage to cities and communities. The previous collective bargaining agreement allowed either party to terminate it before the expiration date. In May 2008, NFL team owners unanimously voted to opt out of the CBA for the 2011 season. Both parties agreed to mediate their dispute in February 2011, but after 17 days, the FMCS concluded that further mediation would not be productive. The NFLPA notified the NFL of its decertification, leading to a lockout. After negotiations, an agreement was reached, and team facilities opened for training camp. A legislative measure was introduced in response to the lockout to prevent misuse of antitrust immunity. Representative Conyers stated the bill's purpose was to prevent improper leverage in future football lockouts. In 2008, the NFL negotiated TV contracts with provisions to protect against lockout impact. Congress was most active during the 1994 strike, with the baseball strike lasting 232 days. The 1982 and 1987 NFL strikes were shorter, with the 1987 season using replacement players. Legislative measures were organized in Table 10 based on dispute resolution methods. S. 3003 (97th Congress) included binding arbitration and requiring league and players to resume activities. The 1982 or 1987 NFL strikes had three proposed methods for resolution: binding arbitration, reconciliation, or resuming normal activities. Baseball faced 15 legislative measures targeting its antitrust exemption, with some proposing binding arbitration or oversight commissions. The legislative measures introduced in response to various sports strikes and lockouts were mostly not approved, with only one resolution encouraging NFL players and management to return to the bargaining table being passed. The National Labor Relations Act governs labor-management relations in professional sports. The NLRA requires employers and unions to bargain in good faith over wages, hours, and other employment terms. Collective bargaining allows for economic weapons like strikes and the use of replacement workers. The FMCS provides mediation and conciliation services to settle disputes under the NLRA. The NLRA authorizes the FMCS to provide mediation and conciliation services for disputes that threaten commerce. The FMCS cannot issue binding arbitration decisions but can facilitate mediation. Previous measures proposed binding arbitration for resolving strikes in sports leagues. The board or panel would consider various factors before rendering a final decision to replace the expired collective bargaining agreement in sports leagues. Factors include history of agreements, changes in circumstances, and owner's ability to pay. Unlike recent legislation, NFL and MLB measures would establish a panel to resolve strikes, which would cease once a decision is reached. Arbitration is favored for allowing parties to select. Arbitration is favored by disputing parties for selecting industry experts as arbitrators. MLB measures proposed an arbitration board with representatives from owners and players. Supporters argue that arbitration leads to faster dispute resolution compared to litigation. Arbitration is increasingly using lawyers, raising questions about cost-effectiveness compared to litigation. Arbitration fees may be expensive. Antitrust exemptions in professional sports include the Sports Broadcasting Act, the baseball antitrust exemption, and the labor-antitrust exemption for collective bargaining agreements. The Sports Broadcasting Act (SBA) allows professional sports teams to pool their broadcasting rights through joint agreements, exempting them from federal antitrust laws. In 1998, there was a congressional attempt to limit the baseball antitrust exemption. For more information, contact the author(s). The Sports Broadcasting Act (SBA) clarifies that the antitrust exemption does not apply to contracts limiting telecasting rights, except for prohibiting games in a team's home territory during a home game. It also carves out specific times for high school and college games, exempting them from professional game telecasts during those times. The \"baseball antitrust exemption\" is not a result of positive action by Congress but rather a historical accident due to the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Commerce Clause. The Supreme Court's interpretation of the Commerce Clause led to the baseball antitrust exemption, which has been recognized since 1922. The exemption's extent and scope have been debated in lower courts, with one court limiting it to baseball's \"reserve system.\" The labor-antitrust exemption, created by the judiciary, aims to foster labor relations in professional baseball. The labor-antitrust exemption allows employees to collectively negotiate employment terms without violating antitrust laws, as long as the terms are bona fide, not overly restrictive, and part of a valid collective bargaining agreement. Some courts also consider if the agreement primarily affects the parties involved. The labor-antitrust doctrine covers management and labor parties in collective bargaining agreements, allowing for the association of employees to standardize wages without violating antitrust laws. The Supreme Court recognizes the importance of labor policy in reducing business competition based on wage and working condition differences. The \"reserve\" clause in professional sports restricts market competition for players' services, binding athletes to their team post-contract expiration. The argument that this restriction is not prohibited by the Sherman Act has been made and rejected. The court rejected the argument that the Sherman Act does not prohibit the \"reserve\" clause in professional sports. However, the court acknowledged the utility of the NFL's \"Rozelle\" rule in maintaining competitive balance among teams and protecting clubs' investments in players. The \"reserve\" clauses have not been completely struck down but have been modified to address judicial criticism of their enforcement. The Curt Flood Act clarified that major league baseball players are covered by antitrust laws in employment transactions, addressing the historical accident of baseball's antitrust exemption. Congress passed the act after unsuccessful attempts following the Supreme Court's Flood decision. The act does not affect employment relations with minor league players or the agreement between major league teams and the National Association of Professional. The Curt Flood Act allows major league baseball players to challenge onerous practices in court, despite frustrations in challenging valid collective bargaining agreements. It does not address the nonstatutory labor-antitrust exemption or provide guidance on its interpretation."
