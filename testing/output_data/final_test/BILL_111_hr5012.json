    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Weekends Without Hunger Act\" and aims to address hunger on weekends and holidays. The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act is amended to include a new section called \"Weekends and Holidays Without Hunger,\" defining terms like 'at-risk school child' and 'eligible institution' for providing food support during weekends and holidays. The Secretary shall establish a program to provide nutritious food to eligible institutions, including schools, food banks, homeless shelters, and other approved emergency feeding agencies, through a competitive commodity distribution process. Eligible institutions can provide nutritious food to at-risk children on weekends and extended school holidays. To receive commodities, institutions must submit an application to the Secretary with a distribution plan for at-risk school children. This includes methods of food delivery and assurances for children receiving food. The application for receiving commodities must include assurances that children will not be publicly separated or identified, lists of food types, food quality and safety provisions, number of at-risk children to be served, per-child cost, and any other necessary information determined by the Secretary. Priority will be given to eligible institutions with ongoing programs for at-risk school children, experience in food delivery and safety, high quality control standards, providing nutritious food, cost efficiencies, potential for additional funding, and project sustainability. The Secretary will issue guidelines with criteria for projects to receive commodities under this section, considering geographical variations and different project types. The Secretary will conduct an interim evaluation of the pilot program by November 30, 2013, focusing on projects offering nutritious foods to at-risk school children and collecting necessary data for analysis and recommendations to Congress.
