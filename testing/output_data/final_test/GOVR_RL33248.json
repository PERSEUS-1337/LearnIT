    "content": "The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58) was signed by President Bush on August 8, 2005, and was the first omnibus energy legislation in over a decade. Key provisions include tax incentives for energy production and efficiency, a mandate to double biofuel use, faster energy production on federal lands, and authorization of federal energy research programs. The Act also established federal jurisdiction over activities to support the reliability of the U.S. bulk power system, clarifying the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to regulate an electric reliability organization (ERO) for improved system reliability. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58) established federal jurisdiction over the U.S. bulk power system's reliability. It mandated FERC to create a certified ERO within 180 days to develop and enforce reliability standards, including cybersecurity protection. The ERO can impose penalties for violations of FERC-approved standards. FERC has the authority to order compliance with reliability standards and impose penalties for violations in the bulk power system. A regional advisory body can be established by FERC if requested by two-thirds of states in a region with more than half of their electric load served within that region. The advisory body provides advice on reliability standards, proposed entities, fees, and other responsibilities requested by FERC. The state of New York can develop rules for greater reliability as long as it doesn't lower reliability for neighboring states. FERC can enforce penalties for entities not complying with reliability standards, potentially improving coordination between market and reliability functions. The Secretary of Energy conducts a study on electric transmission congestion every three years and may designate congested areas for FERC to issue construction permits. Under new Section 216(d) of the Federal Power Act, affected states, federal agencies, Indian tribes, property owners, and other parties can provide input on proposed construction permits. Permit holders can petition in U.S. District Court for rights-of-way through eminent domain. Just compensation is due for any takings of private property. It is unclear if property owners would need to reimburse compensation if rights-of-way are transferred back to them. Applicants seeking federal authorization for transmission facilities on federal lands can request the Department of Energy to coordinate environmental reviews. The Department of Energy has new authority under FPA Section 216(h) to prepare environmental documents and make decisions on rights-of-way and siting on federal lands. Reviews under Section 503 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act can be streamlined by using prior analyses. If a federal agency denies authorization for a facility, the denial can be appealed to the President. The President can issue a decision within 90 days of an appeal's filing for denied facility authorization. States can form compacts for transmission facility siting with congressional approval. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas is exempt. The Western Area Power Administration and Southwestern Power Administration can own or participate in transmission facilities in designated areas for reducing congestion or meeting demand. The project is required to be consistent with the needs identified by the appropriate Regional Transmission Organization or Independent System Operator. The Secretary of Energy, through WAPA and/or SWPA, may design, develop, construct, operate, maintain, or own an electric power transmission facility in the region. No more than $100 million from third-party financing may be used during fiscal years 2006 through 2015. FERC is directed to encourage deployment of advanced transmission technologies and establish an Advanced Power System Technology Incentive Program. An Incentive Program is established to provide payments to owners or operators of advanced power generation systems, with additional payments for qualifying security facilities. Eligible systems include fuel cells, turbines, or hybrid power systems. An annual appropriation of $10 million is authorized for FY2006 through FY2012. FERC is authorized to require unregulated transmitting utilities to provide open nondiscriminatory access. FERC can require unregulated transmitting utilities to charge rates comparable to what they charge themselves and have sales terms similar to other utilities. Exemptions are in place for utilities selling less than 4 million megawatt-hours annually, distribution utilities, and those with transmission facilities not essential for a nationwide interconnected system. These exemptions can be revoked for system reliability. FERC cannot mandate action by states or municipalities. FERC can require unregulated transmitting utilities to charge comparable rates and have sales terms similar to other utilities. Exemptions exist for utilities selling less than 4 million megawatt-hours annually, distribution utilities, and those with non-essential transmission facilities. FERC is not authorized to order states or municipalities to take action if it constitutes private use under the Internal Revenue Code. FERC may remand transmission rates to unregulated utilities if they do not comply. Federal utilities are allowed to participate in regional transmission organizations. The Federal Power Act is amended to clarify that load-serving entities can use their transmission facilities to serve existing customers before making capacity available for other uses. FERC cannot change approved transmission rights allocations by RTOs or ISOs before January 1, 2005. Government entities with transmission facilities supporting water pumping are protected, similar to load-serving entities. This does not apply to ERCOT but does apply to entities in the Tennessee Valley Authority service area. FERC must issue a rule on long-term transmission rights within a year. FERC is required to issue a rule on long-term transmission rights and organized markets within one year of enactment. The Federal Power Act gives FERC jurisdiction over the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and prohibits utilities from granting undue preference. The new language clarifies that reserving transmission for existing customers is not unduly discriminatory. The Secretary of Energy must issue an annual report on economic dispatch to Congress and states. \"Economic dispatch is the operation of generation facilities to produce energy at the lowest cost for consumers, with FERC lacking authority to require utilities in the Pacific Northwest to convert transmission rights. Congress suggests FERC consider state objections to a proposed capacity mechanism in New England.\" The objections to a proposed locational installed capacity mechanism in New England include concerns about reliability and high costs for consumers. FERC is required to establish incentive-based transmission rates to promote reliable and economically efficient electric transmission and generation. FERC is directed to implement incentive rate-making for utilities that join a Regional Transmission Organization and may approve a participant funding plan for new transmission or generator interconnection. States must consider implementing net metering standards within two years of enactment. Net metering service allows electric consumers to use energy generated on-site to offset energy provided by the utility. States must also consider implementing plans to minimize fuel source dependence and increase fossil fuel generation efficiency. Smart Metering standards must be decided upon within 18 months if not already implemented. The Secretary of Energy must issue a decision within 18 months on implementing time-based rate schedules for electric utility customers. This amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 and requires consumer education on advanced metering technologies. Technical assistance will be provided to regional organizations for demand response programs. FERC is directed to issue annual reports on demand assessment by region. The new section repeals the mandatory purchase requirement under Section 210 of PURPA for new contracts if FERC determines a competitive electricity market exists. Qualifying facilities must have access to independently administered wholesale markets and transmission services provided by a FERC-approved entity. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) was enacted in response to the oil embargoes of the 1970s to ensure non-discriminatory treatment for all customers. It required utilities to purchase power from outside sources at avoided costs to promote more efficient electricity generation and fair rates for consumers. The Fuel Use Act of 1978 (FUA) also supported qualifying facilities (QFs) by restricting utilities from using natural gas for new generating facilities. The Fuel Use Act of 1978 (FUA) restricted utilities from using natural gas for new generating facilities, allowing non-utilities to enter the electricity generation business. This led to the development of new generating technology and lowered the financial threshold for new plants. FUA was repealed in 1987, but by then, non-utility generators had gained a portion of the electricity supply, challenging cost-based rates for wholesale transactions. FERC began approving wholesale transactions based on competitive bidding processes to address this shift. The enactment of PURPA in 1978 led to market-based rates for wholesale transactions, marking a shift towards a market-oriented approach to electricity supply. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) further increased competition by removing regulatory barriers for entry into electricity generation. However, EPACT did not allow FERC to mandate retail wheeling or retail competition, which remains under state jurisdiction. PURPA and EPACT shifted regulatory responsibilities to the federal government. The repeal of PURPA's Section 210 shifted regulatory responsibilities to the federal government, creating new options for utilities and regulators. Investor-owned utilities in the Northeast and California supported the repeal, arguing that PURPA's mandatory purchase obligation was outdated and anticompetitive. Opponents, including independent power producers and environmental groups, disagreed with the repeal. Supporters of PURPA argued that the law introduced competition in the electric generating sector and promoted the use of cleaner fuels. They believed that repealing PURPA would decrease competition, hinder renewable energy development, and give more control to utility monopolies. State regulators were concerned about losing jurisdiction if Section 210 was repealed. Nonregulated utilities must establish an interconnection standard for on-site generating facilities following IEEE Standard 1547. The consideration of this standard should begin within one year of enactment and be completed within two years. This section is cited as the \"Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005\" and defines terms such as affiliate, commission, electric utility company, and holding company. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA) is repealed, which regulated holding companies of investor-owned utilities and required SEC approval for mergers and diversification proposals. Holding companies were prohibited if more than twice removed from operating subsidiaries. SEC regulated loans in intercompany transactions and required approval for issuing securities. Exemption from PUHCA was possible if business operations were within the holding company and its subsidiaries. The electric utility industry has historically been considered a natural monopoly due to factors such as declining long-term costs, high investment thresholds, and technological limitations on entrants. Most people are served by vertically integrated, investor-owned utilities. However, there is a growing belief that market forces can replace some traditional economic regulations in the industry. Recent changes in electric utility regulation have allowed independent firms to provide additional generating capacity, reducing the necessity of vertical integration. The Public Utility Holding Company Act and the Federal Power Act of 1935 established a regulatory regime that required utilities to provide electricity at regulated rates in exchange for exclusive franchise service territories. State regulatory commissions oversee intrastate operations. State regulatory commissions oversee intrastate utility activities, including wholesale and retail rate-making. The essential mission of state regulators is to establish retail electric prices through an adversarial hearing process, determining the revenue requirement distribution among customer classes. Federal economic regulation addresses wholesale electricity under the Federal Power Act. Under the Federal Power Act (FPA), federal economic regulation focuses on wholesale transactions and rates for electric power in interstate commerce. FERC has key functions at the federal level for regulating the electric utility industry, including wholesale rate regulation, transmission of retail electricity, and ensuring reliable service. The regulation aims to prevent abusive practices and supplement state regulation. The electric utility industry has undergone significant transformation in the past two decades, with a shift towards smaller, more cost-effective generating facilities. This change has been driven by improved technologies and reduced regulatory barriers, allowing nonutility entities to enter the market profitably. Electric utilities have advocated for changes to PUHCA to further diversify their assets and allow holding companies to acquire securities. Electric utilities sought changes to PUHCA to diversify assets, arguing it would improve risk profiles and resource utilization. State regulators expressed concerns about potential abuses like cross-subsidization. Increased diversification could lead to abuses, such as cross-subsidization where a regulated company subsidizes an unregulated affiliate. This practice was a major concern against exempt wholesale generators (EWGs) and resurfaced as an argument against further PUHCA changes. Nonutility ventures resulting from diversification by electric and gas companies could benefit from regulated utilities' allowed rate of return, contributing to the financial health of a holding company. However, unsuccessful ventures could harm the entire holding company, including utility subsidiaries. Critics feared that utilities would not face consequences for failure, as they could increase retail rates. Consumer and environmental groups, along with state legislators, expressed concerns about the repeal of PUHCA. Groups and state legislators have concerns about the PUHCA repeal, arguing that it could worsen market power abuses in a monopolistic industry. Federal Access to Books and Records (Sec.1264) requires holding companies to provide FERC with relevant affiliate transaction records to protect ratepayers. Confidentiality of these records is mandated. Registered holding companies and subsidiaries must preserve necessary documents for investor and consumer protection. State access is also addressed. State Access to Books and Records (Sec. 1265) allows state commissions to request access to specific books and records from holding companies or associate companies. Compliance with this request is mandatory, and safeguards must be in place to protect trade secrets and sensitive information. Enforcement can be pursued in U.S. District Court. This section does not apply to entities solely classified as holding companies due to ownership of qualifying facilities. Before this provision, the Federal Power Act granted state commissions the authority to examine various records of electric utility companies and holding companies. FERC is directed to exempt qualifying facilities, exempt wholesale generators, and foreign utilities from federal access to books and records provision. FERC is also required to exempt records not relevant to jurisdictional rates of public utilities or natural gas companies. FERC retains authority to prevent cross-subsidization in affiliate transactions. FERC retains authority to prevent cross-subsidization in affiliate transactions and ensure just and reasonable jurisdictional rates. The new energy law allows FERC and state commissions to determine if associate company activities can be recovered in rates. The subtitle does not apply to the U.S. government, states, or foreign governmental authorities operating outside the U.S. FERC or state commissions can still enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act. The Securities and Exchange Commission had authority to enforce provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 before the enactment of the Federal Power Act. Savings provisions allow individuals to continue legal activities authorized before the act. FERC retains authority under the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act. Tax treatment for stock exchanges under the Internal Revenue Service Code is unaffected by the repeal of PUHCA. FERC must implement regulations within four months of enactment. The Securities and Exchange Commission is required to transfer all applicable books and records to FERC. This subtitle will take effect six months after enactment, excluding section 1265. Any FERC rule-making prior to the effective date will not subject public utility companies to regulatory requirements under PUHCA. The FERC requirements do not subject companies to regulatory requirements under PUHCA. FERC must review and authorize cost allocations for nonpower goods or services provided by an associate company. FERC is required to issue rules within four months to exempt companies operating mainly in a single state. Necessary funds are authorized for carrying out this subtitle. Amendments are made to the Federal Power Act to reflect changes to the Public Utility Holding Company. The Federal Power Act is amended to reflect changes to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. FERC is directed to facilitate price transparency in wholesale electric markets by providing timely information on availability and prices of wholesale electric energy and transmission service to various stakeholders. FERC may establish an electronic information system if existing price information is inadequate, with exemptions for information that could harm market operation or system security. Within 180 days, FERC must enter into a memorandum of understanding. The Federal Power Act is amended to prohibit entities from reporting false information related to electricity prices or transmission capacity to federal agencies. Entities with minimal market presence are exempt from reporting requirements. FERC must coordinate with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission within 180 days. No civil penalties for violations occurring more than three years before notice of proposed penalty, except for fraudulent market manipulation activities. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas is excluded from this section. Existing mail and wire fraud laws apply to schemes to defraud or obtain money by false pretenses. Market manipulation in the purchase or sale of electric energy or transmission services is expressly prohibited under the Federal Power Act. The Federal Power Act is amended to allow electric utilities to file complaints with FERC and to increase criminal and civil penalties for violations. Criminal penalties may not exceed $1 million and/or five years' imprisonment, with a fine of $25,000. Civil penalties may be up to $1 million per day for violations. Before the new energy law, criminal penalties were limited to $5,000 and/or two years' imprisonment, with an additional fine of $500. Civil penalties were limited to $10,000 per day per violation. The Federal Power Act is amended to allow FERC to issue refunds for complaints filed by electric utilities within five months. FERC has authority over short-term electricity sales lasting 31 days or less, excluding electric cooperatives and entities selling less than 8 million megawatt-hours per year. The Federal Power Act grants FERC refund authority for short-term electricity sales and allows FERC to order refunds for unjust rates. The FTC can prohibit slamming and cramming by electric utilities. The Commission can defer to state regulations if they offer equal or better protection. Courts can ban individuals who violate the Federal Power Act from holding positions in electric utilities or trading energy. FERC now has approval authority for mergers and acquisitions exceeding $10 million, with notice given to state commissions and governors. FERC must approve acquisitions and mergers under its jurisdiction after giving notice to state commissions and governors. If FERC does not act within 180 days, the application is deemed granted. This section takes effect six months after enactment. The section addresses relief for extraordinary violations in wholesale electricity contracts within the Western Interconnection prior to June 20, 2001, where FERC has found manipulation of the market leading to unjust rates. It allows FERC to determine the lawfulness of termination payments for undelivered power in pending cases. Definitions for electric utility, transmitting utility, electric cooperative, regional transmission organization, and independent system operator are amended or added under the Federal Power Act. The Power Act amends Section 201(f) of the Federal Power Act to exempt certain electric cooperatives from FERC rate regulation. It also directs FERC to convene regional boards to study \"security constrained economic dispatch.\" The Power Act amends the Federal Power Act to exempt electric cooperatives from FERC rate regulation and directs FERC to convene regional boards to study \"security constrained economic dispatch.\" Additionally, the Act requires the Secretary of Energy to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to assess the impact of electrical contaminants on energy production systems, and FERC to investigate unjust charges incurred by California during the 2000-2001 electricity crisis. The Power Act directs FERC to study \"security constrained economic dispatch\" and exempts electric cooperatives from FERC rate regulation. The Secretary of Energy must assess the impact of electrical contaminants on energy production systems. FERC is also tasked with investigating unjust charges incurred by California during the 2000-2001 electricity crisis. Additionally, a report on FERC's actions and timetable for further actions will be submitted to Congress by December 31, 2005. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with states, will study economic dispatch and issue annual reports to Congress and states. Transmission System Monitoring will be studied by the Secretary of Energy and FERC to provide real-time transmission line operating status to transmission system owners and Regional Transmission Organizations."
