    "content": "Trends in U.S. foreign assistance to Latin America have mirrored global aid programs. Assistance increased in the 1960s under President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress to counter Soviet and Cuban influence. In the 1980s, focus shifted to Central America to support friendly governments against leftist insurgencies. Post-1989 interventions in Panama and Nicaragua led to increased U.S. aid to these countries. Since the 1980s, U.S. assistance to Central America and Nicaragua increased substantially. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, U.S. concerns about communist influence lessened, leading to a decrease in assistance levels. Since 2000, U.S. aid has focused on counter-narcotics activities, particularly in the Andean region. Assistance levels have not reached those of the Alliance for Progress, with FY2007 showing the lowest levels in over four decades. Haiti and Guyana are benefiting from new Presidential foreign aid initiatives. The U.S. has increased assistance for HIV/AIDS programs in Haiti and Guyana, while Nicaragua and Honduras have signed Millennium Challenge Compacts. President Bush has identified U.S. support for development as a key pillar of the National Security Strategy. USAID outlines five challenges for U.S. assistance programs, including promoting development and addressing security threats like terrorism and global criminal networks. The focus has shifted to strengthening weak states to combat terrorism and criminal activities. U.S. assistance levels for Latin America and the Caribbean in FY2007 show a decrease compared to previous years, with a significant reduction in Development Assistance but an increase in Economic Support Funds. In FY2007, U.S. foreign assistance for Latin America and the Caribbean shows a decrease in Development Assistance but an increase in Economic Support Funds. Nicaragua and Honduras have signed compacts with the Millennium Challenge Corporation worth $175 million and $215 million respectively over five years. These two countries would also see the largest cuts in Development Assistance in the FY2007 budget request. The table excludes some assistance like Peace Corps and P.L. 480 food aid. Congress uses Foreign Operations Appropriations bills to fund foreign assistance programs. The last comprehensive foreign assistance authorization bill was in 1985. For FY2006, Congress provided $20.9 billion out of the President's $22.8 billion request. The increase in the budget was mainly due to the Millennium Challenge Account and the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative. The MCA links U.S. assistance with good governance and performance measures of recipient nations. In FY2006, U.S. foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean is estimated at $1.68 billion, with the largest portion allocated to Andean countries. Other regions receive varying amounts, with Brazil and the Southern Cone receiving the least. Additionally, the U.S. maintains regional aid programs such as trade capacity building and migration assistance totaling $133 million. In FY2006, U.S. foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean totaled $1.68 billion, with the Andean region receiving the largest portion. The budget request for FY2007 is $1.63 billion, with the Andes receiving 56% of the total. The largest recipients of U.S. foreign assistance in South America are Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru, where most of the world's cocaine originates. The Andean countries of Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru receive significant U.S. assistance through various programs like the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) and military aid. Other countries in the region also receive some funding, but to a lesser extent. U.S. assistance to the Andean region in FY2006 was $919 million, with a request of $927 million for FY2007. The Andean region, spanning from Peru's Pacific coastline to the Amazonian basin, has large indigenous communities, high poverty levels, and a history of political unrest. U.S. assistance has focused on narcotics trafficking since 2000, with significant funding allocated for programs like PlanColombia and the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia receive economic assistance funds, with the Peace Corps maintaining programs in several countries. The Peace Corps maintains programs in Bolivia, Ecuador, Panama, and Peru. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) is a key U.S. policy in the region to curb narcotics production and trafficking, promote democracy and economic development, and strengthen regional security. Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia are major cocaine producers, with Colombia also exporting high-quality heroin to the United States. Leftist guerrilla organizations and a rightist paramilitary group in Colombia profit from the drug trade. The FARC, ELN, and AUC are designated as foreign terrorist organizations by the State Department. The US has committed significant funds to help Colombia fight drug trafficking, with $5 billion provided from FY2000 through FY2006 in ACI funds. Congress granted expanded authority to use counternarcotics funds for a unified campaign against drug trafficking and terrorist organizations in Colombia. ACI funding for FY2006 is estimated at $727.2 million, with most of the request for programs in Colombia. In FY2006, ACI funding is estimated at $727.2 million, with the majority allocated to programs in Colombia, the largest producer of cocaine. Peru and Bolivia are also major recipients, with Ecuador, Brazil, Venezuela, and Panama receiving smaller amounts. The Andean region is set to receive an estimated $91 million in Foreign Military Financing funds in FY2006, primarily for Colombia. For FY2007, the Administration proposes spending a total of $721.5 million on the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI), with Colombia receiving the same amount as the previous year. Neighboring countries would receive cuts, with Bolivia getting $66 million, Peru $98.5 million, Brazil $4 million, Ecuador $17.3 million, Venezuela $1 million, and Panama $4 million. Other programs include Non-proliferation, Anti-terrorism, De-mining, and Related Programs (NADR) and Peace Corps. The Administration proposes spending $721.5 million on the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) for FY2007. Colombia would receive the same amount as the previous year, while neighboring countries would see cuts in funding. Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay are considered middle-income countries and are estimated to receive nearly $36 million in FY2006. Most of the funding goes to Brazil for Development Assistance and Child Survival and Health, and Paraguay for various programs. Peace Corps maintains a program in Paraguay. Brazil receives ACI funding due to its long border with Colombia. Brazil receives ACI funding due to its long border with Colombia, focusing on sustainable economic growth, poverty alleviation, and health issues like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Environmental degradation, especially in the Amazon region, is a concern. Paraguay, the second largest aid recipient, faces stagnant growth and high external debt. U.S. assistance in the region targets economic growth, reproductive health, environment, and democracy. Mexico, a middle-income nation with a strong bilateral relationship with the United States, has not traditionally received U.S. foreign assistance. Trade ties with the U.S. strengthened after NAFTA came into effect in 1994. Promises of increased cooperation between the two countries followed the election of new administrations in 2000. The U.S. increased foreign aid to Mexico from $31 million in FY2001 to nearly $74 million in FY2005, primarily for counter-narcotics efforts. Funding for INL rose from $12 million in FY2003 to close to $40 million in FY2005 and has remained steady since then. Mexico also receives some IMET funds for military training and economic assistance for growth and governance. In FY2006, Mexico received $40 million in counter-narcotics funding, exceeding the $30 million initially slated. The FY2007 request for counter-narcotics funding is $39 million. Mexico ratified its membership of the International Criminal Court in October 2005, leading to a suspension of IMET funds under the ASPA and ESF funds under the Nethercutt Amendment. Mexico received $1.3 million in IMET funding in FY2005 but was only slated to receive $50,000 in FY2006, with a request of $45,000 for FY2007. Mexico could potentially lose IMET funding in FY2006 and the FY2007 request of $45,000, as well as FMF funding of $2.5 million in FY2006. Additionally, $9 million in ESF funds for FY2006 and FY2007 are at risk. Central America consists of seven countries, with Panama and Belize receiving small amounts of U.S. aid. Belize is considered a Caribbean nation, while Panama has strong economic ties with the U.S. due to the Panama Canal. Costa Rica has stable democracy and higher income compared to Nicaragua. Central American countries are recovering from civil war and facing poverty and crime. Trade with the US is crucial, expected to increase with DR-CAFTA. $20 million was allocated in FY2005 and $40 million in FY2006 for trade capacity building. In FY2006, Congress allocated $40 million for trade capacity building in Central America, with $20 million from ESF and $20 million from DA funds. The Central America Regional program focused on trade integration, democracy, immigration, organized crime, and drug trafficking. Major recipients of U.S. foreign assistance in Central America include El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua for economic growth and democracy programs. FY2007 funding for these countries would decrease by 9% from FY2006. In FY2006, American countries saw a 9% decline in funding, with the largest cuts in Development Assistance. Central American countries received $90.6 million in FY2006, but the Administration requested only $66.2 million for FY2007. Funding would be shifted to the Economic Support Fund for trade capacity building. ESF funds for Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Panama in FY2006 totaled $8.8 million, while the FY2007 request includes $26 million for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. These countries also receive between $7 million and $12 million in Child Survival and Health funds for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. In 2004, Honduras and Nicaragua qualified for debt relief under the HIPC initiative. They received grants from the Millennium Challenge Corporation for rural development and road construction. El Salvador also became eligible for MCA funds in FY2006. Despite being additional to traditional aid programs, countries with MCC Compacts faced cuts in DA and CSH funds in the FY2007 request. The United States provides various forms of military and economic assistance to countries in Central America. El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama receive Foreign Military Financing (FMF) funding. Guatemala had withheld Military Assistance Program (MAP) funds released in 2005 due to human rights concerns. El Salvador is the only Latin American country with troops in Iraq and hosts a counter-narcotics Cooperative Security Location. The FY2006 estimated provision of $9.9 million in Foreign Military Financing for El Salvador was higher than the $1.5 million allocated in FY2005. The FY2007 Administration request for FMF for El Salvador is $5.5 million. Costa Rica may face sanctions on military aid and ESF funds in FY2006 for not concluding an Article 98 agreement with the United States. Mexico and Central America's funding estimates for FY2006 and FY2007 are detailed in Table 4. The United States provides INL funding for Panama through the Andean Counterdrug Initiative account. The Caribbean region, with 16 nations and a diverse population, includes countries like Guyana, Suriname, and Belize. Over the past 25 years, the US has given significant foreign assistance to the Caribbean, with aid concentrated in Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. In the 1990s, U.S. assistance to Caribbean nations declined to about $2 billion, with Haiti receiving the largest share at $1.1 billion, Jamaica receiving $507 million, and the Dominican Republic receiving $352 million. Eastern Caribbean nations received about $178 million in assistance. The majority of U.S. aid was economic assistance, with military assistance amounting to less than $60 million during the 1990s. Since FY2000, U.S. aid to the Caribbean region has totaled almost $1.6 billion, with increased assistance for HIV/AIDS, disaster relief after hurricanes, and support for Haiti's interim government. Haiti received 51% of the assistance during this period, with economic aid being the main focus. In October 2004, Congress allocated $100 million in emergency aid for Caribbean nations, with significant amounts going to Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, and other affected countries. For FY2007, the Administration has requested about $321 million in assistance for the Caribbean, with almost 62% of the total for Haiti, $35 million for the Dominican Republic, $31 million for Guyana, and almost $17 million for Jamaica. Assistance to the small nations of the Eastern Caribbean is provided through USAID's Caribbean Regional program, with the Administration requesting $11.6 million for the program in FY2007. The Eastern Caribbean would also receive military assistance and support for a Peace Corps presence, along with funding for the \"Third Border Initiative\" to improve travel in the region. The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Dominican Republic are focusing on improving travel, border security, disaster preparedness, and business competitiveness. A $4 million request for Operation Enduring Friendship would support maritime security in several countries. Some Caribbean nations are potential recipients for Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) assistance, with Guyana designated as a threshold country for future MCA funding. Haiti and Guyana were potentially eligible for MCA funds in FY2004, but were not approved to participate. In FY2005 and FY2006, Haiti may struggle to meet MCA criteria for funding. The income threshold for MCA eligibility increased to $3,255 or below, potentially making the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Suriname eligible. The US has been providing assistance to promote democracy, human rights, and free enterprise in Cuba through USAID programs funded by Economic assistance. Funding for Cuba's human rights activists is largely supported by Economic Support Funds (ESF), totaling $6 million in FY2003, $21.4 million in FY2004, $9 million in FY2005, and an estimated $10.9 million in FY2006. The FY2007 request is for $9 million in ESF to implement recommendations for a Free Cuba. The assistance aims to undermine the Castro regime and hasten its end, supporting democracy and human rights programs. The US provides funding for Cuba's human rights activists through Economic Support Funds (ESF), with amounts increasing over the years. Key groups targeted for assistance include women, Afro-Cubans, and youth, as well as libraries, labor organizations, and other non-governmental organizations. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) also funds projects in Cuba, with grants supporting various initiatives for democracy and human rights. After political discord and violence, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide resigned in February 2004, leading to the establishment of an interim government in Haiti. An international force, including U.S. Marines, French, and Canadian forces, was authorized by the United Nations to restore order. The U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) was then deployed in June 2004 to secure a stable environment and advance the rule of law. New elections were held in February 2006, with former president Rene Preval declared the winner after protests by his supporters. U.S. foreign aid to Haiti increased significantly during this period. U.S. foreign aid to Haiti increased significantly in support of the interim Haitian government, rising from about $72 million in FY2003 to $183 million in FY2005. Assistance included funds for combating HIV/AIDS under the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative account. The FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act provided Haiti with a total of $194 million in assistance, with additional funding for HIV/AIDS programs in subsequent years. The United States provides assistance to the Caribbean through various programs, including Operation Enduring Friendship in Panama. The Latin America and Caribbean program offers funds for Child Survival and Health, Development Assistance, and Economic Support for justice and health-related programs. Anti-Terrorism funding in the Western Hemisphere focuses mainly on Colombia. Anti-Terrorism funding in the Western Hemisphere focuses on Colombia and the tri-border region of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. INCLE funding is also provided for drug transit zones in Central America and the Caribbean. Congressional debate on foreign aid effectiveness often centers on poverty reduction and promoting U.S. interests abroad. Critics argue aid is wasted on countries not using it responsibly, while proponents emphasize the importance of consistent development implementation for long-term results. Development is a long term process that must be consistently implemented to see results. Recent studies have shown a lack of progress in reducing global poverty, questioning the correlation between development assistance and program success. Some argue that U.S. assistance does not contribute as much to sustainable economic growth as trade. Reasons for this perceived lack of success include aid programs having objectives other than development, such as national security or human rights, and the extent of corruption in societies with little transparency. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) aims to address these concerns by linking assistance to good governance and sound economic policy criteria. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) aims to reform foreign aid programs by rewarding good performers based on governance and economic policy criteria. Critics are concerned about resource fragmentation and lack of coordination with traditional aid programs. Secretary Rice announced a new position to better coordinate aid programs government-wide, sparking debate on its effectiveness and ambition. Some observers believe foreign aid reforms are not ambitious enough and advocate for a complete restructuring, which would require legislation. Policymakers are concerned about U.S. policy opposing the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. Countries not signing Article 98 agreements with the U.S. face a cutoff of military assistance. The American Services Members Protection Act of 2002, incorporated in H.R. 4775, allows the President to waive the law in the national interest. Colombia has signed an agreement, while other countries like Bolivia, Brazil, and Mexico could see their assistance withheld. The AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean and Central America poses a threat to economic and social development due to increasing infection rates primarily through heterosexual contact. The AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean and Central America, primarily through heterosexual contact, affects the general population. Countries with high prevalence rates include Haiti, the Bahamas, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Belize, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Suriname, Honduras, and Guatemala. The response involves support from governments, bilateral donors, regional organizations, and NGOs, with funding from the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and the Global Fund. USAID has been leading the fight against HIV/AIDS in Central America and the Caribbean since 1986. Funding for HIV/AIDS projects in the region increased significantly from $11.2 million in FY2000 to an estimated $92.7 million in FY2006. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) included Guyana and Haiti as focus countries, leading to a rise in U.S. assistance to the region. In FY2007, the Administration requested $113 million for HIV/AIDS programs in Central America and the Caribbean. In the 109th Congress, legislative initiatives included adding 14 Caribbean countries to the list of focus countries for increased HIV/AIDS assistance. Other actions authorized assistance for vulnerable children in developing countries, including the Caribbean. Pending initiatives aim to establish pediatric centers in developing countries for HIV/AIDS treatment and care. The MCA initiative differs from traditional USAID programs by linking funding to performance and results, allowing countries to lead development projects, and focusing exclusively on development goals without considering other U.S. foreign policy objectives. Some concerns have been raised that funding for traditional assistance programs could be cut to accommodate increased funding for MCA. The Administration has stated that it does not intend for the MCA to negatively affect its other development programs. Funding for DA and some health programs under CSH have declined, with development assistance in Latin America proposed for FY2007 at 28% less than in FY2006. CSH would also decline by 9%. The countries most affected by these proposed cuts are in Central America, with limitations on countries eligible for MCA grants based on income levels. Low-middle income countries can compete for MCA grants, but are limited to receiving 24% of the total amount appropriated. Eligibility is based on income level, political rights, and civil liberties criteria. Performance indicators are categorized into ruling justly, investing in people, and economic freedom, with measurements from various organizations. Around 115 countries may be eligible, but only 20 to 30 are expected to qualify for grants. Threshold assistance is available for countries showing commitment to meeting eligibility requirements. Guyana and Paraguay have been invited to participate. Congress passed P.L. 108-199 (Division D) to create the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) with an initial funding of $994 million. MCC funding for FY2005 and FY2006 was $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion respectively, with a $3 billion request for FY2007. Latin American countries eligible for MCC assistance include Bolivia, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Bolivia, Honduras, and Nicaragua were approved to participate in the program. Honduras and Nicaragua were approved to participate in the MCC program in 2004, with compacts signed for $215 million and $175 million respectively. Paraguay is a 'threshold' country receiving $37 million for anti-corruption and rule of law programs. Additional Latin American countries that could qualify for MCC assistance include Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Jamaica, Peru, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and Suriname. El Salvador was named an eligible \"lower middle income\" country in 2005. U.S. attention to terrorism in Latin America increased after the 9/11 attacks, leading to enhanced bilateral and regional cooperation. The State Department's annual report on worldwide terrorism highlights threats in Colombia, Peru, and the tri-border region of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. The United States has provided Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) training and equipment to Latin American countries to improve capabilities in airport security, hostage negotiations, bomb detection, and countering terrorism financing. Cuba has been listed as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1982. In FY2005, $7.9 million in ATA was provided for the Western Hemisphere, with $5.1 million for training anti-kidnapping units in Colombia and $0.5 million for the tri-border area of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. For FY2006, an estimated $12.3 million in ATA will be provided for the Western Hemisphere, with $5.3 million for Colombia and $1.5 million for the Bahamas. The FY2007 Western Hemisphere request is $11.9 million, with $3.1 million for Colombia, $2.8 million for Trinidad and Tobago, and $1.4 million for Jamaica. Additionally, Latin American countries would receive assistance in FY2007 under NADR's EXBS program to strengthen export and border control systems. In FY2007, $865,000 is requested for Western Hemisphere NADR/EXBS funding to prevent weapons proliferation. Latin American nations also received assistance for counterterrorism financing and small arms destruction. Economic aid is administered by USAID to address poverty, HIV/AIDS, environment, and humanitarian relief. The U.S. policy towards Latin America focuses on strengthening democracy, encouraging development, and enhancing security. Transformational development programs in the region are funded through various accounts, including Child Survival and Health (CSH), Development Assistance (DA), and Economic Support Funds (ESF). CSH funds combat infectious diseases and promote maternal and child health, while the FY2006 request for Latin America reflected a 12.7% decrease in funding. The FY2006 request for Latin America saw a 12.7% decrease in funding, with traditional CSH programs being cut in favor of new initiatives like PEPFAR. The Administration estimates spending $140.9 million in the Western Hemisphere for FY2006, with a further reduction to $128 million in FY2007. CSH funded HIV/AIDS programs focus on prevention, care, and treatment efforts, specifically targeting children affected by AIDS and integrating into the PEPFAR policy framework. Child survival and maternal health programs aim to reduce child deaths and save women in childbirth. The Administration requested $223.8 million for Latin America out of a total FY2006 request of $1.1 billion, an 8% decrease from the FY2005 estimated allocation of $255.5 million. For FY2006, Congress appropriated $1.524 billion for worldwide programs, but did not earmark DA funds by country or region. The Administration estimates spending $254.4 million in FY2006. The Administration estimates spending $254.4 million in FY2006 in the Western Hemisphere. Congress allocated $20 million in DA funds for labor and environment capacity building programs for CAFTA-DR countries. For FY2007, the Administration requested $181.9 million for Latin America, a 28% decrease from the previous year. DA supports the Opportunity Alliance for Central America, focusing on regional integration and economic recovery from natural disasters and declining coffee prices. Trade capacity-building initiatives were undertaken before the negotiation of CAFTA. The Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) promotes non-traditional agricultural exports and niche markets. USAID manages initiatives for sustainable development, natural resource management, clean water access, anti-corruption, and democracy strengthening in Latin America. Justice sector modernization and anti-corruption programs are also in progress. The Administration requested funding for Transition Initiatives (TI) in FY2006, with Haiti receiving $30 million out of the $325 million requested. The program aims to support stabilization, reform, and post-conflict reconstruction in fragile states. In FY2005, $25 million was spent in Haiti, and $8.9 million in FY2004. Congress allocated $40 million to the TI account in FY2006. For FY2007, the Administration requested $50 million. Economic Support Funds are provided through the ESF program to countries of strategic interest, managed by the State Department and USAID. Israel and Egypt are among the recipients. The ESF program, managed by USAID and the State Department, provides aid to countries like Israel, Egypt, and 11 Latin American countries including Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru. In FY2006, $120.8 million was allocated to Latin America, with a request for $152.1 million in FY2007. Assistance in the Andean region, Mexico, and Central America focuses on justice sector reform, free trade agreements, governance, anti-corruption efforts, and human rights promotion.
