The Department of Energy submitted a license application for the repository to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2008, with plans to start shipping nuclear waste there by 2020. Despite controversy and opposition from Nevada, the proposed Yucca Mountain repository has maintained congressional support. President Obama and Vice President Biden do not support Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste storage site and will seek alternative solutions based on scientific analysis. They plan to ensure that waste at current reactor sites is safely contained in the meantime. The Obama-Biden campaign opposes Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste storage site and aims to find alternative long-term disposal solutions. If Yucca Mountain is rejected, a new repository site search may be necessary, potentially leading to a new organization handling the process. Developing a repository at a different location could also be a lengthy process. The U.S. nuclear waste policy has been based on the \"once through\" fuel cycle since the 1970s, but there is a debate on whether to switch to the \"closed\" fuel cycle. This alternative involves reprocessing spent nuclear fuel for advanced reactors or particle accelerators to reduce radioactive waste. The licensing of new nuclear power plants could be affected if a new repository site is needed, as developing one could take a long time. Previous efforts to establish interim central nuclear waste storage facilities have faced strong opposition. Reprocessing spent nuclear fuel for advanced reactors or accelerators could reduce radioactive waste by destroying long-lived components, leaving only short-lived isotopes that decay within 1,000 years. This could make it easier to site a permanent repository, but there are concerns about nuclear weapons proliferation. Legislation may be needed for a major change in the nuclear waste program, as current law designates Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate site for a high-level waste repository. The Obama Administration has the authority to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application. The report discusses options to delay or halt the development of a repository at Yucca Mountain, along with mid- and long-term alternatives to the existing waste program. DOE's latest schedules for nuclear waste shipments and projected costs provide a baseline for analyzing Yucca Mountain alternatives, despite significant delays in the planned opening of the repository. The DOE's current schedule for nuclear waste shipments to Yucca Mountain includes increasing amounts each year, reaching a planned maximum capacity of 3,000 metric tons in 2024. This could potentially lead to delays in developing a permanent repository, prompting policymakers to consider redirecting the nuclear waste program to interim storage options. The DOE's shipment schedule to Yucca Mountain would not start reducing the backlog of spent fuel until 2024. Commercial spent fuel stored at reactor sites was 57,700 metric tons in 2007, projected to reach 85,000 tons by 2023. Shipments would exceed reactor discharges by 1,000 tons/year after 2023. Shipments of all spent fuel from U.S. nuclear plants would continue until 2066, totaling 109,300 metric tons. Yucca Mountain would also receive 12,800 metric tons of defense-related spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. Yucca Mountain is projected to receive a total of 122,100 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The capacity is currently capped at 70,000 metric tons until a second repository is operational, but a recent DOE report suggests that Yucca Mountain could accommodate all existing and anticipated waste. Legislation to lift the capacity limit has been proposed but not acted upon. If the Yucca Mountain repository were to be halted, there is no backup plan for spent fuel management. The Nuclear Waste Fund, with a balance of about $20 billion at the end of FY2008, collects fees from nuclear power plant operators for spent fuel disposal services. Congress supplements annual appropriations for the DOE waste program from general revenues, as the program also handles defense-related waste. No backup plan exists for spent fuel management if the Yucca Mountain repository were to be halted. The Nuclear Waste Fund collects fees from nuclear power plant operators for spent fuel disposal services. Annual spending for the nuclear waste program at Yucca Mountain averages about $400 million, but funding would need to increase to nearly $2 billion during peak construction. Disposal of all anticipated waste at Yucca Mountain is projected to cost $96.18 billion. NWPA restricts fund use to disposal activities and research authorized by the act, specifically for Yucca Mountain repository and monitored retrievable storage facility. The DOE has missed deadlines for taking waste from reactor sites, leading to liabilities for storage costs. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims has ruled against DOE, with liabilities estimated to reach $11 billion by 2020 if shipments begin as planned. The Yucca Mountain repository is in the final approval stages under NWPA. The Yucca Mountain repository is in the final stages of approval under NWPA. If the Obama Administration opposes the site, options to stop the project include actions by the Secretary of Energy, the President, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as prescribed in NWPA sections 113-116. This includes determining site suitability, notifying Nevada, recommending approval to the President, and allowing Nevada to submit a notice of disapproval to Congress. State disapproval could block the repository unless Congress votes within 90 days. The Yucca Mountain repository has reached the final approval stages under NWPA. State disapproval could block the project unless Congress votes within 90 days. The Yucca Mountain license application has been docketed by NRC for consideration. The President has tools to affect the nuclear waste program, including the option for DOE to withdraw the license application, potentially ending the project permanently. The Yucca Mountain project could be ended by permanently withdrawing the license application, which may require reversing the presidential site designation. Congressional opponents have cut funding for the project, but DOE still submitted the license application. The Bush Administration requested $37.3 million for NRC's license review activities in FY2009. The Obama Administration's ability to reduce or eliminate Yucca Mountain funding would depend on its influence with Congress. Changes in the NRC Commission could affect the licensing process and outcome. The NRC Commissioners serve staggered five-year terms with a limit of three from the same party. Presidential appointments, including the Energy Secretary, could impact the Yucca Mountain project. Senator Reid vowed to block any Energy Secretary nominee supporting the site. The Energy Secretary could redirect the nuclear waste program or withdraw the license application. President Obama's Energy Secretary, Steven Chu, opposes Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste solution due to potential failures in waste canisters. However, Chu previously supported licensing the site in a 2008 nuclear policy statement. Lisa Jackson, the EPA Administrator, was confirmed in 2009 and plays a crucial role in Yucca Mountain's fate under the NWPA. Lisa Jackson, confirmed in 2009, oversees EPA's radiation protection standard for Yucca Mountain. The standard sets exposure limits of 15 millirems for the first 10,000 years and 100 millirems thereafter. Nevada challenges the higher limit after 10,000 years. Overturning the EPA standard could complicate Yucca Mountain's licensing. The Obama Administration may delay or suspend the project and conduct a major program review as suggested in their policy statement. The Obama-Biden campaign policy statement suggests conducting a major program review, which could be done by an interagency task force or an outside entity like the National Academy of Sciences. The review would cover management issues, research needs, foreign waste management experience, and policy options. The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board currently provides independent scientific reviews, but its role in a major policy review is uncertain. Halting or delaying the Yucca Mountain repository project could have significant impacts on the federal budget and proposed new nuclear power plants. The potential policy shift regarding the Yucca Mountain repository could have significant impacts on the federal budget, proposed new nuclear power plants, waste storage, and disposal of defense-related nuclear waste. Long-term isolation of nuclear waste is still necessary, even if Yucca Mountain is abandoned, requiring the eventual establishment of another repository site in the United States. Reprocessing and recycling of nuclear spent fuel can reduce but not eliminate the need for waste isolation. If development of the Yucca Mountain repository were delayed or halted, commercial spent fuel and defense-related nuclear waste would likely remain at on-site storage facilities longer than planned. Federal centralized interim storage has been proposed as a solution, but no facility has been developed yet. Private spent fuel storage facilities in Utah are also being considered as an alternative. Private spent fuel storage facility in Utah with limited capacity of 40,000 metric tons for 40 years. DOE liable for utilities' storage costs due to missed disposal deadline, facing potential damages of hundreds of millions annually. If disposal starts by 2020, $11 billion in liabilities projected over several decades. If disposal at Yucca Mountain begins by 2020, DOE projects $11 billion in liabilities by 2056. Abandoning the site without an alternative could lead to even higher court judgments. The nuclear industry warns of DOE defaulting on NWPA contracts, refunding fees, and paying extra storage costs. DOE has collected over $28 billion in fees by FY2008, growing at $1.5 billion annually. Court cases have raised the possibility of voiding contracts and returning payments to utilities. License applications for new reactors have been filed with NRC, with concerns over carbon dioxide controls and high natural gas prices prompting U.S. electric utilities to consider nuclear power. Delays in the DOE nuclear waste program could hinder licensing of proposed new reactors. NRC established a policy in 1977 regarding waste disposal confidence, with findings in 1984 assuring availability of a repository by 2007-2009 and safe storage at reactor sites for at least 30 years after shutdown. The NRC is proposing a revision to ensure a repository will be available within 50-60 years after a reactor's licensed operating life, with spent fuel safely stored for at least 60 years. Concerns arise if the Yucca Mountain project is canceled without an alternative plan. The Yucca Mountain project was canceled without an alternative plan in place, leading to concerns about nuclear waste disposal. Several states have laws linking new nuclear power plant approval to waste disposal capacity. State authority over nuclear power plant construction is limited to economic considerations, not safety. Public opposition to nuclear power often centers around the issue of nuclear waste disposal. Proposed new reactors without a clear waste removal plan could face increased public scrutiny. Proposed new reactors without a clear waste removal plan could face intensified public scrutiny, especially at sites without operating reactors. Defense-related nuclear waste, resulting from nuclear weapons production, could lead to legal consequences for DOE if repository development is delayed. This waste includes high-level radioactive materials from spent fuel reprocessing, totaling 12,800 metric tons primarily located at Hanford, WA, Savannah River, SC, and Idaho National Laboratory. States have authority to enforce waste disposal regulations. Without Yucca Mountain or an alternative repository plan, DOE faces challenges in disposing of waste stored at defense-related facilities. A lack of repository capacity could jeopardize agreements with states hosting these sites. DOE's SEIS indicates minimal environmental impact for 100 years if Yucca Mountain delays continue. Storage facilities must be maintained to prevent radioactive releases. Some environmental groups argue for extended on-site storage of nuclear waste to allow radioactivity to decay, reducing transportation risks. Waste may need to be moved twice if sent to an interim storage facility before a permanent repository. The environmental risks of surface storage increase over time due to the lack of an underground repository. Maintenance and security of surface storage facilities may eventually drop below adequate levels, leading to potential catastrophic consequences for human health within 10,000 years. Delays in finding a permanent disposal method could further increase these risks. The NWPA limits waste management options to Yucca Mountain or on-site storage. New legislation could allow for new repository sites, interim storage, reprocessing, and alternative disposal technologies. DOE has faced accusations of mismanagement since 1982. Legislation on nuclear waste siting is expected to be highly controversial. Since 1982, the DOE has faced accusations of mismanagement and political interference in scientific decisions regarding nuclear waste. Proposals have been made to transfer the nuclear waste program to an independent organization, such as the High Level Waste Authority, to improve efficiency and reduce political influence. Studies recommend establishing a government corporation to manage nuclear waste. The Partnership recommended the establishment of a government corporation to manage nuclear waste, with oversight from the nuclear industry and an independent board. Licensing and regulation by the NRC could remain unchanged. The existing funding system could be transferred to the new agency, but a new system might be needed for a private entity. The issue of whether a private entity should take permanent title to all nuclear waste is also a consideration. The nuclear industry argues for direct nuclear waste payments without congressional appropriation. Improving program management may not eliminate political controversy. Additional independent oversight or technical oversight by a non-federal agency like the Environmental Evaluation Group in New Mexico could enhance public confidence in DOE's decisions. The Environmental Evaluation Group (EEG) provided independent review of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) until 2004 when DOE stopped funding. Any alternative to the Yucca Mountain repository would likely result in longer on-site storage of nuclear waste. On-site storage of nuclear waste could be extended for decades with policy changes. Waste is stored in deep pools of water at reactor facilities for cooling and radiation shielding. Spent fuel can later be transferred to dry storage casks. Designating central interim surface storage facilities may be controversial. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) found in 2005 that spent fuel pools could be vulnerable to terrorist attacks, potentially causing a release of radioactive materials. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act for FY2006 included funding for the NRC to assess this issue. The FY2006 Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-103) allocated $21 million for the NRC to evaluate vulnerabilities identified by the NAS at reactor sites. There have been proposals to transfer responsibility for storing spent fuel from utilities to the DOE to reduce costs and liabilities. However, states with nuclear reactors and regulators oppose indefinite on-site storage, preferring permanent disposal or central interim storage. DOE lacks the authority under current law to establish a central storage facility. The DOE does not have the authority to develop a central interim nuclear waste storage facility other than the \"monitored retrievable storage\" facility authorized by the NWPA. Legislative efforts to establish central interim storage capacity without restrictions have been unsuccessful due to concerns that it could undermine support for a permanent repository. Central interim nuclear waste storage facilities use dry cask technology for above-ground storage of sealed waste canisters in concrete casks or bunkers. These modular systems can be quickly constructed at various geologically suitable sites. Public concern about long-term storage of highly radioactive waste has hindered central storage proposals. The DOE had planned an MRS facility near Oak Ridge, TN, as a receiving point for small waste shipments from plant sites. The 1987 NWPA amendments nullified the Oak Ridge selection for the MRS facility, establishing new siting procedures and restrictions. A voluntary siting procedure was also introduced, allowing agreements with states or tribes to host nuclear waste facilities under specific terms. Finding a voluntary site for central storage became DOE's best option to meet waste acceptance requirements by 1998. The DOE's central storage facility was seen as the best option to meet the NWPA's waste acceptance deadline. Feasibility study grants were provided to potential volunteers, mainly Indian tribes, but agreements with tribes faced opposition from states. Congress blocked grant funding in October 1993. Legislation was developed in the 104th Congress to authorize an interim surface storage facility at Yucca Mountain by 1998, ahead of the planned underground repository opening in 2010. The nuclear waste negotiator's authority expired in 1995 without any siting agreements reached. In 2010, a bill (H.R. 1020) proposed transporting nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain only after the repository was licensed to avoid potential transportation risks and costs. Similar bills in the 105th and 106th Congress were not enacted due to presidential veto threats. After rejecting proposals for interim storage at Yucca Mountain, language in appropriations bills required DOE to store commercial spent fuel at unspecified federal sites. The House and Senate proposed different plans for the storage of commercial spent fuel. The House wanted the DOE to move spent fuel to centralized interim storage at DOE sites in FY2006, while the Senate proposed allowing the Secretary of Energy to designate interim storage sites in FY2007. The Senate's proposal included designating storage sites in each state with a nuclear power plant or regional storage facilities. Another proposal focused on nine decommissioned reactor sites. The House Appropriations Committee included language in the FY2008 Energy and Water bill requiring DOE to develop a plan to take custody of spent fuel at nine decommissioned reactor sites. The resulting DOE report stated that all spent fuel at these sites could be shipped to a federal central storage facility by 2018, but DOE lacked the statutory authority to implement the plan. The DOE has stored core material from the Three Mile Island accident and Fort Saint Vrain reactor. It also stores highly enriched spent fuel from foreign research reactors. There is a debate on whether DOE has the authority to store larger amounts of commercial spent fuel under the Atomic Energy Act. The NRC licenses private-sector interim storage facilities for commercial nuclear waste under the Atomic Energy Act. A license was issued in 2006 for a central storage facility developed by Private Fuel Storage on the Skull Valley Indian reservation in Utah. The facility can store up to 40,000 metric tons of spent fuel in dry casks pending shipment to a permanent repository. The Private Fuel Storage facility on the Skull Valley Indian reservation in Utah was licensed by the NRC in 2006 to store 40,000 metric tons of spent fuel in dry casks. However, the project was blocked by the Department of the Interior due to concerns about the risk of waste remaining indefinitely and environmental issues with transportation routes. The Skull Valley Band of Goshutes and PFS filed a federal lawsuit alleging political pressure from the State of Utah influenced the decision. The Skull Valley Band of Goshutes and PFS filed a federal lawsuit in 2007 to overturn decisions blocking the PFS project, which aimed to provide a waste storage option for nuclear plants. The new Administration could reconsider the Interior Department's decisions, but the project would still face challenges, including a NRC license challenge from Utah. The PFS facility may not significantly reduce DOE's liabilities for spent fuel delays. The closed fuel cycle involves reprocessing spent fuel into new fuel, potentially reducing nuclear waste volume and postponing permanent disposal. However, it is more expensive than the once-through cycle and does not eliminate the need for a geologic repository. Despite increasing energy extraction from uranium, the separation of plutonium from spent fuel raises concerns due to its potential use in nuclear weapons. The closed fuel cycle involves reprocessing spent fuel into new fuel, reducing nuclear waste volume. Reprocessed uranium and plutonium can be recycled in existing reactors, but buildup of undesirable plutonium isotopes limits recycling potential. France. The buildup of undesirable plutonium isotopes limits further recycling in commercial reactors. Advanced reactors would be needed for multiple recycling of spent fuel, as part of the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership program. Options include recycling in existing reactors and high-burnup gas-cooled reactors, thorium and plutonium-fueled reactors, and \"fast\" reactors. A reprocessing and recycling system with sufficient capacity could treat existing spent fuel inventories and newly generated spent fuel for waste disposal. A recycling system for spent fuel aims to separate fission products for disposal and reuse uranium, plutonium, and other long-lived isotopes in reactors. This process could reduce nuclear waste in repositories within 1,000 years, save space, and address nonproliferation concerns. The GNEP program is researching reprocessing technology to prevent plutonium separation for weapons use. A potential benefit of reprocessing spent fuel is to provide an alternative destination if Yucca Mountain is abandoned. The US is still researching reprocessing technologies, so a US facility may not open before Yucca Mountain's target date. Earlier waste shipments could be possible through foreign reprocessing proposals. The Senate considered authorizing DOE to ship spent fuel to a reprocessing plant in England, but the provision was dropped from the final bill. The Senate passed a bill recommending U.S. spent fuel reprocessing overseas before a U.S. plant is operational. Considerations include using defense-related facilities and the amount of spent fuel to be shipped. Multiple reprocessing plants would be needed in the U.S. to handle the annual discharge from reactors. The implementation of a reprocessing and recycling strategy for spent nuclear fuel would take many decades, with projections indicating a fully operational system by 2070. Siting a permanent geologic repository for high-level nuclear waste has led to proposals for non-repository disposal options. The NWPA authorizes DOE to research such disposal methods. The NWPA authorizes DOE to research disposal alternatives, including launching waste into space or burying it in the deep seabed. A Subseabed Consortium was established in 1987 to develop research plans for subseabed disposal, but the office was abolished in 1996 due to lack of resources. Previous research on subseabed disposal was conducted by the Nuclear Energy Agency. The Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) conducted previous research on subseabed disposal of nuclear waste, concluding in 1988 that it could contain the waste well enough to pose insignificant risk to the deep sea environment. However, more research was deemed necessary to confirm safety. Subseabed disposal is currently prohibited under the 1996 Protocol to the 1972 London Dumping Convention. The 1996 Protocol to the 1972 London Dumping Convention expanded the definition of \"dumping\" to include storage of wastes in the seabed and subsoil from vessels or structures at sea. Parties must conduct scientific studies on sea disposal of radioactive material every 25 years. The DOE has also studied nuclear waste disposal in outer space. The report on space disposal of nuclear waste raised concerns about launch costs, safety, and waste re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. Alternative disposal methods like laser propulsion and electromagnetic rail guns were considered, but would require a major federal commitment for feasibility. Other concepts studied include waste emplacement in polar ice sheets, deep boreholes, and deep well injection of liquid waste, which were dismissed as not viable by AEC. The potential abandonment of Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste repository would lead to the need for a new site search, which would be slow-moving and controversial. The selection process for a new repository site would face intense opposition, making it a major challenge. The NWPA was intended to establish a fair process for selecting waste repository sites, but faced controversy and was paralyzed after five years. DOE had considered various sites including salt domes, bedded salt, and volcanic tuff. Energy Secretary John S. Herrington recommended Hanford, WA; Deaf Smith County, TX, and Yucca Mountain for site characterization on May 27, 1986. The President was required to submit his choice to Congress by March 31, 1987. NWPA limited the first repository to 70,000 metric tons until a second repository was opened, with a separate track established for locating a second repository site by July 1, 1989. The Department of Energy recommended three new repository sites for a second repository to the President, to be located in different geologic media. The search for the second repository was conducted systematically, focusing on granite and crystalline rock formations in 17 states. DOE developed a screening methodology to rank potential repository sites based on their suitability. DOE identified 12 promising rock bodies in seven states for a potential repository. Intense opposition arose from affected and host states, leading to the indefinite postponement of the second repository. The decision was based on lower nuclear power growth projections, but was seen as a response to political pressure and a unraveling of a regional compromise. Opposition from Tennessee to a proposed MRS site near Oak Ridge added to the controversy. The Senate Appropriations Committee noted the controversy surrounding the proposed MRS site near Oak Ridge, citing intense criticism, programmatic decisions by the Secretary of Energy, and unrealistic timelines for site characterization. The NWPA Amendments Act of 1987 cancelled the second repository program, designated Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate site, and nullified Oak Ridge's selection for an MRS facility. The NWPA Amendments Act designated Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate site for a repository, with annual payments offered to states hosting nuclear waste facilities. Nevada rejected the payments and exercised its \"state veto\" in 2002. DOE did not search for an MRS site under the NWPA Amendments, relying on the Nuclear Waste Negotiator to find a voluntary site. The process of developing a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain took 15 years after the 1987 Amendments, with additional delays in completing the license application to the NRC. Chronic underfunding by Congress and DOE management issues were cited as reasons for the slow progress. Nevada's opposition, including denying permits and legal challenges, further slowed the process. In 2008, Nevada filed a petition with NRC raising safety and environmental concerns, highlighting the challenges in siting a nuclear waste repository in the U.S. The history of U.S. efforts to site a nuclear waste repository shows challenges in addressing objections. Various approaches have been unsuccessful, but with program modifications and better management, success may be possible in the future. For example, a negotiated benefits agreement with Nevada is now being considered due to the current economic downturn. The original NWPA selection process for a nuclear waste repository was believed to be fair and technically credible by Representative Morris Udall. However, due to political interference, the program is now in ruins, leading to distrust among Western States towards the Department of Energy's technical integrity. The Department of Energy's siting decisions for nuclear waste facilities are viewed as technically informed political decisions, leading to distrust among some stakeholders. The successful opening of the WIPP facility in NM shows that siting such facilities is not impossible, despite challenges in making long-term projections. Congress authorized the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in 1979 to hold defense-related transuranic waste, which is less hazardous than spent fuel but still requires long-term isolation. After years of controversy, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Land Withdrawal Act was enacted in 1992, detailing regulations and procedures for opening the facility and banning high-level waste and spent fuel. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) was authorized by Congress in 1979 to hold defense-related transuranic waste. Slow progress led to amendments in 1996 exempting WIPP waste from some restrictions and providing funds for New Mexico bypass roads. The first waste shipment to the repository occurred in March 1999, almost 20 years after authorization. There is now discussion about using WIPP for high-level waste disposal, with concerns about \"salt creep\" potentially limiting waste retrieval options. The State of New Mexico strongly opposes high-level waste disposal at WIPP due to scientific uncertainty and technical unsuitability at potential repository sites. The federal government has faced challenges in opening central facilities for nuclear waste disposal, leading to prolonged storage at existing sites. This controversial siting issue could result in increased liability under current law. The federal government faces challenges in opening central facilities for nuclear waste disposal, leading to prolonged storage at existing sites. Major consequences include increased liability for storage costs and penalties for missing cleanup deadlines at defense-related nuclear facilities. Lack of a definite disposal plan could affect licensing of new plants, with reprocessing of spent fuel proposed as a way to reduce hazards. Central interim storage has been suggested as a quick solution, but without a permanent disposal plan, development of interim sites could be controversial. The Department of Energy (DOE) is researching reprocessing techniques to reduce the separation of pure plutonium from nuclear waste, which could make it easier to site a permanent repository. However, the potential use of plutonium in nuclear weapons and its impact on U.S. nonproliferation policy raises significant opposition. Yucca Mountain was designated as the nation's sole candidate site for a high-level nuclear waste repository in 1987, with no backup plan in place. Critics argue that sticking with Yucca Mountain despite technical problems could be risky, and if significant issues arise, an alternative course of action will be needed. If Yucca Mountain faces significant problems, there is no established policy framework for an alternative course of action."
