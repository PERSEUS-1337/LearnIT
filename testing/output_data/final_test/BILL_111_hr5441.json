Congress finds that every minute, one woman dies from pregnancy-related complications, with 99 percent of these deaths occurring in the developing world, particularly in Africa and Asia. Additionally, for every woman who dies, an estimated 20 women survive but suffer from pregnancy-related disabilities, such as obstetric fistula. This condition is a hole that forms between the bladder and vagina, or the rectum and vagina, due to prolonged obstructed labor. Obstetric fistula is a condition caused by prolonged obstructed labor, resulting in a hole between the bladder and vagina or rectum. It leads to incontinence, infections, infertility, and a foul odor. The World Health Organization estimates over 2 million women live with fistula, with 50,000 to 100,000 new cases annually. The majority of cases result in stillborn babies, physical pain, and emotional trauma for the mother. Obstetric fistula, caused by prolonged obstructed labor, leads to incontinence, infections, infertility, and social consequences like isolation and ridicule. It was eliminated in developed regions through improved medical interventions. Prevention is possible through medical care. Obstetric fistula is preventable through medical interventions like skilled attendance during labor, family planning, and emergency obstetric care. Surgery by a trained surgeon can have a success rate of 90% and cost around $300. Social interventions like delaying early marriage and empowering young women are also important. The ability of women to access health-related knowledge and services is crucial for the health of their families. In 2002, the UNFPA and EngenderHealth conducted assessments in African countries to address obstetric fistula, leading to a global campaign in 2003 to treat this condition. The global Campaign to End Fistula is active in over 45 countries in Africa, Asia, and the Arab States region, providing surgery, training, equipment, community outreach, and rehabilitative care for women suffering from obstetric fistula. It collaborates with various organizations to support national processes and fistula providers. USAID supports fistula treatment services in 34 sites across 11 countries with a budget of $70,000,000 through the Fistula Care project managed by EngenderHealth. The United States Global Health Initiative aims to strengthen global health partnerships and private sector engagement. The United States, through its Global Health Initiative, has committed to reducing fistula incidence, maternal mortality, unintended pregnancies, and early childbirths in assisted countries by 2014. This effort involves joining multilateral initiatives with the United Nations to achieve Millennium Development Goals 4, 5, and 6. Prevention and treatment of obstetric fistula is a key focus of the Global Health Initiative to reduce maternal mortality and improve reproductive health outcomes. The President is authorized to provide assistance to address social and health issues leading to obstetric fistula and support its treatment through various organizations. Assistance focuses on increasing prevention through access to sexual and reproductive health services and building local capacity to prevent and treat obstetric fistula within the context of overall good health during pregnancy. Supporting tools to address fistula include qualitative research, sustainable financing, training skilled birth attendants, promoting south-to-south training, and providing basic obstetric care at the community level. Addressing social and economic inequities involves empowering women and girls, reducing child marriage, delaying childbirth, and increasing access to education. Supporting reintegration and training programs help women return to productive lives after treatment. SEC. 4. COORDINATION, REPORTING, RESEARCH, MONITORING, AND EVALUATION. Assistance authorized under this Act promotes coordination through the International Obstetric Fistula Working Group and supports prevention and treatment programs. Funds are used for evidence-based programs and monitoring to measure effectiveness. The President must report to Congress annually on activities related to this Act. Activities undertaken in the previous fiscal year to reduce obstetric fistula incidence and increase treatment, aligning with national action plans."
