    "content": "Artificial neural networks have revolutionized computer science by solving previously unsolved problems. However, classic algorithms often outperform neural networks in terms of accuracy and stability. To bridge this gap, algorithmic neural networks (AlgoNets) have been introduced, integrating smooth versions of classic algorithms into neural network topology. Our novel reconstructive adversarial network (RAN) allows solving inverse problems without strong supervision. Algorithmic neural networks (AlgoNets) integrate algorithms into neural network topology, but propagating gradients through algorithms with crisp decisions can cause non-smooth changes in the loss function. The novel reconstructive adversarial network (RAN) enables solving inverse problems without strong supervision. Algorithmic neural networks (AlgoNets) integrate algorithms into neural network topology, but gradients through algorithms with crisp decisions can lead to non-smooth changes in the loss function. To address this issue, smoothing is necessary to make information about improvement directions exploitable by gradient descent in the vicinity of abrupt changes. To address the issue of non-smooth changes in the loss function due to crisp decisions in algorithmic neural networks, smooth approximations with higher smoothness are designed to prevent unexpected behavior of gradients. Pre-programmed neural networks are structured based on given algorithms to ensure C \u221e smoothness. Existing work in neural networks focuses on dealing with crisp decisions through gradients, but lacks smooth transitions between alternatives, leading to discontinuities in the loss function. TensorFlow offers tools like the sorting layer (tf.sort) and while loop construct (tf.while_loop) to aid in addressing these challenges. Theoretical work by DeMillo et al. [4] demonstrated that any program can be represented by a smooth function. Subsequent research [5] - [7] introduced methods for smoothing programs using Gaussian smoothing. Smooth algorithmic layers, which replace discrete cases with continuous functions, are essential for ensuring differentiability with respect to internal choices. This approach contrasts with previous methods that only propagate gradients through the algorithm. The gradient descent method can influence conditions in algorithms by using a smooth sigmoid function to replace if statements. This allows for smooth interpretation and computation of partial derivatives with respect to neurons. The logistic sigmoid function is a smooth replacement for the Heaviside sigmoid function, enabling differentiability in algorithms. The Heaviside sigmoid function can be replaced by other sigmoid functions like the smooth step function. Reconstructive Adversarial Networks (RAN) can be used to solve for the inverse of a given problem, designed for unsupervised or weakly supervised solving of inverse-problems. RANs are similar to auto-encoders and the encoder-renderer architecture. The RAN system, inspired by auto-encoders and encoder-renderer architecture, introduces domain translators to address domain shift between input and output domains. Training is facilitated by a novel schema using a reconstructor, domain translators, discriminator, and smooth inverse component. The reconstructor predicts reconstructions from input domain A validated through the system. The RAN system introduces domain translators to address domain shift between input and output domains. The reconstructor predicts reconstructions from domain A, validated through a smooth inverse. The discriminator indicates content match, not style, and the network is trained via five data paths, including domain translators. The structure of the RAN allows for a coevolutionary training scheme to solve causality dilemmas. The RAN system utilizes domain translators to address domain shift. The discriminator distinguishes between real and fake values from different inputs. The generator modules are trained to deceive the discriminator in an adversarial game. The optimization involves adversarial, cycle-consistency, and regularization losses. The reconstruction output losses are defined based on dependencies between elements in A and B. The network is trained in sections including the discriminator, translation from B to A, and components for translation from A to B. Separate losses are trained for each section using Adam optimizer. An unsupervised 3D reconstruction method is developed using a smooth 3D mesh renderer. Domain translators include pix2pix network and ResNet. The renderer in the paper performs smooth rasterization and occlusion handling. The RAN achieved results on unsupervised 3D reconstruction from camera-captured images. AlgoNets are introduced as new layers for neural networks, with the rendering layer being computationally expensive but powerful for 3D reconstruction training. The rendering layer is powerful for 3D reconstruction training without 3D supervision using the RAN. Increasing loss weights and introducing a probability of computation execution can reduce training time. AlgoNets can assist neural networks in solving larger problems by using algorithmic layers. Residual algorithmic layers can be added to neural networks for explainable artificial intelligence. In the future, a high-level smooth programming language will be developed to improve representations of higher-level programming concepts. Adding trainable weights to algorithmic layers can enhance the accuracy of smooth algorithms and allow the network to influence the behavior of the layers. Additionally, exploring neural networks with a smooth topology is a future objective."
