    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Thirteenth Amendment Commemorative Coin Act\". The economic contributions of enslaved African-Americans to the American economy between 1691 and 1860 were immeasurable, building the foundations of America. Colonial economies in the Americas relied on enslaved African labor for survival, including the North American mercantile and shipping sectors. Enslaved Africans were also crucial in the political and economic capital of the United States. During the Civil War, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring all slaves in rebellious states free from January 1, 1863. This action added a new dimension to the war aims, shifting from preserving the Union to emancipation. The Civil War evolved from a conflict to preserve the Union to a crusade to end Black slavery and uphold the ideals of the Declaration of Independence. In 1864, the 13th Amendment was introduced in the Senate, prohibiting slavery and granting Congress the power to enforce it, passing with a vote of 38-6. Abolitionists and supporters of slavery debated the moral implications of slavery. President Lincoln played a key role in promoting the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery, ensuring it was included in the Republican Party's 1864 election platform. Various interpretations of natural law and the contradiction between slavery and inalienable rights were debated within the Republican Party. Representative John Farnsworth highlighted the belief of the Constitution's framers that slavery was against human rights. Charles Sumner sought a constitutional interpretation rejecting slavery as incompatible with moral law. Illinois was the first state to ratify the 13th Amendment in 1865, followed by 17 other states. Georgia became the 27th state to approve the Amendment in December 1865, meeting the constitutional requirement. The 13th Amendment was declared part of the Constitution by Secretary of State William Seward on December 18. The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture was established by an Act of Congress in 2003. The NMAAHC receives surcharges from coin sales to fund its endowment and educational outreach, as it focuses on documenting African-American life including slavery and Reconstruction. SEC. 3.
