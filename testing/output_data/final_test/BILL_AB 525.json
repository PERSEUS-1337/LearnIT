    "title": "AB 525",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 20020 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to limit a franchisor's ability to terminate a franchise before its expiration, requiring good cause and a notice period for the franchisee to cure any failures. Section 20021 is also amended in relation to franchise termination. Section 20021 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to allow immediate termination of a franchise if the franchisee is bankrupt, insolvent, or unable to pay debts. The franchise can be terminated if the franchisee fails to operate the business for five consecutive days, both parties agree in writing, or the franchisee makes material misrepresentations or engages in conduct that reflects unfavorably on the franchise. The franchisee can be terminated if they fail to comply with any federal, state, or local laws, engage in repeated noncompliance with franchise requirements, or fail to correct noncompliance after notice. The franchisee can be terminated if the franchised business is seized by a government official or creditor, the franchisee is convicted of a felony, fails to pay franchise fees within five days of notice, or engages in criminal misconduct relevant to the franchise operation. The franchisor can terminate the franchise if there is an imminent danger to public health or safety, or if a separate motor fuel franchise operated by the franchisee or affiliate at the same premises is lawfully terminated. This is governed by the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act. Section 20022 of the Business and Professions Code states that upon lawful termination or nonrenewal of a franchisee, the franchisor must purchase inventory, supplies, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings from the franchisee at the price paid minus depreciation. The franchisor has the right to clear title and possession of these items. Upon lawful termination or nonrenewal of a franchisee, the franchisor is required to purchase necessary items for the franchise business at a fair price. This does not apply if the franchisee declines a renewal offer or retains control of the business location. (e) This section does not apply if a franchisor decides to completely withdraw from franchise activity in the relevant geographic market area. The definition of \"relevant geographic market area\" is the same as in Section 20999. (f) It also does not apply if the franchisor and franchisee mutually agree in writing to terminate or not renew the franchise. (g) Additionally, it does not apply to any inventory, supplies, equipment, fixtures, or furnishings sold by the franchisee between the notice of termination or nonrenewal and the cessation of franchise business operation. Upon termination or nonrenewal of a franchise, a franchisor can offset amounts owed to a franchisee with any amounts owed by the franchisee. It is unlawful for a franchisor to prevent a franchisee from selling or transferring the franchise, assets, or interest to another qualified person, as long as transfer conditions are met as per the franchise agreement. Franchisees cannot sell or transfer the franchise without franchisor's written consent, which cannot be unreasonably withheld. Buyer must meet franchisor's standards for new franchisees or comply with transfer conditions in the franchise agreement. Franchisors can exercise the right of first refusal to purchase a franchise, assets, or interest after receiving a bona fide offer. The payment offered must be at least equal to the value of the offer. The term \"franchise business\" includes a legal entity party to a franchise agreement. Prior to selling, transferring, or assigning a franchise, the franchisee must notify the franchisor in writing with details of the proposed transferee and all related agreements. The franchisee must submit an application for approval to transfer the franchise, including all necessary forms and financial disclosures. The franchisor must provide any additional information needed for the transfer application promptly. If the franchisor's standards for approving new franchisees are not readily available, they must be provided to the franchisee within 15 days of request. When the franchisee notifies the franchisor of their intent to sell or transfer the franchise, the franchisor must communicate the standards within 15 days. The franchisor must notify the franchisee of the approval or disapproval of a proposed sale, assignment, or transfer within 60 days of receiving necessary information. If disapproved, reasons must be provided in writing. The franchisor's decision on sale, assignment, or transfer must be reasonable and based on all circumstances. The franchisor is not obligated to exercise a right of first refusal. Section 6 clarifies that a franchisor is not required to exercise a right of first refusal. However, the franchisor can still choose to use this right to purchase a franchise or its assets after receiving a legitimate offer from a potential buyer. The franchisor must offer the seller payment equal to the value of the offer. The definition of \"franchise business\" includes a legal entity under a franchise agreement. Section 7 repeals Section 20035 of the Business and Professions Code. Article 6 discusses remedies for franchise termination or non-renewal violations. Franchisees are entitled to fair market value of business assets and damages. Courts can grant injunctions for violations. Franchisors can offset any prior recoveries or debts owed by franchisees. Section 20041 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to apply to franchises granted or renewed after January 1, 1981, or to indefinite duration franchises terminable without cause. Amendments made after January 1, 2016, apply to agreements entered into or renewed on or after that date."
