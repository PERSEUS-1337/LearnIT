    "content": "The \"Physician Reentry Demonstration Program Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. Congress finds a significant shortage of primary care physicians in the United States, with estimates indicating a shortfall of 40,000 in the next 10 years. Medical schools are not producing enough graduates going into primary care, exacerbating the overall physician shortage expected to reach nearly 160,000 by 2025. The Department of Health and Human Services estimates a need for at least 16,000 more primary care physicians. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, 22% of female pediatricians took extended leave from medicine, compared to only 6.5% of male pediatricians. Of the female pediatricians who took extended leave, 71% did so to care for a child or family member. SEC. 3. REENTRY PROGRAM FOR PHYSICIANS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a demonstration program to assist physician reentry into clinical practice for primary health services. One grant will be awarded competitively in each of the 10 regions served by a regional office. Up to 15 percent of funds will be used for administrative activities with key stakeholders. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a program to assist physician reentry into clinical practice for primary health services. This program will involve conducting a national needs assessment, developing a database of reentry programs, and disseminating evaluation tools for measuring physician competencies. Entities eligible for grants under this program include states, hospitals, academic medical centers, medical schools, health centers, and non-profit organizations with a history of supporting physician reentry into clinical practice. A non-profit organization with expertise in physician education can receive a grant to assist reentering physicians. The funds can be used for training, credentialing fees, and salaries of reentering physicians. To be eligible for benefits in a demonstration program, reentering physicians must provide primary health services at designated locations such as health centers, Veterans Administration Medical Centers, or school-based health centers. Reentering physicians must work at designated locations like health centers, VA Medical Centers, or school-based health centers for at least 2 years to receive benefits. Liability protections are provided under the Public Health Service Act for any personal injury resulting from their medical activities during the demonstration program. The Public Health Service Act provides liability protections for reentering physicians participating in a demonstration program. The Secretary conducts an annual review and submits a report to Congress evaluating the program's performance, including reentering physicians who return to clinical practice after a period of inactivity. Authorization of Appropriations is provided for fiscal year 2014 to support reentering physicians who return to clinical practice after a period of inactivity."
