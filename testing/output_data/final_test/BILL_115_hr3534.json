The \"State Marihuana And Regulatory Tolerance Enforcement Act\" amends the Controlled Substances Act to exclude marijuana regulation in states that meet specific conditions, including legalizing marijuana and implementing a regulatory regime to protect federal interests. The \"State Marihuana And Regulatory Tolerance Enforcement Act\" aims to prevent various illegal activities related to marijuana, such as diversion to other states, trafficking of other drugs, violence in cultivation and distribution, drugged driving, and growing on public lands. The State agrees to study and report annually to the Attorney General regarding outcomes of legalizing marihuana, including youth use, driving while intoxicated rates, diversion to other states, and drug-related organized crime activity. The Attorney General may grant a waiver for a 3-year period, with the option to renew for another 3 years. The waiver's effective date is tied to the State's regulatory regime. The Attorney General can review and revoke the waiver if necessary. The Attorney General can revoke a waiver granted to a State if conditions are not met, after providing notice and a chance to correct within 180 days. This section does not prevent the Federal Government from assisting States under other laws.
