    "content": "The U.S. Secret Service has investigated counterfeiting since 1865 and provided presidential protection since 1901. Congress has increased oversight due to concerns about terrorism threats, security breaches, and misconduct by USSS personnel. Recent incidents include alcohol abuse, security breaches at the White House, and unauthorized entry. These incidents have damaged the image of the USSS and may have impacted its operations. In March 2015, two senior USSS special agents, one responsible for White House security, were reported to disrupt an investigation under the influence of alcohol. This incident is part of a pattern of misconduct within federal law enforcement agencies, including the DEA. The USSS has two integrated missions: criminal investigations and protection, with the protection mission being more prominent, especially concerning presidential security. Recent incidents have led to proposed changes and reforms within the USSS. The USSS protection mission is focused on safeguarding the President, Vice President, their families, and candidates for those offices, as well as securing various official residences and foreign missions in the District of Columbia. Additionally, the USSS coordinates security for National Special Security Events (NSSE), such as presidential inaugurations. The USSS is structured to handle criminal investigations, protection missions, and administrative functions. It consists of two main divisions led by a Chief Operating Officer and a Deputy Director. Current staffing levels for each component are provided in the report. The USSS organization includes special agents, Uniformed Division officers, and Administrative, Professional, and Technical positions. Special agents handle protection and criminal investigations, while Uniformed Division officers focus on protective actions. APT positions support both missions. Some personnel conduct both protection and criminal investigations due to overlapping missions. Staffing numbers for major USSS components are provided in Table 1. The USSS conducts various activities including protection, protective intelligence, counterfeiting investigations, cyber-crime investigations, and financial crime investigations. Presidential protection has been a full-time mission since 1901, with seven assaults on Presidents since then. USSS protection involves more than physical guarding, including securing facilities and locations. The USSS conducts various activities including protection, protective intelligence, counterfeiting investigations, cyber-crime investigations, and financial crime investigations. This includes securing facilities and locations where protectees are located. Security breaches at the White House complex have occurred, with incidents of unauthorized entrance and ethical violations by USSS personnel. Two senior USSS special agents, responsible for White House security, disrupted an investigation of a suspicious package under the influence of alcohol. An executive panel recommended enhanced training for Presidential and Vice-Presidential Protective Divisions, including a \"Fourth Shift\" training schedule. Increase training for all White House teams to ensure they know their roles in responding to threats. Expand the Uniformed Division by 200 positions and the Presidential Protective Division by 85 positions. Improve recruiting, hiring, promotion, and rotation processes. Allocate dedicated funds for technology upgrades within the Service and DHS Science and Technology. The USSS is advised to enhance communication, prioritize agency goals, promote specialized expertise, adopt a mission-based budget, involve officers in decision-making, lead the federal protective force community, and receive external assessments for protecting the White House complex. The Secret Service should prioritize leadership's priorities and reforms, implement a disciplinary system with zero tolerance for failures, hold forces accountable for performance, and appoint a strong leader from outside the agency as the next director to drive cultural change and establish a leadership development system. The USSS implemented recommendations to improve professionalism and integrity, including establishing a disciplinary process for personnel misconduct. Congress increased oversight following security breaches and ethical violations. Following security breaches and ethical violations, Congress increased oversight of the USSS. Hearings were held to address breaches and incidents, questioning deficient procedures, training, personnel shortages, and low morale. Allegations of misconduct by senior USSS agents were also investigated. The DHS Office of Inspector General found that two senior USSS agents interfered with a bomb investigation at the White House while intoxicated. The agents displayed poor judgment and failed to report their actions to their superiors. Despite this, the USSS Uniform Division followed policy and procedures during the incident. The House passed H.R. 1656 (114th Congress) to address issues with USSS, including appointing the Director with Senate approval, increasing training hours, and hiring more officers and agents. The bill was referred to the Senate committee but no further action was taken. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee conducted a hearing on allegations regarding USSS agents' compensation for overtime and protection of sensitive material. Issues highlighted included technology failures, alleged misconduct in senior management promotions, and withholding of information by USSS leadership. Congress has not received updates on USSS's response to oversight since the hearing. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee conducted a hearing on allegations regarding USSS agents' compensation for overtime and protection of sensitive material. Congress has not received updates on USSS's response to oversight since the hearing. Congress, DHS, and the USSS are exploring ways to address recent security breaches and ethical violations within USSS, focusing on identifying potential reforms to management practices, operations, and training programs. Agreement on fundamental issues and solutions has not been reached yet. The Director leads the USSS and is supported by the Office of the Chief Counsel and the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity. A Chief Operating Officer oversees the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of Human Resources, and Office of Strategic Planning and Policy. A Deputy Director manages the Office of Government and Public Affairs for liaison with the public and other federal entities. The USSS is divided into different offices for various responsibilities: Office of Investigations handles criminal investigations, Office of Professional Responsibility monitors agent conduct, Office of Protective Operations protects the President and dignitaries, and Office of Government and Public Affairs liaises with other entities. The USSS is divided into different offices for various responsibilities including criminal investigations, agent conduct monitoring, protective operations for the President and dignitaries, and government and public affairs liaison. Additionally, the Office of Strategic Intelligence and Information provides counter surveillance and threat intelligence, the Office of Technical Development and Mission Support offers IT support, the Office of Training manages training at the James J. Rowley Training Center, and the Office of Integrity addresses ethical issues. Each office is staffed by USSS personnel."
