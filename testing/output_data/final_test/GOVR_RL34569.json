    "content": "President Bush announced a $30 billion request for the reauthorization of PEPFAR, a global effort to combat HIV/AIDS. PEPFAR aimed to support treatments for 2.5 million infected individuals, prevent 12 million new infections, and care for 12 million affected people, including 5 million orphans. Congress previously authorized $15 billion in 2003 and $48 billion in 2008 for U.S. global efforts against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The Lantos-Hyde Act (P.L. 110-293) was signed into law on July 30, 2008, authorizing U.S. contributions to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria globally through the Global Fund. The report outlines U.S. efforts through PEPFAR, including funding details and key program elements, as well as policy debates during the 110th Congress reauthorization discussions. The 110th Congress considered legislation to reauthorize PEPFAR programs, detailing key proposals in H.R. 5501 and changes to funding for global HIV/AIDS efforts. President Bush proposed PEPFAR in 2003, requesting $15 billion over five years for combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Congress authorized $15 billion for these efforts from FY2004 through FY2008. The Leadership Act (P.L. 108-25) created the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) to oversee U.S. efforts in combating HIV/AIDS in PEPFAR Focus Countries. OGAC coordinates resources, programs, and policies among government agencies and NGOs, including auditing and monitoring activities. The 15 PEPFAR Focus Countries accounted for over 50% of all HIV-infected people in the world in 2003. Countries accounted for over 50% of all HIV-infected people in the world. The 15 Focus Countries are Botswana, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guyana, Haiti, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, and Zambia. OGAC estimates that 58% of PEPFAR funds will have been spent on these countries from FY2004 through FY2008. OGAC transfers funds to PEPFAR-participating agencies like USAID, State, HHS, CDC, NIH, HRSA, FDA, and SAMHSA for HIV/AIDS programs in Focus Countries. The Leadership Act authorized funds for global HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs through various agencies like DOL, Commerce, Peace Corps, and DOD. Funds also support multilateral organizations like the Global Fund, UNAIDS, and IAVI. Funding allocations for Focus Countries are determined by OGAC based on past allocations, with India receiving more funding than some Focus Countries like Guyana. The Leadership Act authorizes funds for global HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs through various agencies. OGAC determines annual funding allocations for Focus Countries based on past allocations and provides budget estimates for Country Operational Plans. Congress outlined funding distribution guidelines and spending directives for HIV/AIDS assistance, including requirements for prevention and treatment funding percentages. Congress outlined funding distribution guidelines for HIV/AIDS assistance, requiring specific percentages for treatment, palliative care, and support for orphans and vulnerable children. President Bush projected that the PEPFAR initiative would prevent new infections, provide treatment for millions, and support care for millions more. OGAC reports that as of September 30, 2008, they have supported HIV counseling and testing for nearly 57 million people, prevention of mother-to-child transmission services during nearly 16 million pregnancies, and antiretroviral treatment for over 2.1 million people, including 130,100 children. They have also supported care for more than 10.1 million HIV-affected people, including over 4 million orphans and vulnerable children. The Leadership Act authorized $15 billion to address HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria globally from FY2004 through FY2008. Since FY2004, U.S. funding for global health programs to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria totaled nearly $19.8 billion. President Bush introduced the President's Malaria Initiative in 2005 to expand efforts to combat malaria globally, leading to separate reporting of malaria funding from PEPFAR calculations. The report details funding separately for HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria, and U.S. contributions to the Global Fund. Since FY2004, U.S. funding for global health programs to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria totaled nearly $19.8 billion. Funding for U.S. programs included $15.3 billion for HIV/AIDS, $535 million for TB, and $915 million for malaria. The United States also contributed $3.0 billion to the Global Fund from FY2004 through FY2008. President Bush introduced the President's Malaria Initiative in 2005, with separate funding for malaria eradication efforts. In FY2009, the Administration requested $6 billion for international HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis programs, including $500 million for the Global Fund and $385 million for the President's Malaria Initiative. President Bush urged Congress to extend PEPFAR with a $30 billion authorization to support treatment for 2.5 million people, prevent 12 million new infections, and care for 12 million people, including 5 million orphans and vulnerable children. The Lantos-Hyde Act proposed changes to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria globally, with key requirements and funding allocations included in the Senate-passed version of H.R. 5501 enacted into law on July 30, 2008. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 5501 proposed funding allocations for U.S. international efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, with the House proposing $50 billion over five years and the Senate proposing $48 billion. Both versions also included higher funding levels for tuberculosis and malaria efforts, as well as contributions to the Global Fund. Additionally, the Senate version proposed $2 billion for an emergency fund for Indian health and safety. The Senate adopted amendments to H.R. 5501, adding language for an emergency plan for Indian tribes and directing fund expenditure. Critics argued against the $50 billion and $48 billion authorization levels due to fiscal concerns amidst military operations and economic challenges. Some analysts warned that increased disease-specific funding could divert resources from other aid priorities in developing countries. Critics of high spending levels were concerned about proposals to increase the number of Focus Countries and extend PEPFAR funds to support health care infrastructure, nutrition, and feeding programs. Some Senators opposed bills that would transform a $15 billion AIDS program into a $50 billion development program. Proponents argued that greater resources were needed for access to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care. Debate focused on where the increased funding should be allocated and what priorities it should support. Some urged Congress to consider further definition of tuberculosis authorities and targets, improved coordination with HIV/AIDS activities in areas of co-infection, and strengthened reporting requirements. Backers of increased funding argued for integration with health systems and related development efforts to ensure sustainability. Some opponents cited the Congressional Budget Office's cost estimates to justify lower funding levels. The proposed bill 5501 would cost $35 billion from FY2009 through FY2013, with most funding spent by FY2018. It included establishing a U.S. Global Malaria Coordinator at USAID to oversee resources for combating malaria internationally, including providing assistance to efforts like the Roll Back Malaria Partnership. The proposed bill 5501 included the creation of a U.S. Global Malaria Coordinator at USAID to oversee resources for combating malaria internationally. Some critics opposed a disease-specific approach, arguing it would create competition for limited human capacity. Supporters believed focusing on malaria would address a major health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. Observers suggested integrating efforts to combat HIV/AIDS with basic healthcare and childhood illness prevention in resource-poor settings under PEPFAR. Questions were raised about coordinating PMI activities with PEPFAR, defining authorities in the Leadership Act, potential competing priorities between PMI and PEPFAR in Focus Countries, and implications of different initiative timetables. Representative Luis Fortu\u00f1o introduced H.R. 848 to authorize assistance to combat HIV/AIDS in certain Caribbean countries. The bill H.R. 5501 proposed adding several Caribbean countries and Vietnam as Focus Countries. Representative Betty McCollum suggested adding Malawi, Swaziland, and Lesotho. The Senate version only included Vietnam as a Focus Country, updating the list from the Leadership Act. The Senate-passed version of the bill added new Focus Countries with a high prevalence of HIV or risk of increasing incidence. Some questioned the selection process, while proponents argued it would direct more funding to these areas. Debate also focused on how funds would be distributed across PEPFAR countries. Opponents of the proposed list for Focus Countries in HIV/AIDS activities raised concerns about the growing incidence rates in East Asia and Oceania, and the increasing prevalence rates in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. They suggested a more comprehensive analysis of need for selecting Focus Countries. Some suggested using compacts between the U.S. government and PEPFAR-recipient governments to outline U.S. involvement in AIDS programs, instead of naming Focus Countries for funding allocation based on country needs and access to other funding sources. Supporters believed compacts could enhance expectations for development efforts with significant health impacts. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 5501 supported the idea of using compacts and framework agreements to promote the transition from emergency to public health and development approach to HIV/AIDS. It required cost-sharing assurances from PEPFAR-recipient governments and transition strategies to be included in compacts. The House-passed version did not include similar language. The House-passed version of H.R. 5501 maintained funding distribution guidelines for HIV prevention, care, and orphans and vulnerable children activities but excluded the directive for HIV/AIDS treatment. The Senate-passed version modified spending directives, requiring over half of bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance to be spent on treatment, care, and support for infected individuals. It did not include funding guidelines for HIV/AIDS prevention. Both versions emphasized balanced funding for prevention activities, with a report to Congress needed to justify spending less than 50% on behavioral change programs. There was debate over congressional spending directives for PEPFAR recipient countries with generalized epidemics. Critics argued that the directives limited the ability to tailor budgets to local HIV transmission patterns and complicated efforts to address the specific nature of the epidemic in each country. HIV/AIDS rates varied among Focus Countries, with epidemics ranging from concentrated among specific groups to spread throughout the population. Some suggested eliminating spending directives to allow for more responsive operational planning. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that spending restrictions did not consider varying costs of HIV/AIDS activities in different countries or changes over time. Some supported maintaining spending directives, especially for orphans and vulnerable children (OVC). Others emphasized the importance of the directive requiring at least 55% of funds to be spent on HIV/AIDS treatment. Senator Tom Coburn introduced the Save Lives First Act of 2008 on March 12, 2008. Senator Tom Coburn introduced the Save Lives First Act of 2008, maintaining protections for AIDS treatment funding. He signed a letter requesting a hold on H.R. 5501 and S. 2731 due to the removal of treatment spending directive. After negotiating changes to S. 2731, Coburn was satisfied with language requiring over half the money to go to treatment, including antiretroviral drugs. He withdrew his objection to proceed with S. 2731. Program objectives establish goals for U.S. HIV/AIDS activities to reach a specified number of people within a set period. The program objective was to provide antiretroviral treatment for 2 million people. U.S. staff in PEPFAR Focus Countries set annual program objectives for prevention, treatment, and care to reach five-year country goals. Global program objectives were calculated by adding up the five-year country targets. Some supporters argue for country teams to determine program targets in PEPFAR Focus Countries, citing their awareness of each country's needs. However, concerns were raised about the challenges country teams may face in reaching a consensus. Critics suggest that Congress could specify global targets to guide policy implementation without hindering country-based teams' flexibility to respond to in-country realities. Both versions of H.R. 5501 proposed a target for prevention of mother to child transmission activities, aiming to reach at least 80% of pregnant women in affected countries. The Senate and House versions of H.R. 5501 proposed targets for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) activities, aiming to reach at least 80% of pregnant women in affected countries by 2013. Debate centered around prioritizing HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care activities, with some experts emphasizing the importance of prevention due to the lack of a cure for AIDS. The Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS emphasized prevention as the main focus of response. Some organizations focused on prevention strategies to prevent new infections, while others argued that neglecting treatment and care would have economic and social impacts. Treatment and care were seen as investments in hope and stability, preventing orphaned children and alleviating the suffering of those infected. Some argued that treatment costs were dropping rapidly for first and second-line antiretroviral therapies, expected to continue as treatment expanded in low-income countries. H.R. 5501 included language linking U.S. HIV/AIDS activities to family planning and maternal health programs. Proposed amendments aimed at a comprehensive global strategy to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 5501 did not include family planning program language. Opponents argued that the language in the House version of H.R. 5501 was ambiguous and could apply the Mexico City policy to programs receiving PEPFAR funding, which denies U.S. funds to foreign NGOs that promote abortion. Some also opposed the language for not adequately supporting the integration of family planning services in U.S.-supported HIV programs. The House version of H.R. 5501 proposed family planning program language that could limit PEPFAR funding based on compliance with the Mexico City policy. Some groups were undecided on endorsing or opposing the language, expressing concerns about conflicting beliefs. Section 501 of the House version also included the development of health workforce strategies and directed reforms to IMF policies limiting health investments. The House version of H.R. 5501 proposed language on family planning programs that could impact PEPFAR funding. It also included provisions for health workforce strategies and reforms to IMF policies. The Senate-passed version directed the Global AIDS Coordinator to develop effective procurement and supply chain systems for supplies and drugs in countries receiving assistance. Additionally, H.R. 5501 required OGAC and USAID to combat HIV/AIDS by strengthening health policies and systems in PEPFAR countries. This included collaboration with post-secondary institutions in host countries to support healthcare systems. The Senate version of H.R. 5501 proposed requiring strategic planning to combat global AIDS by linking investments in disease programs to broader health and development goals, coordinating efforts across program areas. Some experts raised concerns about the single disease approach focusing limited resources. The single disease approach to global health focused limited resources on high burden countries, with concerns about minimal overall health infrastructure improvement. Long-term implications of increased funding for AIDS treatment were highlighted, estimating a need for a 20% increase in U.S. overseas development assistance by FY2016 or reallocation of 20% of the current budget to AIDS treatment alone. The development assistance budget of $23 billion was questioned for its potential impact on other global health programs. Supporters argued for comprehensive health infrastructure development to enhance the effectiveness of disease-specific initiatives like PEPFAR and PMI. Critics believed such investments were outside PEPFAR's scope and could detract from its focus on HIV/AIDS. Both versions of H.R. 5501 promoted integrating HIV/AIDS activities with nutrition programs for better outcomes. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 5501 proposed establishing additional services to provide nutritional support directly for treated individuals, especially for those with HIV/AIDS. Both the Senate and House versions encouraged providing food and nutritional support for children affected by HIV/AIDS. Language in both versions of H.R. 5501 addressing health system infrastructure and nutrition did not differ greatly from language included in the Leadership Act. The new language in both versions of H.R. 5501 provided greater detail on infrastructure and nutrition challenges in certain regions, promoting integration of U.S. HIV/AIDS efforts with other existing programs. The Senate version proposed eliminating the language in the Immigration and Nationality Act that bars foreign nationals with HIV/AIDS from entering the U.S. The Senate version of H.R. 5501 proposed eliminating the language in the Immigration and Nationality Act that bars foreign nationals with HIV/AIDS from entering the U.S. Supporters argued that maintaining these restrictions was discriminatory and unnecessary, while opponents believed it would increase costs for U.S. health programs. The Senate version also included requirements for additional reporting on U.S. global AIDS efforts and the impact of global HIV/AIDS funding on other U.S. health programs. The Senate version of H.R. 5501 proposed eliminating restrictions on foreign nationals with HIV/AIDS entering the U.S. It included requirements for additional reporting on global AIDS efforts and funding impact on U.S. health programs. The House version focused on prohibiting funds to foreign countries unless exempt from taxation or reimbursed. The Global AIDS Coordinator established an advisory panel of experts on prevention of mother to child HIV transmission (PMTCT) known as the PMTCT Panel. The panel reviewed PMTCT efforts and made recommendations to scale-up PMTCT services by 2013 to provide access to counseling, testing, and treatment for at least 80% of pregnant women in countries most affected by HIV/AIDS. Both versions of H.R. 5501 expanded \"conscience clause\" language in the Leadership Act. The House passed the Senate version of H.R. 5501, the Lantos-Hyde Act, which allows organizations to opt-out of HIV/AIDS programs for religious or moral reasons without discrimination in grant issuance. The Lantos-Hyde Act (P.L. 110-293) authorizes $48 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts from FY2009 through FY2013. It also allocates $2 billion for Indian health and safety emergency funds from FY2008 through FY2013. If fully appropriated, $36 billion would remain for HIV/AIDS activities. The Lantos-Hyde Act authorizes funding for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, with provisions allowing for greater funding than the authorized amounts if fully appropriated by Congress. Key changes to U.S. global health programs are directed by the Act."
