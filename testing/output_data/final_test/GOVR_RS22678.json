    "content": "Congress approved legislation in 1972 (P.L. 92-336) to adjust Social Security benefits for inflation automatically. The formula for calculating the new cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) was flawed, resulting in unintended consequences. The high inflation and unemployment in the 1970s led to higher-than-intended increases for beneficiaries and lower-than-expected revenues for Social Security. Congress corrected the error as part of the 1977 Amendments (P.L. 95-216) to prevent future beneficiaries from receiving initial benefits that exceeded their pre-retirement earnings. The 1977 Amendments (P.L. 95-216) corrected the error in the benefit formula created by the 1972 Amendments, ensuring Social Security's solvency. The correction resulted in different treatment for beneficiaries based on their year of birth, affecting those born in 1910 and later. The 1977 Amendments corrected the Social Security benefit formula error from the 1972 Amendments, affecting beneficiaries born between 1910 and 1916. This resulted in unintentional windfall benefits for those born before 1917, while those born during the \"notch years\" received lower benefits. Congress phased in the change for those born from 1917 through 1921, but many still experienced a differential in benefits compared to earlier cohorts. The term \"notch\" originated from graphs showing how the benefit levels of notch babies dip below those born before and after them. Notch babies often receive higher benefits than those born after them. For example, those born in 1917 receive higher monthly benefits than those born in 1922. An average wage earner born in 1917 would receive $1,166 monthly, while one born in 1922 would receive $1,080. The term \"notch\" refers to a group of individuals who have higher replacement rates in their post-retirement income compared to those born after them. The replacement rates for notch babies were intended to be around 40%, but due to a double-indexing error, they rose above 50% before being corrected. This is shown in Figure 2. Benefits for individuals born in 1922 and later are calculated using a corrected formula established by the 1977 Amendments. A commission was established in 1992 to study the \"Notch\" issue, concluding that benefits for those in the \"Notch\" years are equitable and no remedial legislation is needed. The uneven treatment between \"Notch\" years and those before them was magnified by Congress's decision to grandfather individuals born before 1917 under the old law. The 1972 Amendments led to benefits being miscalculated for individuals born before 1917. Advocacy groups like TSCL support legislation to increase benefits for \"notch babies,\" but others like AARP oppose it. Various organizations and administrations have taken different stances on the issue. The notch babies issue arose from benefits miscalculations for individuals born before 1917 due to the 1972 Amendments. Changes to Social Security benefits can create notches, affecting those born before or after a specific date. Notches are common in means-tested programs like SSI. In 2011, an aged or disabled person with assets under $2,000 is eligible for a federal SSI benefit of $674 per month. Phasing in changes in benefit levels over a range can be less precise and increase program costs. For example, reducing benefits for old-age beneficiaries born after 1969 by 10% would create a notch based on birth date. Phasing in changes in benefit levels over a range can be less precise and increase program costs. One alternative is to create a notch based on one's date of birth, resulting in benefits differing by 10% for retirees with identical earnings born one day apart. Another option is to phase in reductions at a rate of 1% per year, eliminating the notch and potentially increasing savings. The notch or cliff in benefits is a common consequence of conditioning benefits on an individual's date of birth, income, or assets. Notches can be eliminated by phasing in changes, but this may result in less precise targeting or increased spending. Despite efforts in Congress to increase benefits for notch babies, little legislative action has been taken. Despite efforts in Congress to increase benefits for notch babies, the sponsors were unable to gather enough signatures. However, notch legislation did make it to the Senate floor multiple times."
