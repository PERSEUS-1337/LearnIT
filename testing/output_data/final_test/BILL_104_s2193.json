    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States Voluntary and Material Assistance Act of 1996\". The Congress finds that a program to dispose of United States donated nonlethal personal property to foreign countries would benefit foreign policy, fill gaps in reduced foreign assistance, save taxpayer money, promote people-to-people activity, and benefit the private sector engaged in foreign trade. The disposal of US donated nonlethal personal property to foreign countries can benefit foreign trade through public relations, reduced storage costs, tax reductions, and access to new markets. The Act aims to supplement US foreign assistance by transferring donated nonlethal personal property to eligible countries for humanitarian or technical assistance purposes. The Act defines \"nonlethal personal property\" as property that is not intended to cause serious harm or death, including capital equipment used in education, manufacturing, or agriculture, and consumables associated with these activities. Nonlethal personal property includes capital equipment used in education, manufacturing, or agriculture, and consumables associated with these activities that are surplus property and screened for donations to State agencies under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. Establishment of United States voluntary and material assistance program under SEC. 5. The President may receive and transfer nonlethal personal property to eligible foreign countries under this Act. Assistance is provided to private and voluntary organizations in the US for transferring donated property. Surplus nonlethal personal property can also be transferred to eligible foreign countries. The United States Voluntary and Material Assistance Program, known as the \"Program,\" ensures that donated nonlethal personal property is transferred to foreign countries based on local needs, the willingness and ability of countries to utilize the property, and US foreign policy objectives. The United States Voluntary and Material Assistance Program, known as the \"Program,\" allows foreign countries to receive nonlethal personal property if they meet eligibility criteria and agree to use the property for specified purposes. Some foreign countries are ineligible based on certain criteria. Foreign countries receiving donated nonlethal personal property under the Program must agree to use it for specific purposes such as schools, hospitals, refugee programs, agricultural activities, small businesses, disaster response, public health, and environmental hazards. Reselling the property for profit is prohibited. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATION OF PROGRAM. The President can make agreements with eligible countries to facilitate the Program, which may involve distributing property through private and voluntary organizations. A Coordinator within the Department of State will oversee the Program's administration. The Coordinator is responsible for managing the Program, including receiving, repairing, storing, and shipping nonlethal personal property donated to the Federal Government or private organizations in the United States. The Secretary of Defense may provide facilities at military installations for collecting donated property. The Coordinator collaborates with various government agencies to enhance the effectiveness of the Program. Property can only be shipped after certification, and a list of approved items for transfer is maintained by the President. The Program Coordinator works with government agencies to improve effectiveness. Items can be added or removed from the approved transfer list based on recommendations from individuals in eligible foreign countries or government officials. The list excludes items for military, religious, or political use. Used shoes are not allowed, except for protective shoes with donated equipment. Quality control standards must be met for new shoes and clothing to be included. Donated property must be certified for its intended use before transfer. The President ensures donated nonlethal personal property is properly utilized by considering the end user's technical competence and establishing policies for training materials and maintenance. Personnel may be employed to manage and operate the Program, including collection points in the United States. The President can accept property donations under the Program from private organizations and voluntary organizations, with assistance from experienced logisticians. For rules on charitable contributions of property, refer to section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. SEC. 7. MONITORING OF PROGRAM. The President must ensure that donated nonlethal personal property transferred to foreign countries is used as intended and report to Congress periodically. Amendments are made to the Foreign Assistance Act regarding the transfer of equipment. The United States foreign assistance program involves the transfer of donated nonlethal personal property to foreign countries under various Acts. The Congress suggests conducting pilot projects in sub-Saharan Africa before implementing the Program to transfer donated nonlethal personal property. $20,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1997 and $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1998 for the Program."
