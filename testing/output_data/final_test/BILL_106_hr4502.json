    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Water Pollution Program Improvement Act of 2000\". Congress acknowledges the significant reduction in pollutant loadings from point sources since the 1972 Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Emphasis on managing nonpoint source pollution is crucial for meeting water quality standards. Comprehensive watershed management strategies play a vital role in coordinating water quality programs. State and local governments, businesses, and landowners will spend billions over the next 20 years on watershed management strategies to address nonpoint source pollution. States will need to develop total maximum daily load allocations for identified waters, costing between $670 million to $1.2 billion over the next 15 years. States face challenges due to lack of credible data and resources for water pollution control efforts. The General Accounting Office found that only 6 States have sufficient data to assess water quality, leading to impaired waters being identified without reliable data. Total maximum daily loads are developed based on anecdotal evidence, lacking quality assurance measures. Federal water quality management programs are impacted by this lack of data. Any Federal water quality management program must be based on sound science, undergo rigorous cost analysis, be efficiently implemented, and have strong stakeholder support. It should also recognize and accommodate State water rights allocations and the distinction between point and nonpoint sources of pollution. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act outlines regulations for nonpoint sources of pollution, emphasizing the States' exclusive authority in regulating them. SEC. 3. NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES STUDY. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will arrange a study with the National Academy of Sciences to evaluate the scientific basis, costs, and alternative programs for reducing pollutants in water sources. The study will also assess scientific methodologies related to water quality. The study will evaluate scientific methodologies, costs, and alternative programs for reducing pollutants in water sources, including coordination efforts between States and Federal agencies. It will also assess the availability of alternative programs to achieve environmental benefits in impaired waters. The study will evaluate the feasibility and costs of implementing programs to reduce nonpoint source pollution, assess the potential for pollutant trading between point and nonpoint sources, and analyze the total costs associated with reducing pollutants from point sources to meet water quality standards. The National Academy of Sciences will conduct a study to evaluate programs for reducing nonpoint source pollution and provide recommendations for improving methodologies. Before submitting the report, stakeholders will have the opportunity to review and comment on it. The report is due within 18 months to the EPA Administrator and relevant congressional committees. The National Academy of Sciences will conduct a study to evaluate programs for reducing nonpoint source pollution and provide recommendations for improving methodologies. $5,000,000 is authorized for this section. SEC. 4. RULEMAKING. In this section, \"proposed rules\" refer to specific revisions related to water quality regulations. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must consider a report from the National Academy of Sciences before making a final decision on these rules and must also seek public input through the Federal Register. The Administrator must publish recommendations in the Federal Register for public comment on proposed rules related to water quality regulations. Final determination on the rules cannot be made until the public comment period is concluded. States retain exclusive authority to regulate nonpoint sources of pollution, except as provided by future legislation. The Administrator must not alter the distinction between point and nonpoint sources of pollution as of June 1, 2000. Approval from the Administrator is not required for State measures controlling nonpoint pollution, except as authorized by section 319 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act."
