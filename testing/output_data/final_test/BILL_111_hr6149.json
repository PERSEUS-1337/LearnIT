    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Coin and Precious Metal Disclosure Act\" and requires disclosures from coin and precious metal dealers. The \"Coin and Precious Metal Disclosure Act\" mandates that covered coin or precious metal dealers must disclose fees, purchase price, melt value, resale value, and any other required information to consumers before any sale. Disclosures must be in writing and presented clearly and conspicuously, except for telephone communications. In telephone solicitations for sales subject to the Act, the solicitor must orally disclose required information to the consumer before the transaction is completed. SEC. 3. ENFORCEMENT BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. Violations of this Act or its regulations will be treated as unfair or deceptive acts under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Commission will enforce this Act with the same powers and penalties as under the FTC Act. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT BY STATES. Whenever an attorney general believes residents' interests are threatened by violations of the Act, the State can bring a civil action in court to stop the violative act, enforce compliance, seek damages, or obtain other relief. Prior notice to the Commission is required before taking legal action. The State must provide the Commission with a copy of its complaint before taking legal action. The Commission has the right to intervene, be heard on all matters, remove the action to the appropriate court, and file petitions for appeal. The attorney general can still conduct investigations and compel witnesses under state laws when bringing a civil action. The Commission has the authority to bring civil actions for violations of section 2 or related rules, preventing states from initiating similar actions during Commission proceedings. Civil actions can be filed in a district where the defendant is located, resides, conducts business, or where venue is appropriate under the law. Service of process can occur in any district where the defendant is located. Actions by Other State Officials may proceed in State court for alleged violations of civil or criminal statutes. Authorized State officers can bring actions on behalf of residents in addition to actions by the attorney general under this section. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The term \"coin or precious metal dealer\" refers to a person selling gold coins or bullion for investment. \"Melt-value\" is the estimated value of processed precious metals. \"Reasonable resale value\" is the price determined by dealers for purchasing coins or metals from consumers. Exemption for rare and collectible coins from the Act if their value is not primarily based on precious metal content and is not affected by metal value fluctuations. The Act does not impact the Telemarketing Sales Rule."
