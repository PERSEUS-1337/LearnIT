    "content": "On the first day of the 111th Congress, the House agreed to H.Res. 5, which made changes to House rules for floor proceedings. H.Res. 5 established that the rules of the previous Congress would apply to the new Congress with amendments. Four changes were made to the standing rules, including the introduction of Calendar Wednesday, a procedure allowing committee-reported legislation to be considered on Wednesdays with authorization from the committee chair or a majority of the committee. The House rules change established Calendar Wednesday for committee-reported legislation to be considered automatically on Wednesdays unless waived by the House. H.Res. 5 eliminated the need for unanimous consent or a two-thirds vote to waive the procedure, streamlining the process. This rule was adopted in 1909 to provide a way for committees to bring up non-privileged legislation. The House established Calendar Wednesday for committee-reported legislation to be considered automatically on Wednesdays, initially proving ineffective in ensuring equal opportunity for committees. The rule was adjusted to allow committee majorities to bring up measures without party leadership approval. However, the House later relied more on suspension of the rules in the 1960s, making Calendar Wednesday procedure rare. Committees now prefer measures to be considered under suspension of the rules or special rules reported by the Rules Committee. The recent rules change allows committees to request the Calendar Wednesday procedure with a simple majority vote, instead of requiring all committees alphabetically. H.Res. 5 added a paragraph to grant the presiding officer the authority to postpone legislation under special rules. In the 110th Congress, special rules routinely included a provision giving the Speaker the authority to postpone consideration of legislation. Adding a paragraph to the standing rules eliminates the need for special rules to permit postponement. Most special rules expedite procedural steps before final passage, allowing limited time for offering amendments before moving to final consideration. In the House, the \"previous question\" motion ends debate and prevents further amendments and motions on a bill. Special rules in the past granted the Speaker the authority to postpone consideration of legislation when necessary. The rule (H.Res. 574) for considering the use of the United States Armed Forces against Iraq allowed 17 hours of debate and consideration of two amendments, with an additional hour of debate. The Speaker was authorized to postpone consideration of the legislation, which was done twice in October 2002. This provision has been included more frequently in special rules in recent years. In the 110th Congress, a provision allowing the Speaker to delay consideration of legislation after a motion to recommit was offered was included in 98% of special rules. The motion to recommit with instructions to report back \"forthwith\" provided a last chance for minority party members to offer amendments before final passage. The House postponed consideration of a bill six times in the 110th Congress, with four instances occurring after a motion to recommit was offered. The standing rules include authority to postpone measures under special rules, reflecting past patterns in Rules development. For example, in the 106th Congress, special rules allowed the presiding officer to postpone a request for a recorded vote on any amendment. In the 107th Congress, House Rule XVIII was amended to grant this authority. House Rule XVIII was amended to grant the presiding officer the authority to bring an amendment immediately before the House. H.Res. 5 also amended House Rule XIX to require motions to recommit with instructions to consist only of directions to report back an amendment \"forthwith.\" Minority party members are given preferential recognition to offer the motion, with 10 minutes of debate allowed even if the motion has no instructions. If a motion to recommit lacks instructions, adoption would return the bill to the committee in its original form. The House Rule XVIII was amended to allow the presiding officer to bring an amendment before the House immediately. H.Res. 5 also changed House Rule XIX to require motions to recommit with instructions to only direct the committee to report back an amendment \"forthwith.\" Motions to recommit without instructions are still allowed and now debatable, giving proponents a chance to discuss desired actions regarding the legislation. In the 110th Congress, motions to recommit with instructions proposed that the committee report back \"promptly\" with an amendment, but not \"forthwith,\" meaning no immediate action was required. These instructions were advisory and did not compel the committee to take any specific action. In the 110th Congress, motions to recommit with non-forthwith instructions were offered more frequently, creating a difficult choice for Members who supported both the underlying measure and the amendment in the motion. Voting for the motion would send the measure back to committee, potentially delaying or defeating the bill. In the 110th Congress, motions to recommit with non-forthwith instructions were offered more frequently, creating a difficult choice for Members who supported both the underlying measure and the amendment in the motion. Some argued that using non-forthwith instructions to present specific policy amendments was unnecessary, as forthwith instructions could achieve the same goal. However, there were procedural differences between the two types of instructions, with forthwith instructions subject to more restrictions on the content of amendments. In the 110th Congress, motions to recommit with non-forthwith instructions were used frequently, providing an alternative to forthwith instructions for proposing amendments. Non-forthwith instructions did not require an immediate consideration of amendments and allowed for instructions without proposing an amendment. This flexibility allowed for motions to recommit with amendatory instructions that could potentially violate budget enforcement rules to be offered with non-forthwith instructions to avoid immediate points of order. In the past, motions to recommit instructed committees to take action, such as conducting research or holding hearings. These instructions were not binding, but now they are no longer allowed. Non-forthwith instructions could be included in the motion to secure time for debate or delay consideration. In previous Congresses, a motion to recommit was not debatable. Prior to the 111th Congress, straight motions to recommit were not debatable, while those with instructions were. House Rule XIX was amended to allow 10 minutes of debate on any motion to recommit. Debate is now in order on both straight motions to recommit and motions with instructions. Other procedures for debate time remain the same. The rules change allows Members to offer a motion to recommit, sending the bill back to committee for further discussion. This gives Members the opportunity to express their reasons for opposition or suggest alternative proposals. The time for debate on motions to recommit was last amended in 1995. The House rules were amended to allow a motion to recommit with instructions on a bill or joint resolution, removing a provision that prohibited holding a vote open for the sole purpose of reversing the outcome. In 1973, House rules set a minimum time of 15 minutes for electronic votes, with the option to reduce subsequent votes to 5 minutes each. The presiding officer can allow additional time for Members to vote beyond the minimum requirement. H.Res. 5 aimed to limit the presiding officer's discretion in allowing extra voting time. The House provision in the 110th Congress aimed to restrict presiding officers from extending voting time by electronic device to reverse vote outcomes. Concerns arose about enforceability and lack of immediate procedural redress. In the 110th Congress, a vote was held open for approximately half an hour, with claims that leadership did so to persuade Members to switch their votes. Members could only enforce the rule collaterally by raising a question of privileges of the House later on. It was unclear how the rule could be enforced immediately during a vote. The chair held a vote open to reverse the outcome, causing procedural difficulties on how to handle the extended vote. Enforcing the rule through a question of privileges of the House avoided these issues. The Speaker's announcements at the start of each Congress provide insight into House operations and the legislative process. Modifications were made in the 111th Congress regarding the closing of electronic votes and the use of the House floor. The Speaker announced modifications to the 1995 policy on closing electronic votes, endorsing existing practices. This change was prompted by a previous incident in the 110th Congress. The House rules set a minimum, but not a maximum, on the length of time an electronic vote can be held open. The Speaker announced modifications to the 1995 policy on closing electronic votes, endorsing existing practices. The presiding officer exercises discretion on when to close a vote, ensuring all Members have the opportunity to vote. The 2009 modification states that presiding officers should await the Clerk's certification of a complete and accurate vote tally. The Select Committee did not recommend including a detailed description of the vote closing practice in the announcement. The presiding officer and clerks follow established practices for closing electronic votes, allowing time for Members to vote or change their votes before closing the electronic voting stations. The announcement does not include a detailed description of the practice to maintain flexibility for potential changes. The final vote count is recorded on a \"tally slip\" and announced by the presiding officer. The Speaker has authority over the House and prohibits the use of the chamber for mock proceedings or political rallies, as stated in House Rule IV. During the August recess of 2008, Members of the House conducted simulated legislative proceedings in the House chamber to address energy policy issues. The Speaker's policy clarified that such use of the chamber was not appropriate and should not happen again."
