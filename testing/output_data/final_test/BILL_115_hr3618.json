Common behavioral issues often lead to suspension, expulsion, or incarceration, with zero-tolerance policies contributing to increased juvenile incarceration rates.

The Office aims to prevent juveniles from developing criminal records due to school behavior and to decrease the number of incarcerated juveniles. The Office of School and Discipline Policy, in collaboration with other agencies, collects data on juvenile arrests for school rule violations, promotes alternatives to detention, and examines the impact of school resource officers on juvenile arrest rates.
