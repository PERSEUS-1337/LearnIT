    "content": "Agricultural conservation has been a public policy issue for over 60 years, initially focusing on reducing soil erosion and improving water quality for farm production. By the early 1980s, concerns grew about environmental problems from agricultural activities. In 1985, Congress enacted four major new conservation programs to address these issues. In 1985, Congress enacted four major new conservation programs in the conservation title of the Food Security Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-198): the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Sodbuster, Conservation Compliance, and Swampbuster. These programs, administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), were the first to address environmental issues related to off-farm impacts of agricultural activities. Subsequent farm bills in 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008 reflected a rapid evolution of the conservation agenda, with increased influence from environmentalists and non-agricultural interests in policy formulation. Mandatory spending for these programs was introduced for the first time, funded through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) borrowing authority. The conservation agenda has expanded to address various natural resource concerns such as wildlife habitat, air quality, wetlands restoration, and sustainable agriculture. Conservation programs have received support from producers and Congress, leading to the reauthorization and expansion of existing programs and the creation of new ones in the 2008 farm bill. The bill addressed issues like payment structure, geographic targeting, program complexity, large-scale conservation efforts, and cost-effectiveness measurement. Funding was a significant aspect of the 2008 farm bill debate. The 2008 farm bill debate focused on funding constraints and competition among conservation groups and farming interests for resources to expand conservation programs. USDA's efforts have targeted working lands, land retirement, and conservation easements, with increased funding for conservation programs since the 2002 farm bill. Recent policy trends show less emphasis on land retirement and more on land producing row crops. The 2008 farm bill expanded program benefits to include specialty crop producers, organic production, forested lands, pollinator habitat, and nutrient management. USDA agencies like NRCS and FSA provide technical assistance and administer conservation programs. Other USDA agencies support with research and educational assistance, along with partnerships with federal agencies, state, and local entities. The USDA agricultural conservation effort involves a wide array of partners providing funds and expertise. There are over 20 conservation programs assisting private landowners with natural resource concerns, grouped into various categories. Working lands programs allow private land to remain in production while implementing conservation practices. Funding levels for these programs are illustrated in Figure 1. The USDA offers over 20 conservation programs to assist private landowners with natural resource concerns. These programs, such as EQIP, WHIP, AMA, AWEP, and CSP, aim to address specific resource concerns or geographic areas. Land retirement programs provide federal payments for temporary changes in land use, while conservation easements impose permanent land-use restrictions. The largest land retirement program is the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which removes land from production and can enroll up to 32 million acres. Other programs like the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) and the Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP) use long-term or permanent easements to protect wetlands and grasslands. The Farmland Protection Program (FPP) restricts productive farmland from being developed for non-farm purposes. Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations are two separate programs with similar objectives. The Watershed Rehabilitation program, authorized in 2000, aims to rehabilitate watershed structures created under the Small Watershed Programs. NRCS partners with local sponsors for soil conservation, flood prevention, water conservation, and land utilization. USDA administers various conservation programs, including technical assistance programs like Conservation Operations. The USDA administers various conservation programs such as Sodbuster and Swampbuster, which require compliance with conservation program requirements for erodible lands and wetlands. The 2008 farm bill reauthorizes existing conservation programs, modifies some, and creates new ones to address eligibility, enrollment, and payment limits. The 2008 farm bill reauthorized conservation programs like CRP with reduced acreage cap to 32 million acres. There are general and continuous sign-ups for land enrollment in CRP. Lawmakers will focus on USDA's implementation of these provisions in the 111th Congress. The 2008 farm bill reauthorized conservation programs like CRP with a reduced acreage cap of 32 million acres. A general sign-up was expected to enroll additional acres due to the cap being reached in 2009. USDA faced delays in offering the CRP general sign-up due to executive branch control on mandatory program spending. Despite Congress granting USDA statutory authority and funding to enroll 32 million acres, OMB procedures initially hindered USDA from reaching this goal. A new general sign-up (sign-up number 39) was eventually announced in August 2010. In August 2010, sign-up number 39 for the CRP program enrolled 4.3 million acres out of 4.8 million acres offered. Over half of the enrolled acreage was set to expire in 2010 or had expired in 2009. Texas, Colorado, and Kansas had the most offers accepted. Currently, there are 31.3 million acres enrolled in CRP, with 4.4 million acres set to expire in 2011. Room for another general sign-up may be created. Future general sign-ups for EQIP could be impacted by administrative PAYGO if no congressional action is taken. The 2008 farm bill increased authorized mandatory funding for EQIP, but actual funding levels have been reduced by nearly $1.16 billion from FY2005 through FY2010. This reduction has been at the request of both current and previous Administrations, leading to a backlog of unfunded applications. The number of pending applications for the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) exceeds available funding, with concerns that low funding levels deter producers from applying. Despite reductions, total funding continues to increase. The original Conservation Security Program faced implementation challenges and criticism, leading to the establishment of CSP in the 2008 farm bill. NRCS implements CSP through a final rule published in 2010. Applications for CSP are accepted continuously and funded based on cut-off dates. In FY2010, over 10,600 contracts were funded, enrolling 12.7 million acres. Top states for applications were Missouri, Minnesota, and Iowa. Implementation issues may arise due to cost restrictions set by the 2008 farm bill, aiming for a national average program cost of $18 per acre. The 2008 farm bill set cost restrictions for the CSP program, aiming for an average $18 per-acre cost. This could lead to a reduction in per-acre payment offers to producers during sign-ups. The lower funding level may impact the type of acres enrolled, with a focus on range, pasture, and non-industrial private forest land. Additionally, limitations on lands eligible for WHIP enrollment were introduced, emphasizing wildlife habitat development on private agricultural land, nonindustrial private forest land, and tribal lands. The 2008 farm bill introduced cost restrictions for the CSP program, aiming for an average $18 per-acre cost. This may lead to reduced payment offers to producers during sign-ups, with a focus on range, pasture, and non-industrial private forest land. The WHIP program now emphasizes wildlife habitat development on private agricultural land, nonindustrial private forest land, and tribal lands, shifting financial assistance towards agriculturally intensive states in the West and Midwest. The 2008 farm bill reauthorized the WRP program with increased enrollment to 3,041,200 acres and mandatory funding of $441 million for FY2009. Congress may reduce WRP enrollment due to budget constraints, and a provision in the bill extended the land ownership requirement for program eligibility. The 2008 farm bill reauthorized the WRP program with increased enrollment and funding. A bill extended the land ownership requirement for program eligibility from one year to seven years, with exemptions for inheritance, foreclosure, or other valid reasons. An investigation found NRCS often ignored the ownership requirement, leading to concerns about the impact of the seven-year rule on eligible lands and enrollment. The 2008 farm bill reauthorized the FPP program with changes to protect agricultural land use, promote state and local farmland protection, and emphasize longer-term cooperative agreements. Some conservation organizations support the increased authority for partners, while others are concerned about potential inconsistencies within the program. The 2008 farm bill expanded USDA conservation activities, creating new programs like one for the Chesapeake Bay region. The bill authorizes $188 million for conservation in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Progress in implementing these programs varies and may be of interest for congressional oversight. The 2008 farm bill debated funding for specific geographic regions, including the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Program. This program, also known as the \"Open Fields\" program, authorizes state grants for public access to wildlife-dependent recreation. The bill provides $50 million in mandatory funds for the program, implemented by the Farm Service Agency through an interim rule. Only state and tribal governments are eligible for grants under this program. The 2008 farm bill provision (Sec. 12020) makes producers planting an insurable crop on native sod ineligible for crop insurance and the NAP program for five years. USDA established a sign-up date of February 15, 2009, but no governors opted to participate. The provision may apply to virgin prairie converted to cropland in the Prairie Pothole National Priority Area if elected by the state. Additional participation opportunities are possible but unlikely if the program remains voluntary. The 2008 farm bill included a conservation provision to support farmers and ranchers in carbon and emissions trading markets. USDA was directed to establish guidelines for carbon storage and environmental services markets. This aimed to address measurement issues, expand conservation programs, and provide incentives for agriculture and forestry to reduce emissions and adopt energy efficiency measures. USDA announced the creation of a federal Conservation and Land Management Environmental Services Board to develop guidelines for ecosystem services and carbon trading. A public advisory committee will include farmers, ranchers, and tribal representatives. USDA also established an Office of Ecosystem Services and Markets to assist in creating markets for ecosystem services in farming and forestry. The USDA established the Office of Environmental Markets (OEM) in March 2010 to create markets for ecosystem services in farming and forestry. Payment limits for conservation programs were expanded in the 2008 farm bill, including a limit on income eligibility. Most conservation programs are now affected by both income and payment limitations, with payment limits being the maximum amount of funding a person or entity can receive. These limits are controversial due to concerns about supporting larger operations and who should receive payments. Programs with higher payments often benefit farms and ranches with larger acreage, leading to debates between supporters of smaller farms and opponents of large animal feeding operations. Opponents of large animal feeding operations argue that conservation programs disproportionately benefit large agricultural producers by providing higher payments to contracts with more acres enrolled. Small farm advocates claim that this limits funding available for small producers. Critics also point out that cost-share assistance in programs like EQIP goes towards expensive practices in concentrated animal feeding operations, further subsidizing environmentally destructive methods. Supporters of higher payment limits argue that conservation programs should prioritize land with the greatest need. Conservation programs should prioritize land with the greatest environmental need and not be limited to a price per participant. Higher payment limits allow for greater environmental stewardship on farms and ranches, especially larger operations with more significant natural resource concerns. Payment limits on restoration agreements could discourage enrolling larger conservation easements, which are highly desirable. The AGI limit sets a maximum income for eligibility in program benefits, with the 2008 farm bill increasing the AGI limitation for conservation programs compared to commodity farm support programs. The AGI limit for conservation programs is higher than that for commodity farm support programs, with a new threshold of $1,000,000 for non-farm income AGI. Exceptions apply if a significant portion of AGI comes from farming sources. The USDA can waive this limit on a case-by-case basis for environmentally sensitive land. This higher limit aims to promote environmental stewardship on larger farms and ranches. Supporters of AGI limits believe that tighter limits benefit small producers and gain additional public support for agricultural programs. Opponents argue that producer enrollment in conservation programs benefits the general public regardless of wealth. Conservation program funding is mainly mandatory through the Commodity Credit Corporation, with discretionary funding for technical assistance. Issues for Congress include reductions in mandatory funding, increased earmarks in discretionary funding, fund accountability, and quantifying environmental benefits of conservation practices. The 2002 farm bill authorized significant increases in mandatory funding for conservation programs, funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation. Despite this, many programs have been reduced or capped since FY2003, often at the request of the Bush Administration. Since FY2003, there have been spending reductions in various programs, with some like EQIP repeatedly reduced below authorized levels. EQIP's authorized mandatory funding was cut by almost $1.16 billion from FY2005 through FY2010. Despite these reductions, total mandatory funding for conservation programs has remained relatively constant at over $4 billion annually. The conservation title in the 2008 farm bill received increased funding, seen as a victory by supporters during the debate. For more information on reductions in mandatory program spending, refer to CRS Report R41245. Supporters of conservation programs saw a victory in the 2008 farm bill with increased funding, but were concerned by reductions in mandatory funding requested in the FY2010 and FY2011 President's budgets. Despite these reductions, overall funding for conservation programs has remained constant at over $4 billion annually. Advocates argue that these limitations compromise the programs' ability to provide benefits, while others believe the reductions are necessary for reducing agricultural expenditures or reallocating funds. Overall, funding for conservation programs has not been reduced, but there is a possibility of spending reductions due to tighter budget constraints. The Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations program has seen a decline in annual appropriations from $200 million in FY2002 to $30 million in FY2010, with an increase in earmarks. The program also received $145 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Earmarks accounted for 97% of funding in FY2009 and 74% in FY2010. The FY2011 budget request sought zero funding for the Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations program due to earmarks. Approximately 300 unfunded authorized watershed projects totaling over $1 billion exist. Two key issues are NRCS's capacity to meet technical assistance demand and funding for technical assistance costs. The 2002 farm bill increased financial assistance in conservation programs, leading to a higher demand for technical assistance. NRCS allowed third-party providers to assist producers, with 1,140 individuals and businesses certified as of February 2010. Despite an increase in capacity with third-party providers, NRCS is facing personnel attrition in critical occupations. The 2008 farm bill raised funding for conservation programs, potentially increasing demand for technical assistance. Congress has addressed funding for technical assistance in mandatory programs in the past, with conflicting interpretations resolved through legislation in 2002, 2005, and 2008. The central issue is whether NRCS can use mandatory programs' funding for technical assistance. The 2008 farm bill raised funding for conservation programs, leading to increased demand for technical assistance. Congress enacted clarifying language in 2009 to address the issue of funding for technical assistance in non-1985 farm bill programs. The new language allows the use of CCC funds for administrative expenses and technical assistance for programs established or amended in the 2008 farm bill. Funding authority for most farm bill programs expires at the end of FY2012, requiring further congressional action. The funding authority for most farm bill programs expires at the end of FY2012. In FY2008, NRCS conducted its first stand-alone audit with KPMG but could not provide an opinion due to lack of documentation for transactions and account balances. NRCS has since taken corrective actions to address these issues. The NRCS has taken corrective actions to address deficiencies found in audits, including training employees in accounting principles and developing an automated tool for general ledger accounts. Despite these actions, a FY2009 audit returned a no-opinion result due to the agency's inability to provide material in support of transactions and account balances. The 111th Congress has taken action on this issue, with hearings held in 2009 and 2010 to review the administration of conservation contracts and programs. In FY2009, Congress allocated $10 million in Conservation Technical Assistance funds to NRCS to improve program and financial management. NRCS is expected to enhance budgeting, accounting, contracting, and information technology systems with the funds. A report to Congress on fund usage is required, along with a report on the 2008 audit and corrective actions. USDA's CEAP project measures environmental benefits of conservation programs to aid policymakers. The Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) aims to assist policymakers in developing and implementing conservation programs effectively. It is supported by the conservation community for evaluating conservation program outcomes. Despite strides in quantifying environmental benefits, data availability remains a limitation. The Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) has gathered enormous data, but little has been shared publicly. Initial results show benefits from conservation practices in the upper Mississippi river basin. Some support the meticulous assessment system for statistical credibility. Conservation programs offer financial assistance, but the assessment does not link benefits to specific federal programs. Agricultural conservation issues in the 111th Congress focus on ecosystem services. Issues for agricultural conservation in the 111th Congress revolve around ecosystem services markets, climate change, bioenergy, CAFO regulations, greenhouse gas emissions reporting, wetlands mitigation, and production pressures from corn-based ethanol. Agriculture and forestry are increasingly participating in emerging ecosystem services markets, gaining support from various stakeholders. Market-based approaches are seen as beneficial for broader societal impacts. Market-based approaches in agriculture and forestry aim to provide environmental benefits alongside traditional services. Ecosystem goods and services, such as water filtration and carbon storage, are essential for society but often not compensated for. The degradation of these services over time is a concern. Market-based approaches in agriculture and forestry aim to compensate providers of ecosystem services, such as water filtration and carbon storage, which are often not rewarded in the marketplace. This could create a business opportunity for these sectors to participate in private markets by offering services like creating, restoring, and preserving natural resources areas, or capturing and storing carbon to mitigate climate change. Conservation practices on agricultural land could also lead to the development of environmental credits and benefits for sale or trade. Market-based approaches in agriculture and forestry incentivize producers to develop environmental credits through conservation practices like reduced tillage and wetland restoration. Programs such as EQIP, AMA, CSP, and WRP offer financial incentives for implementing these practices, which can lead to benefits like carbon sequestration and water quality improvements that can be sold or traded in market-based systems. The inclusion of market provisions in legislation for agriculture and forestry sectors has raised questions about how USDA will address barriers to developing ecosystem goods and services markets. These barriers include participation challenges, measuring and valuing credits, monitoring, and enforcement. It is also unclear how USDA will connect conservation program benefits with ecosystem services markets and the role of the new USDA Office of Ecosystem Service Markets. Congress is considering the role of agriculture and forestry sectors in climate change legislation and how they can participate in addressing concerns. The agriculture and forestry sectors emit and sequester greenhouse gases, accounting for 6%-8% of total U.S. GHG emissions annually. Carbon sequestration on farm and forested lands mitigates about 11% of total annual GHG emissions in the United States. Congress is considering climate change policy options, including cap-and-trade programs to reduce emissions. The current legislative proposals do not mandate emission reductions in agriculture and forestry. Some drafters are hesitant to include these sectors due to uncertainties in measuring and monitoring activities. However, some in Congress advocate for allowing farm and forestry landowners to receive emissions allowances for carbon offsets. Various land management and farm conservation practices can help reduce GHG emissions and sequester carbon, supported by existing USDA conservation programs like EQIP, CRP, CSP, CTA, and WHIP. The USDA has expanded conservation programs like EQIP and CSP to encourage emission reductions and carbon sequestration. Programs such as CTA, AMA, EQIP, and CSP prioritize reducing emissions, affecting funding and project ranking. Under CRP, USDA has modified scoring to prioritize vegetative covers that sequester carbon and has an initiative to plant bottomland hardwoods. The USDA has recognized the potential credits generated by conservation programs like CRP's provision to plant bottomland hardwoods for carbon sequestration. Congress is addressing challenges in measuring carbon changes from forested and agricultural lands, with the 2008 farm bill including provisions to incentivize carbon sequestration and emissions reduction. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 directs the Secretary of the Interior to develop a methodology for assessing carbon sequestration and emissions from ecosystems, including measuring, monitoring, and quantifying GHG emissions and reductions. Congress is considering whether current activities provide accurate measurement of carbon levels from forest and agricultural activities. H.R. 2454 includes a new program for agriculture- and forestry-related GHG offsets within USDA. The \"Peterson amendment\" added to H.R. 2454 allowed for agricultural and forestry activities to participate in a carbon offset program under USDA. This program addressed concerns in the agricultural community regarding renewable energy requirements and recognized early emission reduction efforts by farmers and landowners. The provisions in Title V are similar to those in Title III of H.R. 2454. The provisions in Title V are similar to those in Title III of H.R. 2454, with differences in implementing agencies. S. 1733 in the Senate allows for agriculture and forestry offsets in a cap-and-trade scheme, differing from H.R. 2454 in project types, offset quantities, and program administration. The Clean Energy Partnerships Act of 2009 (S. 2729) by Senator Stabenow expands on agricultural and forestry carbon offset provisions, benefiting U.S. farmers and landowners. Renewable energy, including biofuels like corn-based ethanol, has federal support but faces criticism for environmental consequences. Expansion of ethanol production could have significant impacts. The expansion of corn-based ethanol production in the U.S. could have significant consequences for traditional agricultural crop production and rural economies. Supporters of renewable fuels claim it would bring economic benefits, but there are concerns about environmental impacts and regional economic consequences. Cellulosic feedstocks like prairie grasses and fast-growing trees can improve the energy and environmental effects of U.S. biofuels by reducing the need for chemical fertilizers. However, concerns exist about the need for increased per-acre yields, limited feedstock supply, and lagging technology in harvesting machinery. Some groups raise concerns about environmental drawbacks of cellulosic fuels, such as soil erosion, runoff, invasive species, and wildlife habitat disruption. The 2008 farm bill expands agricultural conservation programs for energy efficiency and renewable energy feedstocks but does not address potential environmental consequences of biofuels production. Expanding conservation efforts could help counteract environmental pressures from biofuel production. EPA proposed changes to the RFS program as required by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Proposed changes to the RFS program under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 have raised concerns in the U.S. agriculture sector regarding the EISA biomass definition and the consideration of \"indirect land use\" effects in calculating GHG emissions for advanced biofuels. Amendments to the Waxman/Markey climate change and energy legislation would alter the biomass definition and restrict EPA from including international indirect land use changes in biofuels' carbon footprint assessment for at least six years."
