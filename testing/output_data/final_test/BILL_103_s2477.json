    "content": "The \"Family Forestland Preservation Tax Act of 1994\" is an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Title I focuses on estate tax provisions, specifically addressing the estate tax treatment of land under a qualified conservation easement. The \"Family Forestland Preservation Tax Act of 1994\" amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by excluding the value of real property used in timber operations and subject to a qualified conservation easement from the gross estate for estate tax purposes. The \"Family Forestland Preservation Tax Act of 1994\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude real property under a qualified conservation easement from the gross estate for estate tax purposes if a qualified conservation contribution has been made by the decedent or a family member. The amendments made by the \"Family Forestland Preservation Tax Act of 1994\" allow for the exclusion of property under a qualified conservation easement from the gross estate for estate tax purposes. This applies to estates of decedents dying after December 31, 1994, which include land subject to qualified conservation easements granted after the same date. SEC. 102 increases the recapture period for special estate tax valuation of forest lands from 10 to 25 years for properties used in timber operations. This change applies to estates of decedents dying after December 31, 1994. SEC. 201 introduces a partial inflation adjustment for timber in the treatment of capital gains. Taxpayers with qualified timber gain can deduct a percentage of the gain from their gross income. The qualified timber gain is the lesser of the net capital gain for the year or the net capital gain from timber activities. The qualified percentage, not exceeding 50 percent, is determined by multiplying 3 percent by the number of years the taxpayer held the timber. In the case of estates or trusts, similar deductions apply. In the case of an estate or trust, the deduction for gains from sales or exchanges of capital assets is computed by excluding the portion includible by income beneficiaries as gain derived from the sale or exchange of capital assets. Coordination with existing limitations includes amendments to the maximum capital gains rate and alternative tax for corporations. The tax code is amended to include a deduction for qualified timber gain, with a partial inflation adjustment. This change is reflected in the table of sections for part I of subchapter P of chapter 1. SEC. 1203 provides a partial inflation adjustment for timber sales or exchanges after December 31, 1994. SEC. 202 excludes gain from the sale of interests in forest lands under a new section 137. The exclusion of qualified timber gain from gross income is limited to 35% or 100% for certain cases. The total excluded gain in a taxable year is the sum of qualified timber gain and $800,000. Qualified timber gain is defined for this purpose. The term 'qualified timber gain' refers to gain from the sale of real property used in timber operations to a governmental unit for conservation purposes. Timber operations and conservation purposes are defined accordingly. There is a special rule for sales to nongovernmental entities. The subsection applies to the sale or exchange of interest to a qualified organization within a 2-year period. If the transfer occurs after the taxable year of the sale or exchange, no exclusion is allowed for that year, but the taxpayer's tax for the transfer year is reduced by the amount that would have been reduced in the sale or exchange year. The subsection applies to the sale or exchange of interest to a qualified organization within a 2-year period. If the transfer occurs after the taxable year of the sale or exchange, no exclusion is allowed for that year, but the taxpayer's tax for the transfer year is reduced by the amount that would have been reduced in the sale or exchange year. Conforming Amendment: The table of sections for part III of subchapter B of chapter 1 is amended by striking the item relating to section 137 and by inserting new items after the item relating to section 136. SEC. 137. Sales of interests in certain forest lands and SEC. 138. Cross references to other Acts. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1994. SEC. 203. Application of passive loss limitations to timber activities. For closely held timber activities, Treasury regulations do not apply if management hours are generally less than 100 per year. Closely held activities are defined as those with 80% ownership held by 5 or fewer individuals or family members. Limited partnerships are not considered closely held. The term \"timber activity\" includes planting, cultivating, cutting, or preparing trees for market. The amendments in this section apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1994."
