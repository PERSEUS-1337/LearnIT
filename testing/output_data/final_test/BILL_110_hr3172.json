    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a condensed summary of the section's title and its purpose. The \"Freedom To Save Act of 2007\" allows households in the food stamp program to have assets up to $2,000 ($3,000 for elderly or disabled members). States can adjust asset limits through categorical eligibility. Unearned income from savings, retirement, or educational accounts can reduce benefits. States may exclude certain assets following TANF or Medicaid rules. Recent qualitative research indicates that asset limits discourage low-income families from saving, especially in formal financial institutions, as saving can lead to reduced or eliminated benefits in the welfare system. Without personal savings, it is harder for low-income families to transition from government assistance to self-sufficiency, hindering the goal of welfare reform. 1996 welfare reform requires individuals to spend down personal savings to qualify for assistance, leaving families vulnerable to income shocks. SSI has asset limits of $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples, penalizing those who save money while receiving benefits. TANF is a cash assistance program. The 1996 welfare reform law allows states to set asset limits for TANF, with some states eliminating the limit entirely. Virginia and Ohio have removed the asset limit, resulting in administrative savings and no increase in fraud. 16 states have raised the financial asset limit for TANF, while 29 states have increased vehicle allowances. States have flexibility in setting asset criteria for public health insurance plans for children under Medicaid and SCHIP. 49 states waive asset tests, while Oregon and Texas have asset limits in their SCHIP programs. Parents face more restrictive eligibility criteria than children when applying for public health insurance. The personal savings rate was negative in 2005 and 2006, indicating that spending exceeded disposable income for the first time since the Great Depression. Asset limits are deemed inefficient and often unnecessary, as most poor and near-poor families have little to no wealth. In 2004, 17 percent of households had zero or negative net worth, while 29.6 percent had a net worth of less than $10,000. Few families meeting low income thresholds for major income support programs possess significant assets. According to a report, a significant portion of the American population, including people with disabilities, lack access to formal financial institutions. Many rely on costly check cashing and lending services, with a high percentage having no savings or checking accounts. Low-income families on public assistance are hesitant to use banks due to fears of benefit reductions. According to the Center for Social Development, savings and asset holdings by households are linked to positive outcomes like economic stability, education, and health. Increasing savings among households can lead to greater control, security, independence, and choice in their lives. Modification of asset test under food stamp program.
