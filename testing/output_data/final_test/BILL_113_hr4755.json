    "content": "The Act titled \"Access to Inpatient Rehabilitation Therapy Act of 2014\" is cited as the short title. The purpose and findings of the Act are outlined in Section 2. The \"Access to Inpatient Rehabilitation Therapy Act of 2014\" emphasizes the importance of intensive medical rehabilitation in inpatient facilities for Medicare beneficiaries to achieve full function and independent living. Medicare uses an \"intensity of therapy\" requirement, including the \"Three Hour Rule,\" to determine eligibility for treatment in these facilities. Before 2010, CMS regulations allowed various therapies to count towards the Three Hour Rule on an as-needed basis, including recreational therapy if deemed necessary by the physician and rehabilitation team. CMS revised regulations in 2010, limiting the Three Hour Rule to only include physical, occupational, and speech therapy, as well as orthotics and prosthetics. This change removed the discretion of the physician and rehabilitation team to count other therapeutic services towards the rule, leading to a lack of access to medically necessary recreational therapy for some patients. Recreational therapy in inpatient rehabilitation hospitals is provided by qualified therapists as part of a patient's care plan to restore functioning and independence. The purpose of this Act is to rely on the professional judgment of the treating physician and rehabilitation team for Medicare patients to access necessary therapy. The patient needs to be in a hospital or unit to access necessary rehabilitation services like physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, orthotics, prosthetics, and recreational therapy. The bill proposes to include recreational therapy as part of intensive rehabilitation therapy programs in inpatient rehabilitation facilities. The bill amends the Social Security Act to include recreational therapy in intensive rehabilitation programs at rehabilitation facilities, effective January 1, 2015."
