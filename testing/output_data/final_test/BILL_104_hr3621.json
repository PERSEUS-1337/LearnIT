    "content": "The Act titled \"MacBride Principles of Economic Justice Act of 1996\" requires disbursements from the International Fund for Ireland to adhere to the MacBride Principles of Economic Justice. The Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986 is amended to ensure that United States contributions increase employment opportunities in communities with high unemployment rates in Northern Ireland and benefit individuals in those communities. Additionally, conditions and understandings of the Act are revised to specify how funds may be used. The Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986 is amended to specify that funds may only be provided to individuals or entities in Northern Ireland if they comply with the principles of economic justice. Section 5(c)(2) is also amended to reflect these changes. The Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986 is amended to require individuals or entities in Northern Ireland receiving funds to comply with economic justice principles. Annual reports must reflect this requirement, and no quotas are mandated for funds. The Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986 is amended to require compliance with economic justice principles in Northern Ireland without mandating quotas. The definition of \"Northern Ireland\" is expanded to include specific counties, and \"principles of economic justice\" now include increasing representation of underrepresented religious groups in various job roles and providing adequate security. The curr_chunk discusses measures to promote equality and diversity in the workplace, such as providing security for minority employees, banning provocative emblems, advertising job openings publicly, attracting applicants from underrepresented religious groups, ensuring fair layoff procedures, abolishing discriminatory employment criteria, and developing training programs. The curr_chunk focuses on establishing programs to train and recruit minority employees for skilled jobs, appointing a senior management staff member to oversee employment efforts, and implementing principles to promote diversity in the workplace. The amendments made by this section will take effect 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act."
