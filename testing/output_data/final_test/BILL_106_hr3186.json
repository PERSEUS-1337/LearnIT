    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Telecommunications Merger Review Act of 1999\". The Congress enacted the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to reduce regulation. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have primary authority to review mergers, while the Federal Communications Commission has limited expertise in analyzing industry concentration and competition effects. The Federal Communications Commission has broad authority over telecommunications industry mergers, allowing it to impose terms and conditions on licenses and authorizations. However, this authority is criticized for overreaching its statutory mandate and causing delays and inconsistencies in decision-making. Parties to mergers must obtain FCC approval, even if other agencies like the Department of Justice are involved. The Federal Communications Commission's rulemaking and enforcement powers ensure licensees, including those in telecommunications industry mergers, operate in the public interest. Separate approval authority by the FCC for such mergers is deemed unnecessary due to the expertise of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission in matters of industry concentration and competition effects. The Federal Communications Commission's review of telecommunications industry mergers is deemed unnecessary, causing duplication of effort, inconsistency, and delays. This imposes unwarranted costs and fails to serve the public interest. The Clayton Act is amended to repeal merger approval authority and the authority to condition licenses. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to give the Commission authority to impose terms or conditions on license transfers in mergers subject to review by the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to grant the Commission the authority to impose terms or conditions on license transfers in mergers subject to review by the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission. This includes restrictions and conditions necessary for carrying out the Act, as well as regulations for alien-operated amateur radio stations. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to grant the Commission authority over mergers subject to review by the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, ensuring competition in commerce. SEC. 314 of the Communications Act of 1934 ensures the preservation of competition in commerce. The Communications Act of 1934 prohibits the Commission from reviewing or imposing conditions on mergers or transactions subject to DOJ or FTC review. DOJ and FTC have primary authority to review mergers involving license transfers under the Act. The Communications Act of 1934 prohibits the Commission from reviewing or imposing conditions on mergers or transactions subject to DOJ or FTC review. If the DOJ or FTC issues a decision on a merger involving license transfers, the Commission must authorize the assignment or transfer accordingly. The Commission is restricted from reviewing or imposing conditions on mergers subject to DOJ or FTC review. If neither agency issues a decision on a merger, the Commission cannot review the application for license transfer unless a written statement of nonintervention is issued. The Commission must conclude any review of a merger within 60 days of DOJ or FTC decision. A presumption of unconditional approval applies, and if no decision is made within 60 days, the application is deemed approved."
