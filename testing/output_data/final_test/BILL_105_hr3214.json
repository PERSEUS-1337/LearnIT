    "content": "LEVY PERMITTED ONLY AFTER APPROVAL OF PRIVATE, VOLUNTEER PANEL OF ATTORNEYS, CPAS, AND ENROLLED AGENTS. The Internal Revenue Code now requires approval by a private panel before a levy can be made on a person's salary, wages, or property for unpaid taxes. The levy review panel must determine if other collection methods are more suitable before approving a levy. The Internal Revenue Code mandates a private panel review before a levy can be imposed for unpaid taxes. The panel consists of 3 individuals with expertise in Federal taxation, including attorneys, certified public accountants, or enrolled agents. The levy review panel for an internal revenue district is selected jointly by the IRS district director and appointing authorities from a pool of attorneys, CPAs, and enrolled agents. The appropriate appointing authority varies based on the profession, such as the head of the State bar association for attorneys. The levy review panel for each internal revenue district is appointed jointly by the IRS district director and appointing authorities from different professional organizations, such as the State bar association for attorneys, the Society of Certified Public Accountants for CPAs, and the National Association of Enrolled Agents for enrolled agents. Meetings are held by the panel for any district. The levy review panel for each internal revenue district meets as specified by the IRS district director. Members serve without compensation or reimbursement for expenses. They are treated as special government employees to avoid conflicts of interest. Members of a levy review panel are not personally liable under Federal law for any claims arising from their acts or omissions within their service on the panel, except for criminal, willful, or malicious conduct, acts for personal gain, or actions outside the scope of their panel service. This provision does not affect other immunities and protections available to panel members. The levy review panel members are not personally liable under Federal law for any claims arising from their service, except for specific misconduct. The panel's decisions do not affect other legal rights or immunities available to Federal officers and employees. The Secretary can bypass the panel if tax collection is in jeopardy, and return information remains protected. The amendment made by subsection (a) regarding levy information applies to levies issued after 6 months from the enactment of this Act."
