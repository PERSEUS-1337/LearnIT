    "content": "The paper describes SCAN, a framework for learning abstract concepts in the visual domain through fast symbol association. SCAN learns concepts from unsupervised experiences and represents them as compositional and hierarchical structures. It requires few pairings between symbols and images and makes no assumptions about the form of symbol representations. Once trained, SCAN enables multimodal bi-directional inference. SCAN is a framework for learning abstract concepts in the visual domain through fast symbol association. It allows for multimodal bi-directional inference and manipulation of visual concepts through symbolic instructions and logical recombination operations. This enables SCAN to imagine novel visual concepts by breaking away from its training data distribution. The techniques in artificial intelligence often require a lot of data and human supervision, leading to overfitting. To bridge the gap between human and artificial intelligence, algorithms need compositional concepts that allow for reusing a set of primitives to create new and coherent concepts. Compositionality is essential for creativity, imagination, and language-based communication. Concepts are abstractions over a set of primitives, as shown in a toy hierarchy of visual concepts. The curr_chunk discusses how concepts in artificial intelligence are defined by a subset of visual primitives, such as object identity and color. As concepts move from specific to general levels of abstraction, the number of visual primitives decreases. This forms an implicit hierarchy where each parent concept is an abstraction over its children and the original set of visual primitives. Intelligent agents can learn abstract compositional concepts with little supervision by filling in values for abstracted factors from visual primitives. This process involves traversing nodes in a concept hierarchy using logical operations. The paper describes how humans acquire word meanings through unsupervised visual data paired with word labels. SCAN is a neural network model that learns grounded visual concepts through unsupervised exposure to visual data and symbol association. It uses a disentangled representation of visual primitives to discover meaningful abstractions by pairing symbol-image pairs that apply to a particular concept. The SCAN model learns visual concepts by associating symbols with visual primitives, allowing for bi-directional inference between concepts and visual samples. The model does not encode symbols, enabling it to learn synonyms for concepts. The SCAN model learns visual concepts by associating symbols with visual primitives, enabling bi-directional inference between concepts and visual samples. It defines concepts in terms of relevant visual primitives and fills in irrelevant attributes by defaulting them to their priors. This structured approach allows for efficient learning of logical recombination operators like AND, IN COMMON, and IGNORE. SCAN is a neural network model that learns compositional and hierarchical representations of visual concepts. It can be trained with minimal supervised data and is capable of manipulating and recombining existing concepts in novel ways to explore unexplored parts of the concept hierarchy. SCAN is a neural network model trained with minimal supervised data, demonstrating high accuracy and diversity in multimodal bi-directional inference and generation. It outperforms existing frameworks and incorporates logical recombination operations to explore new nodes in the concept hierarchy. No equivalent framework currently exists. Bayesian and multimodal generative models can learn from few examples but require a large number of image-symbol pairs for training. However, they underperform compared to SCAN in terms of sample diversity and breaking out of training data distribution. Concepts are abstractions over visual representational primitives defined in a K-dimensional visual representation space. Each concept is a set of assignments of probability distributions to relevant visual latent factors. In concept learning, visual latent factors are represented by probability distributions. To generate a visual sample for a concept, details for irrelevant latent primitives are filled in using a unit Gaussian prior. The notation for concepts can be simplified by using placeholder symbols for irrelevant primitives. In concept learning, visual latent factors are represented by probability distributions. The notation for concepts can be simplified by using placeholder symbols for irrelevant primitives. Concepts can be defined as sets, with binary relations and operators defined on these sets. Superordinate, subordinate, orthogonal, conjunction, overlap, and difference concepts can be defined using these operators. The goal of disentangled factor learning research is to discover the generative structure of the visual world. SCAN is built on top of \u03b2-VAE, a model for unsupervised visual disentangled factor learning. \u03b2-VAE introduces an adjustable hyperparameter \u03b2 to the original VAE framework, resulting in more disentangled latent representations by balancing reconstruction accuracy, latent channel capacity, and independence constraints. In some scenarios, the balance between reconstruction accuracy and disentangled latent representations may lean too heavily towards the latter, leading to the loss of crucial information about the scene. To address this issue, a solution from BID9 involves replacing the pixel log-likelihood term with an L2 loss in the high-level feature space of a denoising autoencoder (DAE) trained on the same data. This approach results in the \u03b2-VAE DAE architecture, optimizing an objective function that maps images from pixel space to a high-level feature space using DAE layers. The proposed SCAN framework utilizes the parametrization of visual building blocks from \u03b2-VAE 1 to learn a hierarchy of visual concepts. The latent spaces of SCAN and \u03b2-VAE are structurally identical, both being multivariate Gaussian distributions with diagonal covariance matrices. The goal is to minimize the KL divergence to ground the learned abstractions in visual primitives. The SCAN framework utilizes visual building blocks from \u03b2-VAE to learn a hierarchy of visual concepts. The abstraction step involves setting SCAN latents to narrow distributions for relevant factors and wider unit Gaussian priors for irrelevant factors. This is achieved by minimizing the forward KL divergence between the two distributions. SCAN is trained by minimizing the forward KL divergence between the conceptual latent distribution and the prior distribution. The architecture does not assume anything about the nature of the symbols used. The symbols are commonly encoded using k-hot encoding, but other encoding schemes can also be used. SCAN allows for bi-directional inference and generation using symbols like \"round, small, red\". Other encoding schemes for symbols can be used, such as word embeddings or random vectors. The model can generate visual samples corresponding to a concept by inferring the concept from a symbol and using the generative part of \u03b2-VAE. SCAN can also infer a description of an image in terms of learnt concepts via their symbols. The compositional and hierarchical structure of the concept latent space learned by SCAN allows for concept recombination using logical operators like AND, IN COMMON, and IGNORE. These operators are implemented within a conditional convolutional module to imagine new concepts by combining two inferred distributions corresponding to different concepts. The conditional convolutional module in SCAN allows for concept recombination by combining two inferred distributions using recombination operators. The module outputs a recombined multivariate Gaussian distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix, selecting the appropriate transformation matrix parametrised by \u03c8. The module is trained through a visual grounding process, pairing recombination instructions with example images. The recombination module in SCAN is trained by minimizing a specific function, resulting in a latent distribution that corresponds to visual concepts. The performance of SCAN is evaluated on a dataset from DeepMind Lab, providing control over the generative process. Visual frames were collected from a static viewpoint in a room with a single object. The generative process in the dataset involved factors like wall, floor, and object colors, as well as object identity. Additional variations were added by the DeepMind Lab engine. The dataset was split into two subsets for training and evaluation. The model performed better in imagining new concepts with higher accuracy and lower diversity scores compared to closed form implementations. The model showed higher accuracy and lower diversity scores in imagining new concepts compared to closed form implementations. The model was able to accurately describe images with diverse visual attributes, including synonyms, and made intuitive confusions like orange and yellow colors. SCAN demonstrates the ability to learn new concepts from few image-symbol pairs. The model's concept understanding is evaluated through qualitative analysis of sym2img and img2sym samples. SCAN is trained on a subset of concepts from an implicit hierarchy, each associated with visual examples. The model demonstrates a good understanding of various concepts and can produce visual samples that match the meaning of the concept, with good variability over irrelevant factors. Confusions may arise due to the sampling process. The model can also correctly describe images with consistent labels and good diversity. Evolution of concept understanding in SCAN involves teaching the model new concepts through progressively diverse visual examples. The model's understanding is tested after training on sets of visual examples. After training SCAN on sets of visual examples, the model's understanding of concepts is tested through sym2img sampling. The number of specified latent units decreases as the diversity of visual examples increases. The remaining highly specified latents correspond to visual primitives representing wall hue and brightness. The accuracy and diversity of sym2img samples produced by SCAN are quantitatively compared to baselines. The text discusses models like SCAN U, JMVAE BID32, and TrELBO BID34 that use visual representations to ground conceptual meanings. It explains how accuracy and diversity metrics are used to evaluate the models' performance, with high accuracy indicating understanding of symbols and high diversity indicating abstraction learning. There is a correlation between accuracy and diversity, as low accuracy often leads to higher diversity scores. A pre-trained classifier with 99% accuracy is used to evaluate the models. The text discusses models like SCAN U, JMVAE BID32, and TrELBO BID34 that use visual representations to ground conceptual meanings. Accuracy and diversity metrics are used to evaluate the models' performance, with high accuracy indicating understanding of symbols and high diversity indicating abstraction learning. A pre-trained classifier with 99% accuracy is used to evaluate the models. Achieving 99% average accuracy over all data generative factors to evaluate the accuracy of img2sym samples. Top-3 accuracy is used for color-related factors. Diversity of visual samples is evaluated by estimating the KL divergence of the inferred factor distribution with the flat prior. Models were trained on a random subset of 133 out of 18,883 possible concepts sampled from all levels of the implicit hierarchy with ten visual examples each. Accuracy and diversity metrics were calculated on two sets of sym2img samples. SCAN outperforms all baselines in terms of accuracy and diversity on both train and test sets of sym2img samples. Increasing the level of disentanglement within the visual representation improves accuracy and diversity. Baselines with poor sample accuracy tend to have good diversity scores due to a relatively flat classifier distribution. TrELBO learns an entangled and unstructured conceptual representation that is accurate but stereotypical. JMVAE is a model that closely matches SCAN in performance by exploiting the structure of symbolic inputs to learn a nearly disentangled joint posterior. However, JMVAE training is more sensitive to architectural and hyperparameter choices, often leading to mode collapse. The JMVAE model, while comparable to SCAN in performance, often experiences mode collapse due to sensitivity to architectural and hyperparameter choices. In contrast, SCAN is able to exploit the k-hot structure of symbols and compositional nature of representations for better generalization to the test set. In Section 4, a recombination module was trained to traverse the hierarchy of concepts without symbolic references, showing promising results in test operators. The recombination operator module successfully reached nodes for 50 novel test concepts in SCAN, preserving accuracy and diversity. JMVAE, a baseline model, showed lower accuracy but increased diversity. The recombination operator training improves diversity by utilizing visual grounding similar to SCAN. Additional experiments were conducted on the CelebA dataset after minimal preprocessing. Our experiments on the CelebA dataset involved minimal preprocessing and testing the robustness of SCAN to learning concepts in an adversarial setting using all 40 attributes, some of which are not useful due to various reasons. SCAN trained on CelebA dataset using controlled capacity schedule BID4 for \u03b2-VAE training outperformed JMVAE and TrELBO baselines. The model learned the meaning of a large number of attributes, as shown in FIG2 with sym2img samples compared to baseline models. SCAN outperformed JMVAE and TrELBO in generating more faithful and diverse samples. Unlike the baselines, SCAN learned meaningful directions of continuous variability in its latent space, allowing for the generation of samples with various attributes by varying the attribute values. This contrasts with JMVAE and TrELBO, which only produce meaningful samples when attributes are set to specific values. SCAN, unlike JMVAE and TrELBO, cannot enforce attributes like darker skin colors in generated samples. It may pick up implicit biases in the dataset, associating terms like \"attractive\" with young white females. The paper introduces a new approach to learning visual concepts grounded in independent abstractions. The paper introduces a new approach called SCAN for learning grounded visual concepts through neural networks. SCAN can discover abstract concepts from minimal symbol-image pairs and outperforms baselines in generating diverse and accurate image samples from symbolic instructions.

SCAN can discover abstract concepts from minimal symbol-image pairs and outperforms baselines in generating diverse and accurate image samples from symbolic instructions. The structure of the learnt concepts in SCAN allows for training an extension that can perform logical recombination operators, enabling traversal of the concept hierarchy and imagining new concepts. The representations learnt by SCAN are sample-efficient and applicable across various problem domains like reinforcement learning, classification, control, and planning. The model details of \u03b2-VAE used in the approach are specified, including the architecture and training setup involving a denoising autoencoder. The DAE architecture included four convolutional layers with kernel size 4 and stride 2, followed by a bottleneck layer of 100 neurons and four deconvolutional layers. ELU non-linearities were used, and the optimizer was Adam with a learning rate of 1e\u22123. The DAE was pre-trained for 200,000 steps before training the \u03b2-VAE architecture. The \u03b2-VAE architecture used an encoder with four convolutional layers, a fully connected layer with 256 neurons, and a latent layer with 64 neurons. The decoder architecture was the reverse of the encoder with deconvolutional layers. ReLU non-linearities were used, and the reconstruction error was calculated using L2 loss. The optimizer used was Adam with a learning rate of 1e\u22124 and pre-training was done with a batch size of 100 until convergence.

The decoder architecture was the reverse of the encoder with deconvolutional layers. ReLU non-linearities were used, and the reconstruction error was calculated using L2 loss. The optimizer used was Adam with a learning rate of 1e\u22124 and pre-training was done with a batch size of 100 until convergence. The disentangled \u03b2-VAE had \u03b2 = 53, while the entangled \u03b2-VAE used within the SCANU baseline had \u03b2 = 0.1. The encoder and decoder of SCAN were simple single layer MLPs with 100 hidden units for DeepMind Lab experiments and a two layer MLP with 500 hidden units in each hidden layer for the CelebA experiments. The decoder was parametrised as a Bernoulli distribution over the output space of size 375. The recombination operator was implemented as a convolutional operator with kernel size 1 and stride 1, and trained using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e\u22123 and batch size 16 for 50k iterations. The JMVAE was trained with a learning rate of 1e\u22123 and batch size 16 for 50k steps. The architectural choices included a visual encoder with four convolutional layers, a fully connected layer with 256 hidden units, and a 32-dimensional diagonal Gaussian latent distribution. The symbol encoder consisted of a single layer MLP with 100 hidden units. The best results were obtained with \u03b1 = 1.0. The encoder q \u03c6y had a single layer MLP with 100 hidden units for DeepMind Lab and a two-layer MLP with 500 hidden units for CelebA. The joint encoder q \u03c6 used the same convolutional stack as the visual encoder for visual input and a two-layer MLP for symbol input. The embeddings were concatenated and passed through a two-layer MLP before outputting 64 parameters for the diagonal Gaussian latents. The visual decoder p \u03b8x was the reverse of the visual encoder, while the symbol decoder p \u03b8x used a single layer MLP. Both decoders had Bernoulli output distributions. The model was trained with Adam optimizer, a learning rate of 1e\u22124, and a batch size of 16. Triple ELBO (TrELBO) model was also mentioned. The Triple ELBO (TrELBO) model was trained with hyperparameters \u03bb yx and \u03bb y set to 10 and 100 respectively. The symbol decoder parameters \u03b8y were trained using specific terms for fair comparison. The networks used were identical to those for the JMVAE model. The classifier evaluated samples generated by each model based on discriminating room configuration factors in the DeepMind Lab dataset. The classifier trained with a network of deconvolutional layers and fully connected layers achieved an overall accuracy of 0.992. The accuracy metric for the samples was computed based on discriminating room configuration factors in the DeepMind Lab dataset. The sym2img data sample diversity was assessed by calculating the KL divergence of irrelevant factor distribution for each concept. The mean KL divergence across all k-grams was reported, using 64 samples per concept. The DeepMind Lab dataset focuses on learning generative factors related to colors. \u03b2-VAE struggled to disentangle these factors due to the lack of smoothness in RGB space. To address this, a pre-processing step converted frames from RGB to HSV space before training, enabling \u03b2-VAE to achieve better results. The DeepMind Lab dataset focused on learning generative factors related to colors. A pre-processing step converted frames from RGB to HSV space before training, enabling \u03b2-VAE to achieve good disentangling results. Training involved using a dataset with 73 frames per room and various generative factors. The recombination operator was trained to ground zr in the ground truth latent space zx. The training objective was to ground zr in the ground truth latent space zx inferred from an image x by applying logical operations to binary symbols y1 and y2. Logical operators were trained by sampling k-grams with specific constraints, and unsupervised visual representation learning SCAN relies on structured visual primitives. SCAN, a visual representation learning method, relies on structured visual primitives. The study investigates if \u03b2-VAE, trained unsupervised on DeepMind Lab dataset, has a disentangled representation of data generative factors. SCAN represents object, wall, and floor colors using hue and brightness latents. By projecting images from RGB to HSV space, a disentangled color representation was achieved. However, \u03b2-VAE sometimes confuses colors, like red floors being reconstructed as magenta due to approximating circular hue space with a linear latent. The circular hue space is represented using a linear latent. Red and magenta are neighbors in the circular space but end up on opposite ends of the linear latent. Comparing disentangled representations in FIG5 to entangled equivalents in FIG6, it shows that an entangled \u03b2-VAE can reconstruct data well but latent traversal plots and samples are not as good as a disentangled \u03b2-VAE. SCAN U analysis in FIG6 shows that a \u03b2-VAE with unstructured vision has an entangled visual latent space zx, making it difficult for the SCAN loss function to pick out relevant visual primitives for each training concept. The JMVAE model is capable of reconstructing data and learning a reasonably disentangled representation of generative factors, although it fails to represent certain objects. Comparing with \u03b2-VAE, JMVAE's representations match those learned by \u03b2-VAE, but it struggles with entangled latent spaces. JMVAE achieves disentangling performance by utilizing extra supervision from symbolic inputs but fails to learn a hierarchical compositional latent representation like SCAN. It learns a flat representation similar to \u03b2-VAE, leading to limited diversity and mode collapse in generated samples. TrELBO struggles with mode collapse and lacks a compositional latent representation like SCAN, resulting in poor sample diversity. The entangled nature of its learned representation hinders accurate sym2img sample generation. Additionally, TrELBO's lack of structure in concept representations affects recombination operator training, leading to inaccurate sym2img samples. The effect of training set size on SCAN, JMVAE, and TrELBO performance is evaluated by comparing accuracy and diversity scores. SCAN consistently outperforms baselines with less variance. Halving training iterations affected baselines but not SCAN. JMVAE and TrELBO show better diversity in this plot due to blurrier sym2img samples. Additional experiments test SCAN on the dSprites BID4 dataset with five ground truth factors. In experiments, a conceptual space was defined by position, scale, and rotation factors. Models were trained on a subset of image-symbol pairs to understand positional and scale concepts. Performance of models grounded in disentangled vs. entangled visual representations was compared. After training on image-symbol pairs to understand positional and scale concepts, models were evaluated by counting white pixels in quadrants or the whole image. SCAN matched ground truth samples closely, while SCANU failed to produce meaningful samples despite perfect dataset reconstruction. Visual samples showed good accuracy but low diversity. The model trained on image-symbol pairs with operators like \"yellow object\", \"hat\", \"orange floor\", and \"cyan wall\" showed low accuracy but decent diversity. SCAN outperformed baselines JMVAE and TrELBO in accuracy and showed less susceptibility to training set size."
