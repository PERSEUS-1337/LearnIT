    "content": "The \"Retain Act\" aims to address the issue of American corporations sending jobs overseas or employing cheap foreign labor instead of American workers. This Act highlights the trend of job shifting across various industry sectors. The \"Retain Act\" amends Chapter 47 of title 41, United States Code, to give preference to offerors who retain jobs in the United States and use products and services made in the U.S. This preference applies to both contracts and subcontracts awarded by executive agencies. Offerors must certify their compliance to be eligible for this preference. Under subsection (a), offerors must certify that they have not relocated jobs from the US to foreign countries in the past five years, established foreign facilities to perform functions that could have been done in the US, will not relocate jobs during the contract period, and will use products and services substantially made in the US. The head of an executive agency may exempt an offeror from certification requirements if products are not available in the US, there is a high cost associated with US products, or using US products/services goes against the public interest. The head of an executive agency can exempt an offeror from certification requirements under certain conditions. If a contractor submits a false statement or violates certification requirements, the contract will be terminated, and the contractor will be ineligible for the preference for at least 5 years. The agency must report annually to Congress on contractors who have violated the certification requirements. The prohibition also applies to parent companies and subsidiaries of the contractor. The certification requirements under subsection (e) apply to contractors and their parent or subsidiary companies. A technical amendment is made to the table of sections in title 41, United States Code. The new section 2317 of Chapter 137 of title 10, United States Code, requires agencies to give preference to offerors who certify to retain jobs in the United States and use products and services made in the United States for contracts. This preference also applies to subcontractors at any tier. The preference described in the new section 2317 of Chapter 137 of title 10, United States Code, requires offerors to certify that they will retain jobs in the United States, use products and services made in the United States, and not relocate jobs to foreign countries during the contract period. The head of an agency may exempt an offeror from certification requirements if products are not available in the US, there is a high cost associated with US products, or using US products is against public interest. The head of an agency may exempt an offeror from certification requirements if products are not available in the US, there is a high cost associated with US products, or using US products is against public interest. If a contractor submits a false statement or violates certification requirements, the agency must terminate the contract and the contractor is ineligible for preference for at least 5 years. The agency must report contractors who violate certification requirements annually to Congress. For the purposes of this section, any prohibition on receiving a preference under subsection (e) applies to a contractor's subsidiary or parent company. A technical amendment is made to the table of sections in title 10, United States Code. The Federal Acquisition Regulation will be revised to implement the preference for keeping jobs in the United States. The amendments will take effect on the enactment date of the Act and apply to contracts awarded 180 days after the effective date."
