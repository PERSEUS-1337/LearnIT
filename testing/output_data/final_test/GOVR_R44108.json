    "content": "The report examines the Air Force and Navy's plans for modernizing and recapitalizing their aging fleet of Boeing 707-based aircraft used for Command and Control (C2) and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. The central issue is whether to continue sustaining and modernizing these legacy aircraft or invest in new ones. Without adequate funding for sustainment and modernization, the legacy C2ISR fleet is at risk of becoming obsolete. Many analysts argue that the aging C2ISR fleet is at risk of becoming obsolete due to physical wear-and-tear, potential adversaries acquiring advanced weapon systems, and the need for sustainment, modernization, and recapitalization. This report addresses congressional oversight and appropriations concerns for the Boeing 707-based legacy C2ISR aircraft fleet. Congress has the authority to approve, reject, or modify Air Force and Navy funding requests for C2ISR aircraft sustainment, modernization, and recapitalization. Decisions on appropriations could impact the nation's C2ISR capabilities and the U.S. aerospace industry. A key issue is whether to continue funding for DOD's Boeing 707-based legacy C2ISR aircraft fleet and at what levels, considering the potential for a shortfall in capabilities if funding is minimized. The Congress has the authority to approve, reject, or modify funding requests for C2ISR aircraft sustainment, modernization, and recapitalization by the Air Force and Navy. Decisions on appropriations could impact the nation's C2ISR capabilities and the U.S. aerospace industry. An important question is whether to prioritize funding for legacy C2ISR aircraft sustainment and modernization over the development of a replacement aircraft. Shifting some legacy C2ISR missions to remotely piloted aircraft may also affect recapitalization efforts and future national defense strategies. Congress's decisions could impact potential base realignment and closure (BRAC) decisions and the U.S. aircraft manufacturing industrial base. In 1952, Boeing developed the Model 367-80 prototype aircraft, leading to the KC-135 tanker and 707 aircraft. These aircraft played various roles, including reconnaissance and transport. The limited information available on these programs relies on Air Force fact sheets. Boeing delivered 856 Model 707s between 1957 and 1994, with most used for commercial purposes. After 2007, many were converted to freighters or corporate transports. The Department of Defense's Boeing 707-based C2ISR aircraft fleet includes 89 operational aircraft. Despite their age, the fleet maintains sufficient aircraft availability for current operational requirements. The E-8C JSTARS is an airborne battle management, command and control platform with a mission to provide ground surveillance for targeting and attack operations. It is a modified Boeing 707-320 with a 27-foot radome housing a 24-foot phased array antenna capable of detecting targets over 155 miles away. The E-8C JSTARS is equipped with sensors that can detect and monitor ground-based objects over a large area. The radar can also detect helicopters, rotating antennas, and slow-moving aircraft. Information is relayed in near real-time to ground command centers. The JSTARS concept originated from programs aimed at detecting and attacking enemy armor from long distances. The technology combines elements from the Air Force's Pave Mover program and the Army's Stand-Off Target Acquisition System program. The E-8 JSTARS development contract was awarded to Grumman Corporation in 1985. The E-8 JSTARS program was awarded to Grumman Corporation in September 1985. Originally planned for 10 conversion aircraft, the number changed to 22 newly-built aircraft, then to 20, and finally settled on 17 operational aircraft. Due to the end of 707 airframe production, the E-8C aircraft are retrofitted Boeing 707 aircraft acquired from other sources. The first E-8C entered operational service in late 1995, with an average fleet age of 13.6 years. The E-8C JSTARS aircraft fleet, operated by the 116th Air Control Wing and the 461st Air Control Wing at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, averages 13.6 years of age. The Air Force planned to recapitalize the fleet starting in FY2015 by divesting the E-8C test capability and retiring five operational aircraft. Congress prohibited the retirement of any operational aircraft in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2015. The Air Force is prohibited from retiring operational JSTARS aircraft until a report is submitted to Congress on the analysis of alternatives for recapitalizing the capability. The FY2016 budget delays divestiture of five E-8C JSTARS aircraft to FY2019 and restores funding for modernization programs. Sustainment and modernization initiatives for the E-8C fleet are either completed or in progress. The Air Force is currently working on various modernization efforts for the E-8C JSTARS fleet, including Prime Mission Equipment (PME) Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS), Kill Chain Enhancement Modifications, JSTARS Modernization, and Test and Infrastructure. PME is crucial for maintaining net-centric warfighter capabilities, addressing parts obsolescence, and ensuring specification compliance. This program does not involve the E-8C engine or airframe. The Computer Replacement Program (CRP) from 1997-2005 addressed hardware and software DMS issues for various subsystems. In October 2013, a contract was awarded for modernization kits for the PME-DMS program. Funding lapsed in FY2015, but the Air Force plans to award contracts for the remaining JSTARS aircraft in FY2016 to complete the fleet retrofit. The Air Force funded the fleet retrofit of 16 aircraft, with funding restored from FY2016 to FY2018. The JSTARS Kill Chain Enhancement program focuses on rapid implementation of warfighting capabilities using emerging technologies for increased system capability and interoperability. Representative efforts include imagery comparison, RPA data integration, and time critical targeting initiatives. The program focuses on time critical targeting initiatives, Internet Protocol enabling technologies, machine-to-machine data exchange, radar enhancements, and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enhancements. Project candidates are based on warfighter experiments, exercises, and analysis of operational data. Funding is provided for aircraft modifications, repair parts, and system improvements across the E-8C platform. In FY2014, efforts were made to develop and integrate system improvements such as Multi-Agency Communication Capability, CENTRIX, Ground Moving Target Indicator Risk Reduction, and Beyond-Line-of-Sight Network Architecture Upgrades. Training and support systems were also upgraded, including Weapon Systems Trainer, Navigator Training System, and Mission Crew Trainers. The test infrastructure program included JSTARS Extended Test Support (JETS), JSTARS Test Force (JTF), and C2 Enterprise Integration Facility. All developmental programs were completed in FY2014. In FY2014, developmental programs were completed, and test infrastructure assets were transferred to Robins AFB, GA. The JETS contract and JTF lease were extended into FY2015 for T-3 aircraft retirement preparation. The FY2016 budget submission for E-8C procurement and research programs was derived from Air Force budget justification books. The E-10A was initially intended to replace the E-8C JSTARS aircraft for improved tracking of ground targets and detecting low-flying cruise missiles. Later derivatives were meant to replace the E-3 Sentry AWACS. The E-10A was designed to replace the E-8C JSTARS aircraft for better ground target tracking and detecting cruise missiles. The Multi-sensor Command and Control Constellation (MC2C) program aimed to integrate command and control and intelligence capabilities, transitioning radar technology from the 707 to the 767 platform. The MC2C program evolved into the Command and Control (C2) Constellation, which later became the E-10 Squadrons program. The E-10 was designed to enhance command and control capabilities through advanced sensors, communication systems, and battle management software for quicker decision-making in combat operations. It aimed to improve interoperability and integration with ground/air/space-based assets. The E-10 program aimed to enhance command and control capabilities in combat operations by adding interoperability and speed. It would have provided weapons-quality target cueing for joint and coalition shooters, with advanced radar technology for improved target detection and surveillance. The open system architecture of the E-10 allowed for growth potential in remotely piloted aircraft control and ISR management functions. The E-10 program aimed to enhance command and control capabilities in combat operations with advanced sensors for air surveillance. It was canceled in FY2008 due to cost growth and controversy over its complexity. Views differed on the future of ISR missions, with some advocating for space-based assets or unmanned aircraft for cost-effectiveness. The Air Force initiated the JSTARS Recapitalization effort in FY2015 to replace the legacy E-8C with a manned aircraft designed for tactical Battle Management, Command and Control (BMC2) and Battlespace Awareness (BA) using advanced technologies. The goal is to enable rapid decision-making during military operations by automating tracking and addressing time-critical targets. The JSTARS Recap program aims to automate tracking and addressing time-critical targets in the aging E-8C fleet. It is designed for worldwide deployment in all weather conditions and focuses on known mission area gaps. The Air Force plans to field an initial capability equivalent to the E-8C JSTARS and upgrade it in the future. The program includes integrating four major subsystems: BMC2, Sensor, Air Vehicle, and Communications, using an open source reference architecture to promote competition and reduce costs.

The E-3 Sentry is an AWACS aircraft providing command and control battle management, surveillance, target detection, and tracking for the Joint Air Operations Center. The FY2016 budget submission outlines expenditures for JSTARS Recap procurement and research programs. The E-3 Sentry, also known as AWACS, provides real-time surveillance and early warning of enemy actions during joint operations. It is a modified Boeing 707 with a rotating radar dome that can detect aircraft within 250 miles. The radar subsystem, along with identification friend or foe technology, allows for tracking of enemy and friendly aircraft. The aircraft's major subsystems include avionics, navigation, communications, sensors, and identification tools. The E-3 Sentry, also known as AWACS, is equipped with navigation, communications, sensors, and identification tools. The mission crew performs surveillance, identification, weapons control, battle management, and communications functions. The radar and computer subsystems gather and present battlefield information on friendly and adversary aircraft and ships, which can be sent to command centers. In times of crisis, data can be forwarded to the President and Secretary of Defense. The E-3 crew supports air-to-ground operations by providing information for interdiction, reconnaissance, airlift, and close-air support for friendly ground forces. The E-3 Sentry, also known as AWACS, supports air operations by providing surveillance, identification, and control of the air battle. It can detect, track, and direct fighter-interceptor aircraft to adversary targets. The E-3 can fly for approximately 8 hours without refueling and has a range that can be extended through in-flight refueling. The Air Force inventory includes 31 E-3s in three different versions. Engineering, test, and evaluation began on the first E-3 in October 1975, with the first E-3s received by the 552nd Air Control Wing in March 1977. The E-3 aircraft, including E-3B, E-3C, and E-3G versions, have various upgrades such as enhanced computer capabilities, jam-resistant communications, and additional mission consoles. The E-3G designation is for aircraft that have completed the Block 40/45 Upgrade. The Air Force operates E-3s at three locations: Tinker Air Force Base, Kadena Air Base, and Elmendorf Air Force Base. The FY2015 President's Budget sought to divest seven E-3 aircraft, reducing the fleet size from 31 to 24. Congress prohibited the divestiture plan, leading to a re-phased force reduction from FY2016 to FY2019. The impact of the planned divestiture on sustainment and modernization initiatives is detailed in the following sections. The AWACS Block 40/45 modification upgrades legacy E-3 mission systems computers, display processors, and displays, and adds a new data architecture designed to enable future modifications. The AWACS Block 40/45 Upgrade includes enhancements to Electronic Support Measures sensor data processing, data fusion of sensor data, Data Link Infrastructure upgrade, new battle management tools, and system software modifications to accommodate Diminishing Manufacturing Sources. It also allows user access to Tactical Data Information Link message formats, enhances mission recording capabilities, and is to be installed on multiple trainers and ground systems. The Mission Crew Training Set and Mission Computing Maintenance Trainer (MCMT) were delivered in FY2014. The MCMT program developed ground systems for mission planning at various Air Force Bases. LRIP was approved for six aircraft in FY2008, with AWACS Block 40/45 Full Rate Production approved in November 2012. Only 18 out of 25 aircraft will receive the AWACS Block 40/45 Upgrade due to divestiture of seven E-3 aircraft in FY2019. In FY2013, the program office began depot activation to procure test equipment, modules, training, repair documentation, and other items to support the E-3G. Funding is for stand-up of the depot at Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex, Georgia, and the Avionics Integration Support Facility at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma. For FY2016, five aircraft are planned for modification and three aircraft from FY2015 are expected to be delivered. Due to end of life issues, engineering support is needed to procure the last four Block 40/45 Upgrade kits and retrofit the six LRIP aircraft. The program office plans to award a contract for 10 modification kits to upgrade the E-3 aircraft's Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) capability. The Next Generation IFF program aims to enhance the E-3's IFF interrogator operation by adding Mode 5 interrogation capability. The program started developing basic Mode 5 capability on Block 30/35 aircraft in FY2008 and full Mode 5 on Block 40/45 aircraft in FY2011. The current projection for full operational capacity is FY2016. The Next Generation IFF program aims to enhance the E-3 aircraft's IFF capability by adding Mode 5 interrogation. Production started in FY2012 after development of Block 30/35 capability, with plans to start installation on Block 30/35 aircraft in FY15. NGIFF also integrates Mode S for civilian air traffic control. All 31 aircraft are planned to receive the modification before the proposed FY2019 divesture of seven E-3s. The TSI program provides management support for AWACS modernization and enhancement. The TSI program supports AWACS training, equipment, and program Government Furnished Property. It includes contract management of labs for AWACS system and radar development, production, and sustainment for U.S. and international customers. TSI program supports AWACS system and radar development, production, and sustainment, as well as trainer/simulator upgrades. DRAGON replaces avionics for navigation and communication, ensuring global airspace access with modern systems and flight simulators. Using COTS avionics is expected to reduce costs. The Electronic Protection program enhances radar processing for specific flight environments, working in parallel with the current Radar System Improvement Program. The Internet Protocol Enabled Communication program provides medium-bandwidth IP communications for the Block 40/45 E-3, supporting net-centric operations. The CID program upgrades AWACS combat identification capability with modern technology, supporting multi-domain networks. It also includes fielding modification kits for E-3 Maintenance Training Devices to maintain mission capability. Modifications aim to achieve a 79% mission capable rate for fleet E-3 AWACS aircraft. The RM&A program funds modifications for E-3 aircraft to resolve maintenance issues, obsolescence, and equipment deactivation. It includes minor modifications to the vertical stabilizer and rudder, as well as funding for repair parts. Additionally, the program investigates improvements and future capabilities for the E-3 AWACS. The E-3 AWACS program focuses on integrating with joint and coalition forces in a net-centric environment through investigation, analysis, and development. Efforts include materiel solution analysis, technology development, prototyping new capabilities, and developing an E-3 Modernization & Sustainment Roadmap. The Communications Network Upgrade program addresses sustainability and capability issues with 20-year-old communication equipment. The MIDS Radio System provides Link 16 capability for military platforms. The FY2016 budget submission for E-3 Sentry AWACS procurement and research programs summarizes expenditures for sustainment and modernization. The Air Force is focusing on modernizing the E-3 to the E-3G variant by 2020, with no immediate plan for recapitalization. The RC-135 program includes three models of operational aircraft. The RC-135 program includes 22 unique models of operational aircraft assigned to the 55th Wing at Offutt Air Force Base. Despite an average airframe age of 44 years, the fleet is expected to meet Combatant Commanders' needs through 2040. The RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT aircraft provides real-time intelligence collection and dissemination capabilities. The RC-135 aircraft is extensively modified for intelligence collection, with on-board sensors to detect signals. The mission crew can transmit information via a communication suite. The fleet dates back to 1962, with the average age of different models ranging from 49.8 to 52.3 years. The RC-135U COMBAT SENT aircraft, with an average age of 52.3 years, provides strategic electronic reconnaissance information to national leaders and theater commanders. It locates, identifies, and collects foreign military radar signals for analysis, aiding in the development of evasion techniques and equipment. The aircraft is equipped with a variety of hardware and software for manual and automatic signal analysis, including high frequency and very high frequency communication equipment. The RC-135U COMBAT SENT aircraft, equipped with high frequency, very high frequency, and ultra-high frequency radios, navigation radar, Doppler system, and inertial navigation system, has unique reconnaissance equipment. It features distinctive antennae arrays, cheek fairings, and an aerial refueling system for unlimited flying range. Crew includes pilots, navigator, engineers, electronic warfare officers, and specialists. Initial operating capability was in April 1964. The RC-135U COMBAT SENT aircraft, with an average age of 49.5 years, is equipped with optical and electronic sensors for collecting data on ballistic missile targets. The RC-135S COBRA BALL, with an average age of 52.3 years, tracks and monitors missiles during boost and re-entry phases for reconnaissance and treaty verification. Crews include pilots, navigators, electronic warfare officers, engineers, and mission specialists. Initial operating capability for the RC-135S COBRA BALL was in March 1972. The RC-135 program focuses on upgrading the RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT variant to drive integration and modification strategies for the fleet. The budget is mainly allocated to RIVET JOINT enhancements, which then trickle down to COBRA BALL and COMBAT SENT variants. The goal is to keep pace with evolving adversarial weapons systems. The acquisition strategy involves purchasing long-lead items, taking about 12 months from contract award to delivery, with installation in the subsequent year. This strategy has been successful in maintaining collection parity. The RC-135 program focuses on upgrading the RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT variant to maintain combat capability in the ISR arena. Current sustainment and modernization initiatives include Baseline Modification for RIVET JOINT, COMBAT SENT, and COBRA BALL variants, as well as Aircraft Spares and Repair Parts. Modernization efforts are concentrated on integrating Baseline 11 and initial integration of Baseline 12 for RIVET JOINT. The RC-135 program is focusing on upgrading the RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT variant to maintain combat capability in the ISR arena. Modernization efforts include Baseline 12 subsystem upgrades such as enhanced digital signal exploitation, improved operator interface, and new steerable beam antenna. The upgrades also involve increased digital signal recorder bandwidth, enhanced weather radar, and modernized communications security protocols. The COMBAT SENT and COBRA BALL programs are undergoing modernization efforts focusing on Baseline 5 enhancements, including WGS reachback connectivity, ELINT systems replacement, liquid cooling system, wideband receiver, tracking system, operator interface improvements, and integration of RIVET JOINT Baseline 11 COMINT suite. The programs align closely with each other and provide funding for RC-135 aircraft repair parts. Detailed information on the Defense Airborne Recce Projects RC-135 program is classified. Reported in accordance with Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 119(a)(1) in the Special Access Program Annual Report to Congress. The RC-135 operational systems development program supports design studies, engineering analysis, and integration of specialized mission systems. It aims to use COTS solutions and address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources/Vanishing Vendor Items. In FY2016, the program plans upgrades for RIVET JOINT Baseline 12 and 13, COMBAT SENT Baseline 5, and COBRA BALL Baseline 5 configurations, including enhancements like continuous recording capability, wideband receivers, avionics upgrades, and beyond-line-of-sight terminals. The Airborne SIGINT Development - RC-135 RIVET JOINT program supports integration and modification of SIGINT sensors and beyond-line-of-sight terminals. Funding is split among RC RIVET JOINT, COMBAT SENT, and COBRA BALL programs, reflecting SIGINT Capabilities Working Group priorities. Table 7 shows FY2016 budget submission for RC-135 procurement and research programs. The RIVET JOINT Baseline 11 and 12 integration efforts focus on the RC-135 Multi-Attribute Utility Assessment, which determined that retaining the RC-135V/W airframe offers the highest assessed weapons system utility. The WC-135 Constant Phoenix aircraft collects particulate and gaseous effluents to detect nuclear weapons testing. The Constant Phoenix program, commissioned by General Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1947, detects atomic explosions worldwide. The WC-135 aircraft, replacing the WB-50s in 1965, supports the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty by conducting air-sampling missions. Currently, WC-135s are the only aircraft in the inventory for this purpose. The WC-135 aircraft, part of the Constant Phoenix program, conducts air-sampling operations to detect radioactive \"clouds\" in real time. The aircraft is equipped with on-board atmospheric collection suite and external flow-through devices for collecting particulates. There are two versions of the WC-135, with one of each version in the active inventory. The aircraft and crew are assigned to the 55th Wing at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. There is no specified plan to modernize the WC-135 Constant Phoenix aircraft in the near future. The Air Force budget documents do not outline a plan to modernize or recapitalize the WC-135 Constant Phoenix aircraft in the near term. The OC-135B Open Skies Observation Aircraft, which supports the Open Skies Treaty, flies unarmed observation flights over treaty participants. The aircraft, originally WC-135Bs from the 1960s, have been converted to OC-135Bs. The average age of the OC-135B fleet is 52.3 years, with most equipment and systems geared towards supporting the cameras for the primary mission of taking pictures. The WC-135 Constant Phoenix aircraft's equipment supports cameras for low and high-altitude photography. The interior seats 35 people, including various crew members. An integrated data annotation system records picture details. The OC-135B Open Skies aircraft are equipped with cameras, monitors, and sensors for observation flights. They are assigned to Air Combat Command's 55th Wing for operations and training. A modernization initiative is underway to upgrade sensors in accordance with Presidential Policy Directive-15. The current film cameras used on the OC-135B Open Skies aircraft are becoming obsolete and expensive to maintain due to the discontinuation of film stock production. A camera replacement program is planned to replace them with modern digital cameras, expected to be more reliable and cost-effective. This initiative aims to provide imagery products in digital format, making them easier to use and extending the equipment's service life significantly. The FY2016 budget submission for OC-135B research and development programs is detailed in Table 8. The E-6B Mercury is a communications relay and strategic airborne command post aircraft that provides command, control, and communications between the National Command Authority and U.S. strategic forces. It replaced the aging EC-130Q for the Navy's TACAMO mission, linking the NCA with naval ballistic missile forces during crises. Boeing developed the E-6A from its commercial 707-320 aircraft, with a very low frequency communication system and dual trailing wire antennas. The Navy awarded Boeing a full-scale development contract for the E-6A in 1983. The E-6B Mercury, developed from the E-6A, was accepted by the Navy in 1989 and the final aircraft in 1992. It was designed to replace the Air Force's EC-135 fleet and is capable of fulfilling both the E-6A mission and the airborne strategic command post mission. The E-6B is equipped with an airborne launch control system for U.S. land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles. The first E-6B was accepted in 1997 and assumed its dual operational mission in 1998. The E-6B fleet was completely modified to the E-6B configuration in 2003, with 16 aircraft in the fleet. The E-6B has a crew of 13 members and a battlestaff crew of 22. All E-6B aircraft are assigned to Strategic Communications Wing One at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma. Various sustainment and modernization initiatives are in progress, including Safety Deficiencies, Tech Insertion, SLEP, Communications Upgrade, MR-TCDL, APU, FAB-T/PNVC, Common Ground Equipment, and Navy. The Safety Deficiencies program aims to correct high-risk aircraft safety hazards caused by federal agency directives, aging aircraft material condition, and the operational environment. Modifications include Fuel Quantity Indicating System installation, aircraft acoustic thermal blankets replacement, Kapton wiring replacement, and other safety deficiencies. The Tech Insertion program addresses aircraft obsolescence, supportability, weight management, and interoperability deficiencies through new technology insertion, such as CRYPTO modernization, brakes, seats, glare shield, High Power Transmit Set (HPTS) and the HPTS Camera, Automated Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, High Frequency Automatic Link Establishment, and Common Ground Equipment. The Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) extends the service life of aircraft to 2040 through airframe strengthening and modifications to prevent grounding. It includes the Individual Aircraft Tracking System and Communications Upgrade program for improved communication bandwidth. The Block I program aims to improve mission capability and legacy system obsolescence by implementing various modifications including Internet Protocol connectivity, wideband communication capability, and technology upgrades. Additionally, the Multi-Role Tactical Common Data Link program enhances aircraft communication bandwidth for interoperability with U.S. Strategic Command. The Auxiliary Power Unit program installs an improved APU to meet increased aircraft power requirements, while the Family of Advanced Beyond-Line-of-Sight Terminals program replaces obsolete equipment. The FAB-T/PNVC program upgrades Military Strategic Tactical Relay terminals with improved FAB-T and adds PNVC for secure voice capability over Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellite communications. The Common Ground Equipment program procures Automatic Test Equipment, aircraft systems trainers, and support equipment for various aircraft. The Navy Strategic Communications Project addresses E-6B Airborne Strategic Command, Control, and Communications requirements through technical evaluations and modeling. The Navy is funding advanced development engineering and analysis for E-6B systems to optimize interoperability in a network-centric strategic environment. The FY2016 budget submission includes expenditures for E-6B procurement and research programs. There is no specified plan for near-term recapitalization of E-6B Mercury aircraft. The Navy plans to extend the service life of aircraft to at least 2040 through the Service Life Extension Program. Congress is concerned about potential shortfall in C2ISR capabilities due to aging and shrinking fleet. The Air Force proposed divesting E-8C and E-3 aircraft for modernization efforts, but Congress temporarily prohibited this in FY2015 NDAA. The FY2015 NDAA prohibited the Air Force from retiring operational JSTARS aircraft until a report on alternatives for recapitalizing the capability is submitted. DOD faces challenges in reducing defense spending while prioritizing sustainment and modernization of aging aircraft. The Air Force is modernizing its legacy ISR and C4 fleet, including the E-3B/C AWACS to E-3G configuration and addressing obsolescence issues with the E-8C JSTARS fleet. They will divest some JSTARS aircraft in FY15 and FY16, with plans to retire more as recapitalized JSTARS aircraft are added to the inventory. The E-6B Mercury, derived from the Boeing 707 aircraft, supports a flexible nuclear deterrent posture with mission system upgrades. The fleet is expected to reach its end of life in January 2040, with plans for a replacement aircraft within 30 years. The Air Force's FY2016 Posture Statement reflects changes in priorities, including buying back combat capabilities in areas like the E-8 JSTARS and E-15C. The final inventory objective is projected to be 17 aircraft. In the FY 2016 budget request, the Air Force maintained capacity, increased investment in the Nuclear C2 enterprise, and pursued modernization critical to ensure a technologically dominant C2 capability in the current fight and future conflicts. This includes a refined acquisition strategy for the E-8 JSTARS recapitalization efforts and delaying the divestiture of five E-8C aircraft from FY 2016 to FY 2019. The Air Force retains modernization funding for the remaining Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) fleet, continuing to field the E-3G variant, enhancing the electronic protection capability of the E-3 radar, and equipping the platform with advanced tactical data links. In FY 2016, the Air Force continues funding E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) recapitalization, refining the acquisition strategy and pushing Initial Operational Capability to FY 2023. To fund JSTARS recapitalization, the Air Force divested E-8C test capability and placed the E-8C on a retirement profile between FY 2025 - FY 2026. The Air Force will also re-phase the E-3 AWACS divestiture from FY 2016 to FY 2019 to increase near-term capacity for combatant commander needs. The Air Force is focusing on funding E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) recapitalization to meet combatant commander needs. There are concerns about potential delays in developing replacement C2ISR aircraft due to budget constraints and modernization efforts for existing aircraft. Recapitalization plans for E-3 AWACS and Navy E-6B are not scheduled in the near term, with viability projected until at least 2040. Observers note that recapitalization has been delayed, raising oversight issues for Congress. The potential oversight issues for Congress include considering the shift of missions from manned C2ISR aircraft to remotely piloted aircraft due to advancements in technology. Another concern is the implications of reduced legacy C2ISR aircraft sustainment on future rounds of base realignment and closure. The Boeing 707-based C2ISR aircraft are located at three bases in the continental U.S. The legacy C2ISR aircraft are currently stationed at three main locations in the United States: Robins AFB in Georgia, Tinker AFB in Oklahoma, and Offutt AFB in Nebraska. There is a possibility of further consolidation of these aircraft types at fewer locations in future BRAC rounds. Concerns also exist regarding the industrial base's ability to sustain these aging aircraft due to potential challenges in manufacturing and supplying parts. The defense industry may need to streamline operations and consolidate production lines to address manufacturing challenges in supplying parts for legacy C2ISR aircraft. Analysts suggest potential defense cuts could impact the industry's ability to sustain these aircraft until 2040. The question remains whether the defense industrial base can meet the sustainment needs of these aircraft, primarily based on Boeing 707, amidst budget debates and potential spending cuts. The DOD's C2ISR missions rely on aging Boeing 707 aircraft procured from the 1960s to the early 1990s. Congress needs to consider funding for sustainment, modernization, and recapitalization of these legacy platforms. Analysts debate whether to invest in upgrading existing aircraft or transitioning to new platforms for better mission effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in the long term. Congress must decide on funding for sustainment, modernization, and recapitalization of the DOD's aging Boeing 707-based legacy C2ISR aircraft fleet. The potential shortfall in C2ISR capabilities if funding is minimized raises questions about delaying the development of a replacement aircraft. Congress's oversight on shifting missions to remotely piloted aircraft also impacts recapitalization efforts. Decisions on these issues will have long-term implications. Congress must decide on funding for sustainment, modernization, and recapitalization of the DOD's aging Boeing 707-based legacy C2ISR aircraft fleet. This decision could impact future base realignment and closure (BRAC) decisions and the U.S. aircraft manufacturing industrial base. The priority the DOD places on legacy C2ISR sustainment, modernization, and recapitalization, and Congress's response, could have consequences on U.S. C2ISR capabilities and national defense strategies. In 2015, the Department of Defense is restricted from making significant changes to manning levels or retiring E-3 airborne warning and control systems aircraft. Similarly, the Air Force is limited from using funds to make changes to manning levels for operational Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar systems aircraft. The Department of Defense is restricted from making changes to manning levels or retiring E-3 airborne warning and control systems aircraft. The Air Force is also limited from making changes to manning levels for operational Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar Systems aircraft until a report is submitted to the congressional defense committees. The report must include an update on alternatives for recapitalizing the current capability and an assessment of the cost and schedule for developing and fielding a new aircraft and radar system to replace the current aircraft by fiscal year 2019."
