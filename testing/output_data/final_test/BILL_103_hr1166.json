    "content": "The Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 1993, also known as the \"Act,\" amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It includes tax relief measures for middle-income taxpayers, such as an increase in the personal exemption amount. The Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 1993 amends the Internal Revenue Code by defining the exemption amount as $2,000 for regular exemption and an additional $1,000 for middle-income taxpayers. Special rules apply to the additional exemption amount for middle-income taxpayers. The Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 1993 defines a middle-income taxpayer as one whose adjusted gross income does not exceed specific dollar amounts based on filing status. For joint filers or surviving spouses, the limit is $102,000, for heads of household it is $87,300, and for unmarried individuals, it is $61,000. The Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 1993 sets income limits for middle-income taxpayers based on filing status. For unmarried individuals, the limit is $61,000, and for married individuals filing separately, it is $51,000. The act also includes a phaseout of additional exemption amounts for middle-income taxpayers with adjusted gross income exceeding a certain threshold. The additional exemption amount is determined based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income compared to certain threshold amounts. The term 'applicable transition dollar amount' is defined for this purpose. The term 'applicable transition dollar amount' is defined as specific dollar amounts based on filing status: $47,000 for joint returns or surviving spouses, $37,000 for heads of household, $28,000 for single individuals, and $23,500 for married individuals filing separately. These amounts are used for determining additional exemption amounts based on adjusted gross income. Inflation adjustments are made to increase dollar amounts in certain paragraphs based on the cost-of-living adjustment for taxable years after 1994. In 1989, amendments were made to section 1(f) and section 151(d) of the tax code, including changes to exemption amounts and phaseouts. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993, changing \"basic\" to \"regular\" in the heading. SEC. 201. INCREASE IN RATE OF INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX FOR HIGH-INCOME TAXPAYERS. Amends tax rates for married individuals filing joint returns and surviving spouses. The tax rates for high-income taxpayers are increased for married individuals filing joint returns and surviving spouses. For heads of households, the tax rates are amended with specific thresholds and percentages based on income levels. Tax rates for unmarried individuals have been amended with specific thresholds and percentages based on income levels. For income over $67,200 but not over $85,000, the tax is $15,429.50 plus 31% of the excess. For income over $85,000, the tax is $20,947.50 plus 36% of the excess. For married individuals filing separate returns, the tax rates have been updated. For income over $47,050 but not over $70,000, the tax is $10,645.50 plus 31% of the excess. For income over $70,000, the tax is $17,760 plus 36% of the excess. For estates and trusts, the tax rates have been revised. For income over $39,200 but not over $50,000, the tax is $8,866.75 plus 31% of the excess. For income over $50,000, the tax is $12,214.75 plus 36% of the excess. The tax rates for individuals with incomes over $9,900 but not over $12,600 are $2,343 plus 31% of the excess. For incomes over $12,600, the rates are $3,180 plus 36% of the excess. These amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1993. Additionally, a surtax on individuals with incomes over $225,000 is introduced in Subchapter A of chapter 1. The surtax on individuals with taxable income over $225,000 increases the tax imposed under section 1 by 15 percent of the excess amount. SEC. 59C imposes a surtax on individuals with alternative minimum taxable income over $225,000, increasing the tentative minimum tax by 2.5 percent of the excess amount. SEC. 59D contains special rules related to this provision. SEC. 59D introduces special rules for estates, trusts, and married individuals filing separate tax returns. It clarifies that the term 'individual' includes estates and trusts taxable under section 1, adjusts thresholds for married individuals filing separately, and outlines the order of applying tax provisions. SEC. 203 and SEC. 204 increase the corporate income tax rate to 36 percent and the individual alternative minimum tax rate, respectively, for taxable years starting after December 31, 1993. SEC. 204 increases the individual alternative minimum tax rate from 24 percent to 27 percent for taxable years starting after December 31, 1993."
