    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Increasing Competition in Pharmaceuticals Act\". Congress acknowledges the importance of generic drugs in establishing competitive markets and reducing healthcare costs for patients in the United States. Studies show that generic drugs make up a significant portion of prescriptions and have resulted in substantial savings over the years. Between 2005 and 2014, increasing generic competition was noted as an effective way to lower prescription drug costs for patients and the healthcare system. Despite the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012, there is still a backlog of generic drug approvals. Aggressive price hikes for off-patent drugs without generic competitors impact access to affordable prescriptions and overall healthcare costs in the United States. Improving the review and approval of generic drugs can lower prices for patients and improve competition. Establishing clear timelines for the FDA to expedite generic drug applications would help keep prices down and ensure timely access for patients. SEC. 101. IMPROVING GENERIC ACCESS. Section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to prioritize the review of new drug applications that meet specific criteria, with a deadline of 150 days for action. Fees may be waived for certain applications meeting the outlined conditions. The Secretary may expedite inspections for drug manufacturing establishments under certain conditions. SEC. 102. REPORTING ON PENDING GENERIC DRUG APPLICATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit a report every 90 days on pending generic drug applications, including the number of applications, average time pending, certifications, and applications subject to review. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must report every 90 days on pending generic drug applications, including the number of applications and those subject to priority review. SEC. 201. GENERIC PRIORITY REVIEW VOUCHER is a new amendment in Chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, introducing a generic priority review voucher system. In this section, definitions for \"priority review\" and \"priority review voucher\" are provided. The Secretary will award a priority review voucher to the sponsor of an approved application under section 505(j)(11)(A). The recipient of a priority review voucher can transfer the entitlement to the voucher without limit. The new owner must notify the Secretary of the transfer within 30 days. Sponsors must notify the Secretary 30 days before submitting a human drug application for priority review, except for applications pending before October 1, 2015. The sponsor of a pending application must notify the Secretary within 30 days of receiving a priority review voucher. The sponsor is also subject to required fees. The Secretary can revoke a voucher if the drug is not marketed within 365 days of approval. The generic priority review voucher program will end on October 1, 2022. SEC. 202 amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regarding tropical disease product applications. It includes new requirements for clinical investigations essential for approval. TITLE III focuses on a study on REMS. The Comptroller General will review the implementation and effectiveness of the REMS program under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. This program allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for drugs. The review will examine relevant elements for new drug applications. The Comptroller General will review various categories including new drug applications, abbreviated new drug applications, biological product licenses, REMS, controlled substances, and risk management processes employed by the FDA. The Comptroller General will examine the number of REMS required, submitted, modified, approved, and the effectiveness of the REMS program in improving drug safety. Burdens associated with REMS will also be evaluated. The Comptroller General will evaluate the impact of REMS on patients, healthcare providers, and drug manufacturers, including coordination between FDA and DEA for controlled substances. Additionally, the report will assess the effectiveness of additional risk mitigation strategies and the standards applied by the FDA for REMS. The Comptroller General will submit a report by May 1, 2018, to Senate and House committees with the results of the review on REMS impact and effectiveness."
