The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 is amended to encourage the formation of science parks for promoting innovation through high technology activities. Definitions for 'Brownfield' and 'Business or industrial park' are also added to the Act. The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 is amended to encourage the formation of science parks and clusters to promote innovation through high technology activities. Science parks are defined as groups of interrelated companies and institutions that foster knowledge flow and collaboration. Science parks and clusters aim to foster knowledge flow, promote economic growth, and facilitate cooperation and competition among companies, researchers, and workforce training activities. They are located in specific regions to promote real estate development, technology transfer, and partnerships between companies and institutions. This includes science parks, research parks, technology parks, and research and development parks. The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 defines science park infrastructure as facilities supporting the economic activity of a science park.

The Secretary will award grants for the development of feasibility studies and plans for new science parks or the expansion of existing ones, with a limit of $750,000 per grant. Grants will be awarded through a competitive process, with an emphasis on geographic dispersion among states of varying population densities. The Secretary will advertise competitions in the Commerce Business Daily and publish selection criteria for grants under this subsection, focusing on the science park's impact on economic growth, job creation, and required funding. The selection criteria for grants under this subsection will focus on the impact of the science park on economic growth, job creation, required funding, financing options, types of businesses and research entities expected, letters of intent from potential tenants, quality of life for employees, and the ability to attract a well-qualified workforce. The criteria for grants under this subsection include attracting a well-trained workforce, managing the science park, financial risks, infrastructure availability, and energy-efficient building technology. The criteria for grants under this subsection include attracting a well-trained workforce, managing the science park, financial risks, infrastructure availability, energy-efficient building technology, transformation of military bases affected by BRAC, redevelopment of existing buildings, collaboration with other science parks worldwide, and other criteria prescribed by the Secretary. Authorized appropriations are $7,500,000 for each fiscal year. The Secretary is authorized to appropriate $7,500,000 annually from 2011 to 2015 for loan guarantees for science park infrastructure projects. The guarantees can cover up to 80% of the loan amount, with a maximum of $50,000,000 for a single project and $500,000,000 for all projects. Recipients are chosen based on their ability to meet the criteria set by the Secretary. Entities receiving a grant under subsection (a) are not eligible for a loan guarantee.

The Secretary will enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to evaluate activities and recommend best practices for US science parks within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The Board will submit a report on their findings to the Secretary. The Board will submit a report to the Secretary evaluating science park development and may include recommendations for promoting and facilitating science parks in the US. The Secretary will submit a tri-annual report to Congress describing activities under this section, including any recommendations from the Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy, and may suggest legislative actions. The Secretary may recommend legislative or administrative actions to promote science park development in the US.
