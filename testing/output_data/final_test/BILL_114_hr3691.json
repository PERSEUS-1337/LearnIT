The Act \"Improving Treatment for Pregnant and Postpartum Women Act of 2016\" establishes a pilot program for state substance abuse agencies to provide competitive grants for family-based services for pregnant and postpartum women with substance use disorders.

The Director of the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, in coordination with the Director of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, will submit a report to relevant committees on the outcomes of the pilot program, including reductions in drug use, engagement in treatment services, retention in services, access to FDA-approved medications, and other measures.
