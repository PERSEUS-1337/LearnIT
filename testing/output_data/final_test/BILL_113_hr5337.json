Congress finds that in 2012, ICAO adopted a standard requiring new aircraft over 15,000 kilograms to have 2 combination FDR/CVR recorder systems. The second system should include a deployable ELT to improve survivability and location in emergencies. Deployable recorder systems combine FDR, CVR, and ELT into a crash-hardened \"black box\" that releases from the aircraft upon impact, floats on water to avoid underwater search efforts, and sends a distress signal to SAR satellites for rapid location and recovery of data in all crash scenarios. Recent commercial aviation accidents highlight the challenges and costs of locating and recovering underwater aircraft black boxes. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared in 2014 with 239 people on board, and Air France Flight 447, which crashed in 2009, are examples of difficult search and recovery missions involving significant resources. In June 2009, Air France Flight 447 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean with 216 passengers and 12 crew members. It took nearly two years and over $160,000,000 to recover the flight data recorders from a depth of 12,000 feet. Yemenia Airlines IY626 crashed with 152 passengers, and a 12-year-old girl was the sole survivor found after floating in the ocean for thirteen hours. On January 1, 2007, Adam Air Flight 574 crashed off the coast of Indonesia with 102 passengers and aircrew. The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) were located one month later but recovered seven months later due to the challenging underwater environment. The FDR and CVR were found at depths of 6,600 feet and 4,600 feet apart. Countries like Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Japan, Norway, United Kingdom, and the United States have advanced search and rescue capabilities. Following the crash of Air France Flight 447, the French BEA led a group of safety experts who rated deployable FDR/CVR/ELT systems highly for improving aircraft and black box localization. There are no recurring fees for using these systems, as the COSPAS-SARSAT satellites provide a free global safety service for receiving alerts and locating crash sites. The Transportation Security Administration conducted a pilot program to test automatic deployable recorder systems for rapid access to flight data after aviation crashes and locating downed aircraft and potential survivors. SEC. 3. REGULATIONS REQUIRING DEPLOYABLE RECORDERS. Regulations require all commercial passenger aircraft to be equipped with a deployable recorder system as the second combination FDR/CVR recorder system. Compliance schedule mandates installation on aircraft ordered by air carriers after January 1, 2016. The term \"aircraft\" refers to jet aircraft with a take-off mass over 15,000 kilograms, required to have 2 combination FDR/CVR recorder systems. A \"deployable recorder system\" includes a flight data recorder, cockpit voice recorder, and emergency locator transmitter in a crash-protected unit meeting specific performance standards."
