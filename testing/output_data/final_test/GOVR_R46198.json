    "content": "The evolving digital economy poses challenges due to divergent national internet regimes, impacting international trade and the growth of U.S. and global digital economies. Congress aims to ensure the U.S. digital economy thrives and influences global digital trade norms. In the 1990s, the expansion of internet technology led to a lack of clear rules, allowing some U.S. firms like Google to thrive in foreign markets. The digital economy's impact on international trade is influenced by divergent national internet regimes. U.S. firms like Google face trade barriers in certain markets, affecting global digital trade norms. Internet governance and data policies differ between the U.S., China, and the EU, creating challenges for U.S. firms expanding abroad. Trade barriers are hindering U.S. firms from doing business abroad, including rules on foreign investment, market access, e-commerce, and data usage. The U.S. promotes a free internet and seeks to establish common trade rules through negotiations to achieve its objectives. Bilateral and plurilateral agreements have led to overlapping and inconsistent rules among trading partners globally. The lack of multilateral rules on digital trade is a key focus of U.S. trade policy. E-commerce negotiations at the WTO offer an opportunity to establish enforceable multilateral rules aligning with U.S. priorities. Congress plays a crucial role in shaping U.S. internet policy and trade negotiations. Congress has established U.S. digital trade negotiating objectives for trade agreements and supported provisions in FTAs to address the lack of multilateral digital trade rules. The report will compare national internet regimes and examine ongoing WTO e-commerce negotiations to establish global rules and technology standards. The \"digital economy\" accounted for 6.9% of U.S. GDP in 2017. The digital economy accounted for 6.9% of U.S. GDP in 2017, encompassing the ICT sector, digital transactions, and digital content. Data exchange and processing are transforming various sectors, increasing productivity through the trade of data as end products, inputs for goods and services, and sources of information for further action. New data is generated daily through various means, including individual interactions and automated machine-to-machine transmissions. The digital economy relies on data flows for communication between individuals, organizations, and devices, often crossing national boundaries. In 2017, e-commerce facilitated 12% of international trade in physical goods, and digital platforms enabled almost 20% of China's imports and exports. Digital products accounted for 70% of the U.S. services trade surplus in 2017. 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are produced daily, with data exchange and processing transforming various sectors and increasing productivity. The study highlighted the significant growth of cross-border data flows, with the global datasphere expected to expand rapidly. By 2025, there could be over 150 billion connected devices worldwide. China's datasphere is growing rapidly, while the U.S. and EU's relative shares are expected to decline. Policymakers are increasingly focused on data gathering methods as data's volume and importance continue to increase. The future growth of the global digital economy and digital trade will be influenced by policies governing data flows at national, regional, and multilateral levels. China's digital growth may impact global data rules, potentially creating trade barriers. The ICT sector is seeing a convergence of telecommunications, media, consumer electronics, and information technology. The convergence of technologies in the ICT sector, including telecommunications, media, consumer electronics, and information technology, has led to the need for governing policies for digital trade. However, there is a lack of international rules governing key digital trade issues such as electronic contracts and cross-border data flows, resulting in inconsistent treatment in trade agreements. This lack of multilateral rules has led to countries creating diverging approaches in regulating the digital economy. The lack of international rules governing the digital economy has led to countries creating diverging national policies and efforts to establish common global rules. National internet regimes allow governments to advance domestic priorities and reflect local norms, but without shared rules, differing requirements can lead to trade barriers. Investment barriers can hinder businesses and consumers from entering certain markets, particularly in the digital services sector. Discriminatory restrictions in markets like China can limit access for U.S. firms, raising concerns about protectionism. Global supply chains may face threats if rules governing data sharing do not allow for reciprocity, potentially disrupting trade and economic competitiveness. The growth of individual companies could be hindered by limited participation in a virtual trading bloc, affecting a country's economic competitiveness. Diverging standards and regulations could impede the diffusion of knowledge and gains from emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, which rely on global data aggregation. Global internet rules and technical standards for data could impact international trade. The party(ies) that establish global internet rules and technical standards for data and emerging technologies will gain a first-mover advantage. Some governments are actively promoting their domestic policies to persuade other countries to adopt similar regimes, potentially diverging from U.S. priorities. China is exporting its national standards and technologies, particularly in Africa and Latin America, while the EU aims to set global standards on competition and privacy. The EU aims to set global standards on competition and privacy through its rules and enforcement actions, compelling multinational technology firms to adjust business models. This includes promoting data privacy regimes and imposing security requirements that may constrain business operations. The lack of global rules has led to a diversity of digital trade rules, potentially creating digital trading blocs. Ongoing e-commerce negotiations at the WTO aim to address these challenges. The ongoing e-commerce negotiations at the WTO aim to establish common trade rules and interoperability mechanisms for internet governance. International forums are discussing internet governance issues with active U.S. participation, focusing on best practices and frameworks. The U.S. government prioritizes maintaining a global network that is open, interoperable, reliable, and secure, with some Members of Congress supporting bills for an open internet and expanded global internet access. The proposed USMCA and U.S.-Japan digital trade agreement set standards for digital trade rules, ensuring cross-border data flows and protecting data privacy. These agreements aim to establish a legal framework for an open North American digital economy and serve as templates for future U.S. FTAs. The U.S. government is actively participating in international forums to discuss internet governance issues and prioritize maintaining a global network that is open, interoperable, reliable, and secure. The USMCA and U.S.-Japan agreements, along with the TPP-11 rules, focus on digital trade regulations, emphasizing open cross-border data flows. Unlike EU and Chinese FTAs, the TPP-11 ensures data flow openness. The U.S. lacks a centralized approach to regulating the digital economy and internet governance, unlike some other countries. The United States does not manage the internet but sets laws and policies for its use by the private sector. China aims to be a \"cyber superpower\" with state-directed internet policies that limit information flow and discriminate against foreign companies. The Chinese government promotes \"Internet Sovereignty\" to expand trade and set guidelines for internet regulation. This concept was introduced in a white paper in 2010, asserting China's jurisdiction over the internet within its territory. Citizens and organizations must adhere to Chinese laws and protect internet security. China promotes \"internet sovereignty\" in contrast to the U.S. support for a global, open internet. The Chinese government emphasizes respecting each country's right to choose its own cyber development path and participate in international cyberspace governance equally. China's tightly controlled domestic system allows for strict information control and economic advantage for Chinese players. China's state control over the internet and digital technologies for domestic surveillance and social credit system has been termed \"digital authoritarianism.\" The PRC social credit system monitors individual and corporate behavior, with firms having social credit profiles. China's social credit system monitors corporate behavior through a central database developed by China's National Development and Reform Commission. Data disclosure requirements may compel firms to provide sensitive information to the government, raising concerns about discrimination against multinational firms and increased compliance costs. The \"Great Firewall\" in China censors foreign websites and apps, leading to an opaque market access regime. China's internet freedom is heavily restricted, with China being labeled as the worst abuser of internet freedom in 2018 by Freedom House. The country's national internet governance regime, highlighted by the Cybersecurity Law, poses concerns for U.S. firms operating in China due to requirements such as providing full access to proprietary data to the government and storing data locally. The differences in online access between U.S. and Chinese users further isolate China's internet regime from the rest of the world. China's restrictive internet policies, including the Cybersecurity Law, require U.S. firms to provide access to proprietary data and store it locally. This has led to concerns about intellectual property protection and data security, prompting some firms to avoid entering or limit their presence in the Chinese market. Collaboration with local Chinese firms through joint ventures may be necessary for U.S. companies to operate in China. Apple, for example, faces restrictions on offering certain services in China and must use a government-backed provider for its iCloud service. These policies have raised concerns among U.S., EU, and other officials and executives about Chinese companies. Chinese companies operating overseas using business models that give access to sensitive data raise concerns among U.S., EU, and other officials. China exports technologies like security cameras and internet filtering software to exert control over populations. Analysts debate whether China is exporting digital authoritarianism through internet governance systems. China exports enabling technologies and infrastructure, potentially giving Chinese authorities access to data. This expands China's influence in ICT markets and international standards forums, promoting indigenous innovation in emerging technologies like AI and 5G through projects like the Belt and Road Initiative and Digital Silk Road. China is increasing its participation in international standards-setting bodies like the ISO to balance its isolationist tendencies with economic gains. The EU's approach to internet governance is less state-controlled than China's but more regulatory than the US. The EU aims to establish itself as a technology leader. The EU aims to establish itself as a technology leader and set its mark on global internet norms by working on technological sovereignty, digital revolution, and artificial intelligence. This includes focusing on infrastructure, connectivity, services, data, regulation, and investment to ensure Europe's digital sovereignty and benefit from the digital development while promoting societal values and inclusiveness. The EU is striving for technological sovereignty in trade policy, aiming for digital leadership while preserving the \"European way.\" There is a push for a third way internet regime between the US and China, with some advocating for cyber sovereignty and an independent European internet architecture. The EU is seeking cyber sovereignty and an independent European internet architecture to protect data, privacy, free expression, and state security. Critics suggest this is driven by protectionist motives to compete with U.S. and Chinese internet firms, while others see it as a way to preserve the internet as a global public good. German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasizes the need to balance digital sovereignty with global cooperation. The EU aims for digital sovereignty without isolation, emphasizing the ability to shape digital transformation. Key EU digital initiatives like GDPR impact U.S. firms operating in the EU by enforcing data protection rules EU-wide. The EU is working on digital sovereignty through initiatives like GDPR, impacting U.S. firms in the EU. The GDPR may set global data privacy standards, with countries like Brazil imitating parts of it. The German Economy Ministry is developing a cloud-hosting service (Gaia-X) as a European alternative to U.S. and China-based providers. The EU is aiming for digital sovereignty by offering government cloud services like Nextcloud to limit dependence on U.S. technology companies. The Digital Single Market (DSM) initiative seeks to unify the EU market and drive economic growth through technology and digital trade. EU policymakers are implementing rules under the DSM that firms doing business in the EU must comply with, but it is unclear how these initiatives will align with U.S. policy and norms. The EU's Digital Services Act aims to establish uniform rules for online platforms and digital services, including intermediary liability. Concerns have been raised about how platform regulation may impact competition and favor EU entities. Additionally, Digital Services Taxes (DSTs) have been proposed in Europe, targeting revenue earned by multinational corporations in the digital economy sector. Proponents argue that digital firms are undertaxed, while U.S. critics see DSTs as targeting American tech companies due to high minimum thresholds. The EU's Digital Services Act aims to establish uniform rules for online platforms and digital services, including intermediary liability. Concerns have been raised about how platform regulation may impact competition and favor EU entities. Digital Services Taxes (DSTs) have been proposed in Europe, targeting revenue earned by multinational corporations in the digital economy sector. Without a multilateral agreement or an EU-wide rule, DST policies vary across European countries. Countries outside the EU, such as Canada, are also considering implementing a DST. The UK's future internet regime after Brexit is unclear, with discussions continuing on potential bilateral trade negotiations. The UK's future internet regime post-Brexit is uncertain. The UK aims to maintain GDPR compliance but requires an adequacy decision from the EU to ensure smooth data flow. UK leaders seek regulatory autonomy in some areas while aligning with the EU in others. Potential UK regulatory changes may impact internet policy alignment with the US. Differences in US and UK internet policies may need to be addressed in future bilateral trade negotiations. India and Vietnam are examples of countries seeking to balance U.S. and Chinese internet policies while protecting their domestic industries. India aims to become a technology leader by exporting services and opening access to foreign markets, but also uses protectionist rules to shield its industry. India's draft e-commerce policy aims to protect domestic industry through local data storage requirements and national standards. Additional policies may restrict international e-commerce platforms and require supply chain adjustments. The country's Personal Data Protection Bill focuses on data localization and limits cross-border data transfer for security reasons. India has also taken measures to curb internet freedom, citing reasons like halting disinformation. India's imposition of tariffs on ICT imports has led to a WTO dispute with the EU and the United States. India's decision not to extend the temporary WTO moratorium on tariffs on electronic transmissions may impact ongoing e-commerce negotiations. President Trump terminated India's eligibility for the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences in 2019 due to concerns about market access restrictions. India's imposition of tariffs on ICT imports has led to a WTO dispute with the EU and the United States. President Trump terminated India's eligibility for the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) in 2019 due to concerns about market access restrictions. Bilateral trade discussions between the U.S. and India are ongoing to address key concerns, including nontariff barriers to digital trade. Vietnam is adopting elements of the Chinese internet approach, such as data localization requirements, while also liberalizing its economy to benefit from the U.S.-China trade war. Vietnam, as part of TPP-11, has a two-year grace period before facing dispute settlement for e-commerce regulations. The country must reconcile its restrictive internet policies with TPP-11 commitments on data flows. Vietnam may need to adjust cybersecurity regulations or claim national security exemptions. Additionally, Vietnam is aligning with the U.S. by avoiding Chinese 5G equipment in the telecommunications sector. Providers are avoiding purchasing 5G equipment from Chinese suppliers due to concerns raised by U.S. cybersecurity officials. The Vietnamese government has not taken a formal stance on western or Chinese telecommunications equipment. Trade negotiations aim to establish enforceable rules for international trade and bridge differing internet regimes. The WTO lacks a comprehensive agreement on digital trade, with existing agreements focusing on ICT goods and e-commerce. The WTO ITA and e-commerce moratorium show a focus on tariffs and non-discrimination in trade negotiations. Non-tariff barriers and standards development are areas that still need attention as technology evolves. Plurilateral negotiations offer a chance to establish new international rules for digital trade. Recent trade agreements are starting to include commitments on digital issues. Bilateral and plurilateral trade agreements now include commitments on the digital economy, adding complexity to international trade rules. Various FTAs offer ideas for broader WTO negotiations. Over 75 countries, including the US, are involved in WTO e-commerce negotiations to establish global rules for digital trade. Australia, Japan, and Singapore are leading the Joint Statement Initiative (JSI) to explore future WTO negotiations on electronic commerce. Negotiations began in January 2019, focusing on information exchanges and outreach to developing countries. Some countries have submitted proposals outlining their positions, reflecting the diversity of internet regimes globally. India and South Africa have chosen not to participate to protect their policy space. The United States is actively participating in WTO e-commerce talks, submitting a discussion paper with high-standard trade provisions. The paper aims to safeguard and promote digital trade, emphasizing a market-driven, open internet. Key provisions include protecting cross-border data flow and ensuring fair treatment. The US proposal for WTO e-commerce talks aims to protect cross-border data flow, prevent data localization mandates, ensure fair treatment of digital products, protect proprietary information, collaborate on cybersecurity, and facilitate internet services and trade. It includes provisions similar to the USMCA for financial services and internet intermediaries. China's proposal focuses on facilitating e-commerce and global value chains. China's proposal for WTO e-commerce talks emphasizes facilitating digital trade to benefit developing countries, advocating for varying levels of ambition in negotiations and respect for internet sovereignty. It prioritizes development needs like bridging the digital divide and capacity building. China's proposal for WTO e-commerce talks focuses on preventing trade restrictions on ICT equipment and products, reflecting a vision of separate national internets. The limited overlap between U.S. and Chinese proposals poses challenges for negotiators. The EU proposal seeks comprehensive WTO disciplines including provisions on e-commerce, data protection, and intellectual property. The EU proposes revising the WTO Reference Paper on Telecommunications Services to promote competition and protect personal privacy. It allows cross-border data flows but also permits members to maintain safeguards for data protection. Other countries have put forth proposals focusing on extending the moratorium on duties on electronic transmissions and including provisions on consumer protection and security. Industry supports plurilateral negotiations for enforceable rules and certainty in international trade. Priorities include open cross-border data flows, protection of source code, and promoting trade in services. USMCA, U.S.-Japan agreement, and U.S. proposal align with industry provisions. One civil society group opposes ongoing WTO negotiations, fearing they will benefit large multinational tech companies over developing countries. Another group advocates for transparency, consumer protection, and competition in negotiations, but warns against including data protection, privacy, net neutrality, AI, and cybersecurity in trade agreements. Consumer groups are engaging with WTO reps for transparency but lack consensus on data privacy and flows. Consumer groups are working on addressing data privacy and data flow issues in WTO negotiations. They aim to streamline proposals for the next ministerial conference in June 2020. Negotiations will need to tackle controversial issues to reach a meaningful agreement. Commonalities and differences in proposals suggest potential controversies and challenges ahead. E-commerce measures like e-signatures and consumer protection are likely to find consensus among parties. The U.S., Chinese, and EU proposals all include extending WTO obligations. The U.S., Chinese, and EU proposals in WTO negotiations include extending the temporary moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions. Digital services taxes may be addressed directly or left for ongoing OECD negotiations. Differences exist on data flow protections, with China opposing commitments. Personal data privacy is a challenging issue. The negotiations in the WTO involve discussions on data flows, personal data privacy, and cybersecurity provisions. Balancing trade facilitation with sovereignty is crucial, especially for members developing their digital agenda. Maintaining flexibility and policy space is essential. Analysts suggest that plurilateral negotiators must choose between a narrow agreement focused on e-commerce facilitation to retain more participants or a high-standard broad agreement like the one between the US and Japan, which may deter some participants. Possible approaches include a staggered or early harvest approach to reach consensus on less controversial issues early on. This could establish a common framework for future negotiations but may not have a significant impact on countering trade barriers. Some experts propose a tiered agreement for plurilateral negotiations on e-commerce. Parties could accept binding commitments on less controversial issues, with more ambitious provisions agreed on a non-MFN basis. This approach aims to create a common framework without necessarily preventing the splitting of the internet into different \"dataspheres.\" Interoperability mechanisms could be established under the WTO to allow open data flows between different cybersecurity or data privacy regimes. Staged implementation and capacity building provisions, similar to those in other WTO agreements, could provide flexibility and inclusion. This could give developing countries more time to make domestic changes and implement commitments, while capacity building could encourage all parties to commit to more ambitious obligations. For example, the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement requires donor members to provide capacity building and support to developing and least-developed members. The Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) at the WTO provides capacity building and support to developing and least-developed members. Implementation progress is tied to technical and financial capacity. International standards play a crucial role in trade agreements, especially in ICT goods and emerging technologies. Technology companies benefit from developing international standards for market access and cost reduction. International standards are crucial for trade agreements, promoting transparency, innovation, and flexibility. Standards development is becoming more complex as technologies converge, with WTO members encouraged to use relevant international standards to reduce trade barriers. SDOs like ISO and 3GPP are gaining attention from various industries for their role in developing these standards. China's state-led approach to standardization under the Revised Standardization Law has led to increased participation in international standards development, especially for emerging technologies. Some stakeholders question the benefits and risks of Chinese involvement, raising concerns about strategic and nationalist motives. China's strategic and nationalist focus, driven by the Communist Party of China, prioritizes protecting and advancing its values globally. China prefers multilateral institutions like the U.N. over U.S.-backed multi-stakeholder standards organizations. The debate over international versus Chinese standards, especially in emerging 5G networks, highlights competition between Chinese and Western technology companies. China controls its industry's participation in global standards organizations and international projects. Some U.S. stakeholders advocate for increased participation in standard development to maintain U.S. leadership in emerging technologies. The Trump Administration emphasized U.S. leadership in AI standards through Executive Order 13859, prompting NIST to call for deeper engagement in AI standards development. Congress has a policy interest in the divergence in national internet regimes and its impact on digital trade. Key issues include examining the U.S. position in WTO e-commerce negotiations, exploring China's digital authoritarianism, and its impact on the global digital economy. Congress has a policy interest in the divergence in national internet regimes and its impact on digital trade. Efforts are being made to counter China's digital policies through investments in telecommunications and internet infrastructure. A bipartisan bill aims to improve and secure internet access in developing countries to promote innovation, economic growth, free speech, democracy, and good governance. The potential impact of a splintering internet on the U.S. economy is a concern for Internet governance. Congressional oversight could examine the economic impact of the fractured global internet on U.S. businesses and consumers, as well as analyze different approaches to internet governance in EU or Chinese FTAs compared to U.S. agreements. Additionally, Congress could assess the economic impact of technology trade restrictions in China and other countries on U.S. companies. To establish global standards and rules through U.S. participation in SDOs, international forums, and trade negotiations. Congress could hold hearings on U.S. involvement in standard-setting and China's role in international standards discussions. Congress may consider promoting hosting of standards meetings for more U.S. stakeholder participation."
