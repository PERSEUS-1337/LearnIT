    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"California New River Restoration Act of 2017\". The New River originates in Mexicali, Mexico, flows into the United States through Calexico, and drains into the Salton Sea. It covers approximately 750 square miles, with 63 percent in Mexico and 37 percent in the US. The river faces significant water pollution issues due to agricultural runoff, raw sewage, pesticides, and industrial discharges. The New River, flowing from Mexico to the Imperial Valley, became highly polluted by the 1980s, posing health risks to local populations. In 1992, a sanitation strategy was established by the International Boundary Water Commission, leading to two immediate repair projects funded by both countries. In 1995, the EPA provided funds for water quality control projects. In the late 1990s, the US and Mexico funded the construction of wastewater treatment plants, with New River water treated and chlorinated before being used for reforestation. Additionally, a 10-year effort addressed the pollution source by building a new sewage treatment plant in Mexicali and developing a site plan for the river on the US side. In 2009, California mandated the creation of a strategic plan by the California-Mexico Border Relations Council to improve the water quality of the New River and develop a river parkway. In 2012, the Council approved the strategic plan for the New River Improvement Project. In 2016, the project's infrastructure was revised, and California allocated $1.4 million for grants or contracts. The revised New River Improvement Project includes a large trash screen, conveyance system, aeration devices, new pump station, and managed wetlands. The project received $1.4 million for planning, design, environmental review, and permitting work. Improved efficiency, cost effectiveness, and increased private-sector investments are needed for ongoing conservation efforts at the New River. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms such as Administrator, Mexican, New River, Program, and Restoration and protection. Establishment of the California New River Restoration Program. The Administrator shall establish the \"California New River restoration program\" within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Duties include implementing projects for the New River in consultation with various entities for restoration and protection activities. The Administrator shall establish the \"California New River restoration program\" within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The program will support science-based restoration and protection activities, target cost-effective projects with measurable results, and maximize conservation outcomes without increasing Federal full-time equivalent employees. Coordination with various Federal agencies is required in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Administrator of General Services. Grants and technical assistance will be provided in accordance with section 5. The California New River restoration program will involve coordination with various Federal agencies, state agencies, and public organizations for conservation strategies in the United States and Mexico. The California New River restoration program aims to coordinate activities among different entities for the restoration and protection of the New River. This includes enhancing fish and wildlife habitat, improving water quality, managing water for flood mitigation, and increasing public access. The California New River restoration program aims to improve public access and recreation along the river while also focusing on ecological needs, maximizing resilience of natural systems, engaging the public through outreach and education, increasing scientific capacity, and providing technical assistance for restoration and protection activities. Technical assistance is provided for restoration and protection activities related to the New River. SEC. 5. GRANTS AND ASSISTANCE. The Administrator will provide grants and technical assistance to various entities in the US and Mexico to achieve program goals. Criteria will be developed to ensure activities align with program purposes and priorities. The Federal share of project costs will not exceed 55 percent. The Administrator may partner with organizations like the North American Development Bank to manage grant implementation. The selected organization will receive advance payments for each fiscal year to carry out the program. The Administrator will invest and reinvest grant amounts for the program's benefit and administer the implementation to support public-private partnerships. The Administrator will submit annual reports to Congress on the implementation of the Act, detailing funded projects and their status."
