The definition of the term 'filing date' is clarified in Section 100 of title 35, United States Code. Section 102(e) is amended to specify conditions for patentability regarding novelty and loss of right to patent. Section 119 of title 35, United States Code is amended to allow an application for a patent to have the same effect as if it was filed on the filing date of a previously filed application if certain conditions are met. The filing date of a previously filed application can have the same effect on a new patent application if certain conditions are met, such as filing within one year and containing a specific reference to the previous application. This invention must be disclosed in the specification of the previous application filed in the United States before the new application is filed. Section 120 of title 35, United States Code, allows for the benefit of an earlier filing date in the United States for a new patent application if certain conditions are met. The new application must be filed before the patenting, abandonment, or termination of proceedings on the previously filed application.

The provisions of this Act and its amendments will take effect 90 days after enactment and will only apply to applications filed on or after that date."
