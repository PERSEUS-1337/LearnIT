    "content": "The House and Senate passed their versions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, containing provisions affecting military personnel. A conference committee resolved differences between the bills, leading to President Trump signing the bill into law on December 20, 2019. President Donald J. Trump signed the bill into law (P.L. 116-92), highlighting selected personnel-related issues of high congressional and constituent interest. CRS analysts are identified for each issue, with some previously addressed in the FY2019 NDAA (P.L. 115-232). The authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 were specified for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. In response to the demands of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Congress increased the authorized personnel strength of the Army and Marine Corps. However, with the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress began reversing those increases. Despite slight end-strength increases for the Army and Marine Corps in FY2017, the Army did not reach its authorized end-strength in FY2018 and FY2019 due to missing enlisted recruiting goals. The Air Force's end-strength remained generally stable. The Air Force's end-strength generally declined from 2004 to 2015 but increased from 2016 to 2019. The Navy's end-strength declined from 2002 to 2012, increased in 2013, and remained stable through 2017; it increased again in 2018 and 2019. The Administration's FY2020 budget proposed a decrease for the Army and increases for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force due to challenges in recruiting new enlisted personnel. The Army has adjusted its end-strength growth ramp to add 2,000 Soldiers per year, aiming for 478,000 in FY 2019 and 480,000 in FY 2020. This increase is in response to challenges in military recruiting. The enacted bill approved end-strengths matching the Administration's request. The Selected Reserve end-strengths for FY2001 were also discussed. The overall authorized end-strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 6% over the past 18 years, with reductions in various reserve components. The Administration's FY2020 budget proposed decreases in the Army National Guard and Army Reserve. The Administration's FY2020 budget proposed decreases in the Army National Guard, Army Reserve, and Navy Reserve, with increases for the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve. The Army National Guard fell short of its authorized end-strength due to recruiting challenges and attrition losses, but efforts are being made to address these issues. The Army Reserve faced challenges in meeting its end-strength goals, leading to a reduction in the FY 2019 target and a focus on achievable targets for FY 2020. Efforts are being made to address recruiting and retention issues to reach projected end-strength levels by FY 2024. The Army Reserve is working towards achieving an end strength of 189,250 by the end of FY 2019 and sustaining that level through FY 2020. The enacted bill approved end-strengths identical to the Administration request. References to previous reports on military personnel issues are available for more information. The Department of Defense (DOD) provides reproductive health services in military treatment facilities (MTFs) and through TRICARE. Services include counseling, therapy, and treatment for male and female fertility issues. DOD policy ensures access to comprehensive contraceptive counseling and services during various healthcare visits. Fertility services, including diagnostic procedures, are also offered by DOD. DOD offers fertility services including diagnostic procedures, treatment for reproductive system issues, genetic testing, prescription drugs, and assisted reproductive services for seriously ill/injured active duty servicemembers. Active duty military personnel usually have no out-of-pocket costs for DOD health care services, but may need to pay for reproductive health services not directly provided or covered by DOD. Other DOD beneficiaries may have cost-sharing based on their TRICARE health plan. The DOD offers comprehensive contraceptive counseling and methods, with potential cost-sharing for non-active duty beneficiaries. Reproductive health services like cryopreservation are not typically covered unless specific criteria are met. The Senate bill includes a reporting requirement for a study on infertility among Armed Forces members. A study on infertility among Armed Forces members is to be reported to the House and Senate armed services committees by June 1, 2020. It will cover the number of servicemembers diagnosed with infertility, incidence of miscarriage among female servicemembers, infertility rates compared to civilians, demographic information on infertile servicemembers, availability of infertility services, criteria for service-connection for infertility, and DOD policies for geographic stability during infertility treatment. The Defense Health Agency administers the TRICARE program, providing health care services to approximately 9.5 million beneficiaries. The agency ensures a medically ready force for combatant commands in both peacetime and wartime. The Defense Health Agency oversees the TRICARE program, serving around 9.5 million beneficiaries and ensuring medical readiness for combatant commands. Congress mandated reforms to streamline the Military Health System, transferring management of Medical Treatment Facilities to the DHA Director and reorganizing internal structures. Service surgeons general now act as advisors to their respective military branches and to the DHA. The implementation plan outlines DOD's reform of the MHS to a streamlined organizational model with standardized care delivery, reduced overhead, and improved oversight. Congress revised the reform mandate, clarifying tasks and extending the deadline to September 30, 2021. DOD accelerated certain tasks, transferring U.S.-based MTFs to the DHA on October 1, 2019. Overseas MTFs will transition to the DHA by 2020-2021. The enacted bill clarifies responsibilities for DHA and other medical entities, including managing MTFs, providing health service support, conducting medical research, and recruiting personnel. It amends qualifications for DHA assistant director and deputy directors, allows reassignment of civil service employees, and adds roles like provision of health care and coordination with military services. The enacted bill clarifies the roles and responsibilities of service surgeons general, including support for combatant commanders, deployment requirements, combat medical capabilities, and medical readiness of the Armed Forces. DOD is consolidating medical research programs under the DHA, with the DHA coordinating all research, development, test, and evaluation funds for the defense health program. The USAMRMC administers the congressionally-directed medical research programs. In FY2017, USAMRMC executed 76% of the total DHP RDT&E funds. USAMRMC restructured its responsibilities under DHA and Army Futures Command. Section 737 of the enacted bill directs the Secretary of Defense to retain manpower and funding resources with USAMRMC until September 30, 2022. The DOD plans to transfer resources from USAMRMC to the DHP and maintain USAMRMC as a Center of Excellence for Biomedical Research. The DOD's budget request for FY2020 includes reducing the active duty medical force by 13% to align with National Defense Strategy requirements. The Army would see the largest reduction in medical forces (-16%), followed by the Air Force (-15%) and the Navy (-7%). The plan includes transferring positions to new health service support positions in deployable units. The DOD plans to reduce its active duty medical force by 13% to align with National Defense Strategy requirements. This includes transferring positions to new health service support roles in deployable units, transferring resources from USAMRMC to the DHP, and maintaining USAMRMC as a Center of Excellence for Biomedical Research. Section 719 of the enacted bill limits DOD actions to reduce or realign its active duty medical force until certain internal reviews and outreach actions are conducted within specific timeframes. Exceptions allow DOD to proceed with reducing or realigning certain positions. The Military Health System (MHS) aims to build strong partnerships with civilian health care organizations to enhance military medical readiness and deliver health entitlements. A pilot program authorized by Section 740 of the bill will improve medical surge capabilities and interoperability with civilian health care organizations. The pilot program authorized by Section 740 of the bill aims to enhance Disaster Medical System interoperability with civilian health care organizations and federal agencies. DOD is directed to study military-civilian integrated health delivery systems and submit a report on findings and a plan for further development of health partnerships within 180 days of enactment. The characterization of service when a servicemember is discharged, awards received, and length of service can impact eligibility for veterans' benefits and employment opportunities. Statutorily established entities like a board of correction of military records (BCMR) and a discharge review board (DRB) address service record inaccuracies or injustices. A board of correction of military records (BCMR) and a discharge review board (DRB) provide administrative processes for military personnel and former servicemembers to request record corrections and changes to the reason for discharge or characterization of service. Requests must be made within specific timeframes, and any monetary claims associated with changes must be presented to a BCMR. Changes in service policy do not affect preceding discharges unless retroactive or materially different to enhance servicemember's rights. The enacted bill substantially enhances servicemembers' rights by requiring liberal consideration for discharge reviews involving PTSD, TBI, or mental health conditions related to combat or sexual assault. It includes provisions on oversight, PTSD/TBI, and separations for homosexual conduct. Section 522 reduces the number of required DRB. Section 522 of the enacted bill reduces the number of required DRB members from five to three, reallocating the fourth and fifth members to new DRBs. Section 523 creates a new entity for discharge review appeals with new reporting requirements. Section 524 extends restrictions on personnel level reductions at service review agencies until December 31, 2025. Each Service Secretary must report plans to reduce application backlogs and maintain personnel. Section 521 of the enacted bill requires a DRB or BCMR to obtain a medical opinion from specified health care professionals on cases related to PTSD, TBI, or other trauma mental health conditions. Advice must be sought from professionals with training in PTSD, TBI, or other trauma treatment for cases related to combat or sexual trauma. Section 525 amends training requirements for BCMR and DRB. Section 525 of the enacted bill expands training for BCMR and DRB members to include education on sexual trauma, intimate partner violence, and responses to these events. Section 527 removes the presumption that a discharge for homosexual conduct was correct, allowing for review and potential change of service characterization. Recent reform proposals have aimed to reduce the Defense Commissary Agency's reliance on appropriated funds without compromising patrons' benefits or reducing revenue from military exchanges. However, consolidation is prohibited without new legislation. Section 627 of the FY2019 NDAA required changes to training for BCMR and DRB members, including education on sexual trauma and intimate partner violence. The FY2019 NDAA required a study on consolidating commissaries and military exchanges into a single defense resale system, which projected significant cost savings. Opponents fear potential higher costs and failure to achieve projected savings, leading to increased prices for patrons. In the FY2019 NDAA, Congress authorized $1.3 billion for DeCA to operate 236 commissary stores on military installations worldwide. The enacted provision requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review DOD's business case analysis before merging the various resale entities into a single entity. GAO is to provide an interim report by March 1, 2020, and a final report by June 1, 2020. The House-passed bill required a report on military commissaries and exchanges management practices by the Defense Secretary within 180 days. It aimed to reduce operating costs by $2 billion from 2020 to 2024 without increasing costs for patrons. The enacted bill extended MWR privileges to Foreign Service Officers on mandatory home leave, allowing the use of military lodging from January 1, 2020. The enacted bill extends MWR privileges to Foreign Service Officers on mandatory home leave, allowing the use of military lodging from January 1, 2020. It also requires coordination for business transformation efforts and the implementation of new technologies and marketing strategies for the defense resale system. The enacted bill includes provisions for advertising commissary sales, fees collected by DeCA, and procurement of locally sourced products in commissary stores to offset operating costs and maintain patron savings. Throughout the history of the Armed Forces, Congress has established criteria for recruitment, promotion, and separation based on demographic characteristics. Changes in laws and policies have allowed for diversity and inclusion, including women in combat roles and LGBT individuals. These changes have been contentious and ongoing. In FY2009, Congress authorized the Military Leadership Diversity Commission (MLDC) and in 2012, DOD issued a five-year Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan. In 2013, Congress mandated DOD to develop a plan for diversity in military leadership. The House bill includes provisions for diversity and inclusion, while the Senate bill does not. Section 526 of the House bill requires DOD to implement a strategic plan consistent with the 2018 National Military Strategy by January 1, 2020. Section 529 of the enacted bill mandates DOD to implement the new plan within one year. The DOD is required to implement a new strategic plan within one year. Surveys will now ask about experiences with extremist activity. Recent policy changes allow individuals who identify as transgender to serve. The DOD's new policy allows transgender individuals to serve in the Armed Forces, with certain restrictions on those with a history of gender dysphoria. Waivers can be sought for exceptions to these standards. Military medical care may be provided for gender dysphoria, with retention possible without a waiver if deemed medically unnecessary and if all standards are met. The enacted bill requires DOD to submit an annual report on servicemembers seeking waivers for transgender-related conditions, with clarifying language on data reporting and protection of member information. Waiver consideration for applicants with gender dysphoria or history of transition treatment is encouraged under the same standards. Reporting requirement expires in 2023. The conferees encourage waiver authorities to consider waivers for transgender individuals under the same standards as those with analogous conditions. Entry into the Armed Forces requires meeting physical, medical, mental, and moral standards, with additional qualifications for certain specialties. Gender-neutral qualification standards are mandated by law. Section 530B would require service entry standards to focus solely on an individual's ability. Women were historically prohibited from certain combat roles until December 3, 2015, when all combat roles were opened to women who meet gender-neutral standards. Gender-integrated training is prevalent across military services, except for Marine Corps basic training. In 2019, the Marines graduated the first gender-integrated boot camp class at Marine Recruit Depot Parris Island. The House bill would phase out gender-segregated Marine Corps recruit training at Parris Island and San Diego within five to eight years. The bill also includes provisions for sharing lessons learned on gender integration and examining recruitment strategies for women in foreign militaries. The final bill did not adopt provisions for gender-segregated Marine Corps recruit training phase-out or examining recruitment strategies for women in foreign militaries, as recommended by DACOWITS. The Family Advocacy Program (FAP) within DOD focuses on clinical assessment, supportive services, and treatment for domestic abuse and child abuse in military families, providing an annual report to Congress on these issues. In FY2018, there were reported rates of child abuse and neglect in military homes, with 26 child abuse-related fatalities and an increase in reported spousal abuse. DOD has been collecting data on unmarried intimate partner abuse since FY2006, with 1,024 incidents in FY2018. Special victim counsels (SVC) provide specialized legal support for these cases. The enacted bill expands Special Victims' Counsel (SVC) staffing and authorizes SVC services for military-connected victims of domestic violence. The Administration opposes this measure, citing concerns about decreased access for sexual assault victims to SVCs/VLCs and high caseloads for SVC/VLCs. The bill requires SVCs to receive specialized domestic violence training, serve for a minimum of two years, and be supported by trained paralegals. DOD must provide a report on implementation within 120 days of enactment. The transitional compensation benefit provides financial security to dependent family members of servicemembers separated due to dependent-abuse offenses. Recipients receive monthly payments for 12 to 36 months at the same rate as dependency and indemnity compensation. They also have access to military benefits and TRICARE healthcare services. Sections 621 and 601 of the House and Senate bills aim to expand this authority. The House and Senate bills aim to expand the authority of the Secretary concerned to grant exceptional transitional compensation in an expedited manner for dependents who are victims of abuse. This would allow compensation to start while the offending servicemember is still on active duty. Additionally, the bills call for a comprehensive review of the transitional compensation program and the issuance of military protective orders in cases of domestic violence. The House bill aims to amend 10 U.S.C. \u00a71567a to require military installation commanders to notify civilian authorities within seven days of issuing a military protective order (MPO), regardless of the member's residence. It also mandates notification of the receiving command in case of a transfer of an individual with an MPO. The Department of Defense (DOD) must track and report the number of orders reported to civilian authorities annually. MPOs are not enforceable by civilian authorities, but civil protection orders (CPOs) have full force of law. The House bill requires DOD to establish policies for registering civil protection orders (CPOs) with military installation authorities. It also mandates reporting servicemembers prohibited from purchasing firearms due to domestic violence convictions to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Additionally, DOD is required to study the feasibility of creating a database for military protective orders issued in response to domestic violence. The curr_chunk discusses amending the National Instant Criminal Background Check System Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 with respect to DOD reporting and expanding the matters explored in the feasibility report. It also touches on criticisms of the Medal of Honor review process for being lengthy and bureaucratic. The DOD periodically reviews inquiries by Members of Congress and reevaluates its historical records to award the MoH retroactively or upgrade other awards. Systematic reviews began in the 1990s for World War II records, resulting in over 100 soldiers receiving the MoH, mostly posthumously. On January 6, 2016, DOD announced the results of its year-long review of military awards and decorations. The MoH was awarded to the first living recipient from the Iraq War, Army Staff Sgt. David Bellavia, on June 25, 2019. Section 583 of the House-passed bill would require DOD to review the service records of certain WWI servicemembers for potential posthumous MoH awards. In 1991, President George H.W. Bush awarded the MoH posthumously to Corporal Freddie Stowers, the first African-American recipient from WWI. The FY2015 NDAA authorized posthumous awards of the MoH to Private Henry Johnson, an African-American veteran, and Sgt. William Shemin, a Jewish-American veteran, for valor during WWI. Proponents of the Pentagon review in Section 583 point to similar reviews for minority groups who served in other conflicts from World War II to the present, with the majority of MoH awards being posthumous. The Congressional Budget Office states a possibility exists for veterans honored under Section 583 to have surviving widows eligible for expanded health benefits. Section 584 allows for posthumous award recommendations for World War I veterans. The House-passed bill would waive time limitations for awarding the MoH to Army Sergeant First Class Alwyn Cashe for valor in Iraq. Cashe led recovery efforts and delayed medical treatment until his men were evacuated. SFC Cashe led recovery efforts after an IED struck their vehicle, saving six soldiers before succumbing to his wounds. The enacted bill did not include provisions to honor WWII MoH recipients or award the MoH to Army Major John J. Duffy for valor in Vietnam. The enacted bill waives the time limitation for awarding the Medal of Honor to John J. Duffy for valor in Vietnam. Approximately 2.1 million Armed Forces members have 2.7 million dependent family members. Approximately 40% of servicemembers have children and 50% are married. The military offers quality of life programs for military families to improve recruitment, retention, and readiness. Section 1784 of Title 10, U.S. Code requires measures to increase employment opportunities for military spouses due to frequent moves. The FY2018 NDAA authorized reimbursement of relicensing costs up to $500 for military spouses relocating to a state with different licensing requirements. The House bill proposed raising the reimbursement to $1,000, while the Senate bill extended the authority to December 31, 2024. The enacted bill adopted the House provision and extended the benefit authorization to 2024. Both bills aimed to improve interstate license portability through DOD funding support. The enacted bill supports interstate license portability through DOD funding, capping funding for each compact at $1 million. The Secretary of Defense will cooperate with the Council of State Governments for funding and development. The My Career Advancement Account Scholarship Program provides up to $4,000 for eligible military spouses to pursue portable careers. The DOD program initially offered benefits to all spouses for a wider range of degrees but has since reduced the maximum benefit amount to $4000, limited eligibility to junior servicemembers' spouses, and restricted eligible degrees and career fields. Proposed sections in the House bill aimed to maintain eligibility for spouses after promotions, expand qualifying degrees to non-portable career fields, and include all enlisted and Coast Guard spouses in the program. The enacted bill expands eligibility for military spouses in the DOD program, including Coast Guard spouses. DOD operates a large childcare program for children of servicemembers and civilians, offering subsidized care on and off military installations. The House bill proposed fee assistance for survivors of Armed Forces members who die in the line of duty. The enacted bill expands eligibility for military spouses in the DOD program, including Coast Guard spouses. It authorizes fee assistance for survivors of those who die in combat-related incidents in the line of duty and clarifies hiring authorities for military childcare workers. It also seeks to improve portability of background checks for childcare workers. The enacted bill expands eligibility for military spouses in the DOD program, authorizes fee assistance for survivors of combat-related incidents, and clarifies hiring authorities for military childcare workers. Section 580 includes language clarifying direct hire authority for DOD childcare development centers. Patient safety events and medical malpractice by providers in military treatment facilities are also addressed. The Federal Tort Claims Act allows private parties to sue the United States for medical malpractice, but the Feres doctrine prohibits military servicemembers from doing so if the injuries are related to their service. Federal courts have determined that the Feres doctrine prevents military servicemembers from suing the United States for medical malpractice by military health care providers. Congress has considered changing this but the enacted bill does not alter the Feres doctrine or the FTCA. Instead, it focuses on creating an administrative claims process for injured servicemembers and overseeing the Defense Department's clinical quality assurance program. Section 731 of the bill authorizes the Secretary of Defense. The enacted bill focuses on creating an administrative claims process for injured servicemembers due to medical malpractice by Department of Defense health care providers. The Defense Secretary is authorized to settle and pay claims, with a maximum compensation of $100,000. Additional compensation may be issued by the Secretary of the Treasury if referred by the Defense Secretary. The Defense Secretary must brief Congress within 180 days on developing regulations for additional compensation exceeding $100,000. DOD monitors healthcare quality through Medical Quality Assurance programs. GAO will assess DOD's quality assurance program, including the use of the National Practitioner Data Bank for hiring and documenting adverse actions against healthcare providers. The GAO will report adverse actions against DOD health care providers to Congress by January 1, 2021. Congress has a longstanding interest in military pay raises and recruitment of high-quality personnel. Section 1009 of Title 37, U.S. Code, outlines the formula for annual pay increases indexed to the Employment Cost Index. The statutory formula for military pay raises is outlined in Section 1009 of Title 37, U.S. Code, indexed to the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The FY2020 President's Budget requested a 3.1% increase in basic pay, which would go into effect at the start of the calendar year. The House bill included provisions for a 3.1% increase in basic pay, while the Senate bill did not specify an increase, relying on the automatic adjustment provided by the statutory formula. The FY2020 President's Budget requested a 3.1% increase in basic pay, as outlined in Section 1009 of Title 37, U.S. Code. The military retirement system provides a monthly annuity after 20 qualifying years of service. Military retirees also receive a defined contribution into the Thrift Savings Plan. Military retirees and their dependents are eligible for benefits such as commissary and exchange shopping privileges, medical benefits, and space-available travel on military aircraft. Surviving spouses may receive a portion of the servicemember's retired pay through the Survivor Benefit Plan. Additionally, they may be eligible for VA benefits including Dependency and Indemnity Compensation. Military retirees are paid from the Military Retirement Fund, with contributions made annually by the federal government. The DOD budget includes a contribution to the Military Retirement Fund (MRF) based on future retirement costs, determined by the normal cost percentage (NCP) set by the DOD Retirement Board of Actuaries. The DOD Actuary calculates separate NCPs for active and reserve components but applies a single NCP across all military services. The GAO was asked to evaluate the current method used to calculate DOD retirement. The GAO found that the current method of calculating DOD retirement contributions does not reflect service-specific costs. The Senate bill proposed separate NCPs for each Service to improve resource allocation efficiency and accuracy in budget estimates at the service level. The GAO report highlights the need for improved resource allocation efficiency and accuracy in budget estimates at the service level. The enacted bill does not change the funding process but requires the Secretary of Defense to deliver an implementation plan by April 1, 2020. Certain beneficiaries may be eligible for survivor benefits from both DOD and the VA, but there is an offset that reduces SBP payments by the amount of DIC received, known as the \"widows' tax.\" The FY2018 NDAA authorized the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA) to address this issue. The Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA) was authorized to offset the reduction in Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) payments for surviving spouses. The SSIA payment is adjusted annually for cost-of-living increases. A provision in the House bill would repeal the offset and the authority to transfer the SBP benefit to dependent children. This repeal would increase federal spending by $5.7 billion over 10 years. Approximately 65,000 surviving beneficiaries are eligible for both SBP and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC). The enacted bill phases out the SBP-DIC offset over three years and repeals the optional SBP annuity for dependent children. References to various CRS reports and legal analysis are provided. In the past decade, sexual assault and harassment in the military have received significant attention from Congress and the media. Efforts have been made to study, collect data, and improve support services for victims. The Department of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office oversees policies and produces annual reports on prevalence rates. In FY2018, estimated prevalence rates were 6.2% for women and 0.7% for men in the active duty population. In FY2018, estimated prevalence rates were higher for active duty women compared to men. The discussion covers Reporting and Accountability, Prevention and Response, Victim Services and Support, and Military Justice and Investigations. The Sexual Assault Accountability and Investigation Task Force (SAAITF) was established in March 2019, making recommendations for legislative action reflected in House and Senate bills. Reporting and Accountability provisions in the bills support congressional oversight, including the establishment of the Defense Advisory Committee on Investigation, Prosecution, and Defense of Sexual Assault in the Armed Forces (DAC-IPAD). The Defense Advisory Committee on Investigation, Prosecution, and Defense of Sexual Assault in the Armed Forces (DAC-IPAD) was established in 2016 and has produced several studies. The House and Senate bills aimed to extend the committee's term and expand its research scope, including exploring restorative justice models and assessing the relationship between race/ethnicity and sexual assault investigations. The GAO reported disparities in investigations based on race and gender in May 2019. The GAO reported disparities in investigations based on race and gender in the military services, with Black and female servicemembers more likely to be subjects of investigations and trials. Section 540I of the enacted bill requires the DAC-IPAD to review racial, ethnic, and gender disparities in completed court-martial cases annually. Additionally, both House and Senate bills aimed to establish a Defense Advisory Committee for the Prevention of Sexual Misconduct. The enacted bill includes provisions for a Defense Advisory Committee for the Prevention of Sexual Misconduct with expertise in various areas. Section 540M requires a GAO report on Armed Forces implementation of statutory requirements for sexual assault. The Senate bill aimed to reinvigorate prevention of sexual assault in the military through policies promoting education, healthy relationships, and social courage. The enacted bill includes provisions for a Defense Advisory Committee for the Prevention of Sexual Misconduct with expertise in various areas. It addresses behaviors across the continuum of harm, countering alcohol abuse, and other relevant matters. The bill also includes the Catch a Serial Offender (CATCH) Program to help sexual assault victims identify potential serial offenders. Section 530 of the enacted bill ensures that restricted reports to the CATCH program maintain victim confidentiality. The bill also includes provisions to expand the Special Victim Counsel program, which provides legal assistance to victims of sexual assault in the military justice process. The Senate bill expands SVC services to include cases of retaliation and authorizes services for military-affiliated victims of domestic violence. It also establishes minimum staffing levels, requires the creation of SVC paralegal positions, and mandates specialized training in domestic violence for legal counsel. Both House and Senate bills ensure an SVC is available to victims within a specified timeframe. Section 542 of the enacted bill establishes a 72-hour window. Training on state-specific criminal justice matters, including protective orders, is required under Section 550C. Both bills also mandate the development of a safe to report policy to protect victims from punishment for minor collateral misconduct violations. The Administration expressed concerns about the House provision granting blanket immunity to alleged victims, stating it could undermine the validity of allegations. Survey data shows that collateral misconduct may deter reporting of sexual assault. The final bill did not include the safe to report provision. Section 558 of the House bill required the Secretary of Defense to draft regulations for transferring military service academy students who are victims of sexual assault. The enacted bill includes this provision and expands options to include enrollment in a Senior Reserve Officer Training Corps program. While regular active duty members can request changes in duty assignment, there are generally no regulations for cross-service transfers. Service academy cadets may change units within the same academy, but cross-service transfers are rare. Cross-service transfers are rare among military service academies due to specific entry requirements and curriculum differences. Considerations for transfer include meeting another academy's standards and completing all commissioning requirements within the four-year program. Legislation addresses confidentiality of restricted reports in cases of inadvertent disclosure of sexual assault allegations to mandatory reporters. The enacted bill requires mandatory reporters to report sexual assault information to military criminal investigative services. Provisions in the House and Senate bills aim to change how disposition decisions are made in sex-related cases for military service academies and the total force. The House bill proposed a pilot program at the academies with an independent Chief Prosecutor for certain sex-related offenses. Independent prosecutors are seen as better equipped for making disposition decisions outside the chain of command. The House bill proposed a pilot program at military service academies for disposition decisions in sex-related cases, opposed by the Administration. DOD policy requires all unrestricted reports of adult sexual assault offenses to be reviewed by a special court-martial convening authority. Section 522 of the Senate bill would codify the requirement for certain sex-related offenses. The House and Senate bills proposed provisions for training commanders on handling sexual assault cases. The enacted bill adopted these provisions, including requiring timely disposition action on nonprosecutable sex-related offenses. The provision in the enacted bill requires timely disposition of alleged sex-related offenses that a court-martial convening authority has declined to refer for trial within 90 days. The Administration objects to this provision, citing concerns about potential immunity for misconduct if action is not taken within the specified timeframe. The bills allow for cases with insufficient evidence to be referred for trial by court-martial. Provisions also require commanders to notify victims monthly on case determinations. Victims are asked about their prosecution venue preference. A DOD report found that 27% of victims were denied preferences. The Inspector General found that in 27% of cases, victims were denied the opportunity to state their preference, with insufficient documentation in the remaining cases. The enacted bill requires documentation of victim consultation on prosecution venue within 180 days. A 2019 DOD report recommended making sexual harassment a criminal offense for uniformed personnel. Section 529 of the Senate bill would require DOD to submit a report within 180 days of enactment. Section 529 of the Senate bill requires DOD to submit a report within 180 days on establishing a separate punitive article for sexual harassment in the UCMJ. The enacted bill adopts this provision. DOD policies mandate education, training, protective equipment, exposure assessments, and medical care for military and civilian personnel. Exposures are documented in DOEHRS for surveillance and prevention measures. The DOD utilizes DOEHRS data for evaluating, diagnosing, and treating patients exposed to hazardous substances. Exposure data is also documented in legacy electronic health record systems, paper records, or the ILER. The VA uses DOD's exposure data for veteran disability claims and medical care. The enacted bill addresses DOD's requirements for documenting and conducting medical surveillance on at-risk individuals or those exposed to hazards. The enacted bill addresses DOD's requirements for documenting and conducting medical surveillance on at-risk individuals or those exposed to hazards, including recording exposure to occupational and environmental health risks during deployment and providing standardized questions for assessment. It also includes provisions for lead level screening for potentially exposed children. The bill requires DOD to offer lead level screening and testing to potentially exposed children, following CDC guidelines. Test results with elevated levels are to be shared with parents, local health departments, and Congress by January 1, 2021. GAO will report on the program's effectiveness. House Section 710, authorizing $5, was not adopted. The enacted bill directs DOD to assess servicemembers for exposure to burn pits and toxic airborne hazards, enroll them in the Burn Pit Registry, and share findings with the VA. DOD is also required to assess firefighters for PFAS exposure during their annual physical examination starting October 1, 2020. The enacted bill requires DOD to assess servicemembers for exposure to blast pressure and document it in their medical records. It also modifies the longitudinal medical study on blast pressure exposure, directing DOD to assess the feasibility of uploading data into tracking systems. The CRS Report RS21688, Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention: Summary of Federal Mandates and Financial Assistance for Reducing Hazards in Housing, was coordinated by David M. Bearden and authored by Jerry H. Yen. Point of contact: Bryce H.P. Mendez."
