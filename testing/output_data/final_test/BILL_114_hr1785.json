Section 326(b) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to include voluntary verification programs for air conditioning, furnace, boiler, heat pump, and water heater products to verify compliance with energy conservation standards and Energy Star specifications. The Voluntary Verification Program Act of 2015 requires the Administrator to establish criteria for recognition of voluntary verification programs within 180 days of enactment. The Voluntary Verification Program Act of 2015 mandates nationally recognized verification programs to maintain a public list of verified products, remove products not meeting verified performance levels, and qualify new participants. The Voluntary Verification Program Act of 2015 requires new participants to conduct testing, produce test reports, allow challenge testing, verify performance ratings, and promptly notify authorities of testing results. The Voluntary Verification Program Act of 2015 mandates testing, producing test reports, allowing challenge testing, verifying performance ratings, and promptly notifying authorities of results. This includes rerating or delisting products or equipment. The Voluntary Verification Program Act of 2015 requires test reports for Energy Star compliant products to be treated as confidential information under the Freedom of Information Act. Additional requirements or standards may be set by the Secretary or Administrator. The Secretary or Administrator shall establish a voluntary verification program for manufacturers, without requiring their participation or information that can be obtained through the program. The Secretary or Administrator may maintain a list of covered products and equipment verified under a voluntary program, distinguishing between verified and non-verified products. Manufacturers in compliance with the program are not subject to periodic verification testing. The Secretary or Administrator may subject products or equipment verified under a voluntary program to periodic verification testing to ensure performance accuracy. This does not limit their authority to enforce compliance with any law."
