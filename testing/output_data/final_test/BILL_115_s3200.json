    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Modern Employment, Reform, Improvement, and Transformation Act of 2018\" or the \"MERIT Act of 2018.\" It introduces an alternative removal process for performance or misconduct in Chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code. Sec. 7551 of the MERIT Act of 2018 allows agency heads to remove employees from the civil service for performance or misconduct, with misconduct defined to include neglect of duty, malfeasance, and other violations. The agency head must determine if the individual's performance or misconduct warrants removal, following specific procedures outlined in the Act. When taking action against an employee under subsection (b), the agency head must provide written notice of the proposed personnel action, reasons for it, and the expected final date of employment. The employee has the opportunity to respond within the remaining employment period. Any removal can be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board within 7 days of the removal. The Merit Systems Protection Board must issue a decision within 30 days of receiving an appeal regarding an employee's removal. The decision to remove an employee will be upheld if supported by substantial evidence, and if the Board cannot issue a decision, the removal becomes final. If the Merit Systems Protection Board cannot issue a decision within 30 days of receiving an appeal, the removal becomes final. A report must be submitted to Congress within 14 days explaining the reasons for not issuing a decision. The Board cannot stay a removal unless the appeal is based on specific violations. During an appeal of removal from civil service, the individual is not entitled to receive any pay or benefits until a final decision is made by the Merit Systems Protection Board. The agency head must provide necessary information to expedite the appeal process. Additional authority is granted by this section. The authority provided by this section allows for expedited appeal processes in addition to existing authority under chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code. \"Subchapter VI provides alternative removal procedures for performance or misconduct under section 7551.\""
