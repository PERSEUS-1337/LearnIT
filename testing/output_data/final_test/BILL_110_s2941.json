    "content": "The Act titled \"Runway Safety Improvement Act of 2008\" includes a strategic plan for runway safety. The \"Runway Safety Improvement Act of 2008\" mandates the development of a strategic runway safety plan by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration within 6 months. The plan must include goals to enhance runway safety, actions to reduce runway incursions, required resources and time frames, and a process for monitoring performance towards the goals. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct an audit of the strategic runway safety plan developed by the Federal Aviation Administration. Periodic reports will be submitted to the Senate and House committees, detailing the effectiveness of the plan in reducing runway safety risks and the FAA's progress in implementing the plan. The Comptroller General of the United States will audit the FAA's strategic runway safety plan to assess its effectiveness in reducing risks and the progress in implementation. The Administrator must submit a plan by December 31, 2008, for installing systems to alert air traffic controllers and flight crews of potential runway incursions at high-risk commercial and general aviation airports. The plan should ensure improved situational awareness technology is available to pilots of commercial and large general aviation aircraft. The plan aims to enhance surface movement detection systems by transmitting runway incursion alerts directly to flight crews and prioritizing high-risk airports for advanced detection system installation by March 31, 2009. The plan requires aural alerts for aircraft positioning near runways by December 31, 2009, on specific types of aircraft. By June 30, 2010, airports with advanced surface movement detection systems must have the capability for alerts without controller intervention. The plan mandates that by December 31, 2010, all specified aircraft at airports with advanced surface movement detection systems must be able to receive runway incursion alerts. Additionally, a schedule for equipping aircraft under part 125 or 129 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations must be published. The Inspector General of the Department of Transportation will review the installation of funded systems to ensure they function as certified by the Administrator. The annual report must describe the proper implementation and reliability of each system to generate timely alerts for controllers and operate successfully in all climate conditions at airports. SEC. 4. INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES. Authorization of appropriations for technology investments from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund for installing systems to reduce runway incursions, with specific amounts allocated for fiscal years 2009 to 2011. Authorization of appropriations for technology investments from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund for installing systems to reduce runway incursions, with specific amounts allocated for fiscal years 2009 to 2011 to improve runway safety areas and meet Federal Aviation Administration standards. The owner or operator of each airport must improve runway safety areas to comply with FAA design standards by December 31, 2015. The Administrator will provide an annual report on progress to the Senate and House committees. SEC. 5. REVIEW OF RUNWAY AND TAXIWAY LIGHTING AND MARKINGS. The Administrator must review runway and taxiway lighting and markings at certain airports for compliance with FAA standards and identify any nonstandard lighting that may contribute to operational errors. A report must be submitted to the Senate and House committees within 60 days of the review. The House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure must submit a report describing lighting and markings variance at airport runways, identifying high-risk runways, and proposing a plan to address nonstandard runway conditions and costs. The Administrator will evaluate systems to improve safety and accident investigations by recording the operational status of lighting systems at airports. A report on the evaluation results must be submitted to the Senate and House committees within 120 days of the Act's enactment. SEC. 7. AIRCRAFT RESCUE AND FIREFIGHTING STANDARDS. The Administrator must initiate a rulemaking proceeding within 180 days to revise aircraft rescue and firefighting standards under part 139 of title 14, CFR. The rule aims to enhance protection from fires and hazardous materials incidents for the public, aircraft, and the environment. Key areas addressed include personnel responsibilities, staffing levels, response timeliness, and handling of hazardous materials incidents at airports. The proposed rule aims to revise aircraft rescue and firefighting standards at airports, focusing on personnel responsibilities, staffing levels, response timeliness, hazardous materials incidents, vehicle deployment, and equipment modernization. The rule should align with national voluntary consensus standards and assess potential impacts on airports and air transportation services. If the rule deviates from these standards, the Administrator must report to the Office of Management. The Administrator must explain any inconsistencies in the proposed rule for aircraft rescue and firefighting standards at airports to the Office of Management. The final rule must be issued within 24 months of the enactment of the Act. The Federal Aviation Administration Administrator is required to collect data on aircraft excursions without fatalities, injuries, or significant property damage, analyze the data regularly, and submit an annual report to Senate and House committees detailing trends, safety risks, and actions taken to mitigate those risks."
