    "content": "The Act is titled the \"American Veterans Disabled for Life Commemorative Coin Act\". Congress acknowledges the service and sacrifices of the Armed Forces, including those who have served in various conflicts. Americans are urged to honor and commemorate veterans, especially those who are disabled, and the construction of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial was authorized in 2000. The United States should honor living disabled veterans by minting a commemorative silver dollar coin, with proceeds going towards the construction of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint $1 silver coins in honor of disabled American veterans, with specific weight, diameter, and composition requirements. These coins will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The design of the coins minted under this Act will be emblematic of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial. Each coin will have a value designation, the year \"2010\" inscribed, and include words like \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design will be selected by the Secretary in consultation with the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation and the Commission of Fine Arts. The design of the coins minted under this Act will be emblematic of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial, with input from the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation, the Commission of Fine Arts, and the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF COINS. Coins minted under this Act will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities from a single United States Mint facility during the calendar year starting on January 1, 2010. The coins issued under this Act will be sold by the Secretary at a price equal to the face value of the coins, a $10 surcharge per coin, and the cost of designing and issuing the coins. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted with a reasonable discount on sale prices. The surcharges from coin sales under this Act will be given to the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation for the American Veterans' Disabled for Life Memorial. The Comptroller General can audit the Foundation's expenditures. Financial assurances are also required. SEC. 8 of the bill S. 633 requires financial assurances for minting and issuing coins to ensure no net cost to the government. Payment for coins must be made in full, with security or guarantee satisfactory to the Secretary. The bill S. 633 requires the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins honoring veterans disabled while serving in the Armed Forces of the United States."
