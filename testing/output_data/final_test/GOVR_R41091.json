    "content": "Humans rely on plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, with plants providing the majority of the world's food supply. In developing countries like Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, plants contribute significantly to dietary energy and protein intake. The history of plant genetic resources has seen rapid movements of domesticated crops and animals across continents, with a small number of species dominating daily diets globally. Plant genetic resources for food and agriculture are crucial for global food security. FAO estimates that key crops like rice, wheat, sugar, and corn provide over 60% of human calorie intake. Plant breeding has significantly increased crop productivity in the past 30 years, with experts emphasizing the need for developing new varieties that are high-yielding and resilient to pests, diseases, and extreme weather conditions for future food security. Crop improvement has led to plants being resistant to pests, diseases, and extreme weather events. Plant genetic resources are essential for creating new crop varieties. By 2050, the world's population is estimated to reach 9.1 billion, requiring a 70% increase in food production to meet demand due to population growth, urbanization, and rising incomes. By 2050, the demand for food due to population growth, urbanization, and rising incomes will require a 70% increase in food production. Countries rely on each other for plant genetic resources for food security, with modern crops having diverse parent materials. Most countries heavily rely on imported germplasm of staple crops from other regions, such as corn and cassava originating in South America but widely grown and stored in genebanks globally. The world's largest genebank collections of corn varieties are important for food security. Various crops like cassava, millets, sorghums, and grasses have origins in different regions but are now widely cultivated globally. The exchange of plant genetic resources has been crucial for the development of diverse food crops. A recent study showed that most regions heavily depend on genetic resources from other regions for their major food crops, highlighting the interdependence in the global food system. The high degree of interdependence in Asia argues for continued access to plant genetic resources from other regions for crop improvement. Intensive agriculture in the U.S. benefits from genetic uniformity but can lead to vulnerability to pests and diseases. An example is the 1970 outbreak of southern corn blight, which cost farmers 15% of the nation's corn crop due to genetic susceptibility. This event led to the establishment of the National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS). The National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) was established in response to the 1970 outbreak of southern corn blight, which caused significant crop loss in the U.S. The NPGS is a network of public agencies, private institutions, and individuals dedicated to conserving and using crop germplasm for improvement. It allows free exchange of germplasm with all nations for research and breeding purposes. The National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) was established to conserve and use crop germplasm for improvement. The Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN) supports NPGS by providing access to databases for managing germplasm collections. The National Genetic Resources Program (NGRP) was authorized by Congress in 1990 to acquire, preserve, and distribute germplasm important for food and agricultural production. The National Genetic Resources Advisory Council (NGRAC) advises on conservation and utilization of genetic resources for food and agriculture. The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture provides a framework for sustainable use of plant genetic resources to meet global goals of ending hunger and poverty. The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture establishes a multilateral system of access and benefit sharing for plant genetic resources, promoting food security and crop productivity. It differs from other international laws by providing free access to genetic resources for research and conservation. The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, replacing the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources, aims to ensure access and benefit-sharing of agricultural biodiversity. It originated from the FAO in 1983 and promotes the exploration, preservation, and availability of plant genetic resources for research and breeding purposes. The concept of free availability of genetic resources under the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture was not seen as compatible with intellectual property protection. Tension existed regarding farmers' rights and the contributions of generations of farmers to the development of plant genetic resources. Concerns were addressed through agreed interpretations of the Treaty in 1989 and a conference resolution in 1991 reaffirming states' sovereign rights over their plant genetic resources. The parties resolved outstanding issues on the interrelationship between the CBD and sustainable agriculture. FAO launched a revision of the IU to address access to PGRFA and farmers' rights. After seven years of negotiations, the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture was concluded, establishing the legal basis for the exchange of PGRFA covered in Annex 1. Adopted by consensus at the 31st session of the FAO. The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture was adopted by the 31st session of the FAO Conference on November 3, 2001. It entered into force on June 29, 2004, after the ratification of the 40th country. The treaty currently has 120 contracting parties. The United States signed the treaty on November 1, 2002, and it was submitted for ratification on July 7, 2008. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the treaty on December 14, 2010. The treaty aims to enable global use of plant genetic resources for food security. Its objectives include conservation, sustainable use, and fair benefit sharing. Key components include farmers' rights, access and benefit sharing system, financial and institutional provisions. The treaty aims to enable global use of plant genetic resources for food security through conservation, sustainable use, and fair benefit sharing. Key components include farmers' rights, access and benefit sharing system, financial, and institutional provisions. General provisions set a modern framework for conservation and sustainable use of PGRFA, drawing upon the Global Plan of Action. Contracting parties are tasked with conservation, evaluation, and documentation of PGRFA, promoting an integrated approach to exploration and sustainable use. Policy and legal measures promoting sustainable use of PGRFA are required to be developed and maintained by contracting parties. The treaty promotes sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food security through national commitments, international cooperation, and technical assistance. The State Department analysis suggests that the treaty can be implemented in the United States under existing USDA authorities. The U.S. currently participates in the FAO and provides technical assistance for global agriculture sustainability. The U.S. provides technical assistance for global agriculture sustainability through various programs and organizations such as FAO, USDA, and USAID. The Global Intellectual Property Academy sponsors seminars for participants from developing countries on conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources. The treaty recognizes farmers' rights and their contributions to plant genetic resource conservation for food and agriculture production. The treaty recognizes farmers' rights to save, use, exchange, and sell farm-saved seed. It also emphasizes the protection and promotion of traditional knowledge and the rights of farmers to benefit from the utilization of plant genetic resources. The United States supports such recognition and consultation at the national level. The United States recognizes the importance of consultation and acknowledgment of farmers' rights under various laws. USDA provides nonmonetary benefits to farmers through land-grant universities and extension services. The treaty focuses on the Multilateral System of Access and Benefit Sharing for genetic resources of food crops. Article 11 specifies the PGRFA covered by the MLS. The list in Annex I covers 35 crops and 29 forages, including major crops important to the United States for domestic use or export. Negotiators agreed on a list of crops based on food security and interdependence, but individual party interests influenced the final list. Major food crops like rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, and legumes are included, but some crops like soybeans and groundnuts are excluded. The Annex I list includes maize, sorghum, millets, legumes, roots, tubers, oil crops, and fruits. Some notable absences are soybeans, groundnuts, sugar cane, wild cassava relatives, and certain fruits. The MLS also covers PGRFA held in CGIAR Centers and other international institutions. Contracting parties must encourage inclusion of Annex I PGRFA in the MLS. The United States encourages depositing germplasm in the National Plant Germplasm System under authority from 7 U.S.C \u00a7 5841. Parties must facilitate access to covered PGRFA for research and agriculture purposes. Access to PGRFA under the MLS should be provided promptly and free of charge, with passport data included. Recipients cannot claim intellectual property rights that limit access to PGRFA. The State Department analysis suggests that the obligations in Article 12 of the treaty could be implemented in the United States through existing authorities, particularly the National Plant Germplasm System. This system, operated by ARS under various authorities, allows for the provision of germplasm samples from federal gene banks to requestors free of charge, as long as it does not conflict with other laws. The State Department analysis suggests that in the United States, any recourse required from contractual disputes arising from the SMTA would be available via existing authorities that allow for recognition and enforcement of arbitral judgments in the Federal Arbitration Act. Article 13 describes the types of benefit-sharing that may result from the provision of access to PGRFA, including exchange of information, access to technology, capacity-building, and financial benefit-sharing from commercialization. The SMTA adopted in June 2006 requires recipients of PGRFA commercializing products from the MLS to pay 1.1% of gross sales. Benefits should primarily go to farmers conserving PGRFA globally. The State Department suggests using existing USDA authorities to implement Article 13 for benefit-sharing. USAID provides technical assistance for agriculture development in rural areas. The treaty under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 supports agriculture development in rural areas. It includes promoting the Global Plan of Action, international plant genetic resources networks, and a global information system on PGRFA. Parties are required to implement a funding strategy to enhance financial resources for the treaty's activities. The treaty establishes a governing body to oversee the provision of financial resources for its activities, including benefits from commercialization of PGRFA. Funding targets may be set, with resources primarily used for implementing treaty plans and programs, such as strengthening technical capacity in developing countries. Parties may make voluntary contributions, but mandatory payments by contracting parties are also envisaged. The treaty establishes a governing body to oversee policy implementation and decision-making by consensus. Amendments require consensus from contracting parties and come into force after two-thirds ratify them. Dispute settlement mechanisms and third-party mediation are also provided for. The treaty establishes a governing body for policy implementation and decision-making by consensus, with provisions for dispute settlement and third-party mediation. Currently, 120 countries are parties to the treaty, including the United States, which signed it in 2002. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the treaty in 2010, but it was not considered by the full Senate. The 112th Congress may consider ratification. The treaty asserts that the United States could provide leadership and resources in agricultural biodiversity conservation, international research, and global food security. Some believe this could foster trust among contracting parties, especially developing countries. The presence of the United States may encourage countries like Japan and China to sign the treaty. Critics argue for more resources to aid in treaty implementation and benefits realization. The treaty on agricultural biodiversity conservation has seen slow progress in realizing benefits, especially for developing countries lacking technical expertise and resources. A significant achievement is the inclusion of CGIAR ex situ collection under the multilateral system, contributing to 80% of the world's energy food supply. The treaty mandates funding strategies for implementation, particularly to support developing countries. The governing body of the treaty aims to raise $116 million over the next five years through voluntary contributions from developed countries, international organizations, and private entities. Funding sources include the Global Crop Diversity Trust and mandatory contributions from commercialized products. Distribution and use of funds remain unclear, with priority given to benefit-sharing provisions. The governing body of the treaty aims to raise $116 million over the next five years through voluntary contributions from developed countries, international organizations, and private entities. Priority is given to benefit-sharing provisions, with a \"Benefit-Sharing Fund\" distributing $500,000 to 11 projects in its first biennial cycle. The projects focus on information exchange, technology transfer, capacity building, managing and conserving plant genetic resources on-farm, and sustainable use of plant genetic resources. More details are needed for a longer-term strategy to scale up the use of treaty funds to support conservation and use of PGRFA, especially by farmers in developing countries. The governing body aims to raise $116 million through voluntary contributions for benefit-sharing provisions. Some believe that if the United States becomes a party to the treaty, other countries will expect greater capacity-building resources for conservation and use of agricultural biodiversity globally. Contributions are technically voluntary, but FAO has an Indicative Scale of Contributions. Congress authorized USAID to contribute $60 million to the Global Crop Diversity Trust for conservation efforts. The United States has contributed $14.5 million to the Global Crop Diversity Trust from FY2008 to FY2012, with $10 million earmarked for FY2010. There is a question of whether additional funds will be needed for the governing body, considering the importance of the plant treaty in relation to other international agreements. The treaty aligns its objectives with the Convention on Biological Diversity. The CBD is a comprehensive international agreement dedicated to biodiversity conservation. After extensive involvement by the United States, President Clinton signed the treaty in 1993. The treaty was adapted from the International Understanding to address gaps in the CBD process related to agricultural biodiversity. Only four nations are not parties to the CBD: Andorra, Iraq, Somalia, and the United States. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee supported CBD ratification by a 16-3 bipartisan vote, but the CBD never received a ratification vote on the Senate floor. Environmental groups advocate for U.S. ratification of the CBD for biological conservation, while others oppose it due to concerns about intellectual property rights and the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. The Cartagena Protocol, an international agreement on biosafety, aims to protect biodiversity from risks of GMOs. It allows countries to use the precautionary principle to regulate biotechnology, including banning GMO imports and requiring labeling. The United States supports biotechnology for agriculture and opposes restrictions on GMO-containing commodities in international trade. The 112th Congress could evaluate ratification of the Treaty. The 112th Congress could assess the impact of ratifying the Treaty for PGRFA on the United States' stance on the CBD. The State Department suggests providing clarifying language on interpretations of MLS provisions, particularly Article 12, which prohibits recipients from claiming intellectual property rights that restrict access to PGRFA. The State Department analysis recommends notifying the governing body about the interpretation of MLS provisions, specifically Article 12.3d, to ensure intellectual property rights are not restricted. Commercialization of plant genetic materials under the treaty requires free access or a percentage of sales to be returned to the benefit-sharing fund. The treaty is seen as crucial for global food security by international agricultural researchers and development practitioners. The Global Food Security Act of 2009 authorizes increased investment in agricultural productivity, research, and technology for hunger and poverty alleviation, emphasizing the importance of research for smallholder farmers. However, there is no direct link between agricultural biodiversity conservation and economic growth in the initiatives proposed by the Administration and Congress. The Global Food Security Act of 2009 authorizes increased investment in agricultural productivity, research, and technology for hunger and poverty alleviation. However, there is no mention of how proposed programs relate to the conservation and use of PGRFA or the need for technical capacity-building in developing countries."
