    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Small Business Liability Reform Act of 2007\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the defects in the civil justice system have a direct impact on interstate commerce by reducing the availability of goods and services.

Entities, including small businesses, may face unjust costs and increased insurance expenses due to joint and several liability, leading to the need for legislation to address these concerns.
