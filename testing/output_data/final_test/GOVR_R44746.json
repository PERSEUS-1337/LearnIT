    "content": "Youth employment has declined in recent years, especially during the summer months. One solution is to support summer job programs funded by cities and the public/private sectors. These programs aim to provide income and develop skills for youth in the workforce. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunities Act made summer employment mandatory under the Youth Activities program. The report provides information on summer youth employment, focusing on low-income youth facing challenges in securing jobs. It discusses trends in youth employment, local summer job programs, federal initiatives, and considerations for Congress on supporting summer employment. The report discusses youth labor force participation rates and employment-to-population ratios, focusing on individuals aged 16 to 24. Data is collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to assess youth engagement in the labor market. The youth employment-to-population (E/P) ratio and unemployment rate are key indicators of labor market conditions for young workers. In July 2016, around 38 million individuals aged 16 to 24 were in the civilian labor force, with approximately 20 million actively participating. Labor force participation rates, E/P ratios, and unemployment rates for youth have shown seasonal increases, peaking in July of most years. The youth labor force participation rate and employment-to-population ratio have declined since the late 1990s, with peaks in July of most years. Following recessions in 2001 and 2007-2009, these rates did not fully recover to pre-recession levels. Unemployment rates remained similar in July 1996 and July 2016, with a slight upward trend in the intervening years, especially after the 2011 and 2007-2009 recessions. Recovery was slow, with the unemployment rate remaining elevated until around 2013. The labor trend data from July 1996 to July 2016 shows a significant decline in labor force participation and employment-to-population ratio for teenagers aged 16 to 19. Young adults aged 20 to 24 also experienced downward trends, but less steep. Unemployment rates for both groups remained similar over the years. The research literature lacks exploration on the labor force participation of low-income youth during the summer. During the summer, teens' employment rate increases with household income. In 2013 and 2014, about 1 in 5 teens with family incomes below $20,000 were employed, compared to 28% to 41% of teens in higher income households. Summer job programs offer employment experiences, career exploration, training in employment skills, and internships for young people aged 14 to 24. There is no census of youth employed in summer jobs, but a survey of 40 cities found that nearly all have summer job programs funded publicly and privately. A survey of 40 cities in 2015 found that around 116,000 youth were placed in summer jobs. These programs target high school students and older youth with little job experience. Mayors are expanding these programs, funded by a mix of public and private sources. For example, the Boston Private Industry Council secured funding for youth job placements. The Boston Private Industry Council secured over 2,600 unsubsidized summer jobs in 2015 from local employers like JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citi. The cost per participant for these programs is around $1,400 to $2,000, with the largest share of the budget going towards subsidized wages. Summer employment programs aim to provide income to youth, develop their skills, and meet broader objectives. Federal workforce laws have included summer job training and employment activities targeting low-income and vulnerable youth. Summer employment programs aim to improve academic outcomes, deter youth from harmful activities, and provide economic opportunities in areas with few job prospects. Summer job programs have evolved from standalone programs to optional activities under WIOA, effective as of July 1, 2015. The Youth Activities program under WIOA received $873 million in FY2016 appropriations, allocated to states based on income and employment factors. Funds are then distributed to localities through workforce development boards for education and employment activities for youth with barriers to employment. Summer employment is optional under the program, with data not yet available on participation numbers. Summer job programs were previously offered under the Workforce Investment Act. The WIA Youth Activities program, funded by WIOA, provides summer employment opportunities for low-income youth. The ARRA allocated $1.2 billion for youth employment, with 40% used for summer jobs, benefiting 374,489 youth. Congress emphasized both summer and year-round employment for youth up to age 24. The Obama Administration's Summer Opportunity Project aimed to enhance summer employment prospects for young people by providing employment, academic opportunities, and supportive services. This initiative included the development of the Summer Opportunity Resource Guide to assist communities in accessing federal resources and supports. Additionally, the Administration supported 16 communities through the \"summer impact hubs\" initiative to help disadvantaged youth connect to school and work while receiving supportive services. The Summer Opportunity Project, led by a federal representative, aimed to enhance summer employment prospects for young people by leveraging federal funds and partnerships with the private sector. LinkedIn collaborated to connect businesses with local organizations in 72 cities to provide summer jobs for disadvantaged youth. The Department of Labor allocated $21 million in FY2016 for the Summer Jobs and Beyond initiative, supporting 11 communities in expanding work opportunities for youth. The initiative, authorized under the FY2016 appropriations law, focuses on providing technical assistance and demonstration projects for new entrants and incumbent workers in the workforce. The Summer Jobs and Beyond grants aim to support local workforce development boards in expanding summer employment programs for youth ages 16 to 24, including those in or out of school with limited work experience. The grants require partnerships with employers, education agencies, and re-engagement centers to help in-school and out-of-school youth transition to work positions. The Summer Jobs and Beyond grants aim to support local workforce development boards in expanding summer employment programs for youth ages 16 to 24, including those in or out of school with limited work experience. Grantees in 11 communities are pursuing projects to provide summer jobs and academic support to in-school youth who are refugees, offer courses and summer jobs in various industries, and provide employment-related services to eligible Native American youth with limited work experience. Participants will be evaluated based on their progress towards obtaining a postsecondary credential or employment. The Summer Jobs and Beyond program aims to connect youth and young adults with job opportunities during the summer and year-round. It builds upon DOL's Urban Youth Employment Demonstration Grants, providing support for workforce development and preparing young people for work in growing industries. Services include financial literacy, apprenticeship training, leadership development, and mental health/substance abuse counseling. The program seeks to expand summer employment opportunities for youth ages 16 to 29. The executive branch has worked to increase summer job opportunities by aligning DOL youth workforce programs with other federal initiatives. HHS oversees TANF, which supports low-income families with children. Through ARRA, HHS urged states to use TANF funds for summer jobs for eligible youth. ECF, created by ARRA, provided additional funding for states to support youth employment. HHS and DOL encouraged states to use ECF for subsidized youth employment, resulting in 24 states and DC implementing summer job programs for over 138,000 youth. Columbia utilized funds to operate summer employment programs for over 138,000 youth, with support from local workforce boards and TANF offices. HHS and DOL have encouraged states to use TANF funds for summer efforts through joint letters and technical assistance. Coordination of summer employment efforts has been further encouraged by the executive branch. The executive branch has encouraged coordination of summer employment efforts through programs like CSBG and CFCIP, providing federal funds for community-based activities to reduce poverty and support employment opportunities for low-income youth. HHS has also encouraged local CSBG offices to engage in securing government-sponsored and private sector summer jobs for youth, as well as offering additional supports like mentoring and financial education. The CFCIP delivers funding to child welfare agencies to provide services and supports for older youth in foster care. The Administration has encouraged partnerships between workforce programs and child welfare agencies to support older youth in foster care and those recently emancipated. They have also urged local housing authorities to collaborate with youth service and workforce programs to create summer job opportunities for low-income youth. Additionally, the executive branch has formed partnerships with various sectors to expand summer employment opportunities through initiatives like Summer Jobs+ and Youth Jobs+. In summer 2012, the Obama Administration initiated Summer Jobs+ to create over 300,000 summer job opportunities, including 100,000 paid positions. The Youth Jobs+ initiative in 2013 aimed to provide paid positions and skills training for youth. President Obama established the My Brother's Keeper Task Force in 2014 to improve outcomes for boys and young men of color. The MBK Task Force, formed in 2014, developed recommendations to support vulnerable youth, focusing on education and employment outcomes for young men of color. Initiatives include providing summer jobs in Detroit and strengthening evidence on summer employment interventions. The MBK Task Force developed recommendations to support vulnerable youth, focusing on education and employment outcomes for young men of color. Initiatives include providing 15,000 new summer jobs in Detroit over the next 10 years. Congress may want to examine the efficacy of summer employment programs and promising approaches to serving young people. Summer jobs are short-term interventions that vary in intensity and support for youth, with limited research on their effectiveness. Some studies have shown improvements in youth behavior during summer employment programs. The Department of Labor studied youth engagement in summer employment funded under ARRA in 2009, finding that 76% demonstrated work readiness skills. Previous evaluations of federally funded summer employment programs from the 1960s to 1980s showed short-term impacts but not long-term effects. Recent research on programs like One Summer Plus in Chicago and the Summer Youth Employment Program in New York City suggest that summer jobs can reduce youth crime. Summer jobs for youth can reduce violent crime, incarceration rates, and improve academic outcomes. Challenges in developing and expanding these programs include funding uncertainties and the need for staff to juggle multiple tasks simultaneously. Some programs lack sufficient staff to match youth with appropriate worksites and prepare supervisors. The 2016 study identifies key elements for successful summer employment programs, including recruiting employers, matching youth with suitable opportunities, providing professional training, and connecting youth to other community programs. Some programs struggle to reach vulnerable youth with barriers to work, such as unstable housing. Capacity and infrastructure are essential for successful summer employment programs, including sufficient staff, technology systems for program management, and tools like guidebooks for staff and youth. Other opportunities in the community, such as year-round employment and youth preparation programs, are also important.
