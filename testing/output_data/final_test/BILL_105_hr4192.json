    "content": "Tax treatment of Alaska Native settlement trusts. Tax Exemption for Alaska Native Settlement Trusts under Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, with special rules for taxation outlined in subsection (p) for conveyance to trust. Tax Exemption for Alaska Native Settlement Trusts under Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code includes special rules for taxation related to conveyance to trust. Contributions to the Settlement Trust are not taxable for beneficiaries, with options for electing or nonelecting trust status affecting tax treatment. Settlement Trusts can elect to have specific tax provisions apply by making an election before the tax return due date for the applicable year. An election under subparagraph (A) for Settlement Trusts is irrevocable, except if the trust allows a disposition of a beneficial interest not permitted under certain regulations. The revocation of an election under subparagraph (A) for Settlement Trusts takes effect on the 1st day of the taxable year of the failure. If revoked, no further elections can be made for the taxable year of revocation or any subsequent year. Additionally, if an election is in effect, the Settlement Trust must distribute at least 55 percent of its stock. Trust must distribute at least 55 percent of its adjusted taxable income for the taxable year. If the distribution requirement is not met, a tax will be imposed on the trust. The trust can designate distributions made within 12 months after the close of the taxable year to meet the requirements. For tax purposes, distributions to beneficiaries from a trust are treated as ordinary income. Adjusted taxable income is used to determine the tax treatment of distributions. The Settlement Trust shall establish an earnings and profits account to account for earnings transferred from an Alaska Native Corporation. Distributions to beneficiaries are included in gross income as ordinary income. The account in the Settlement Trust is increased each time an Alaska Native Corporation makes a contribution. The increase is equal to the lesser of the contribution amount or the corporation's earnings and profits at the end of the taxable year. The account in the Settlement Trust is increased by contributions from an Alaska Native Corporation. Distributions to beneficiaries are treated as contributions until the account balance is zero, after which they are taxable. Earnings and profits of the corporation are reduced by the amount contributed to the trust. The Settlement Trust account is funded by an Alaska Native Corporation, with distributions to beneficiaries considered contributions until the account is depleted. Earnings and profits of the corporation are reduced by the amount contributed to the trust. Beneficiaries can elect to have federal income tax withheld on distributions, up to 15 percent. The Settlement Trust account funded by an Alaska Native Corporation allows beneficiaries to elect federal income tax withholding on distributions. Distributions from the trust are subject to reporting requirements under section 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Settlement Trust must provide information on distributions and tax withheld on returns. Filing these returns satisfies other form requirements. The amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1996, and contributions after that date. An election under section 501(p)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for a taxable year beginning in 1997 can be filed with the tax return for the first taxable year after that year without failing to meet the requirements of the Code."
