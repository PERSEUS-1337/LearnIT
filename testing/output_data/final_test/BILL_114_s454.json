    "content": "The Act titled \"Exascale Computing for Science, Competitiveness, Advanced Manufacturing, Leadership, and the Economy Act of 2015\" is also known as the \"ExaSCALE Computing Leadership Act of 2015.\" It amends previous acts to reflect this new title and includes definitions for key terms. SEC. 3 of the Exascale Computing for Science, Competitiveness, Advanced Manufacturing, Leadership, and the Economy Act of 2015 defines key terms like 'Department' as the Department of Energy and 'exascale computing' as computing with a machine that performs over 10 to the 18th power floating point operations per second. It also removes a specific reference in paragraph (6). Section 3 of the Exascale Computing for Science, Competitiveness, Advanced Manufacturing, Leadership, and the Economy Act of 2015 is amended to establish a coordinated program across the Department, develop exascale computing machine architectures, and promote the Department's missions. The Secretary shall establish National Laboratory partnerships with industry and higher education for the research and development of exascale computing systems. Access to these systems will be provided on a competitive basis to researchers in various organizations. The Secretary will select partners for partnerships through a competitive process. The Program will integrate application, computer science, and hardware architecture to ensure multiple exascale computing architectures can solve Department target applications. A report will be submitted to Congress on the integration process. The Secretary will select partners for partnerships through a competitive process to develop exascale architectures systems. A report will be submitted to Congress on how the integration is furthering application science data and computational workloads across various interests. The Secretary will submit an annual report to Congress detailing the results of a review, coordination, and management of the Program, along with funding and critical milestones. The Exascale Computing for Science, Competitiveness, Advanced Manufacturing, Leadership, and the Economy Act of 2015 is amended to authorize appropriations of $272 million for fiscal year 2016, $340 million for fiscal year 2017, and $360 million for fiscal year 2018."
