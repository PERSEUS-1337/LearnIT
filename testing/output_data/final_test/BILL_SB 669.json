    "title": "SB 669",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 89036.5 of the Education Code establishes standards for personal services contracts at California State University. Trustees can enter into these contracts for cost savings if certain conditions are met, including demonstrating actual overall cost savings compared to in-house provision of services. This includes considering additional costs such as salaries, benefits, space, equipment, and materials. When comparing costs for personal services contracts at California State University, indirect overhead costs are not included unless they are solely attributed to the function in question. Contractor costs should include continuing university costs directly associated with the contracted function. Proposals to contract out work at California State University must meet specific criteria: contractor wages must be industry-level, not significantly undercut university pay rates, not cause displacement of university employees, and not adversely affect affirmative action efforts. The contract for outsourcing work at California State University must meet specific criteria: it should not affect affirmative action efforts, ensure savings that won't be affected by cost fluctuations, justify the agreement's size and duration, be awarded through competitive bidding, include provisions for staff qualifications and nondiscrimination practices, minimize economic risks from contractor rate increases, and be with a firm (corporation, partnership, nonprofit organization, or sole proprietorship). The trustees at California State University can enter into personal services contracts under specific conditions, such as when the services are for a new university function mandated by the Legislature or when the expertise is not available within the university. The trustees at California State University can enter into personal services contracts under specific conditions, such as when the services are incidental to a purchase or lease of property, when university employees cannot accomplish the goals, or in cases of emergency for public health, welfare, or safety. The purpose of allowing personal services contracts at California State University is to provide equipment, materials, facilities, or support services that cannot be feasibly provided by the university in the location where the services are needed. Additionally, training courses can be conducted by contractors when university instructors are not available, and services of urgent, temporary, or occasional nature that would be delayed by the university hiring process are permitted. The contracting agency must show that the proposed contract will save overall costs for the state. This includes comparing the state's additional costs of providing the same service, such as salaries, benefits, and equipment. Indirect overhead costs should only be included if they are directly related to the function in question. In comparing costs for contracting services, state costs directly associated with the function must be included. This includes inspection, supervision, and monitoring expenses. Proposals to contract out work should not be approved based solely on lower contractor pay rates. Approval is possible if contractor wages are industry standard and do not significantly undercut state pay rates. The contract for contracting services must meet specific criteria: it should not displace civil service employees, must not impact affirmative action efforts, savings should be substantial and stable, justified by the agreement's size and duration, awarded through competitive bidding, and not solely based on lower contractor pay rates. The contract for contracting services is awarded through a competitive bidding process and includes provisions for staff qualifications and nondiscrimination. Future economic risk to the state is minimal, and the contract is with a firm. Personal services contracting is permissible under certain conditions. The California Constitution exempts contracted functions from civil service, allowing for independent contractors to perform new state functions mandated by the Legislature. Services contracted must be specialized, not available within civil service, or incidental to property purchase or lease agreements. Contracts can be used when regular civil service system cannot achieve legislative goals, to prevent conflicts of interest, or for emergency appointments. Private counsel may be needed when the Attorney General's office has a conflict of interest. The contractor provides equipment, materials, or support services not feasible for the state. They conduct training courses when civil service instructors are unavailable. Urgent or temporary services are not delayed by civil service procedures. All service providers must be retained under civil service unless exempted. This article applies to the California State University, with any reference to a contracting agency or state agency including the California State University."
