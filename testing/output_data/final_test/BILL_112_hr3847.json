    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safety Of Untested and New Devices Act of 2012\" or the \"SOUND Devices Act of 2012\". Predicate devices that have been recalled, corrected, or removed from the market. The submission of information by persons seeking substantial equivalence determination for a device under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include details on the market status of predicate devices and devices in the full device lineage. Information must specify if the device has been corrected or removed from the market. The submission of information for substantial equivalence determination now requires details on the market status of predicate devices and devices in the full device lineage. This includes whether the device has been corrected or removed from the market, the reason for such action, and why the device in question does not have any intrinsic flaws affecting safety. The Secretary may reject a claim of substantial equivalence if the predicate device has been removed from the market or found to be misbranded. The Secretary may reject a claim of substantial equivalence if there is an intrinsic flaw in technology or design that affects safety, even if the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device. The Secretary may reject a claim of substantial equivalence if a device in the full predicate lineage is being corrected or removed from the market without proper notice. The Secretary is required to maintain a database for determining eligibility of devices as predicate devices under certain conditions, including when a device is recalled or corrected by the manufacturer. The Secretary is mandated to include information in a database regarding the reason for device corrections or removals, as well as publish notices of such determinations. Additionally, a new section requires the inclusion of root cause analysis in reports of device removals and corrections. The new section mandates manufacturers to include root cause analysis in reports of device removals and corrections, to be submitted promptly to the Secretary within 90 days of the action. The new section mandates manufacturers to include root cause analysis in reports of device removals and corrections, to be submitted promptly to the Secretary within 90 days of the action. The Secretary may order reports for devices in the same lineage as those subject to corrections and removals due to safety concerns. The new section requires manufacturers to submit reports on device removals and corrections promptly to the Secretary, including root cause analysis. Reports may also be requested for devices in the same lineage as those with safety concerns. The Secretary will review all life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices to identify any that have been recalled due to safety concerns. This review will prioritize devices in the same lineage as those with issues. The Secretary will prioritize reviewing high-risk devices and identifying those with shared flaws that impact safety. A report on progress must be submitted to Congress within 3 years. Definitions for \"Class I\", \"Class II\", and \"recall\" are provided. The term \"covered device\" refers to a device cleared under section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that is life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable, and continues to be marketed. The term \"device in the full device lineage\" pertains to a device that demonstrates substantial equivalence. A covered device is one that is cleared under section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and is life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable. The term \"device in the full device lineage\" refers to a device that shows substantial equivalence. A substantial equivalence determination for a predicate device is made by the Secretary of Health and Human Services through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs."
