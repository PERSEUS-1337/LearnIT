    "content": "The \"Secure Annuity Income for Life Act of 2003\" allows for the exclusion of a percentage of lifetime annuity payments. The \"Secure Annuity Income for Life Act of 2003\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude 15 percent of lifetime annuity payments from gross income for qualified distributees from qualified trusts. The \"Secure Annuity Income for Life Act of 2003\" defines a lifetime annuity payment as a series of periodic payments made over the life of the qualified distributee or their designated beneficiary. Exceptions apply to ensure the payments are considered substantially equal. The periodic payments may vary based on investment experience, reallocations, actuarial gains or losses, and cost of living indices. The distribution is considered a lifetime annuity payment regardless of commutation benefits, minimum payment periods, or amounts. Lifetime annuity payments to a qualified trust are also included. The qualified trust makes lifetime annuity payments to qualified distributees, including employees, surviving spouses, and alternate payees who are spouses or former spouses. This provision does not apply to any lifetime annuity payment to a qualified distributee. The provision does not apply to any lifetime annuity payment that exceeds 50 percent of the applicable amount for the year under section 415(c)(1)(A) to a qualified distributee. All lifetime annuity payments received by a qualified distributee are considered if subject to this paragraph or similar rules. The provision states that if a portion of a lifetime annuity payment is not taxable due to certain conditions, and the series of payments is later modified, the qualified distributee's gross income will increase in the first taxable year of the modification. The specific amount of increase is determined by the Secretary's rules. The provision outlines that if a lifetime annuity payment is not taxable initially but is later modified, the qualified distributee's gross income will increase in the first year of the modification as per the Secretary's rules. Section 403(a) and 403(b) Plans are amended to exclude a percentage of lifetime annuity payments, similar to section 402(e)(7) rules. Additionally, IRAs under Section 408(d) of the Code will also follow these rules for distributions under annuity contracts. The Code is amended to exclude a percentage of lifetime annuity payments from distributions made after December 31, 2003, for Section 457 Plans and individual retirement plans. SEC. 3.
