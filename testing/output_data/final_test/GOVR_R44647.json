    "content": "Foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean is used by the United States to advance its interests, with aid programs tailored to the diverse needs of the region. Some countries receive assistance for political, socioeconomic, and security challenges, while others, which have made progress in governance and development, still receive support for security issues like combating organized crime. Despite evolving relations, foreign aid remains important for U.S. goals in the region. Foreign aid plays a crucial role in advancing U.S. policy in Latin America and the Caribbean. Congress oversees aid programs and examines budget priorities, including potential cuts to foreign assistance. This report analyzes historical trends, the Obama Administration's FY2017 aid request, and legislative developments on foreign aid appropriations for the region. The United States has been a major contributor of foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, providing nearly $165 billion between 1946 and 2014. Assistance spiked in the 1960s with President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress. Congressional policy issues include conditioning aid, Department of Defense's role in security assistance, and potential for trilateral cooperation in the region. After a period of decline, U.S. assistance to Latin America increased following the leftist Sandinistas' rise to power in Nicaragua in 1979. Throughout the 1980s, the U.S. supported Central American governments against leftist insurgencies to prevent Soviet influence. Aid decreased in the mid-1990s after the end of conflicts and the Soviet Union's dissolution. Assistance to the region rose again in the late 1990s, with a focus on humanitarian and development aid, especially after Hurricane Mitch in 1998. The United States provided extensive humanitarian and reconstruction aid to Central America after Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Aid increased with the establishment of new assistance programs like the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. Significant assistance was also given to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. Increased funding for counternarcotics and security programs contributed to the rise in U.S. assistance through 2010, including support for \"Plan Colombia\" to combat drug trafficking and promote development in the region. In FY2008, President George W. Bush announced the M\u00e9rida Initiative, providing U.S. counterdrug and anticrime assistance to Mexico and Central America. Aid was split into separate programs for Central America (CARSI) and the Caribbean (CBSI) in FY2010. U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean began to decline in FY2011 due to overall reductions in the foreign assistance budget. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis and U.S. recession, foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean decreased between FY2010 and FY2014. Despite a slight increase in FY2015 and FY2016, spending caps and cuts from the Budget Control Act of 2011 could continue to impact aid budgets. The region saw a decline in poverty rates from 44% in 2002 to 28% in 2014, and most countries now have democratically elected governments. In Latin America, some countries like Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay are now able to provide foreign aid to others. However, nations like Bolivia and Ecuador have expelled U.S. personnel and opposed U.S. assistance projects, leading to the closure of USAID offices. This has allowed the U.S. government to focus its resources in fewer countries and sectors, closing field offices and transitioning out of supporting family planning and elections administration in the region. U.S. foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean decreased from 9% in FY2005 to 6% in FY2015. The Obama Administration aimed to promote democratic governance, human rights, citizen security, social inclusion, economic prosperity, clean energy, and climate resilience in the region. In FY2017, $1.7 billion was requested for foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, a slight increase from FY2016. The Obama Administration's FY2017 foreign aid request for Latin America and the Caribbean includes over $627.7 million for development assistance programs aimed at promoting economic progress, social stability, democracy, education, health, and environmental protection. The request also includes funding for development food assistance. The Obama Administration's FY2017 foreign aid request for Latin America and the Caribbean includes $5 million in development food assistance through the Food for Peace account. The request shows a decline in DA and P.L. 480 funding, with an increase in GHP funding. The Administration plans to fund some programs with ESF aid in FY2017 that were previously funded with DA aid in FY2016. ESF programs aim to promote political and economic stability in the region. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean includes an increase in ESF assistance by $94.4 million, with additional support proposed for Colombia and other nations. The remaining $598.8 million would support security assistance programs, including $489 million under the INCLE account for counternarcotics and law enforcement efforts. The FY2017 budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean includes funding for strengthening judicial institutions, countering global threats, and providing equipment and training to militaries in the region. Total security assistance would decrease by $16.6 million compared to FY2016, with changes in aid for Mexico, CARSI, CBSI, and increased aid for Colombia. The Obama Administration's FY2017 foreign aid request for Latin America and the Caribbean includes $743.6 million allocated to Central America, focusing on El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The aid supports the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America to promote good governance, economic prosperity, and improved security. Bilateral aid for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras would increase compared to FY2016 estimates. The Obama Administration's FY2017 foreign aid request for Central America includes an increase in bilateral aid for Honduras from $98.3 million to $105.7 million. The additional aid would support activities to strengthen governments, improve education, increase agricultural production, enhance business environments, and strengthen natural resource planning. Assistance through regional programs would also increase, with a decline in aid through CARSI and an increase in aid through USAID's Central America Regional program. The Obama Administration's FY2017 foreign aid request for Central America includes an increase in bilateral aid for Honduras to $105.7 million. An additional $25 million would be provided through the State Department's Western Hemisphere Regional program in support of the Central America strategy. Colombia would remain the largest recipient of U.S. assistance in Latin America, with aid rising to $391.3 million. Funding levels for Colombia have declined in recent years as the security situation has improved. The FY2017 request includes assistance to strengthen Colombia's capacity to end its conflict with FARC and implement a peace agreement. Haiti would be the second-largest recipient of U.S. assistance in the region, with $218.1 million allocated for post-earthquake recovery efforts. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposal includes a 9% increase in funding for Mexico, making it the third-largest aid recipient in the region. The $134.7 million aid would support Mexico's efforts to combat transnational crime, reform rule-of-law institutions, protect human rights, strengthen border security, and carry out conservation and clean-energy initiatives. U.S. assistance through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) would decline under the Administration's FY2017 request, with funding decreasing by about 16% compared to FY2016 levels. The request includes $48.4 million for community-based policing programs, police and justice-sector reforms, equipment and training for security forces, and opportunities for at-risk youth. President Obama signed a continuing resolution into law that funds most foreign aid programs at FY2016 levels until April 28, 2017. The continuing resolution signed by President Obama funds most foreign aid programs at the FY2016 level with reductions until April 28, 2017. Additionally, $145.5 million in supplemental FY2016 appropriations were allocated for global health assistance to address the Zika virus outbreak in Latin America and the Caribbean. The 115th Congress may draw from appropriations measures reported by the Senate and House Appropriations Committees for the remainder of FY2017. The Senate Appropriations Committee's bill included $32.1 billion for bilateral economic and international security assistance globally. The House Appropriations Committee's bill, H.R. 5912, included $33.3 billion for bilateral economic assistance and international security globally, which was $1.1 billion above the Administration's request and $313.8 million above the FY2016-enacted level. Congressional priorities in the 114th Congress differed from the Obama Administration's priorities, particularly in Central America. The House Appropriations Committee's bill, H.R. 5912, allocated $750 million for the Central America strategy, with slight differences in fund distribution compared to the Administration's request. The bill provided $77.7 million for El Salvador, $133 million for Guatemala, $103.3 million for Honduras, and $260.3 million for CARSI. This amount was $100 million less than requested for the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America. The House Appropriations Committee's bill, H.R. 5912, allocated $77.7 million for El Salvador, $133 million for Guatemala, and $102.8 million for Honduras, which is less than requested. It also included $393 million for CARSI, exceeding the Administration's request. S. 3117 fully funded the $391.3 million request for aid to Colombia, while H.R. 5912 provided at least $300.1 million for Colombia. Additionally, S. 3117 allocated no more than $183.2 million for Haiti, which is less than requested. The House Appropriations Committee's bill, H.R. 5912, allocated funding for Haiti, Mexico, and the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative. H.R. 5912 provided $158.7 million for Mexico, including more than requested for INCLE and FMF aid. Both bills would have provided more funding than the Administration requested for the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative. S. 3117 would have provided $53.6 million for the CBSI. H.R. 5912 allocated $57.7 million for democracy programs in Cuba, double the Administration's request. The bill stipulated that funds should only be used for democracy-building activities. S. 3117 supported the Administration's request of $15 million for democracy programs in Cuba. The committee supported $5.5 million in ESF for democracy programs in Venezuela, slightly less than the FY2016 estimate. Additional support was expected through the Complex Crises Fund and Democracy Fund accounts. H.R. 5912 proposed $8 million for Venezuela, $2.5 million above the Administration request. Congress is considering various issues regarding assistance for Latin America and the Caribbean, including aid conditioning, Department of Defense's role in security assistance, and trilateral cooperation in the region. President Obama's 2010 Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development emphasized the importance of political leaders and institutions in aid effectiveness. Studies show that recipient countries' political institutions are crucial for sustainable development outcomes. Congress often places conditions on foreign aid to ensure recipient governments are committed to fostering necessary policy environments. For example, FY2017 appropriations bills required withholding assistance for certain Latin American and Caribbean nations until they took specific actions to address concerns such as border security, corruption, and human rights violations. Section 7045 of H.R. 5912 and S. 3117 proposed withholding requirements for foreign aid to countries like Colombia, Haiti, Mexico to address human rights issues and governance concerns. Haiti would have funds withheld until new elections were held and governance improved. Mexico would have 25% of aid withheld until corruption investigations were conducted. The proposed withholding requirements in H.R. 5912 and S. 3117 aimed to address human rights issues and governance concerns in countries like Colombia, Haiti, and Mexico. For Mexico, aid would be withheld until corruption investigations were conducted. However, some U.S. officials argue that aid restrictions can hinder the ability to advance policy objectives, as seen with delays in funding for addressing Central American migration. Some U.S. defense officials fear that imposing conditions on U.S. security assistance could lead recipient nations to seek aid from other countries that do not prioritize human rights or good governance. There is ongoing debate on whether aid conditionality effectively changes recipient behavior. Studies show mixed results, with some cases where conditions are ineffective due to donors' reluctance to enforce compliance, and others where recipient countries reject conditioned aid due to alternative sources of non-conditioned assistance. Since the 1980s, Congress has provided security assistance authorities to the Department of Defense under Title 10 of the U.S. Code and the National Defense Authorization Act, in addition to traditional aid authorized under Title 22 of the U.S. Code. This has resulted in Latin American and Caribbean nations receiving training, equipment, and support from the DOD alongside assistance from the State Department. In FY2016, DOD spent $230.1 million on counternarcotics efforts in Latin America and the Caribbean, with significant amounts allocated to Colombia, Mexico, and the northern triangle of Central America. DOD also increased joint training programs and military-to-military exchanges in the region, primarily benefiting partner countries but also training U.S. forces. The number of U.S. Special Operations Forces training missions reportedly tripled between 2007 and 2014. The expansion of DOD authorities and resources for security cooperation activities in Latin America and the Caribbean has increased significantly from 2007 to 2014. This growth may have unintended consequences, potentially hindering Congress's oversight of U.S. foreign assistance policy in the region. Unlike the State Department, DOD's reports on security cooperation activities are not always available to the public, making it challenging for effective oversight. The lack of information on DOD security cooperation activities in Latin America and the Caribbean may impede congressional oversight of U.S. foreign assistance. This could lead to a disproportionate emphasis on military support over intended policy changes in recipient nations. The growth of DOD security programs may weaken Congress's ability to shape budget priorities and incentivize policy changes. The \"Leahy laws\" require vetting of foreign security forces and prohibit funding for units with human rights violations. DOD security cooperation programs in Latin America are not subject to aid conditions, potentially weakening compliance with legislative requirements. In FY2016, Congress withheld 19% of FMF for Colombia until human rights concerns were addressed. The FY2017 NDAA modified DOD's security cooperation authorities and strengthened congressional oversight. It requires DOD to submit a consolidated budget request for security cooperation programs by country starting in FY2019. Quarterly reports on obligations and expenditures must be submitted to relevant congressional committees. The FY2017 NDAA modified DOD's security cooperation authorities and strengthened congressional oversight by requiring quadrennial reviews of U.S. security assistance and establishing a program for security cooperation assessment. Many Latin American and Caribbean countries have progressed in democratic governance and economic development, leading to the closure of USAID field offices and reductions in aid. As U.S. relations with these countries shift away from aid provision, policymakers are exploring ways to remain engaged for advancing U.S. policy objectives in the region. As Latin American and Caribbean countries transition from aid recipients to aid donors, the U.S. government engages in trilateral cooperation initiatives with them. For example, Brazil, once a recipient of U.S. assistance, now collaborates with USAID to improve agricultural productivity in other countries. Similarly, the U.S. has invested in training Colombian security forces, who have in turn trained military and police in Central America and the Dominican Republic. The U.S. has also partnered with Chile in various initiatives. The United States has engaged in trilateral cooperation initiatives with Latin American and Caribbean countries, including partnerships with Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay. The Obama Administration sought funding for renewable energy projects in Honduras with Brazil and for citizen security programs with Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico. However, minimal U.S. assistance has been provided through trilateral initiatives in the region. Analysts see potential benefits in trilateral cooperation efforts. Trilateral cooperation offers potential benefits such as increased impact of limited resources, cost-effectiveness, better understanding of aid recipients' challenges, and facilitation of U.S. engagement in countries. However, critics raise concerns about oversight when providing assistance through foreign governments. Critics raise oversight concerns about potential misuse of U.S. funds in trilateral cooperation with Colombia for training foreign security forces. They argue for more transparency and worry about loss of U.S. branding and implementation delays."
