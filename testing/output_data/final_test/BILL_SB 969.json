    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California enacts amendments to Article 14 of the Health and Safety Code regarding Asian rice noodles, Korean rice cakes, and Vietnamese rice cakes. Definitions for \"Asian rice-based noodle\" are provided, specifying ingredients and preparation methods. Korean rice cake is a confection made with rice powder, salt, sugar, edible seeds, oil, beans, nuts, fruits, and pumpkin. It must not contain animal fats or products. The traditional Korean method of preparation involves steaming at 275 degrees Fahrenheit for 5 to 15 minutes. Vietnamese rice cakes, known as B\u00e1nh T\u00e9t or B\u00e1nh Ch\u01b0ng, are made with rice, beans, and meat or fruit wrapped in banana leaves. B\u00e1nh T\u00e9t is cylindrical, B\u00e1nh Ch\u01b0ng is square. They are cooked by boiling for at least 10 hours and must be handled and stored under sanitary conditions. After cooking, they should be kept below 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Unwrapped rice cakes need to be refrigerated. Manufacturers of Asian rice-based noodles must label packaging with the date and time it came out of hot holding above 135 degrees Fahrenheit. The noodles are considered perishable and must be labeled only once. Exceptions apply to noodles with specific pH and water activity levels or deemed nonpotentially hazardous by the department. Manufacturers of Korean and Vietnamese rice cakes must label their products with the date of manufacture and time of cooking completion, respectively. The labels must state that the rice cakes should be consumed within one day. Exceptions apply to nonpotentially hazardous Vietnamese rice cakes. Section 114429.3 of the Health and Safety Code allows food facilities to sell Vietnamese rice cakes kept at 70 degrees Fahrenheit for up to 24 hours. Cakes stored for longer must be destroyed as per regulations and all cakes must have a label meeting specific requirements. The act does not require reimbursement for certain costs incurred by local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes. Reimbursement may be made for other mandated costs determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
