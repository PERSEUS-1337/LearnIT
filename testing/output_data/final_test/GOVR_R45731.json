The report highlights amendments to House rules impacting committee procedures, including the establishment of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis and the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress. Changes in the rules affect committee membership, organization, hearings, markups, oversight, and investigations for all House committees in the 116th Congress. Specific committees may see modifications in names, jurisdiction, or procedures. In the 116th Congress, H.Res. 6 made changes to House rules allowing Members to serve unlimited terms as committee chairs. It also clarified that Delegates and the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico can be appointed to joint committees, expanding their roles beyond select and conference committees. In 1979, House rules were amended to allow Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to be appointed to select committees. The 116th Congress rules provide them with equal status as Members on various committees. H.Res. 6 added a provision for Members, Delegates, or the Resident Commissioner indicted for a felony offense to resign from committee assignments and party caucus. In the 116th Congress, House rules state that individuals indicted for a felony offense must resign from committee assignments and party leadership positions unless acquitted or charges are dismissed. The Code of Official Conduct, Rule XXIII, outlines these requirements, with the Democratic Caucus and Republican Conference able to make recommendations. The House rules allow for the removal of a party member from a committee assignment if they do not voluntarily resign, with a privileged resolution to be voted on by the House. Committees now have 60 days to adopt and publish their rules, instead of 30 days, to allow for adequate time to organize at the start of a Congress. The rules package for the 116th Congress requires certain lawmaking measures to undergo committee hearings and markup before floor consideration. Bills and joint resolutions under a special rule from the Rules Committee must be reported by a committee to be considered. The rules package for the 116th Congress mandates committee hearings and markup for certain lawmaking measures before floor consideration. Bills and joint resolutions brought to the House floor under a special rule from the Rules Committee require committee reporting and may include waivers for points of order. The rules package for the 116th Congress mandates committee hearings and markups for legislation. A new requirement for \"Member Day Hearings\" allows members to speak on proposed legislation. H.Res. 6 amended Rule XI to modify the notification requirement for markup meetings. In the 116th Congress, committees must provide at least three workdays' notice before marking up legislation. Oversight plans outline a committee's intentions to review federal laws, regulations, and agencies within their jurisdiction. Standing committees were required to adopt oversight plans from the 104th through the 114th Congresses, and in the 115th Congress, committees had to submit authorization and oversight plans. In the 116th Congress, committees are required to submit oversight plans, with changes made to the procedures for submitting these plans compared to the 115th Congress. In the 116th Congress, standing committees must submit oversight plans. Full committees no longer mark up and adopt the plans in open meetings, with the chair preparing the plan in consultation with the ranking member. The completed plans are submitted to the Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Committee on House Administration by March 1, along with any additional views. The House Committee on Oversight and Reform reports the oversight plans to the House by April 15 after consulting with the majority and minority leaders. In the 116th Congress, oversight plans are to be developed by chairs of committees, not the full standing committee. The deadline for submitting plans to the Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Committee on House Administration is extended to March 1, with the full House to be reported to by April 15. The Appropriations Committee's role in reviewing plans has been removed, and technical changes have been made to the list of items required in activity reports. In the 116th Congress, oversight plans are developed by committee chairs, not the full standing committee. H.Res. 6 amended Rule XI to remove authorization from oversight plans. Committee activity reports now summarize the plans, aligning with the 116th Congress requirement. Chairs of most House committees can order depositions, subject to regulations and consultation with the ranking minority member. The Rules Committee summary of H.Res. 6 in the 116th Congress amended House rules to rename the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform as the Committee on Oversight and Reform. The new rules allow Members, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner to participate in depositions without requiring their presence. The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform was established in 1927, consolidating 11 separate committees. In 1953, it became the Committee on Government Operations. After a change in House majority in 1995, it was renamed the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight. It has since operated under various names, including Government Reform, Oversight and Government Reform, and now Oversight and Reform. Clause 3 of Rule X assigns special oversight functions to House committees, with H.Res. 6 amending it to emphasize the Committee on Oversight and Reform's role. Clause 3 of Rule X has been amended to emphasize the Committee on Oversight and Reform's responsibility to oversee presidential activities. The amendment clarifies the committee's special oversight authority over all government operations, including those of the Executive Office of the President. H.Res. 6 removed a provision from clause 4 of Rule X that required a committee member to be present during oversight activities. The Committee on Oversight and Reform's rules have been amended to allow committee counsel to take depositions without a committee member present. This change is similar to a separate order affecting multiple committees but only applies to the Committee on Oversight and Reform. Additionally, the Committee on Education and the Workforce has been renamed to the Committee on Education and the Labor in the 116th Congress. The Committee on Education and the Workforce has been renamed to the Committee on Education and Labor in the 116th Congress. The committee's jurisdiction includes the organization, administration, and general management of the Department of Education and the Department of Labor. The Rules Committee clarified the Committee on Education and Labor's jurisdiction over federal education and labor programs. A separate order was included in the 116th rules package directing the Committee on Ethics to form an investigative subcommittee in cases where a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner is indicted on a criminal charge. This order applies the text of H.Res. 451 from the 110th Congress. The Committee on Ethics must form an investigative subcommittee if a Member is indicted on criminal charges, as per H.Res. 6. The subcommittee can consider criminal trial evidence related to the investigation. The Committee on Ethics forms an investigative subcommittee in response to a criminal trial involving a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner. The subcommittee can consider trial evidence following a conviction, and the full Ethics Committee may also receive trial evidence for investigation. H.Res. 6 removed term limits for members of the Committee on the Budget. In the 115th Congress, term limits for committee membership were limited to \"four Congresses in a period of six successive Congresses,\" with exceptions for chairs or ranking members. However, in the 116th Congress, House rules now allow Members, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner to serve on committees without term limits. The Democratic Caucus rules in the 116th Congress restrict members from serving on the Budget Committee for more than three out of five successive Congresses. Additionally, the 116th rules package permits the Committee on Rules to file reports without recording committee votes. In the 116th Congress, H.Res. 6 exempted the Committee on Rules from the requirement to include recorded vote information in reports, to avoid delays in floor consideration of special rules. In the 116th Congress, H.Res. 6 exempted the Committee on Rules from including recorded vote information in reports to prevent delays in floor consideration of special rules. The separate order for the Committee on Financial Services allows for up to seven subcommittees, with exceptions for certain committees like Agriculture and Appropriations. In the 116th Congress, the Committee on Financial Services established six subcommittees, including a new Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion. They combined the jurisdiction of two subcommittees from the previous Congress to form a National Security, International Development, and Monetary Policy Subcommittee. This was necessary as the committee is allowed up to seven subcommittees but opted for six. The Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, established by H.Res. 6, has the authority to investigate and make recommendations on policies to reduce pollution. It consists of 15 members appointed by the Speaker and can recommend subpoenas and depositions to relevant standing committees. The committee does not have legislative authority but can hold public hearings and function under the rules governing standing committees. The Speaker appoints members to the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, with specific criteria for membership. The committee must submit policy recommendations by March 31, 2020, and a detailed report by December 31, 2020, to be made publicly available. Title II of H.Res. 6 establishes a Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress to recommend improvements to the work and operation of Congress. The committee's \"sole authority\" is to investigate, study, make findings, hold public hearings, and develop recommendations on modernizing Congress, including new rules, scheduling procedures, leadership development, staff diversity, efficiency, technology, and procedures for the Franking Commission. Membership includes two Members, Delegates, or the Resident Commissioner appointed by the Speaker, with specific criteria for new members. The Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress is bipartisan and consists of members with specific criteria. It does not have legislative jurisdiction but can make recommendations to standing committees. The committee must provide an interim status report every 90 days as required by H.Res. 6. The Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress must provide an interim status report every 90 days, including transcripts of proceedings, expenditures, and a plan for the next 90 days. It can also submit additional reports with investigation results and policy recommendations. The final report must be approved by a 2/3 majority and include detailed findings and recommendations. Policy recommendations are to be submitted to relevant standing committees, and all reports must be made public within 30 days. The committee will terminate on February 1, 2020. The Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress will terminate on February 1, 2020, and its records will be transferred to relevant standing committees as determined by the Speaker."
