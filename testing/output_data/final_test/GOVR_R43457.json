    "content": "The federal government has the power to determine which aliens can enter or be removed from the United States, but the impact of alien migration is mostly felt in the communities where they settle. State and local responses to unlawfully present aliens vary, with some actively deterring them and assisting federal immigration authorities in identifying and apprehending them. In recent years, some states and localities have tried to increase their involvement in immigration enforcement. Some states and localities have increased their role in immigration enforcement due to perceived federal inadequacies. Measures criminalizing actions aiding unlawfully present aliens have decreased post the 2012 Supreme Court ruling on Arizona's S.B. 1070. Others refuse to assist in enforcing federal measures distinguishing legal residents from unauthorized individuals. State and local jurisdictions have adopted measures to limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts, particularly in response to recent initiatives like Secure Communities. This report discusses legal issues related to these measures. The report discusses legal issues surrounding state and local measures limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities, including restrictions on police investigations into immigration status, refusal to honor federal requests to hold certain aliens, shielding unlawfully present aliens, and amending state criminal laws to reduce immigration consequences of criminal convictions. The federal government has broad power over immigration and has established complex rules under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. These rules govern admission, removal, and conditions for aliens in the United States. Courts recognize removal of aliens for violating immigration laws as a civil action, not a criminal sanction, aimed at ending violations rather than punishing wrongdoing. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that not all state laws related to aliens are automatically preempted by federal immigration authority. States have reserved powers, including traditional police powers, to regulate safety, health, welfare, and economic activity within their jurisdictions, which may involve addressing aliens in their communities. States and localities may be limited in their exercise of police powers by federal authority under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. Federal law can preempt state or local actions in three ways: express preemption, field preemption, or conflict preemption, based on Congressional intent. Federal law can preempt state or local actions through express preemption, field preemption, or conflict preemption, based on Congressional intent. The federal government has preempted state and local activities that conflict with immigration enforcement policies, such as barring the exchange of immigration-related information. The federal government has extensive power to preempt state or local measures that restrict the exchange of immigration information. However, there are constitutional limits to its authority, including the anti-commandeering doctrine which prohibits the federal government from forcing state or local governments to assist in immigration enforcement. This doctrine was established in cases like New York v. United States and Printz v. United States, emphasizing the sovereignty of states in the federalist system. The Supreme Court ruled in New York that the Tenth Amendment prevents the federal government from compelling state legislatures to enforce federal regulatory programs. In Printz, the Court also found that the Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from commandeering state and local police for background checks on handgun purchases. This anti-commandeering principle restricts the federal government from forcing state officers to administer federal programs. The Supreme Court's ruling in Printz and New York established anti-commandeering principles, prohibiting the federal government from compelling state participation in federal programs. Federal statutes require state entities to report certain information to federal agencies, with the Court distinguishing reporting requirements from direct state involvement in federal program administration. Direct federal requirements on state or municipal authorities are more likely to withstand anti-commandeering challenges if they do not interfere with state regulation of private parties and apply to both private and government activities. In Reno v. Condon, the Court rejected a Tenth Amendment challenge to the Driver's Privacy Protection Act, which limited states' actions regarding driver privacy. The Supreme Court distinguished the Driver's Privacy Protection Act (DPPA) from federal enactments in New York and Printz, as it regulated states as owners of databases without requiring them to regulate their citizens. The DPPA also covered private entities in information-sharing requirements, but the Court did not definitively rule on federal regulation of state conduct through general laws. The federal government can influence states to adopt favored policies by imposing preconditions on state regulation or conditioning the receipt of federal funds on state compliance with federal policy preferences. Conditioning federal funding is permissible as long as it relates to the purpose of the spending and is not coercive. Several states and municipalities have implemented measures to limit their involvement in federal immigration enforcement, including restricting police cooperation, shielding certain aliens from detection, and ensuring state convictions do not have immigration consequences. These restrictions on law enforcement activities are discussed in relation to current federal law. Several states and municipalities have adopted policies restricting police cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts, known as \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions. There is disagreement on the meaning of this term, with some jurisdictions self-identifying as \"sanctuary\" sites. The accuracy of this designation may vary, especially if law enforcement cooperates with federal authorities in some areas but not others. Any reference to a jurisdiction as a \"sanctuary\" is meant as an illustrative example, not a definitive classification by CRS. Many states and municipalities have implemented policies to limit police involvement in federal immigration enforcement, often referred to as \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions. These initiatives have roots in actions by U.S. churches providing refuge to Central American immigrants in the 1980s, leading to declarations of support and measures such as restricting police from making immigration-related arrests and sharing information with federal authorities. Some violations of federal immigration law may result in criminal or civil consequences, with alien removal being a civil proceeding. For instance, entering the US without authorization can lead to removal and criminal charges. Unauthorized immigration status can lead to removal, but unlawful presence alone is not a criminal offense. Some jurisdictions restrict police from making immigration-related arrests. Some jurisdictions have adopted measures restricting police from making arrests for federal immigration law violations, including civil violations like unlawful presence. State or local restrictions on police authority in this regard do not raise significant legal issues. The INA allows state and local law enforcement to engage in immigration enforcement activities within certain parameters, but there is no direct compulsion for their participation. Some states and localities have restrictions on sharing information with federal immigration authorities to prevent apprehension of unlawfully present aliens. Congress attempted to end these restrictions in 1996 through specific provisions in two acts. The PRWORA and IIRIRA acts do not require state or local government entities to share immigration-related information with federal authorities. Instead, they allow voluntary communication between state or local government entities and federal immigration authorities regarding a person's immigration status. PRWORA \u00a7434 prohibits restrictions on sending or receiving information on an individual's immigration status, while IIRIRA \u00a7642 is broader and prohibits any restrictions on sending or receiving information on immigration or citizenship status. The City of New York challenged the constitutionality of PRWORA \u00a7434 and IIRIRA \u00a7642, alleging that they violate the Tenth Amendment by restricting states and localities from controlling cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The City of New York challenged the constitutionality of PRWORA \u00a7434 and IIRIRA \u00a7642, alleging that they violate the Tenth Amendment by restricting states and localities from controlling cooperation with federal immigration authorities. A federal district court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed that the information-sharing provisions in PRWORA and IIRIRA did not directly compel state authorities to administer and enforce federal immigration laws, but rather protected the voluntary exchange of immigration information between federal and state authorities. The Second Circuit emphasized the importance of voluntary interaction between states and federal authorities in the American system of dual sovereignty. The Second Circuit rejected the City of New York's constitutional challenge to the information-sharing provisions of PRWORA and IIRIRA, stating that states and local entities do not have the unrestricted right to prohibit cooperation with specific federal programs. The court found that the city's policy only limited sharing immigration status information with the agency enforcing federal immigration law, and did not impermissibly intrude upon state and local authority. The Second Circuit rejected the City of New York's challenge to the information-sharing provisions of PRWORA and IIRIRA, stating that states and local entities cannot prohibit cooperation with federal programs. The court found that the city's policy only limited sharing immigration status information with the agency enforcing federal immigration law, without intruding upon state and local authority. The Supreme Court denied the City of New York's appeal, but a later decision in Reno v. Condon supported federal statutes regulating information dissemination by state authorities. No court has assessed the implications of the Condon decision on PRWORA \u00a7434 and IIRIRA \u00a7642. Since the Second Circuit's ruling, there have been no judicial challenges to the validity of the information-sharing provisions in PRWORA and IIRIRA. Some state and local measures restrict sharing immigration-related information with federal authorities, but enforcing these restrictions may face preemption challenges. Sanctuary policies limit police inquiries into immigration status, with some focusing on criminal investigations, crime victims, and witnesses. PRWORA and IIRIRA prevent state or local restrictions on sharing immigration information. PRWORA \u00a7434 and IIRIRA \u00a7642 prohibit state or local restrictions on sharing immigration status information with federal authorities, but do not mandate police to collect such information. Limiting police authority to inquire about immigration status prevents sharing information with federal agencies. Although some argue that state restrictions on police questioning regarding immigration status may be preempted by federal law, a California court rejected this argument in a case involving the Los Angeles Police Department. Federal courts have not addressed this issue. The Supreme Court in Arizona v. United States found that a provision requiring police to verify immigration status was not preempted by federal law. It is unlikely that federal courts would find state or local measures limiting police questioning on immigration status as preempted by the INA. ICE issues immigration detainers to notify law enforcement agencies about individuals they are holding who are of interest for removal proceedings. The Secure Communities program raised questions about detainers from 2008 to 2014, focusing on identifying removable aliens based on criminal activity. DHS prioritized removing criminal aliens and repeat immigration violators through this program. Several jurisdictions have adopted policies of declining immigration detainer requests for some aliens, particularly those who have committed non-violent misdemeanor offenses. This decision was made in response to reports of detainers being issued for individuals who had not been convicted of any offense or whose only offense was a misdemeanor. ICE's focus on removing criminal aliens and repeat immigration violators through the Secure Communities program led to the prioritization of individuals convicted of aggravated felonies, other felonies, or three or more misdemeanors. Some jurisdictions have policies of declining immigration detainer requests for certain individuals, such as those with non-violent misdemeanor offenses. These policies may require a written agreement with the federal government for reimbursement of costs incurred in complying with ICE detainers. While criticized for hindering federal immigration enforcement, it is permissible under federal law for states and localities to refuse to honor some immigration detainers. The INA does not mandate compliance with immigration detainers, although detainer regulations suggest that holds may be required. The regulation requires that any period of time a state or locality holds an alien pursuant to a detainer generally be limited to 48 hours. Federal courts have characterized detainers as requests, not requirements, to avoid violating the Tenth Amendment's anti-commandeering principles. In the 2014 Galarza v. Szalczyk case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit highlighted the Tenth Amendment's anti-commandeering principles, stating that requiring states to detain aliens for ICE would disrupt federalism. The recent discontinuation of the Secure Communities program and the introduction of the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) by DHS may address some concerns regarding immigration detainers. The Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) replaces Secure Communities and focuses on issuing detainers for convicted aliens, not just those arrested. Detainers are used for notification, not detention beyond release for state offenses. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) regulates immigration by establishing conditions for entry and presence in the US, imposing sanctions to deter unlawful activities. INA \u00a7274 imposes criminal penalties for transporting or harboring unlawfully present aliens. Some state or local activities may violate these provisions by providing sanctuary, which traditionally involves offering refuge to those in need. The sanctuary movement in the 1980s involved individuals providing refuge to unlawfully present aliens, leading to convictions under INA \u00a7274. State or local measures restricting involvement with federal immigration enforcement typically do not implicate anti-harboring provisions. However, if officials actively prevent the removal of specific aliens they know are unlawfully present, serious concerns may arise. San Francisco's policies in 2008 regarding unlawfully present aliens in the juvenile justice system were investigated for potential violations of anti-harboring provisions in the INA, but no definitive determination was made as the city abandoned its policy and no federal charges were pursued. An alien's state criminal conviction can impact their immigration status under federal law, potentially leading to removal, disqualification from relief or benefits, and a ban on re-entry. States play a significant role in determining the removable alien population through criminal prosecutions. Some states have tried to lessen immigration consequences for certain convictions. The alien's removability under the INA depends on the nature of the criminal offense. The nature of a criminal offense and the sentence imposed determine an alien's removability under the INA. Some states have reduced maximum sentences to avoid removal. State courts may consider immigration consequences during criminal proceedings and may resolve cases to prevent immigration consequences. The court may sentence an alien to a lesser term to avoid removability under the INA. Federal legislative proposals to counter state court actions have not been enacted."
