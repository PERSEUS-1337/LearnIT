    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Retooling America's Workers for a Green Economy Act\". In October 2008, mass layoffs and initial unemployment claims reached their highest levels since 2001. The lack of skilled workers in green technology is a barrier to adopting clean energy. In December 2008, the unemployment rate rose to 7.2 percent, with 524,000 jobs lost. Job losses were widespread across major industry sectors. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 11,100,000 jobs were lost. In December 2008, 11.1 million people were unemployed, with 8 million wanting full-time work but only able to find part-time jobs. Analysts predict unemployment to reach 8.6 percent by the end of 2009. The potential for green-collar jobs to drive economic growth is recognized as a response to climate change and environmental protection efforts. To prepare US workers for jobs in the current and future economies, an investment in skills development is needed to build greener communities in urban and rural settings. The purpose of this Act is to retrain America's workers for green-collar, existing, and new industries to enhance the country's competitiveness and quality of life. The Act defines key terms such as \"adult\", \"dislocated worker\", and \"community college\". It also defines \"green-collar industries\" as those promoting energy efficiency and environmental protection. The Act defines \"green-collar industries\" as those promoting renewable energy, clean technology, and environmental protection, offering well-paying jobs with benefits and having a continued demand for workers. SEC. 5. ACTIVITIES FOR DISLOCATED WORKERS. The Secretary is authorized to reserve $2 billion for rapid response activities, dislocated worker employment and training, and additional assistance under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. Of the reserved funds, up to $500 million may be used for national emergency grants to provide employment and training assistance to workers affected by economic dislocations. The Secretary may reserve $2 billion for rapid response activities, dislocated worker employment, and training under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. After determining an amount for subsection (b), remaining funds can be used for State allotments following the formula in section 132(b)(2). States can use 25% of their allotment for rapid response activities for closures or layoffs and efforts to prevent future closures. States or entities designated by States may use dislocated workers to enhance rapid response activities by providing outreach, coaching, counseling, and information to other dislocated workers or unemployed persons. Each State or outlying area must allocate 75 percent of their allotment directly to local boards for local activities. Each State must prioritize dislocated worker employment and training activities in viable industries, including green-collar industries. States must report on the entry of individuals from these activities into unsubsidized employment in their annual reports to the Secretary. The Secretary must report annually to Congress on the entry of individuals from dislocated worker employment and training activities in viable industries, including green-collar industries, into unsubsidized employment. SEC. 6. ACTIVITIES FOR ADULTS WITH MULTIPLE BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT. The purpose of this section is to help adults with multiple barriers to employment acquire skills for jobs in viable industries, particularly in green-collar industries. The term \"adult with multiple barriers to employment\" includes long-term unemployed, low-skilled, limited English proficient, individuals with disabilities, and older workers. The Secretary is authorized to reserve $800,000,000 for this purpose. The Secretary will reserve $800,000,000 to provide employment and training activities to adults with multiple barriers to employment. States can use 10% of their allotment to assist local boards in helping these adults find jobs in viable industries. Assistance may include system alignment and capacity building. Each State or outlying area must use 90% of their allotment to make grants to local boards for employment and training activities for adults with barriers to employment. Priority is given to local boards that align their areas to reflect natural labor markets or economic development districts. The curr_chunk focuses on the requirements for local boards receiving grants for employment and training activities. It emphasizes the need for regional partnerships, outreach to adults with barriers to employment, and alignment of various systems to provide career opportunities. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need for local boards to use grant funds for career pathway strategies to help low-skilled individuals achieve postsecondary education or industry-recognized certificates leading to economic self-sufficiency. It also requires a strategic partnership for effective implementation. A strategic partnership for effective implementation of grant funds involves representatives from local boards and various organizations actively engaged in providing employment and training activities to adults with multiple barriers to employment. These organizations include businesses, unions, schools, public agencies, nonprofit community organizations, and philanthropic organizations. Each State must report on adults with multiple barriers to employment obtaining postsecondary credentials or industry certificates, entering unsubsidized jobs in viable industries, and their average wages. The Secretary will refine indicators in reports to avoid unintended consequences for adults with barriers to employment or those seeking part-time work along a career path. The Secretary will reserve $625,000,000 for energy efficiency and renewable energy worker training programs. Additionally, $3,425,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated for activities described in the Act from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2010."
