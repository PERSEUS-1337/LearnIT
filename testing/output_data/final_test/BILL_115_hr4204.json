The International Regulated Investment Company Act of 2017 defines an international regulated investment company as a domestic corporation meeting specific requirements, including being registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and holding only the stock of a single regulated investment company. All its stock must be held by nonresident alien individuals and qualified foreign pension funds. The International Regulated Investment Company Act of 2017 defines an international regulated investment company as a domestic corporation meeting specific requirements, including being registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and holding only the stock of a single regulated investment company. An election to be treated as an IRIC applies to the taxable year for which made and all subsequent taxable years until terminated. An IRIC may hold cash, cash equivalents, and other assets incidental to its normal affairs. The International Regulated Investment Company Act of 2017 defines an international regulated investment company as a domestic corporation meeting specific requirements. If a corporation fails to meet the requirements, it will not be treated as an IRIC for that taxable year, unless the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. The International Regulated Investment Company Act of 2017 outlines the requirements for a corporation to be considered an IRIC. If a corporation fails to meet these requirements, it will not be treated as an IRIC for that taxable year, unless the failure was caused by individuals holding less than 1 percent of the corporation's stock and the additional tax is paid. The tax imposed on the IRIC under section 998A(a) shall be the sum of the tax on amounts received for the taxable year, excluding amounts attributable to stock held by certain individuals, plus 100 percent of the amounts received which are so attributable. The Secretary will establish rules for allocating deductions to these amounts. Taxation of IRICs under section 998A includes the tax on amounts received for the taxable year, excluding amounts attributable to certain individuals, plus 100 percent of the amounts received which are so attributable. The Secretary will establish rules for allocating deductions to these amounts. Taxation of IRICs under section 998A imposes a tax of 30 percent on amounts received, with deductions properly allocated. Treaties may reduce this tax to 15 percent for treaty IRICs. Treaty IRICs, with all stock held by residents of a treaty country, can elect to be taxed at a rate not exceeding 15 percent under section 871(a). Rules similar to section 998(b) apply to this election. \"SEC. 998B. OTHER RULES.\" An IRIC is not considered a regulated investment company for tax purposes. Carryovers from non-IRIC years are not allowed, and certain taxes and credits do not apply to an IRIC. In redemptions, an IRIC is treated as a publicly offered regulated investment company. A corporation can rely on shareholder certification unless it knows it is false. If false, the corporation must redeem the stock within 30 days to meet requirements. The corporation must meet certification requirements under section 998(a)(3) or 998A(b)(2)(A). A certification by certain institutions will be deemed as a certification by the person. Amendments are made to the table of parts for subchapter N of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments in Part V apply to taxable years starting after the enactment of this Act."
