    "content": "The economies of the United States and Canada are highly integrated due to trade agreements like the FTA and NAFTA. Despite geographic proximity and cultural similarities, the U.S. economy is much larger than Canada's. The economic disparity between the United States and Canada presents opportunities and challenges for Canada. NAFTA provides a large market for Canadian exports but also increases import competition for small businesses. The Canadian economy is heavily impacted by U.S. economic slowdowns and exchange rate changes. Despite slightly higher GDP growth rates in Canada, the per capita income gap remains constant at around 84% of the U.S. income, raising concerns about Canadian productivity. The Canadian economy's sectoral composition is similar to the United States, with a larger services sector in the U.S. and a more significant manufacturing sector in Canada. Canada's fiscal discipline improved in the 1990s, with balanced budgets and reduced public debt-to-GDP ratio. The Canadian economy improved its public debt-to-GDP ratio from 100% in 1996 to 61.3% in 2008, but it increased to 84.0% in 2009 due to deficit spending. In comparison, the United States had a lower debt-to-GDP ratio but it increased to 62.9% in 2010. Differences in economic performance between the two countries can be attributed to varying government intervention in economic policies. Canada protected small-scale manufacturing enterprises with high tariffs before the FTA with the U.S., leading to higher prices for consumers and inefficiencies in the economy. Canada's higher taxes fund a generous social safety net, including a government-run national health service. Provinces have significant power over natural resources, impacting economic dynamics and negotiations. Alberta's energy reserves may cause tension with other provinces. Canada's vast energy reserves may lead to friction with other provinces without similar resources. The federal government provides equalization payments to poorer provinces, causing disputes. Canada is the largest trading partner of the United States, with trade increasing in 2010 to $481.5 billion. In 2010, Canada purchased 18.3% of U.S. exports and supplied 14.5% of total U.S. imports. The United States is the dominant trade partner for Canada, supplying 50.4% of Canada's imports and purchasing 74.9% of Canada's merchandise exports. Trade between the two nations has decreased in recent years, with Canada's share of U.S. total trade dropping from 20% to 15% and the U.S.'s share of Canada's global trade decreasing from 74% to 63%. Trade is a significant aspect of the Canadian economy, with trade value as a percentage of GDP at 49.3% in 2010. Canada's goods exports totaled $386.0 billion in 2010. In 2010, Canada's goods exports totaled $386.0 billion, representing 29.1% of Canadian GDP. Canada imported $390 billion, 31.3% of its GDP. The merchandise trade balance fell into deficit in 2009 and persisted in 2010. Canada is highly exposed to the world economy, especially to the United States. Autos and auto parts are top U.S. exports to Canada. Other major U.S. exports include agriculture machinery, computer equipment, aerospace products, and pharmaceuticals. U.S. imports from Canada include energy, pulp, and aerospace products. The economic integration between the United States and Canada has been facilitated by trade liberalization over the past 40 years, starting with the Automotive Agreement of 1965. This integration has led to the elimination of tariffs and reduction of nontariff barriers, allowing for specialization in the production of goods for a larger continent-wide market. Key industries involved in this trade relationship include autos, auto parts, agriculture machinery, computer equipment, energy, pulp, aerospace products, and pharmaceuticals. The integration of the U.S. and Canadian automotive industries through trade liberalization led to increased bilateral trade and specialization, improving productivity and competitiveness. About 45% of U.S.-Canadian trade was intra-firm trade, reflecting the substantial integration of the two economies. This integration allowed for economies of scale and coordinated production, benefiting firms on both sides of the border. The Automotive Agreement of 1965 (Auto Pact) between the United States and Canada led to increased bilateral trade and specialization in the automotive industry. Coordinated production on both sides of the border improved productivity and competitiveness, benefiting firms in both countries. Motor vehicles, vehicle parts, and engines accounted for a significant portion of U.S.-Canadian trade in 2009. The primary trade flow between the United States and Canada involves U.S. parts being exported to Canada for assembly, and vehicles being exported back to the U.S. In 2009, U.S. vehicle imports from Canada decreased by 27.6% to 1.2 million vehicles, while U.S. vehicle exports to Canada dropped by 40.7% to 427,000 in 2008. The trade also includes \"new domestic\" manufactures, with foreign-owned companies having manufacturing plants in both countries. The value of Canadian \"Big 3\" exports to the U.S. has declined, while the value of primarily Japanese new domestics has increased. Canada's automotive plants are competitive in North America, with advantages including a national health system reducing costs per vehicle. The global economic recession has impacted Canada's auto industry, with 20% of Big Three plant capacity located in Canada. The government has provided loans to match those given by the U.S. government. Canada matched U.S. government loans to GM and Chrysler, providing $4 billion in bridge loans. After Chrysler's bankruptcy, a $10.5 billion assistance package was promised, with the U.S. contributing $8.08 billion and Canada $2.42 billion. Following GM's bankruptcy, the U.S. government owned 60.8% of the new company, Canada and Ontario held an 11.7% stake, and the rest was owned by other entities. Ford also has a significant presence in Canada. Canada is a major energy supplier to the United States, providing oil, uranium, natural gas, and electricity. The value of U.S. petroleum and natural gas imports from Canada reached $82.2 billion in 2010. Canada is the world's fifth-largest petroleum producer and a reliable source of energy. The two countries are cooperating on pipeline construction. China has shown interest in Canada's oil sector, recently buying stakes in Alberta's oil sands projects. Canada is a net exporter of electricity to the United States, with a closely interconnected North American electricity grid. Oil and gas became the United States' largest import from Canada in 2005. Canada has traditional crude oil sources in Alberta, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia. Oil extracted from Alberta's oil sands is becoming a significant part of Canadian energy supplies, despite being energy-intensive, water-dependent, and environmentally unfriendly. Canada's oil sands hold reserves second only to Saudi Arabia. The FTA and NAFTA ensure U.S. energy supply from Canada by prohibiting export price and tax restrictions. China's economic rise and U.S. response are major concerns. Canada's political discourse is quieter, but China is its second-largest trading partner. Imports from China include labor-intensive goods, while exports to China consist mainly of natural resources. China's $12.5 billion trade primarily includes natural resources like forest products, metals, petroleum, and agriculture, along with aviation and telecommunications equipment. Concerns arise over the loss of manufacturing jobs to low-wage countries like China, with fears of Canadian producers being squeezed out of the U.S. market. China's pursuit of natural resources has led to controversial bids for assets abroad, including Unocal in the U.S. and stakes in Alberta's oil sands projects. In 2004, a Chinese attempt to purchase Noranda (now Falconbridge) was called off due to rising share prices, sparking concerns about Chinese acquisition of Canadian resources. Canada ran its first trade deficit since 1995 in 2009, with the U.S. trade deficit with Canada narrowing sharply before increasing in 2010. The bilateral trade deficit increased from 3.5% in 1991 to 15.3% in 2005, then decreased to 14.4% in 2010. The persistent trade deficit with Canada has been blamed on various factors, including the fluctuation of the Canadian dollar. The loonie depreciated in value up until 2003, reaching a low of $0.63 in 2002 before appreciating and hitting a high of $1.10 in 2007. Despite crossing the parity line with the U.S. dollar multiple times, the currency gradually declined to $0.77 in 2009 due to the end of the commodity boom and recession. Since then, the loonie has strengthened again due to improved commodity prospects and an earlier exit from recession. The loonie strengthened due to improved commodity prospects and an earlier exit from recession, leading it to exceed the value of the U.S. dollar for most of 2011. The United States conducts a significant services trade with Canada, with a surplus of $20.0 billion in 2009. U.S. service exports to Canada accounted for 8.7% of total U.S. private service exports, while Canadian service exports to the U.S. represented 52.3% of total Canadian service exports. Canada's service sector trade deficit has doubled since 2004, reaching C$22.6 billion in 2009. The U.S. is the largest investor in Canada, with a stock of $296.7 billion in 2010, representing 7.6% of U.S. direct investment abroad. U.S. travelers accounted for 45.5% of Canada's travel receipts in 2009. In 2010, foreign direct investment (FDI) in Canada decreased to 58.8% from 64.1% in 2004. The three largest categories of U.S. FDI in Canada are manufacturing, finance/insurance, and mining/energy. Canada had a significant FDI position in the United States at $206.1 billion, representing 8.8% of the total FDI stock in the U.S. in 2010. FDI represented 35.6% of Canada's GDP in 2010, with Canadian direct investment abroad (DIA) at 39.1% of GDP. Foreign investment has been crucial for the development of the Canadian economy. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Canada is monitored and reviewed under the Investment Canada Act to ensure a \"net benefit\" to the country. The review threshold for parties to the World Trade Organization is C$312 million, and transactions involving certain sectors like uranium production, financial services, transportation services, and cultural businesses must be reviewed. Net benefit is assessed based on factors such as the impact on economic activity, employment, Canadian participation, productivity, technological development, and competition. The Investment Canada Act is used to monitor foreign direct investment in Canada, ensuring a \"net benefit\" to the country. Industry Minister Tony Clement blocked the takeover of Potash Corporation by BHP Billiton in 2010, marking the second time a non-resident takeover was blocked. Acquisitions by foreign state-owned enterprises are subject to additional scrutiny to assess if they meet the \"net benefit\" test, including adherence to Canadian corporate governance standards. In 2009, an amendment to the Investment Canada Act allowed for reviews of transactions potentially \"injurious to national security.\" The Industry Minister can order reviews for national security concerns, and if not resolved, the Federal Cabinet can block or order divestment of transactions. Both the US and Canada have open trading regimes but have issues with each other's conduct in bilateral relations. The US and Canada have issues with their bilateral trade relationship, with disputes being resolved through WTO, NAFTA, and regulatory actions. In 2006, an agreement was reached to resolve the softwood lumber dispute, but it is now subject to arbitration between the two countries. The agreement was signed in Ottawa by USTR Susan Schwab and Canadian Trade Minister David Emerson, implemented on October 12, 2006. The Canadian government enlisted support for the agreement among provinces and the lumber industry. The Softwood Lumber Agreement between the US and Canada expired in 2001, leading to disputes over lumber exports. US producers claim Canadian provinces subsidize their industry, while Canadian government denies allegations of unfair practices. The Canadian Parliament approved legislation implementing a new agreement on December 14, 2006. The Canadian government rejected allegations of dumping and demanded free trade in lumber, citing modernized and efficient Canadian mills. The Softwood Lumber Agreement ended antidumping and countervailing duty litigation, returning $4 billion to the Canadian lumber industry. A supply management system was implemented for lumber exports, with export taxes and quotas based on lumber prices. If prices exceed $355/thousand board feet, no tariffs or quotas would be imposed. The Canadian government implemented a supply management system for lumber exports, with options for provinces to pay a sliding-scale export tax or agree to market share limitations based on prices. Producers would pay a tax of 5% if prices fall below $350, 10% if below $335, and 15% if below $315. Alternatively, provinces could have their exports capped at their share of the U.S. market with corresponding taxes if prices fall below certain thresholds. The agreement lasts for seven years with a two-year renewal option. The agreement between the Canadian and U.S. governments on lumber exports includes a two-year renewal option. Provinces with private timber ownership and those not involved in litigation are exempt. There is a surge mechanism in place if exports exceed allocated shares, and a refund provision if U.S. market share increases. Supporters see the agreement as the best outcome compared to ongoing litigation risks. The agreement between the Canadian and U.S. governments on lumber exports includes various restrictive mechanisms. U.S. producers can avoid free trade with Canada, while Canadian producers would get most of their antidumping and countervailing duties back. Proponents in Canada argue that an export tax would keep proceeds in Canada instead of paying duties to the U.S. market. Unless lumber prices drop below $355, there will be no restrictions on the U.S. market. Lumber prices have fallen since the agreement was proposed, with opponents claiming it will hurt consumers through higher prices for new homes and renovation materials. Canadian opposition parties criticize the deal as a \"sell-out\" to U.S. lumber interests and believe it scuttles the NAFTA dispute settlement process. In April 2007, the United States requested consultations with Canada on various aspects of the agreement. The United States sought clarification on forest sector assistance programs from Canada, expressing concern about the surge mechanism and export tax-quota issue. A formal request for arbitration was made in August 2007, with written arguments submitted in October. The London Court of International Arbitrators agreed with the US on March 4, 2008. The London Court of International Arbitrators ruled in favor of the United States on March 4, 2008, stating that Canada had not adjusted surge levels in a timely manner. However, the western provinces were exempt from adjusting their trigger volumes, saving Canada from collecting an extra $75 million in export taxes. The arbitrators rejected the US position that adjustments had to be made regardless of the provinces' tax options. Subsequent arbitration was initiated to address Canada's failure to operate its adjustment mechanism from January 1, 2007. On February 26, 2009, LCIA ruled that Canada must impose a 10% tariff on Eastern Canadian shipments until $68.26 million is collected as compensation. Canada failed to 'cure the breach' by March 28, 2009, offering $46.7 million directly to the United States. In response, the US imposed 10% tariffs on softwood shipments. Canada sought arbitration over the breach cure offer. In January 2008, the US requested arbitration over provincial forest sector assistance programs in Quebec and Ontario, found to breach the SLA in January 2011. In January 2011, the LCIA found breaches in certain programs under the SLA, leading Canada to impose additional charges on lumber from Quebec and Ontario. Arbitration was sought over timber grading practices in British Columbia, where the BC government was accused of classifying more lumber as salvage Grade 4, resulting in a subsidy for Canadian timber processors. Disputes arose over the cause of the increase, with U.S producers claiming changes in grading procedures and heating lumber prior to grading. Some members of Congress criticized the SLA enforcement, with Senator Snowe proposing a licensing system for importers of Canadian lumber. The 2008 farm bill requires importers of Canadian lumber to certify compliance with the Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA). U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a rule for monitoring compliance with the SLA. The 2002 farm bill mandated country-of-origin labeling for certain products, with seafood requirements implemented in 2004 and others delayed until 2008. The 2008 farm bill reaffirmed and expanded these labeling requirements. The 2008 farm bill expanded country-of-origin labeling requirements to include goat meat, chicken, ginseng, pecans, and macadamia nuts as covered commodities. A final rule was issued in January 2009, effective March 2009. The WTO established a dispute settlement panel in November 2009 to address challenges to COOL from Canada and Mexico, finding that it discriminated against imported livestock. The Buy American provision of the ARRA states that no funds shall be appropriated for projects unless all iron, steel, and manufactured goods are made in the U.S. The Buy American provision in the ARRA requires all iron, steel, and manufactured goods to be made in the U.S. Three waivers exist for exceptions: if it's not in the public interest, products are not produced in sufficient quantities in the U.S., or if including U.S. products increases project costs by more than 25%. The Senate added language to ensure compliance with U.S. trade obligations, including those with Canada under the WTO's Agreement on Government Procurement and NAFTA. The Buy American provision in the ARRA requires products to be made in the U.S., with waivers for exceptions. Canada firms can bid on ARRA-related federal procurement under the AGP, but Canadian firms are excluded from bidding on ARRA-financed contracts tendered by the U.S. government. The United States and Canada negotiated an agreement to waive Buy American provisions for Canadian firms bidding on ARRA contracts in 37 states until September 30, 2011. In return, Canada's provinces will join the AGP, allowing U.S. firms procurement opportunities. This agreement only applies to future tenders and will not reopen existing contracts. Parties will also discuss expanding market access in procurement between the two countries. The U.S. and Canada negotiated an agreement to waive Buy American provisions for Canadian firms bidding on ARRA contracts. Canada was listed on the Special 301 report for intellectual property rights protections, joining China and Russia as violators. The U.S. urged Canada to implement the WIPO Copyright treaty and expressed concerns about trade in pirated goods. Canada was urged by the United States to adopt tougher border security measures to combat trade in pirated and counterfeit goods, with concerns raised about weak enforcement and lax penalties for intellectual property rights infringement. The government introduced the Copyright Modernization Act (C-32) to align Canadian copyright law with WIPO treaties, allowing for some exceptions like fair-use but prohibiting the circumvention of digital protection measures. While supported by the business community and entertainment industries, opponents argue against potential benefits from fair-use or format shifting. The aftermath of the 9/11 attacks increased scrutiny on Canadian border security. Potential economic disruption from a terrorist attack on border infrastructure is significant, with the Ambassador Bridge being a key trade link. The government is expected to reintroduce legislation prohibiting the circumvention of digital locks. The cost of the border in terms of delays and compliance is estimated at $7.5 billion to $13.2 billion annually. Transit time and uncertainty costs total $4 billion, while trade policy related costs are estimated at $6.28 billion. Average processing times have increased by 200% from 45 seconds in 2001 to 2.15 minutes in 2004. Additional reporting, compliance, and delays add $800 to the cost of every North American-produced vehicle. Increased border security has not affected Canadian export volumes to the United States through most land ports. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required travelers from Canada and Mexico to present secure documentation to enter the US. Most land travelers currently use driver's licenses or government IDs, but a new PASS card is being introduced as an alternative. The impact of increased border security on Canadian export volumes to the US has been minimal. The new PASS card, introduced as an alternative to driver's licenses for border crossing, contains a biometric identifier and citizenship documentation. Concerns have been raised about its impact on travel and trade on the northern border. The Department of Homeland Security is working with Canada to develop secure alternatives like enhanced driver's licenses with biometric information. The Government Accountability Office reported high compliance with WHTI requirements in FY2010. A Smart Border Action Plan was established in 2001 to ensure secure flow of people and goods between the US and Canada. This plan includes initiatives for harmonized commercial processing, joint customs facilities, and infrastructure improvements. The Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPP) updated this initiative in the NAFTA context. The Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPP) was launched in 2005 at a summit of the leaders of the US, Canada, and Mexico. The leaders met multiple times to discuss border improvements, joint security exercises, and a 32-point Action Plan. The Obama Administration continued cooperation with neighboring leaders through the Beyond the Border Declaration in 2011, focusing on perimeter security and economic competitiveness. The declaration between the US and Canada focuses on improved information sharing, infrastructure investment, cross-border law enforcement, and cyber-infrastructure. The FAST program enhances security along the supply chain for low-risk shippers. The FAST program and NEXUS program expedite the secure movement of goods and people across the US-Canada border. FAST provides dedicated inspection lanes for lower-risk shippers, while NEXUS offers identification cards and dedicated lanes for frequent travelers. These programs aim to enhance security and minimize disruptions in cross-border trade. The NEXUS card will be a valid form of identification for the WHTI at border crossings, airports, and marine crossings by January 2009. The U.S. Container Security Initiative (CSI) aims to prescreen high-risk containers entering the United States at overseas ports and work alongside Canadian agents in ports like Halifax, Montreal, and Vancouver. The Canadian government has implemented port security initiatives to enhance screening of marine traffic and monitoring of vessels in Canadian waters. These initiatives aim to address concerns about differences in port security affecting Canadian ports' competitiveness as entry points for goods entering the U.S. market. Additionally, the United States and Canada have agreed on increased screening and monitoring of railway shipments between the two countries, including the installation of railcar cargo detection equipment. The Vehicle and Cargo Inspection System (VACIS) has been installed at rail crossings in the United States and Canada. Land preclearance by U.S. and Canadian customs agents remains a contentious issue due to unresolved legal and institutional issues. Negotiations for a pilot program at the Peace Bridge crossing broke down in 2007. Disagreements over arrest authority, fingerprinting practices, and individual rights at preclearance stations were cited in a 2008 GAO report. The Obama administration reviewed the decision, but negotiations were not successful. In August 2009, Secretary Napolitano announced that negotiations for a preclearance site at the Peace Bridge would not be reopened. The aging land border infrastructure, including the Ambassador Bridge and Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, is inadequate for current commercial needs. The Peace Bridge, opened in 1927, is also facing challenges due to its three-lane width. The FAST system offers expedited preclearance lanes at land border ports, but there are still issues with efficient security implementation. The new Detroit River International Crossing (DRIC) south of the Ambassador Bridge between Zug Island on the Michigan shore and Brighton Beach, Windsor, received approval from the Federal Highway Administration on January 14, 2009. The Canadian government supports the DRIC proposal and offers to loan Michigan $550 million for the new bridge. The new Detroit River International Crossing (DRIC) south of the Ambassador Bridge between Zug Island on the Michigan shore and Brighton Beach, Windsor, received approval from the Federal Highway Administration on January 14, 2009. The Canadian government supports the DRIC proposal and offers to loan Michigan $550 million to fund its share of the new bridge, with a total cost of $5.3 billion. Incoming Michigan governor Rick Synder endorsed the construction of the bridge in January 2011, while the owner of the Ambassador Bridge has brought a NAFTA investor-state dispute over concerns about traffic diversion. The aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks sparked a debate in Canada over North American integration and trade flows. The impact of border closings on trade flows after the terrorist attacks sparked a broad debate in Canada, encompassing issues of sovereignty, economic integration with the United States, and even the adoption of the U.S. dollar. While concerns in the United States focus on border security and immigration, discussions in Canada often revolve around relations with the U.S. and resistance to harmonization of certain aspects of cooperation. Resistance in Canada to harmonization of U.S. and Canadian regulations is fueled by fears of adopting U.S. standards. Some believe that cooperation with the U.S. is necessary post-9/11, while others argue that regulations are already similar and can be mutually recognized for border management. Increased cooperation with the United States is seen as necessary and inevitable for Canada due to trade flows and economic interdependence. Various economic options are being considered, such as regulatory harmonization, a security perimeter, and a customs union. Discussions also involve Mexico and ways to enhance cooperation between the countries. There is renewed discussion on enhancing cooperation between NAFTA partners, with the concept of \"NAFTA plus\" gaining importance. The relative advantage of NAFTA has decreased due to FTAs with other trading partners. Since the 2001 terror attacks, Canada and Mexico perceive greater security cooperation with the U.S. as crucial for economic access. This realization has led to border initiatives and the Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP) containing initiatives for regulatory harmonization. The Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP) aims to harmonize regulations among the United States, Canada, and Mexico in areas such as border security, energy, transportation, financial services, and standards. Ten ministerial working groups were established to report regularly on regulatory changes without requiring legislative action. The SPP's Prosperity component focuses on enhancing competitiveness through streamlining regulatory processes, combating counterfeiting and piracy, and liberalizing rules of origin. Sectoral initiatives in steel, autos, energy, air transport, and e-commerce are also planned. The United States, Canada, and Mexico are working on harmonizing regulations in various sectors such as border security, energy, transportation, and financial services through the Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP). Initiatives in pollution, agriculture, health, and competitiveness have been launched. A North American Competitiveness Council has been formed to improve business competitiveness in global markets. There are discussions about creating a North American security perimeter to address terrorism concerns. The creation of a customs union is discussed as a step towards further integration of the North American economy. This would involve eliminating tariffs among members and establishing common barriers against non-members. The seamless border for goods would require standards harmonization, information sharing on threat assessments, and trust in screening procedures. The assumption is made that there are no indigenous terrorist threats within the North American security perimeter. The U.S. and Canada have eliminated tariffs between each other under NAFTA. A customs union would eliminate the need for customs agents at the border but would not harmonize regulations. It is unclear how trade remedy practices would continue under a customs union. Actions against third countries could still be taken easily, but actions against each other would be more complex. Deeper integration of the North American economic space would require harmonization of regulations and standards, potentially leading to a common market or economic union similar to the European Union. This would involve free movement of labor, capital, and goods, as well as mutual recognition of investment and immigration regulations. The potential for North American economic integration raises questions about governance, such as adopting common standards and resolving disputes. Discussions in Canadian policy circles also include the idea of monetary union with the United States, potentially linking currencies or creating a new North American currency. The idea of a new North American currency, known as the Amero, replacing the U.S. and Canadian dollars, and possibly the Mexican peso, has been discussed during times of loonie weakness. Proponents argue that a monetary union would force Canada to become more competitive with the U.S. by removing the ability to cushion economic conditions through currency depreciation. Tying the loonie to the U.S. dollar would commit Canada to converge with U.S. macroeconomic policy, potentially leading to lower inflation. Opponents of a North American monetary union argue that it would result in a loss of political and economic sovereignty for Canada, as monetary policy would be tied to the U.S. Federal Reserve. They believe that the two economies respond differently to events and require different adjustment mechanisms. Additionally, Canada's influence on U.S. monetary policy would be limited due to its smaller population and economy compared to some Federal Reserve districts. Canada's influence on U.S. monetary policy in a monetary union would be small due to its smaller economy compared to some Federal Reserve districts."
