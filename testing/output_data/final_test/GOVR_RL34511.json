    "content": "Congress continues to show interest and support for nanotechnology, believing in its potential for economic growth and societal benefits. Key topics of concern include federal R&D investments, U.S. international competitiveness, and EHS issues. Additionally, nanomanufacturing and public attitudes towards nanotechnology are of interest to Congress. Nanotechnology R&D focuses on controlling matter at nanoscale dimensions. President Clinton launched the NNI in 2000 to promote U.S. competitiveness in nanotechnology. Congress supported the NNI with increased funding until FY2010, but funding declined by $478 million from FY2010 to FY2016. President Obama's proposed funding for nanotechnology R&D in FY2017 remains similar to FY2016 levels. In 2003, Congress enacted the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act to provide a statutory foundation for the NNI. The 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act provided a statutory foundation for the NNI, established programs, assigned agency responsibilities, and authorized agency funding levels for FY2005 through FY2008. Congress has continued to appropriate funds for nanotechnology R&D beyond FY2008, with a focus on advancing understanding of fundamental nanoscale phenomena, developing nanomaterials, devices, instrumentation, standards, and nanomanufacturing processes. The NNI supports research on environmental, health, and safety impacts of nanotechnology, as well as its ethical, legal, and societal implications. Current nanotechnology applications offer incremental improvements to products in various industries such as display screens, automobile parts, clothing, and sporting goods. Nanotechnology plays a central role in various applications, improving performance in products like microchips, flash memory, and hard drives. Proponents believe it may lead to revolutionary advances in areas such as disease detection and treatment. Nanotechnology is being used to detect and treat diseases like cancer by developing sensors that can identify biomarkers indicative of early tumor development. Approaches include using carbon nanotubes and nanowires to detect molecular signals of cancer biomarkers, as well as nanoscale cantilevers treated with molecules that bind only with cancer biomarkers. These methods are in clinical trials or approved by the FDA. Nanotechnology is utilized for detecting and treating diseases like cancer by developing sensors to identify biomarkers. Current research involves metallic, magnetic, and polymeric nanoparticles attached to antibodies for targeted cell imaging. Nanotechnology offers new cancer treatment approaches, such as engineered adenovirus nanoparticles and nanoshells with silica cores for shutting down cancer cell enzymes. Nanoshells with a core of silica and an outer metallic shell can be used to concentrate at cancer lesion sites and kill cancer cells using near-infrared light. Another approach involves a gold nanoshell carrying a chemotherapy drug that releases the drug inside the tumor when heated. Nanoparticles can also carry multiple drugs and release them in response to different triggering mechanisms. In February 2015, the FDA authorized a nanotechnology-enabled antigen test for detecting Ebola during the outbreak in West Africa. The National Institutes for Health are developing a universal influenza vaccine using nanotechnology. A nano-enabled skin patch for diabetes delivers insulin painlessly. Nanotechnology applications are advancing renewable energy, including solar energy collection and conversion. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has developed \"black silicon\" solar cells with a world record energy conversion efficiency of 18.2%. They also created nanostructured coatings for solar thermal energy conversion with efficiencies over 90% and increased heat-transfer fluid temperature range. Nanomaterials are being used to produce fuels and high-value chemicals directly from sunlight, with semiconductor catalysts showing promise for hydrogen production from water using sunlight. Nanotechnology shows promise in improving energy production and storage. Nanostructured catalysts and photovoltaic devices can utilize a wider spectrum of sunlight for hydrogen production and electricity conversion. Additionally, nanostructured materials offer potential advancements in energy storage, surpassing standard batteries by 40%. Nanotechnology approaches also hold potential for enhancing water treatment through various methods like nanosorbents and nanoparticle filtration. Nanotechnology advancements in water treatment include catalytic membranes and nanoparticle enhanced filtration for improved water quality in large-scale plants and point-of-use systems. Nanoscale filtration systems with pores allow water molecules to pass through while blocking larger molecules like salt ions, bacteria, viruses, and heavy metals. Nanobiosensors can detect viruses in agriculture, enabling targeted pesticide use to increase crop yield and reduce environmental impact. Nanotechnology offers various benefits such as improving crop yield, reducing costs, and environmental impact. It can enhance nutrient delivery, extend shelf life of products, and provide targeted nutrition through nanocapsules. Additionally, nanotechnology enables materials to self-heal by incorporating repair substances in nanocontainers. Nanotechnology can be used for environmental remediation by injecting engineered nanoparticles into the ground to move more easily through contaminated sites and bond with targeted contaminants. Nanoparticles can also be designed to release repair material to seal cracks and detect toxins or pathogens using sensors. EPA cautions that site-specific conditions must be considered. Nanotechnology has potential for environmental remediation by targeting contaminants, but site-specific conditions may limit effectiveness. Private sector invests significantly more in nanotechnology R&D than the public sector. Many nations and firms worldwide are also investing in nanotechnology. President Clinton launched the National Nanotechnology Initiative. President Clinton initiated the National Nanotechnology Initiative in 2000 to advance nanoscale science and technology in the United States. The initiative involves multiple federal departments and agencies dedicated to nanotechnology research, development, and regulation, including the EPA, FDA, and CPSC. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) was established in 2000 by President Clinton to advance nanoscale science and technology in the United States. Congress has been actively involved in the NNI, providing appropriations for nanotechnology R&D and creating legislative foundations for its activities. The 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act of 2003 authorized appropriations for NNI activities at various agencies. Congress has continued its engagement through hearings, proposed legislation, and annual appropriations. The 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act, which authorized appropriations for NNI activities, had no sunset provision and FY2008 was the last year it was authorized. Legislation to amend and reauthorize the act has been introduced in multiple Congresses. In the 114th Congress, H.R. 1898 and S. 3084 were introduced to reauthorize and modify NNI reporting requirements, respectively. No further action has been taken on these bills. Efforts to enact comprehensive NNI reauthorization legislation in previous Congresses were unsuccessful. The NNI is coordinated within the White House through the National Science and Technology Council's NSET subcommittee, comprised of representatives from federal departments and agencies. The NSET subcommittee has two working groups: National Environmental and Health Implications (NEHI) Working Group; and Nanotechnology Innovation and Commercialization Ecosystem (NICE) Working Group. The NSET subcommittee within the National Science and Technology Council coordinates the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI). The NSET subcommittee has designated coordinators for four broad areas and the National Nanotechnology Coordination Office (NNCO) provides support. The NNI website is maintained by NNCO for public outreach. The NNI conducts public outreach and maintains its website. NNI funding is provided through appropriations to participating agencies, with 94.2% coming from the original six agencies in FY2016. Congress appropriated $1.435 billion for nanotechnology R&D in FY2016, a decrease from previous years. The NNI has received approximately $22.3 billion in funding from FY2001 to FY2016. President Obama requested $1.443 billion for nanotechnology R&D in FY2017, similar to the previous year. The NNI's funding by agency is detailed in Table 1, with Program Component Areas (PCAs) guiding investments across different areas. The 2004 NNI Strategic Plan identified seven PCAs, later revised in 2014 by the NSET Subcommittee. The NSET Subcommittee revised the taxonomy for PCAs in 2014, reducing the number from eight to five. One new PCA is Nanotechnology Signature Initiatives (NSIs), focusing on areas like solar energy and sustainable manufacturing. Funding breakout for FY2013-FY2017 is provided in Table 2. The report discusses U.S. competitiveness, environmental implications, nanomanufacturing, and public attitudes towards nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is still in its early stages, making it difficult to assess U.S. competitiveness internationally. Data on revenues, market share, and global trade are not readily available. Despite this, many experts believe the U.S. is a global leader in nanotechnology. However, some argue that the U.S. lead is narrower compared to previous emerging technologies. Some nations have more substantial scientific and industrial infrastructure and technical capabilities compared to the U.S. Estimates of global nanotechnology revenues often rely on subjective assessments due to the varied incorporation of nanotechnology in products. This leads to a wide range of estimated global nanotechnology revenues. The global nanotechnology market has a wide range of estimated revenues, with a 2012 estimate at $20.7 billion by BCC Research and a 2014 estimate at $1.6 trillion by Lux Research. The United States accounted for $370 billion, Europe for $602 billion, Asia for $524 billion, and the rest of the world for $120 billion in 2014. The United States leads in nanotechnology in terms of economic output data, R&D investments, scientific papers, and patents. However, these measures may not accurately reflect the country's competitive position due to various factors such as basic research not translating into commercial applications, research results being available to all competitors, U.S. companies operating production outside the country, and U.S.-educated foreign students returning home to conduct research and start businesses. The United States leads in nanotechnology with high R&D investments and economic output. However, foreign students may conduct research abroad, and U.S. companies could be acquired by foreign competitors. Global leadership in niche areas could impact the U.S. competitive position. Despite these challenges, the U.S. remains a top investor in nanotechnology R&D. In 2014, global nanotechnology funding totaled $18.1 billion, with the United States contributing $5.9 billion. Corporate R&D accounted for the majority of funding for the first time in 2010. Public nanotechnology R&D funding in 2014 was estimated at $7.9 billion, with the United States contributing $1.7 billion, Europe $2.5 billion, Japan $1.1 billion, Russia $1.1 billion, and China $590 million. The United States leads in public investments in nanotechnology, but the outcome differs when adjusted for currency exchange rates. When using currency exchange rates, the outcome varies when adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP), which considers the price of goods and services in each nation. Lux Research found that Russia's public funding exceeded that of the United States, and total public spending by the EC and individual EC member countries was more than double that of the United States. Corporate nanotechnology R&D in 2014 was $9.8 billion, with the United States accounting for $4.0 billion (41%), Japan for $2.5 billion (25%), and Germany for $0.8 billion (8%). U.S. corporate spending on nanotechnology R&D grew faster between 2012 and 2014 (9%) compared to Europe (7%) and Asia (3.1%). Venture capital (VC) funding for nanotechnology peaked at nearly $1.4 billion in 2008. Venture capital funding for nanotechnology has significantly decreased since its peak in 2008, with 2014 seeing the lowest level at $316 million. U.S.-based companies received the majority of global VC investment in 2014, while the publication of scientific papers is seen as an indicator of scientific leadership. Different approaches to analyzing nanotechnology scientific papers have yielded varying results, with a recent analysis by the National Science Foundation showing different outcomes based on the journals searched. China led in nanotechnology publications in 2014 with approximately 39,500 papers, followed by the EU-27, the United States, South Korea, and Japan. The U.S. accounted for 19% of publications, down from 29.5% in 2001-2005, due to faster growth in Chinese publications. In 2010, the U.S. had approximately 33% of nanotechnology publications, down from 51% in 2000. The U.S. accounted for 65%-70% of contributions to top scientific publications since 2006. The Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) found that China and the European Union published more nanotechnology papers than the United States between 2011 and 2013. Patent counts are used to assess technological competitiveness, with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) data often being used for analysis due to the importance of securing a U.S. patent in the market. The U.S. patent position remains strong globally, with inventors from other nations accounting for a greater share of patents in recent years. From 1975 to 2015, the United States granted the majority of patents, followed by Japan, South Korea, Germany, and others. USPTO examined patenting activity in over 50 countries from 1986 to 2015, showing different results. The United States accounted for 24.4% of nanotechnology patents globally from 1986 to June 2015, with China at 17.7%, Japan at 10.3%, and South Korea at 7.9%. Over time, the U.S. share of patents issued by these countries declined, while China and South Korea's shares grew significantly. The number of patents issued to U.S. inventors increased over time, but the U.S. share declined due to a faster rise in patents from other countries. A measure of nanotechnology patents issued in three or more countries showed the U.S. accounting for 31.3% between 1986 and June 2011. The U.S. share dropped from 40% in 2002 to 31% in 2014-2015. The United States accounted for 65.1% of nanotechnology patents awarded by USPTO between 1991 and 2012, followed by Japan (9.4%), South Korea (5.4%), Taiwan (3.3%), Germany (3.0%), France (2.3%), and China (1.7%). The U.S. share of patents decreased over time but still represented around 60% of patents awarded during 2011 and 2012. Asian countries saw a rapid increase in patents awarded during the same period, with South Korea, China, and Taiwan together accounting for 2.0% of patents in 1991-2000 and 18.3% in 2011-2012. Nanotechnology has the potential to benefit the environment, health, and safety by reducing energy consumption, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as offering new materials for various applications. However, concerns arise due to the unique properties of nanoscale materials, such as their small size and high surface area to volume ratio. Nanoscale particles, whether natural or engineered, raise environmental and health concerns due to their potential to accumulate in vital organs. Nanoscale silver, used in various consumer products, may harm ecosystems by killing essential microbes. The unique properties of engineered nanomaterials offer both benefits and risks. Some nanoscale materials can be beneficial or harmful based on their size characteristics. Certain particles may cross the blood-brain barrier to deliver medicine for brain tumors, while others could unintentionally harm humans and animals. Stakeholders are concerned about the potential negative effects of nanoscale materials on environmental and human health. The importance of addressing nanotechnology regulation is to protect human health, safety, and the environment, enable accurate risk assessments, create a stable regulatory environment for investment, ensure public confidence, prevent negative consequences, and maximize economic benefits. Research investments aim to understand nanoscale particles and their interactions. Researchers are working to characterize nanoscale particles and their interactions with living organisms and the environment. They aim to establish frameworks for assessing toxicity risks and informing regulatory decisions. Despite ongoing research, there is now a broader knowledge base to minimize potential adverse effects of nanotechnology. Increasingly precise understanding of nanoscale characteristics and interactions, along with data on exposure and the ability to manipulate matter at the nanoscale, may help engineers design around potential risks. The ability to manipulate matter at the nanoscale may help engineers design around potential risks of nanotechnology. However, leading experts highlight challenges such as a lack of exposure data, reliance on animal studies for regulatory decisions, and regulations based on engineered nanomaterials as novel chemical substances. The current status of nanotechnology EHS involves regulations on engineered nano materials as novel chemical substances, with positive trends emerging in safety assessment approaches. This includes a shift towards mechanistic and systems-level methods, reducing reliance on outdated toxicology studies and promoting alternative test strategies to improve regulatory processes. The policy issues surrounding nanotechnology EHS impacts include federal investment in research, regulatory structures, and international cooperation. Nanomanufacturing is crucial for translating nanoscience knowledge into market-ready products, with current products requiring incremental manufacturing changes. Nanomanufacturing involves producing nanoscale materials in a factory setting, requiring new technologies and standards. Federal agencies fund R&D for scalable and cost-effective nanomanufacturing, with a reported budget of $93.9 million in FY2013. The NNI proposed $100.3 million for FY2014 but changed its reporting taxonomy in FY2015, eliminating the Nanomanufacturing program component area. Under the new PCA taxonomy, nanomanufacturing R&D funding is included in the Nanotechnology Signature Initiatives PCA under the subcategory \"Sustainable Nanomanufacturing: Creating the Industries of the Futures.\" The President's FY2017 budget proposes $37.4 million for the Sustainable Nanomanufacturing initiative, with NSF, NIST, and USDA accounting for the largest shares of funds. Nanomanufacturing is supported by federal agencies through R&D and other activities, including the establishment of the National Nanomanufacturing Network (NNN) for collaboration and information exchange. The NNN promotes U.S. nanomanufacturing through various initiatives and is supported by key entities such as NSF, DOE, NIST, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst Libraries. Some agencies are advancing nanomanufacturing through non-R&D activities. For instance, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is developing case studies to address potential EHS issues in nanomanufacturing. The U.S. Government Accountability Office held a forum with experts to discuss nanomanufacturing's future, U.S. investments, competitiveness, challenges, ways to enhance competitiveness, and EHS implications. Experts see nanomanufacturing as a technological revolution with potential for disruptive innovation and job creation. The report highlights nanomanufacturing as a megatrend with transformative impacts on the economy and society, comparable to the digital revolution. Experts suggest federal actions such as information dissemination, standards development, addressing EHS issues, and enhancing U.S. competitiveness through policy updates, public-private partnerships, and a national strategy. Public opinion and attitudes towards nanotechnology can influence research funding, regulation, market acceptance, and response to negative events. Studies show that the public generally believes the benefits of nanotechnology outweigh the risks, with low risk perceptions compared to other hazards. Public opinion on nanotechnology risks and regulation varies among different groups. A 2015 paper found that scientists and the general public have differing views on regulating commercial versus academic nanotechnology research. Factors such as religiosity, political ideology, and risk perceptions influence support for regulation. Media attention also plays a significant role in shaping public support for regulating commercial nanotechnology research. Growing media attention to nanotechnology risks and benefits in the US has led to increased public concerns over commercial use of the technology, prompting a greater need for industry regulation. This contrasts with a 2007 survey showing a positive correlation between nanotechnology awareness and belief in its benefits. However, communicating about nanotechnology without clear answers to environmental, health, and safety questions can create uncertainty and opposition among the public. The 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act of 2003 emphasizes public engagement in the NNI's efforts, including public input, outreach, and fostering public understanding through various mechanisms. The NSET subcommittee has appointed a coordinator for education and engagement, while the NNCO has conducted webinars on NNI activities for the general public and the nanotechnology community. The federal government has made sustained investments in nanotechnology under the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) since FY2001. Various topics have been covered in webinars, including nanotechnology applications in commercial products and the potential for revolutionary products. The NNI plays important roles in key science and technology initiatives. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) plays important roles in various science and technology initiatives, including the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP), Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) program, Materials Genome Initiative (MGI), National Cancer Moonshot, and cybersecurity. Congress may address hurdles in research, development, and innovation to realize economic and social benefits from these efforts. Topics for consideration include budget authorization levels, R&D funding priorities, administration of the NNI, and translating research into commercially viable applications. The NSET subcommittee focuses on translating research results and early-stage technology into commercially viable applications, addressing environmental, health, and safety issues, ethical, legal, and societal implications, education and training for the nanotechnology workforce, metrology, standards, and public understanding. It includes various member departments, agencies, and offices such as the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Department of Health and Human Services, and others. The NSET subcommittee includes various federal departments, independent agencies, and commissions with a budget dedicated to nanotechnology research and development.
