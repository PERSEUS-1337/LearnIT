    "content": "INCREASE IN DEPOSIT INSURANCE COVERAGE. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act is amended to limit the net amount due to any depositor at an insured depository institution to the standard maximum deposit insurance amount. The term 'standard maximum deposit insurance amount' is defined for the purposes of the Act. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act limits the amount due to depositors at insured depository institutions to a standard maximum deposit insurance amount. This amount is set at $100,000 until final regulations are issued, and then can be increased to $100,000 or $500,000 at the institution's option. Eligible retirement accounts can be insured up to $250,000 or $500,000, also at the institution's option. The term 'eligible retirement plan' has the same meaning as in the Internal Revenue Code. The Board of Directors and the National Credit Union Administration Board will jointly consider inflation adjustments every 5 years. The standard maximum share insurance amount for depositors at insured depository institutions will be increased based on a calculation involving specified amounts and options chosen by the institution. This adjustment is made in consideration of inflation every 5 years. The adjustment of the standard maximum share insurance amount for depositors at insured depository institutions is based on the Consumption Expenditures Chain-Type Price Index published by the Department of Commerce. The calculation uses values from the preceding calendar year and is updated every 5 years to account for inflation. The standard maximum deposit insurance amount is adjusted based on the Consumption Expenditures Chain-Type Price Index from the Department of Commerce. If the calculated amount is not a multiple of $10,000, it is rounded down. The Board of Directors and the National Credit Union Administration Board must publish a report by April 5 of any year when an adjustment is required. The standard maximum deposit insurance amount is adjusted annually based on the Consumption Expenditures Chain-Type Price Index. The Board of Directors and the National Credit Union Administration Board must publish the adjusted amounts in the Federal Register and submit a report to Congress. An Act of Congress must be enacted before July 1 for the adjustment to take effect. The standard maximum deposit insurance amount is adjusted annually based on the Consumption Expenditures Chain-Type Price Index and takes effect on January 1 of the following year unless specified otherwise."
