The Secretary annually determines per capita payment rates for individuals enrolled in eligible organizations under risk-sharing contracts for Medicare Part A and Part B benefits. The cost reimbursement contract is defined as a contract under subsection (h). The annual per capita rate of payment for Medicare payment areas is determined by the adjusted capitation rate, adjusted by the Secretary for various factors to ensure actuarial equivalence. Eligible organizations with risk-sharing contracts are included in this determination. The Secretary makes monthly advance payments to eligible organizations with risk-sharing contracts for each enrolled individual. Separate payment rates are established for individuals with end-stage renal disease. Payment amounts may be retroactively adjusted based on actual enrollment numbers. The Secretary may make retroactive adjustments to advance payments for individuals enrolled in a health benefit plan operated by their employer or former employer, with a maximum retroactive period of 90 days. Adjustments cannot be made for individuals who do not certify their enrollment with the organization. The Secretary must notify eligible organizations of proposed changes in methodology or benefit coverage assumptions at least 45 days before announcing changes for the year. The announcement must include detailed explanations for organizations to calculate payment rates for individuals. Organizations can calculate payment rates for individuals in each county within their service area. Payments to eligible organizations with cost reimbursement contracts will be made according to specific subsections. These payments replace amounts that would otherwise be payable for services provided to enrolled individuals. The 'adjusted capitation rate' for a Medicare payment area is defined in the section. The 'adjusted capitation rate' for a Medicare payment area is determined by the area-specific percentage and the national percentage multiplied by a budget neutrality adjustment factor. This rate replaces amounts payable for services provided to enrolled individuals. The adjusted capitation rate for Medicare payment areas is calculated based on input price adjustments and national average per capita growth percentages. Additionally, the annual per capita rate of payment for the previous year is increased by 102 percent for subsequent years. The adjusted capitation rate for Medicare payment areas is calculated based on input price adjustments and national average per capita growth percentages. In subsequent years, the annual per capita rate of payment is increased by 102 percent of the previous year's rate. The area-specific percentage and national percentage vary for different years, with the area-specific percentage decreasing over time. The area-specific adjusted capitation rate for Medicare payment areas is determined based on historical rates adjusted for inflation and national average per capita growth percentages. In subsequent years, the rate is increased by the national average growth percentage. The Medicare payment area for a year is calculated by summing the product of the national standardized adjusted capitation rate, the proportion of the rate attributable to each type of service, and an index reflecting the relative input price of services in the area compared to the national average. The Secretary applies indices used for national payment rates for specific areas and localities. The capitation rate for a year is calculated by multiplying the area-specific adjusted capitation rate by the average number of standardized Medicare beneficiaries in that area, divided by the total average number of beneficiaries in all Medicare payment areas. In 1998, Medicare services are divided into part A and part B services, with specific proportions for each type of service. The capitation rate for Medicare services in 1998 is calculated based on specific proportions for part A and part B services. Part A services are adjusted by a wage index, while part B services are adjusted by a geographic area factor index. The Secretary may adjust payment rates for physicians' services based on specific percentages, with a budget neutrality adjustment factor calculated annually. The 'national average per capita growth percentage' is determined by the projected growth in Medicare fee-for-service per capita expenditures. The term 'medicare payment area' refers to a specified county or area for individuals with end-stage renal disease. The Secretary can adjust the system for determining payment areas in a state upon request from the State's Chief Executive Officer. Adjustments can include a single statewide payment area or a metropolitan-based system. The Secretary can adjust payment rates for Medicare payment areas in a State upon request, ensuring payments equal what would have been made without adjustment. This adjustment consolidates noncontiguous counties into a single payment area and is effective from January of the following year. The Secretary can adjust payment rates for Medicare payment areas in a State upon request, consolidating areas into single payment areas as designated by the Secretary of Commerce. The amendment made by subsection (a) regarding risk-sharing contracts will take effect on October 1, 1997."
