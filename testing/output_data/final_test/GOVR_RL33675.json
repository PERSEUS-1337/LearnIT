Participants receive a basic monthly federal benefit, with additional supplements provided by 44 states and the District of Columbia. Some states, like Arkansas and Tennessee, do not offer a state supplement. Recipients also qualify for Medicaid in most states. As of December 2008, over 7.5 million people were enrolled in the SSI program. In December 2008, over 7.5 million people received SSI benefits, with an average cash benefit of $477.80. The program paid out nearly $3.9 billion in benefits, with eligibility based on limited assets and resources. Couples may become ineligible if their combined resources exceed $3,000. The countable resource limit for SSI eligibility is $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples, set by law since 1989. Excluded resources include home, car for transportation, and specified assets. Marriage for SSI purposes is defined by federal regulations, including legal marriage, entitlement to Social Security benefits, or living together as a couple. Marriage for SSI purposes under the Defense of Marriage Act involves two SSI beneficiaries living together as a couple, which can impact their eligibility and benefits. A married couple is considered a beneficiary couple with a lower resource limit, federal benefit, and excluded income compared to two single beneficiaries. The maximum federal SSI benefit for 2008 is $674 per month for a single beneficiary and $1,011 per month for a married couple. Single SSI beneficiaries can have up to $2,000 in countable resources, while married couples have a limit of $3,000. Unmarried beneficiaries can each receive up to $674 per month or a combined benefit of $1,348, while married couples can receive a maximum of $1,011 per month. Single beneficiaries can exclude $85 of income. When an SSI beneficiary marries a person who does not receive SSI benefits, their eligibility and benefits may be affected if the ineligible spouse has significant income or assets. The income and assets of both spouses are considered shared, potentially increasing the beneficiary's countable income or resources after marriage. When an SSI beneficiary marries someone who does not receive benefits, a portion of the ineligible spouse's income is deemed to the SSI beneficiary, affecting benefit eligibility. The income deeming process involves determining the countable income of the ineligible spouse and considering the overall family size. The countable income of an ineligible spouse is reduced for any children or sponsored aliens in the household. If the final countable income is less than the federal SSI benefit rate for an individual, the beneficiary's SSI eligibility continues. If the countable income of an ineligible spouse is less than the federal SSI benefit rate for an individual, the beneficiary can continue receiving SSI benefits as an individual. If the income of the ineligible spouse exceeds the difference between the federal SSI benefit rates for a couple and an individual, the beneficiary and spouse are considered a couple and eligible for SSI benefits at the couple rate. If a married beneficiary is considered an individual, their SSI benefit is the individual rate minus their countable income. The spouse's income is not factored in. If the married couple is considered a couple, their benefit is reduced. If a beneficiary and their spouse are considered a couple, their combined countable income reduces their benefit. The ineligible spouse's income is added to the beneficiary's total income, then reduced by standard exclusions. Resources owned by the ineligible spouse are deemed to the beneficiary, subject to SSI limitations. A single beneficiary can have up to $2,000 in countable resources, while a beneficiary couple's limit is $3,000. If a beneficiary is part of a couple, the countable resource limit is $3,000, except for an ineligible spouse's pension plan."
