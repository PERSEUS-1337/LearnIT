MINE is back-propable and strongly consistent, with successful applications in enhancing generative models in unsupervised and supervised settings. The framework is used to estimate the information bottleneck and improve supervised classification tasks, showing significant flexibility and performance improvements. Mutual information is a crucial concept in data science, used in various domains such as biomedical sciences and feature selection. Unlike correlation, it measures the absolute statistical dependency between two variables, X and Z, on the same probability space. It quantifies the shared information between the variables. The mutual information is difficult to compute, especially for general problems. Common approaches include binning, kernel density estimation, Edgeworth expansion, and likelihood-ratio estimators. These estimators make assumptions about the underlying distribution of samples and may not scale well with sample size. Recent advancements in estimation techniques have focused on f-divergences and integral probability metrics using deep neural networks, particularly in the context of generative adversarial networks (GANs). These methods allow for the computation of variational lower-bounds on distances or divergences of implicit probability measures. This paper aims to extend this strategy to mutual information estimation, specifically the Kullback-Leibler (KL-) divergence. The paper introduces the mutual information neural estimator (MINE) based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL-) divergence. The estimator is scalable, flexible, and trainable via back-propagation, providing improved support coverage and richer learned representation for training adversarial models. The mutual information neural estimator (MINE) based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL-) divergence is used to improve reconstructions and inference in Adversarially Learned Inference. It outperforms variational bottleneck methods and provides a method for performing the Information Bottleneck method in a continuous setting. Mutual information measures dependence between random variables by quantifying the decrease in uncertainty of X given Z. The KL-divergence measures the difference between joint and marginal distributions, with zero mutual information when divergence is zero. MINE uses this to estimate mutual information, providing a tight lower-bound. Jensen's inequality is used to define the KL-divergence between two probability distributions. The KL-divergence is a measure of the difference between distributions, always non-negative and zero only when P = Q. The Donsker-Varadhan representation provides a variational form of the KL-divergence, with a compression lemma giving a lower bound. Jensen's inequality is used in defining the KL-divergence between distributions. The Donsker-Varadhan bound is compared with other variational bounds in the literature, showing that it is stronger in certain cases. Numerical comparisons are performed in Section 4.1, and the representations (6) and (10) are derived from a unifying point of view of Fenchel duality in the context of f-divergences. The discussion focuses on the representation of mutual information using KL-divergence in the context of joint random variables. It involves parametrizing functions with a deep neural network for easier optimization in deep learning. The Donsker-Varadhan bound is compared with other variational bounds, showing its strength in certain cases. The discussion focuses on representing mutual information using KL-divergence with joint random variables. It involves transforming an infinite dimensional problem into a parametric optimization problem using a statistic network. The Mutual Information Neural Estimator (MINE) is introduced as a way to estimate expectations through Monte-Carlo sampling. The objective is maximized using gradient ascent, updating the statistic network parameters until convergence. The discussion introduces the Mutual Information Neural Estimator (MINE) to estimate mutual information using a statistic network. An adaptive gradient clipping method is used for stability. Consistency of MINE is defined as convergence to true mutual information as sample size increases. The problem of consistency involves approximation and estimation issues. The discussion addresses two main problems: the gap in inequality and an estimation problem related to empirical measures. The universal approximation theorem for neural networks addresses the first problem, while classical consistency theorems apply to the second problem. Lemmas are presented with proofs in Appendix 6.2, showing the existence of a feedforward network function and a family of functions defined by a network architecture. The discussion introduces a consistency theorem for neural networks, showing strong consistency for MINE defined by Equations 12 and 13. The construction can be extended to more general information measures based on f-divergences indexed by a convex function f. The KL-divergence is a special case of f-divergence, and f-information measures can be defined as f-divergences. In this section, a family of f-information measures known as f-divergences is defined. The Donsker-Varadhan representation is analogously applied to f-divergences, utilizing convex operators and Fenchel-Legendre duality for variational representation. The mutual information neural estimator (MINE) is extended to a mutual finformation estimator, with applications presented alongside competing methods. Experimental results are also discussed, emphasizing the importance of mutual information in analyzing statistical dependencies. The MINE method is used for estimating mutual information, with various approaches like k-NN and Edgeworth series. Estimation is challenging due to the complexity of joint distributions. The MINE method is utilized for estimating mutual information between random variables, using neural networks for scalability. It can provide good estimates without the limitations of other methods. In an experiment comparing MINE to a k-means-based estimator, two bivariate Gaussian random variables are considered. In an experiment comparing MINE to a k-means-based estimator, two bivariate Gaussian random variables are considered with different correlation values. The results show that MINE provides a tighter estimate of mutual information compared to other methods. Mode dropping in GANs occurs when the generator fails to generate all modes in the target dataset. Two sources of mode dropping are identified: discriminator liability and generator liability. To address the greedy behavior of the generator, maximizing the entropy of the generated data is proposed as a solution. The generator in GANs can maximize data entropy by incorporating a mutual information term. The discriminator is optimized to maximize the value function, leading to maximizing the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The generator then minimizes the value function alternatively as the discriminator maximizes it. The generator in GANs can maximize data entropy by incorporating a mutual information term. To palliate mode-dropping, the strategy is to maximize the entropy of the generated data. The generator objective is to maximize the mutual information using back-propagation and gradient descent with adaptive gradient clipping for stability. BID10 proposes learning a reconstruction distribution to teach the generator to sample from it, aiming to reduce mode dropping indirectly. InfoGAN and VEEGAN also leverage recognition networks to maximize variational lower bounds on entropy. Our approach involves using MINE to estimate entropy in a GAN with entropy regularization of the generator, similar to BID13. This strategy improves mode coverage during training on datasets like swiss-roll and 25-Gaussians. Applying MINE to improve mode coverage in GAN training, maximizing mutual information to enhance generator entropy. Results on Swiss-roll and 25-Gaussians datasets show increased mode coverage compared to orthodox GAN. Adversarial bi-directional models incorporate a reverse model for improved inference. ALI, Dumoulin et al., 2016, and related models like BiGAN BID15 and ALICE BID29 aim to train a discriminator to maximize a value function over joint distributions induced by encoder and decoder models. ALI struggles with identifiability issues and mode dropping, leading to poor sample reconstructions. ALICE addresses these issues by minimizing conditional entropy through additional terms. The text discusses the connection between mutual information and reconstruction error in the context of training a bi-directional adversarial model. By fixing the conditional density and maximizing mutual information between X and Z, the reconstruction error can be lowered. The model uses a deep neural network to model the conditional density and aims to achieve higher mutual information for better mode coverage and reconstructions. The text compares MINE to existing bi-directional adversarial models in terms of reconstruction accuracy and mode coverage. MINE improves reconstruction ability by capturing all modes of the data distribution, unlike ALICE which shows mode-dropping in the sample space. Training MINE on datasets of increasing complexity demonstrates its balanced reconstruction performance. MINE outperforms ALI in terms of reconstruction errors and is competitive with ALICE in terms of reconstruction accuracy and MS-SSIM. The comparison of MINE with other bi-directional adversarial models on the MNIST dataset shows its superior performance in capturing all modes of the data distribution. MINE shows decent performance compared to ALI in reconstructions, but lags behind in MS-SSIM scores. Information Bottleneck (IB) is an information theoretic method for extracting relevant information from input to output. MINE achieves a substantial decrease in reconstruction errors without compromising on quality. MINE achieves a substantial decrease in reconstruction errors without compromising on better MS-SSIM score. IB seeks a feature map that induces a Markovian structure X ! Z ! Y by minimizing the IB Lagrangian. The regularizer is estimated with MINE, which uses the Blahut-Arimoto Algorithm in the discrete setting. The Information Bottleneck was successfully applied to jointly Gaussian random variables in BID11 using MINE to estimate mutual information directly. An implementation of the Information Bottleneck objective on permutation invariant MNIST was demonstrated using MINE, with an MLP encoder and softmax decoder. Alemi et al. used a variational bound on conditional entropy, requiring a tractable density for their approach. The mutual information neural estimator (MINE) is compared to other encoders in Table 3, showing MINE's superiority. MINE is scalable and efficient, addressing mode-dropping in GANs and improving inference and reconstructions in adversarially-learned inference. The mutual information neural estimator (MINE) improves inference and reconstructions in adversarially-learned inference. It allows for tractable application of Information bottleneck methods in a continuous setting, illustrating this with distributions on natural image manifolds. The mutual information of pixels in natural images is expected to be high, indicating the presence of physically possible priors like smoothness. The larger the ponderation of higher order cumulants tensor in the cumulant generating function of the joint distribution over the pixels, the higher the mutual information, indicating more structure among the pixels. Assessing the joint distribution's deviation from the product of marginals reveals the amount of structure present. This principle can be extended to different divergences, with proofs of the Lemma leading to the consistency result in Theorem 2. The input space is a compact domain of R^d with absolutely continuous measures. We denote joint distribution as P and product of marginals as Q. We focus on feedforward functions with continuous activations and a single output neuron. The reconstruction error is defined for encoder and decoder models. The relationship between reconstruction error and mutual information is clarified by proving a bound. The reconstruction error is defined for encoder and decoder models in terms of joint distributions and marginals. It can be expressed as a bound involving KL-divergence and entropy, with tightness achieved when the encoder's induced marginal matches the prior distribution."
