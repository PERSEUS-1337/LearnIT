    "content": "The Act titled \"Catastrophe Savings Accounts Act of 2006\" introduces Catastrophe Savings Accounts under a new part in the Internal Revenue Code. The Catastrophe Savings Account is tax-exempt but subject to unrelated business income taxes. It is a trust for the exclusive benefit of an individual or beneficiaries, designated as such at establishment, with specific contribution requirements. The Catastrophe Savings Account is a tax-exempt trust with contribution limits and specific requirements. The trustee must be a bank or approved person, and account balances must not exceed specified limits. Assets cannot be mixed with other property, ensuring individual nonforfeitable interests. The Catastrophe Savings Account has contribution limits based on deductible amounts. For individuals with deductibles not exceeding $1,000, the limit is $2,000. For those with higher deductibles, the limit is the lesser of $15,000 or twice the deductible amount. Qualified catastrophe expenses are defined as those incurred due to a declared major disaster. The term 'qualified deductible' refers to the annual deductible for an individual's homeowners' insurance policy. A 'qualified rollover contribution' to a Catastrophe Savings Account can be made from another account of the same beneficiary or from a spouse's account, within 60 days of the distribution. Tax Treatment of Distributions from a Catastrophe Savings Account: Distributions are taxable and included in gross income, following the rules of section 72. However, if qualified catastrophe expenses equal or exceed the distributions, they are not taxable. If expenses are less than distributions, the taxable amount is reduced by the excess distributions. The tax on distributions from a Catastrophe Savings Account is increased by 10% if the amount is included in gross income. No additional tax is imposed if the distributions are used for qualified catastrophe expenses. The tax treatment of Catastrophe Savings Accounts includes rules similar to section 408(e) and a 10% tax on excess contributions under section 4973 of the Internal Revenue Code. The tax treatment of Catastrophe Savings Accounts includes rules similar to section 408(e) and a 10% tax on excess contributions under section 4973 of the Internal Revenue Code. A new subsection has been added to define excess contributions for Catastrophe Savings Accounts, and a conforming amendment has been made to the table of parts for subchapter F of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments for Catastrophe Savings Accounts will be effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2006."
