    "content": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers loan guaranty programs, including the flagship 7(a) program, to support small businesses by providing and guaranteeing business loans. The 7(a) program has subprograms like SBAExpress, Export Express, and Community Advantage Pilot with streamlined procedures for specific borrower groups. These programs have unique eligibility requirements, terms, and benefits but operate under the 7(a) program's authorization. The SBA administers loan guaranty programs, including the 7(a) program, to support small businesses. 7(a) loans can be used for various purposes such as establishing a new business, acquiring land, improving a site, purchasing inventory, and refinancing debts. In FY2018, the SBA approved 60,353 7(a) loans totaling nearly $25.4 billion, with an average loan amount of $420,401. The number and amount of approved 7(a) loans have fluctuated over the years. In FY2010 and FY2011, SBA loan guaranty programs declined in FY2012 but have since increased. Congressional interest in the 7(a) loan program has grown due to concerns about small businesses accessing capital to grow and create jobs. Some advocate for more SBA resources to help small businesses, while others worry about increasing the federal deficit and suggest business tax reductions and financial credit market regulation reform. The report discusses the rationale for the 7(a) program, borrower and lender eligibility standards, program statistics, and issues with the program's administration. It also covers congressional and presidential actions to improve small businesses' access to capital, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Small Business Administration received additional funding through various acts like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 to subsidize loan guaranty programs' fees and increase loan guaranty percentages. The Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 2011 extended these subsidies and loan guaranty percentages until March 4, 2011. Several bills were introduced during the 112th Congress to expand small business lending, including S. 1828 to reinstate fee subsidies and increase the loan guaranty percentage for the 7(a) program, H.R. 2936 to extend the maximum loan amount for the SBAExpress program, and S. 532 to provide statutory authorization for the Patriot Express Pilot program. The Patriot Express Pilot Program, with increased loan guaranty percentages and maximum loan amount, was discontinued by the SBA in 2013. During the 113th Congress, the SBA waived fees for smaller 7(a) loans to encourage demand. H.R. 2462 aimed to make fee waivers permanent. Additionally, fee waivers were provided for loans to veterans under the SBAExpress program. In FY2015, the SBA waived fees for veterans on non-SBAExpress 7(a) loans from $150,001 to $5 million. In FY2016 and FY2017, fee waivers were also provided for smaller 7(a) loans and annual service fees for loans under $150,000. Additionally, in FY2016 and FY2017, 50% of the up-front loan guaranty fee was waived for veterans on non-SBAExpress 7(a) loans. In FY2015, the SBA waived fees for veterans on non-SBAExpress 7(a) loans from $150,001 to $5 million. In FY2016 and FY2017, fee waivers were also provided for smaller 7(a) loans and annual service fees for loans under $150,000. The Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015 made permanent the veteran's fee waiver under the SBAExpress program. The act increased the 7(a) program's authorization limit to $23.5 billion in FY2015 and to $26.5 billion in FY2016. The SBA is waiving fees and reducing fees for various 7(a) loans to encourage demand, including waiving the up-front guaranty fee for loans under $125,000 in FY2018, waiving 50% of the fee for loans to veterans from $125,001 to $350,000 in FY2018, and waiving the annual service fee for loans under $150,000 in rural areas or HUBZones in FY2019. In FY2019, the Small Business Administration (SBA) implemented various legislative changes to the 7(a) program, including increasing the authorization limit to $29.0 billion. The Small Business 7(a) Lending Oversight Reform Act of 2018 codified the SBA's Office of Credit Risk Management, required annual risk analysis reports, established a lender oversight committee, and allowed for increased loan amounts up to 115% of the program's limit. The SBA increased the 7(a) program's authorization limit to $29.0 billion in FY2019. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included provisions to make 7(a) loans more accessible to employee-owned small businesses and cooperatives. This act clarified that 7(a) loans to ESOPs may be made under the Preferred Lenders Program and allows the seller to remain involved when the ESOP or cooperative has acquired 100% ownership of the small business. The Small Business Administration (SBA) increased the 7(a) program's authorization limit to $29.0 billion in FY2019. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 made 7(a) loans more accessible to employee-owned small businesses and cooperatives. It allows the seller to remain involved when the ESOP or cooperative has acquired 100% ownership of the small business. President Trump's FY2019 budget proposed changes to offset SBA business loan administrative costs, including setting the 7(a) program's annual servicing fee at rates below zero credit subsidy and increasing certain loan fees. The Trump Administration requested an increase in the 7(a) loan program's authorization limit to $30.0 million in FY2019, along with other changes to better equip the SBA to meet demand. P.L. 116-6 increased the 7(a) program's authorization limit to $30.0 billion in FY2019. The report's Appendix provides a description of the SBA's loan programs. To qualify for an SBA 7(a) loan, businesses must be for-profit, small according to SBA size requirements, demonstrate a need for credit, and be unable to secure reasonable terms without SBA assistance. Applicants must be creditworthy, have a strong business, good character, and sufficient collateral. Borrowers seeking an SBA 7(a) loan must operate on a sound financial basis and demonstrate potential for long-term success. Loan proceeds can be used for various purposes such as establishing a new business, acquiring or expanding an existing business, purchasing land or buildings, improving sites, acquiring fixed assets, financing working capital, and refinancing certain debts. Inadequate collateral will not be the sole reason for denial of a loan request. Borrowers are prohibited from using loan proceeds to refinance. Borrowers seeking an SBA 7(a) loan must operate on a sound financial basis and demonstrate potential for long-term success. Loan proceeds can be used for various purposes such as establishing a new business, acquiring or expanding an existing business, purchasing land or buildings, improving sites, acquiring fixed assets, financing working capital, and refinancing certain debts. The 7(a) loan program has a maximum gross loan amount of $5 million, with the average approved loan amount in FY2018 being $420,401. The SBA 7(a) loan program has a maximum term of 10 years, but can be up to 25 years for real estate or equipment loans. Lenders can charge a fixed or variable interest rate, with maximum rates published by the SBA. In February 2019, maximum fixed interest rates were 13.50% for loans of $25,000 or less, 12.50% for loans over $25,000 but not exceeding $50,000, and 11.50% for larger loans. The SBA 7(a) loan program offers variable interest rates based on loan amounts, with rates ranging from 10.50% for loans over $250,000 to 12.50% for loans over $25,000 but not exceeding $50,000. Collateral requirements vary based on loan size, with lenders needing a first lien on assets for loans exceeding $25,000 up to $350,000. The SBA requires collateral for 7(a) loans, with lenders needing a first lien on assets financed with loan proceeds. Loans exceeding $350,000 must be collateralized to the maximum extent possible. If business assets do not fully secure the loan, the lender must take equity in the principal's personal real estate. The SBA advises lenders not to decline a loan solely based on inadequate collateral. Lenders providing 7(a) loans must have the ability to evaluate, process, and service loans, maintain good character, and be supervised by a regulatory authority. The SBA evaluates lender performance through various measures and started the Preferred Lenders Program in 1983 to streamline procedures. In FY2017, 1,978 lenders provided 7(a) loans. The Preferred Lenders Program (PLP) was established in 1983 to streamline financial assistance to small businesses by delegating credit decisions to selected lenders. In FY2018, PLP lenders approved a significant portion of 7(a) loans, totaling $18.8 billion. Lenders must adhere to SBA eligibility requirements and loan program guidelines. Borrowers submit applications for a 7(a) business loan to private lenders, who review the application and decide if it merits a loan on its own or if it requires an SBA guaranty. The SBA guaranty assures the lender of reimbursement if the borrower defaults, up to a certain percentage. If the lender requires an SBA guaranty, the application is submitted to the SBA's Loan Guaranty Processing Center for approval. The SBA's Loan Guaranty Processing Center (LGPC) processes 7(a) loan guaranty applications for lenders without delegated authority. PLP and express lenders can make credit decisions without SBA review, but SBA reviews their analysis when purchasing the guaranty or conducting a lender review. The SBA now requires non-express 7(a) loans of $350,000 or less to be credit scored through E-Tran. If the credit score is acceptable, PLP lenders can process the loan under delegated authority. If not, the loan must be submitted to the SBA for approval with a full credit write-up. Maintenance of documentation by PLP lenders is required for SBA review. The lender must refer the loan to the LGPC for review if not a PLP lender or if the loan is not eligible for PLP delegated authority. SBA documentation required for 7(a) standard loans of $350,000 or less includes Form 1919 for borrower information. Form 912 is required for borrowers with recent criminal history or convictions, and includes disclosures such as number of employees, jobs to be created, and jobs retained. Form 912 is required for borrowers with recent criminal history or convictions, providing details about the offense(s) and authorizing the SBA's Office of Inspector General to request criminal record information. Form 159 is necessary if a borrower or lender uses a packager, broker, accountant, or lawyer for loan application assistance, disclosing identifying information and fees paid. Form 601 is required for borrowers using over $10,000 of loan proceeds for construction, ensuring compliance with anti-discrimination laws. Form 1920 is for lenders applying for guaranty in SBA 7(a) programs, providing details about the loan type, terms, and business information. The PLP lenders complete a form with details about the business, applicant's character, availability of credit elsewhere, type of business, conflicts of interest, and job creation. Other lenders must submit this form electronically to the LGPC. Verification of Alien Status is required before submitting the application to the SBA. Lender's Credit Memorandum for loans up to $350,000 includes business history, management description, debt service coverage ratio, financial data reconciliation, and IRS transcripts. The Lender's Credit Memorandum for loans exceeding $350,000 includes reconciled financial data, owner/guarantor analysis, life insurance requirements, credit analysis, business valuation for change of ownership, and analysis of collateral and financial statements. It also includes cash flow projections on a monthly basis. Cash Flow Projections are required for all new businesses and for 7(a) standard loans exceeding $350,000. Form 413 (Personal Financial Statement) and Form 1846 (Statement Regarding Lobbying) are also necessary for loan applications. The lender must submit a Standard Form LLL \"Disclosure of Lobbying Activities\" and IRS Form 4506-T. Verification of IRS Form 4506-T is required for nondelegated lenders before submitting the application to the SBA. Business Financial Statements or tax returns within 180 days of submission include year-end balance sheets, profit and loss statements for the last three years, reconciliation of net worth, interim balance sheet, and profit and loss statements. The application to the SBA requires submission of affiliate and subsidiary financial statements or tax returns, a lease agreement, a schedule of collateral, a list of machinery and equipment being purchased with the loan proceeds, real estate appraisal and environmental investigation reports if applicable, and documentation for purchasing an existing business. The SBA application requires submission of various documents including a buy-sell agreement, business valuation, financial statements, and evidence of equity injection. Proper evidence of equity injection may include a copy of a check or escrow settlement sheet. The SBA charges lenders upfront and annual fees for 7(a) loans, with fees varying based on loan amount and maturity. Guaranty fees must be paid within specific time frames to avoid cancellation. Short-term loan guaranty fees can be passed on to borrowers. The SBA charges lenders upfront and annual fees for 7(a) loans, with fees varying based on loan amount and maturity. Lenders can charge guaranty fees to borrowers for short-term loans and after initial disbursement for longer-term loans. Lenders can retain 25% of the guaranty fee on loans of $150,000 or less. The annual service fee cannot exceed 0.55% of the outstanding balance of the SBA's share of the loan. The SBA waived its annual service fee for all 7(a) loans of $150,000 or less approved from FY2014 through FY2016. The SBA waived annual service fees for small businesses in rural areas or HUBZones for 7(a) loans of $150,000 or less in FY2019. They also waived guaranty fees for loans approved in previous fiscal years and reduced fees for loans in rural areas or HUBZones in FY2019. Table 1 displays the fees for 7(a) loans in FY2019. The SBA waived guaranty fees for veteran loans under the 7(a) SBAExpress program from 2014 to FY2019. They also waived 50% of the guaranty fee for non-SBAExpress 7(a) loans for veterans in various fiscal years. In FY2018, the Obama Administration waived guaranty fees on non-SBAExpress 7(a) loans of $125,001 to $350,000 for veterans to promote lending to small businesses with credit constraints. Loans of $150,000 or less accounted for a small percentage of total 7(a) loan approvals in previous fiscal years. The Small Business Administration (SBA) reduced guaranty fees for 7(a) loans in FY2014-2017 to increase access to capital for small businesses. Congress questioned the practice of subsidizing smaller loans with fees from larger loans. Lenders can charge reasonable fees for services. The lender must inform the applicant in writing that they are not obligated to pay for unnecessary services. Fees charged are subject to SBA review and any unreasonable fees must be refunded. Additional fees may be charged with SBA approval for loans with special servicing needs, not exceeding 2% per year. Out-of-pocket expenses such as filing fees, appraisals, and other direct charges related to loan closing can be collected from the applicant. The lender is prohibited from requiring the borrower to pay certain fees for goods and services as a condition for obtaining an SBA guaranteed loan. They can charge a late payment fee not exceeding 5% of the regular loan payment when the borrower is delinquent. A subsidy recoupment fee must be paid to the SBA if the borrower prepays 25% or more of the loan in any one year during the first three years. The total number and amount of SBA 7(a) loans approved fluctuated in recent years, with increases in FY2010 and FY2011. The decrease in loans approved in FY2008 and FY2009 was attributed to reduced demand during the recession and tightened loan standards by lenders. Loan disbursements may be higher than approvals due to borrowers declining the loan for various reasons. The SBA attributed the increased number of loans approved in FY2010 and FY2011 to legislation that temporarily reduced loan fees and increased loan guaranty percentage to 90%. The increase in loans approved since FY2012 is attributed to improving economic conditions. The small business credit market's precise measurements are not available, but the SBA estimated its size. The SBA estimated the small business credit market to be around $1.2 trillion, with the 7(a) program's unpaid balance at $92.41 billion in FY2018. The goal is to achieve a zero subsidy rate for loan guaranty programs. Loan guaranty fees and recoveries did not cover loan losses from FY2010 onwards. The SBA struggled to cover loan losses in the 7(a) and 504/CDC loan guaranty programs from FY2010 through FY2015, requiring appropriations to address shortfalls. Congress did not approve appropriations for credit subsidies in FY2016 through FY2019. In FY2017, the SBA spent $82.2 million on 7(a) program administrative expenses, with anticipated expenses of $82.2 million in FY2018 and $84.5 million in FY2019. In FY2017, borrowers used 7(a) loan proceeds for various purposes including purchasing land, buying businesses, financing working capital, paying off loans, constructing buildings, purchasing equipment, and other expenses. A study by the Urban Institute in 2008 surveyed SBA loan guaranty borrowers who rated their satisfaction with their 7(a) loans positively. The SBA anticipated spending $36.9 million in FY2018 and $36.6 million in FY2019 for lender oversight of its lending programs. In FY2018, 32.8% of 7(a) loan approvals were to minority-owned businesses, with 23.0% going to Asian-owned businesses and 6.0% to women-owned businesses. The survey found that 18% rated their satisfaction with the loan as excellent, 50% as good, 20% as fair, and 6% as poor. Additionally, 90% reported the loan was important to their business success. In FY2018, 32.8% of 7(a) loan approvals were to minority-owned businesses, with 23.0% going to Asian-owned businesses and 6.0% to women-owned businesses. The Urban Institute's comparative analysis showed that SBA's loan programs target creditworthy borrowers who may not qualify for conventional loans, leading to more loans to minority-owned, women-owned, and start-up businesses compared to conventional loans. The 7(a) and 504 loan programs provide larger amounts of credit to firms facing capital gaps, aligning with SBA's goal. Congressional interest in these programs has grown due to concerns about small businesses accessing sufficient capital for economic recovery. Laws have been enacted to increase capital supply and demand for businesses, such as the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 authorized the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) with a $700 billion fund to purchase troubled assets. The Dodd-Frank Act later reduced the TARP purchase authority to $475 billion, with the Treasury Department ending new commitments by October 3, 2010. Approximately $430 billion has been disbursed, including $370 million for SBA 7(a) loan guaranty program securities. The SBA received additional funding of $730 million for various programs, including fee reductions and loan modifications in the 7(a) and 504/CDC loan guaranty programs. The maximum loan guaranty percentage was increased to 90% for standard 7(a) loans. Additional funding was provided through the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 and the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 2011 to extend fee subsidies and the 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage. The Small Business Administration (SBA) received additional funding of $730 million for fee reductions and loan modifications in the 7(a) and 504/CDC loan guaranty programs. The funding was used to extend fee subsidies and the 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through March 4, 2011. However, funding was exhausted on January 3, 2011. The Obama Administration credited the funding for improving small business lending and creating jobs, while critics argued for small business tax reduction and financial credit market reform. The SBA's Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Government Accountability Office reported deficiencies in the SBA's administration of its loan guaranty programs. The SBA's oversight of its loan guaranty programs has been criticized by the OIG and GAO for deficiencies, including issues with 7(a) lenders and lack of performance measures. The OIG's FY2001 list of management challenges highlighted SBA lender oversight, leading to improvements such as the establishment of the Office of Lender Oversight. The SBA has made progress in enhancing lender oversight by developing a strategic plan and implementing a comprehensive loan monitoring system. The SBA implemented a loan monitoring system to evaluate lender performance by collecting data on delinquency rates, default rates, liquidations, loan payments, and originations. Additionally, in 2008, the SBA issued an SOP for 7(a) lender oversight, establishing uniform policies and procedures for evaluating lender performance. The SBA's Office of Financial Program Operations (OFPO) implemented a comprehensive quality control program to evaluate lender performance and ensure compliance with loan program requirements. This program aims to improve service, reduce waste, fraud, and abuse by monitoring centers' adherence to statutory, regulatory, and procedural requirements. Additionally, the SBA conducts risk-based off-site analysis of lending partners through its Loan/Lender Monitoring System. The SBA improved its monitoring of lending partners through the Loan/Lender Monitoring System by developing risk profiles, lender performance thresholds, and a new risk rating model. In 2013-2014, they enhanced corrective action verification procedures and implemented a system for oversight results. In 2015, the Office of Credit Risk Management engaged contractor support for corrective action expansion. In 2016, the Office of Credit Risk Management conducted 147 corrective action follow-up assessments and established performance measures for the SBA's lending portfolio. The OIG continues to highlight lender oversight as a significant management challenge for the SBA, emphasizing the need for improved risk management practices. The portfolio risk management program supports risk-based decisions, implements controls to mitigate risks, tracks loan agents effectively, and updates regulations. GAO argues that the 7(a) program's performance measures provide limited information on the impact of loans on small businesses. The current measures do not show how well the agency is meeting its goal of helping small businesses succeed. The SBA's OIG has also raised concerns about the Microloan program's performance. The SBA's OIG has raised concerns about the Microloan program's performance measures, stating that they do not ensure that microloan borrowers are truly assisted by the program. They argue that without appropriate metrics, the SBA cannot ensure the program is meeting policy goals. The OIG found that the program's performance measures are based on the number of microloans funded, the number of small businesses assisted, and the program's loan loss rate. They also noted that the SBA does not track the number of microloan borrowers who remain in business after receiving a loan to measure the loans' impact on success. The SBA formed an impact evaluation working group to develop additional performance metrics for the microloan program, aiming to measure its success in assisting borrowers in establishing and maintaining successful small businesses. The SBA has established a program evaluation framework to gather outcome-rich data and plans to enhance analytical capabilities, collaboration, and use of impact evaluations. They have created an annual Enterprise Learning Agenda to promote evidence-based evaluations and continuous learning among program managers. The SBA conducts evaluations of programs to increase 7(a) loans. Congress authorized changes to the 7(a) program, including temporarily subsidizing fees and increasing the loan guaranty percentage to 90%. The Obama Administration proposed various modifications to SBA programs, including increasing the maximum loan sizes for 7(a) and 504/CDC loans, raising the limits for microloans and lenders in the Microloan program, temporarily increasing the cap on SBAExpress loans, and allowing refinancing of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans nearing maturity. The Obama Administration proposed increasing maximum loan limits for SBA programs to support larger projects and help small businesses drive economic growth. Critics raised concerns about higher default risks and potential need for additional funding. Some advocated for modest increases in loan limits to focus on startup and early-stage small firms, while others suggested creating a direct lending program within the SBA for small businesses. Critics warned against providing additional resources to the SBA or modifying existing loan programs. The SBA's loan programs are seen as ineffective in improving small businesses' access to capital. Instead, focus should be on small business tax reduction, financial credit market regulation reform, and federal fiscal restraint. In 2009, ARRA allocated $730 million for SBA programs, including reducing fees and increasing loan guaranty percentages. The Small Business Administration (SBA) made changes to its loan programs, including increasing the maximum loan sizes for 7(a) and 504/CDC loans, temporarily raising the cap on SBAExpress loans, and increasing the maximum loan size for the Microloan program. These changes were part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) in 2009, which allocated $730 million for SBA programs to improve small businesses' access to capital. The Small Business Administration (SBA) increased the maximum loan sizes for 7(a) and 504/CDC programs, with an interim size standard of $15 million tangible net worth and $5 million average net income. Additionally, 504/CDC loans were allowed to refinance up to $7.5 billion in short-term commercial real estate debt annually for two years. The SBA also established a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) and a $1.5 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative to support small business loans and capital access programs. The Small Business Administration (SBA) increased loan sizes for 7(a) and 504/CDC programs, allowing refinancing of short-term commercial real estate debt. Congress did not approve changes to the 7(a) program during the 112th Congress, but bills were introduced to increase small business lending and reinstate temporary fee subsidies. The Small Business Administration extended loan sizes for various programs, including the SBAExpress program. Legislation introduced in 2011 aimed to increase the maximum loan amount for the SBAExpress program from $350,000 to $1 million for an additional year. Another bill sought to provide statutory authorization for the Patriot Express Pilot Program, which was later discontinued in 2013. The bill introduced in 2013 aimed to increase the SBA's maximum loan amount to $1 million and adjust guaranty percentages. H.R. 2451, the Strengthening Entrepreneurs' Economic Development Act, proposed direct loans up to $150,000 for businesses with fewer than 20 employees. H.R. 2461, the SBA Loan Paperwork Reduction Act, focused on reducing paperwork for SBA loans. The SBA Loan Paperwork Reduction Act of 2013 aimed to streamline the application process for 7(a) loans up to $350,000 through the Small Loan Advantage pilot program. The program started in 2011 and became the model for processing smaller loans effective January 1, 2014. The Obama Administration waived fees for loans under $150,000 in FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016. The Acceleration Act of 2013 aimed to make the fee waiver permanent for veteran loans under the SBAExpress program. Various acts and programs, such as the Veterans Entrepreneurship Act and P.L. 114-38, authorized and made permanent the waiver of the up-front loan guaranty fee for veterans in the SBAExpress program. The SBA requested an increase in the 7(a) loan program's authorization limit to $22.5 billion in FY2015 due to high demand, leading to the suspension of 7(a) program lending on July 23, 2015. The SBA suspended 7(a) program lending due to high demand, but continued to process loan applications up to approval, placing them in a queue for future funding. 7(a) lending resumed on July 28, 2015, after P.L. 114-38's enactment, which increased the program's authorization limit for FY2015 and added requirements to prevent SBA loans from displacing private sector loans. The SBA may not guarantee a 7(a) loan if the lender's liquidity depends on selling the guaranteed portion on the secondary market or if the guarantee is solely to exceed the legal lending limit. The SBA is required to report 7(a) program statistics quarterly to Congress, including lending pace, authorization limit estimates, early defaults, and SBA actions. P.L. 114-113 increased the program's authorization limit to $26.5 billion for FY2016. The SBA's authorization limit for 7(a) loans increased to $26.5 billion for FY2016. P.L. 114-223 allowed the SBA to use funds to meet increased demand for loans. S. 2496 proposed allowing loans up to 110% of the authorization limit if demand exceeded it. The Obama Administration requested authorization for the SBA Administrator to issue loans beyond the limit if demand exceeds it. S. 2992, the Small Business Lending Oversight Act of 2016, proposed penalties for 7(a) lenders engaging in specified activities, required annual risk analysis reports, redefined credit elsewhere requirement, and authorized fees for OCRM operations. The SBA extended the Community Advantage Pilot program through March 31, 2020, to support small businesses. Legislation was introduced to provide permanent authorization for the program. Congress increased 7(a) loan approvals in FY2017 through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 and 2018 increased the 7(a) program's authorization limit. The Small Business 7(a) Lending Oversight Reform Act of 2018 codified the SBA's Office of Credit Risk Management and implemented various provisions to enhance oversight of the program. The SBA Administrator can increase 7(a) loans up to 115% of the program's limit once a year with 30 days' notice to Congress. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 made 7(a) loans more accessible to ESOPs and cooperatives by allowing \"back-to-back\" loans to ESOPs. The Small Business Administration (SBA) has made changes to allow 7(a) loans to Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) under the Preferred Lenders Program. Sellers can now remain involved after an ESOP or cooperative acquires 100% ownership of a small business. The SBA can finance transition costs to employee ownership and waive mandatory equity injections. Outreach programs will be created to make lending programs more accessible to ESOPs and cooperatives, along with a promotion program for technical assistance and training on transitioning to employee ownership. The Trump Administration proposed changes in the FY2019 budget request for the Small Business Administration (SBA) to introduce counter-cyclical policies and update fee structures in business loan programs. This included raising additional revenue by adjusting fees in the 7(a) loan program, increasing the upfront loan guarantee fee, and raising the program's authorization limit to $30.0 million in FY2019. The SBA proposed increasing the 7(a) loan program's authorization amount by 15% in FY2019, imposing an annual fee on outstanding balances, and raising the SBAExpress program's loan limit to $1 million. P.L. 116-6 increased the 7(a) program's authorization limit to $30.0 billion in FY2019. Congressional debate focused on enhancing small businesses' access to capital and job creation during the 111th Congress. Some Members of Congress argued for additional resources for the SBA to help small businesses access capital for job creation. Others advocated for business tax reduction and fiscal restraint to promote economic growth. Specific program changes were proposed to enhance job creation by improving access to credit for 7(a) borrowers. The 2008 Urban Institute study found that specific changes in federal policy may not significantly increase sales or employment among firms receiving SBA financing. Factors such as local economic conditions, zoning regulations, tax rates, and business owner's skills also play a role in business success after receiving SBA financing. The Urban Institute study suggests that measuring the 7(a) program's impact on job retention and creation is complex due to various influencing factors. Recommendations include adopting outcome performance-oriented measures like tracking the number of borrowers remaining in business post-loan. Congress could also consider surveying borrowers to assess the program's contribution to job creation and business expansion. The SBA's 7(a) program offers specialized loan programs like SBAExpress for small businesses to access credit easily. Approved lenders can use existing procedures with reduced SBA guaranty on loans up to $350,000. In 2020, 27,794 SBAExpress loans were approved, totaling $1.98 billion. In FY2018, 27,794 SBAExpress loans were approved, totaling $1.98 billion. The program's higher loan amount in FY2011 was due to a provision in the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. Loan proceeds can be used for various purposes like expansion, renovation, and working capital. The SBAExpress loan program allows for debt restructuring up to 50% of the project, with loan terms similar to the 7(a) program. Lenders have a 36-hour turnaround time for approval, and collateral is not required for loans under $25,000. The SBA waived loan guaranty fees for 7(a) loans under $125,000 in FY2018 and 50% of fees for non-SBAExpress 7(a) loans to veterans between $125,001 to $350,000. The Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015 made the veteran's fee waiver in the SBAExpress program permanent. The SBA has waived fees for veterans in FY2016, FY2017, FY2018, and FY2019 as part of efforts to support veteran entrepreneurs. The SBA discontinued the Patriot Express Pilot Program on December 31, 2013, which provided loans of up to $500,000 to veterans and their spouses. The program had streamlined documentation requirements and disbursed 9,414 loans totaling over $791 million. The Export Express program, established in 1998, aims to increase credit availability for small businesses. The Export Express program aims to increase credit availability for small business exporters in operation for at least 12 months.

The SBA approved 59 Export Express loans totaling $15.45 million in FY2018. The Community Advantage 7(a) loan initiative aims to increase lending to underserved low- and moderate-income communities. As of September 12, 2018, there were 113 approved CA lenders actively making and servicing CA loans. The CA loan initiative aims to increase lending to underserved communities by providing loan terms similar to the 7(a) program, with expedited approval process and maximum interest rate of prime plus 6%. It targets community-based financial institutions to offer SBA loans. Development Financial Institutions certified by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, SBA's Certified Development Companies, SBA's nonprofit microlending intermediaries, and SBA's Intermediary Lending Pilot Program intermediaries are required to maintain 60% of their SBA loan portfolio in underserved markets. This includes loans to small businesses in low-to-moderate income communities, Empowerment Zones, HUBZones, start-ups, businesses eligible for the SBA's Veterans Advantage program, Promise Zones, Opportunity Zones, and Rural Areas. The SBA implemented a moratorium on new CA lender applications starting October 1, 2018, to reduce the risk of loan defaults. Additionally, the SBA raised the minimum acceptable credit score. The SBA increased requirements for CA loans, including raising the minimum credit score to 140, extending the wait time for lenders, increasing the number of initial dispersed loans, raising the loan loss reserve requirement, modifying debt refinancing requirements, limiting lender fees, and adding Opportunity Zones. The SBA approved 1,118 CA loans totaling $157.5 million in FY2018 and 4,906 CA loans totaling $643.72 million since the program began. Legislation was introduced to make the Community Advantage Pilot program permanent."
