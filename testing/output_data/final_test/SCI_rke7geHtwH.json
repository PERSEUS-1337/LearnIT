    "content": "Off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms are useful when only a fixed dataset of environment interactions is available. Standard off-policy algorithms often fail in continuous control settings, but a proposed solution involves using a learned prior called the advantage-weighted behavior model (ABM) to bias the RL policy towards successful actions. This method improves performance in various RL tasks, including continuous control benchmarks and multi-task learning. Batch reinforcement learning (RL) involves learning a policy from a fixed dataset without collecting new data through interaction with the environment, which is especially useful in domains where gathering new data is costly, such as robotics applications. Batch RL is a powerful solution in settings where gathering new data is expensive. Off-policy algorithms designed for handling data from a behavior policy different from the one being learned can be challenging in continuous control domains. Fujimoto et al. (2018) found that naive application of off-policy methods in batch RL can lead to significantly worse performance than the original policy. The key challenge lies in exploiting data information thoroughly while avoiding overvaluing state-action sequences not present in the dataset. In batch reinforcement learning, problems arise when the provided data contains behavioral trajectories from different policies that may not align with the target task. Previous adaptations for off-policy learning can be misled by consistent behavioral patterns that are not relevant to the task at hand. This situation is more detrimental than learning from noisy or random data. In batch reinforcement learning, problems arise when the provided data contains behavioral trajectories from different policies that may not align with the target task. Previous adaptations for off-policy learning can be misled by consistent behavioral patterns that are not relevant to the task at hand. To address this issue, the proposal suggests restricting solutions to 'stay close to the relevant data' by learning a prior that focuses on relevant trajectories and enforcing the policy improvement step to stay close to the learned prior policy. This approach enables stable learning from conflicting data sources and shows improvements on competitive baselines in various RL tasks. In reinforcement learning, utilizing an appropriate prior stabilizes learning and simplifies the algorithm. The environment is modeled as a Markov decision process with continuous states and actions, and transition probability distribution describing system dynamics evolution over time. This approach results in improvements on competitive baselines in various RL tasks. Reinforcement learning aims to find a policy that maximizes cumulative rewards by considering system dynamics and state-visitation distribution. The policy is parameterized by \u03b8 and can be optimized for multiple tasks with their own reward functions. In batch RL, a dataset D \u00b5 is given for learning. In batch RL, a dataset D \u00b5 is provided containing trajectory snippets. The reward function is accessible for the task of interest. The dataset is filled by behavior policies prior to training. To stabilize off-policy RL, the learned policy needs to be restricted to the support of the empirical state-conditional action distribution. In batch RL, a dataset D \u00b5 is provided containing trajectory snippets. The learned policy needs to be restricted to the support of the empirical state-conditional action distribution to stabilize off-policy RL. This is achieved through a policy iteration procedure where the policy is constrained in the improvement step. In batch RL, a dataset D \u00b5 is provided containing trajectory snippets. The policy iteration procedure ensures closeness to the empirical state-conditional action distribution of the batch. Policy evaluation and improvement are done via gradient descent steps while holding \u03c0 and Q \u03c0i fixed using target networks. The task action-value function is learned by minimizing the squared temporal difference error for a given reward. The expectation required to calculate V \u03c0i (s) is approximated with M samples. The use of policy evaluation differs from the Q-learning approach pursued in previous works. In batch RL, a dataset D \u00b5 is provided with trajectory snippets. Policy iteration ensures closeness to the empirical state-conditional action distribution. Policy evaluation and improvement are done via gradient descent steps while holding \u03c0 and Q \u03c0i fixed using target networks. The task action-value function is learned by minimizing the squared temporal difference error for a given reward. The expectation to calculate V \u03c0i (s) is approximated with M samples. The policy improvement step involves solving a constrained optimization problem with a behavior model as a prior policy to keep the policy close to the actions found in D \u00b5.

The policy improvement step involves solving a constrained optimization problem with a behavior model as a prior policy to keep the policy close to the actions found in D \u00b5. To learn a prior alongside policy optimization, a behavior model can be used to simplify the algorithm by skipping the policy improvement step if the prior is good enough. The behavior model is learned by maximizing the log likelihood of observed data with parameters \u03b8 bm. Regularizing towards the behavior model can prevent the use of unobserved actions but may also hinder policy improvement over the behavior in D \u00b5. In batch RL, a dataset D \u00b5 is provided with trajectory snippets. Policy iteration ensures closeness to the empirical state-conditional action distribution. To address datasets with diverse trajectories, a second learned prior, the advantage-weighted behavior model, \u03c0 abm, biases the RL policy towards actions supported by D \u00b5 and beneficial for the current task. This maximizes the objective function to improve policy performance. The objective in batch RL is to maximize the log likelihood of observed actions by focusing on \"good\" actions through advantage weighting, which filters out poor actions over time to improve policy performance. The advantage-weighted behavior model biases the RL policy towards actions supported by the dataset, enhancing policy iteration. In batch RL, the advantage-weighted behavior model biases the policy towards actions supported by the dataset, improving performance over time. The policy converges to the best trajectory snippets in the data without importance weighting for off-policy data, creating a broad prior that only considers actions present in the dataset. Different functions for f, such as exponentiation, did not significantly impact the results in experiments. The optimization of Equation 2 can be done using various schemes, including an EM-style optimization or directly using stochastic methods. The MPO algorithm optimizes Equation 2 using a two-step procedure. The optimal policy \u03c0 can be expressed as a distribution that can be sampled from using samples from \u03c0 prior. The parametric policy is learned by minimizing the KL divergence and maximizing the weighted log likelihood via gradient descent with a trust-region constraint. Alternatively, stochastic value gradient optimization can be used. The text discusses using Langrangian relaxation to optimize Equation 2 for gradient descent, alternating steps on \u03b8 and \u03b7, and sampling Q-values through re-parameterization. It also mentions off-policy RL algorithms with function approximators for batch RL convergence. In batch RL, convergence properties are analyzed for bootstrapping errors in approximate dynamic programming and policy iteration. While stable algorithms exist for linear function approximation, non-linear function approximators face challenges in continuous action domains. Off-policy algorithms struggle in fixed batch settings, with some success reported in discrete domains. In the fixed batch setting, approximators fail due to extrapolation or bootstrapping errors in estimating Q-values, leading to suboptimal behavior. Previous algorithms suggest correcting overly optimistic Q-values and restricting unlikely actions in the policy. In the fixed batch setting, algorithms aim to correct overly optimistic Q-values and restrict unlikely actions in the policy. This is achieved through Bellman updates and a generative model of actions, along with Clipped Double-Q learning or an ensemble of Q-networks to penalize uncertainty in the Q-values. The policy is constrained to stay close to the data by considering only actions sampled from the perturbed generative model or the constrained policy during execution. Our work is based on a policy iteration scheme instead of Q-learning, where we directly learn a parametric policy for execution. We estimate the Q-function as part of the policy evaluation step with standard TD-0 backups. The policy is constrained to remain close to the adaptive prior, which can adapt to the task at hand, making this constraint work well in empirical evaluation. Our policy iteration scheme is constrained to remain close to an adaptive prior, which can adapt to the task at hand. This constraint works well in empirical evaluation and is related to trust-region optimization in action space. Other works have focused on policy priors optimized for multi-task or transfer-learning setups. The constrained updates in policy optimization enforce a trust region constraint on the advantage weighted behavior distribution, different from conservative updates. Experimental results show improved performance and stability in learning with learned priors on continuous control tasks. In a study on continuous control tasks, the algorithm is compared to off-policy baselines on tasks from the DeepMind control suite and learning multiple tasks involving manipulation of blocks using a robot arm in simulation. The same networks are used for all algorithms, optimized with Adam, and proprioceptive features are utilized. The experiments were conducted in both simulation and on a real robot. In a study on continuous control tasks, the algorithm is compared to off-policy baselines on tasks from the DeepMind control suite and learning multiple tasks involving manipulation of blocks using a robot arm in simulation. The algorithms were implemented in the same framework, with variations in update rules. For the multi-task setting, a task conditional policy and Q-function were learned, with task identifier provided as an additional network input. Experiments were conducted on tasks like Cheetah, Hopper, and Quadruped from the DeepMind control suite. Data for offline learning experiments was obtained by generating a fixed dataset using MPO and separating it into two sets. The high data regime uses 10,000 episodes per seed, while the low-quality data regime uses 2,000 episodes per seed. The high data regime has more data and higher quality policies. Learning curves for tasks \"bring to corner\" and \"bring to center\" are shown in Figure 4. Offline learning experiments involve reloading data into a replay buffer, with a fixed dataset and no new transitions added. The learner evaluates performance by testing policies in the environment without receiving any data on their performance. Standard off-policy RL algorithms can learn some tasks offline with enough data, but stability is an issue. A simple method combining policy iteration with a behavior model prior performs as well as more complex baselines. Further improvements can be made using advantage weighted behavior. The advantage weighted behavior model (ABM) outperforms the behavior model (BM) on tasks with conflicting trajectories like Hopper. ABM performs as well as or better than baseline methods in control-suite domains. Training only an ABM prior can achieve competitive performance in simple domains, providing a simpler method when maximum performance is not necessary. In a multi-task setting, a Sawyer robot arm is simulated in Mujoco to manipulate blocks in various tasks. Data is generated by running MPO to learn task-conditional policies for seven tasks, with data collected by randomly switching tasks after each episode. In a multi-task setting, data was collected by randomly switching tasks after each episode with random resets of the robot position every 20 episodes. Behavioral modelling priors improved performance of MPO across all tasks compared to standard MPO, especially in more challenging tasks. The ABM+MPO achieved high performance due to the sequential nature of the tasks. The ABM+MPO achieves high performance across all tasks, even outperforming the prior RL policy. New tasks can be learned from previously recorded data, as demonstrated successfully with ABM+MPO. This approach shows promise for fast learning in real-robot experiments. Our approach, ABM with MPO as the optimizer, successfully re-learns all seven tasks on a real Sawyer arm robot using offline learning from collected data in less than 12 hours. This demonstrates the feasibility of fast learning in real-robot experiments. In this work, stable learning from logged experience with off-policy RL algorithms is explored. The approach involves using a learned prior to model behavior distribution in the data, allowing for regularization of the RL algorithm policy. This method is robust to sub-optimal data and outperforms strong baselines on standard continuous tasks. The algorithm presented in Algorithm 1 outlines a procedure for stable learning from logged experience with off-policy RL algorithms. It includes steps for sampling trajectories, computing gradients for prior models, Q, \u03c0, and \u03b7, and updating parameters. This approach is robust to sub-optimal data and performs well on standard continuous control benchmarks. The implementation of the policy improvement step in the algorithm involves using different update rules depending on the policy optimizer (MPO or SVG). The optimal non-parametric policy respecting the KL constraint is described, with details on estimating Z based on samples drawn for each state. The optimization process involves sampling M actions from the prior distribution for each state, using these samples to optimize for a parameter \u03b7 with Adam optimizer. The optimization starts with \u03b7 = 3 for stability and projects \u03b7 to positive numbers after each gradient step. The optimization process involves sampling actions from the prior distribution to optimize the parameter \u03b7. The procedure ensures positive values for \u03b7 and fulfills KL constraints well. The same batch and action samples are used for optimizing policy parameters \u03b8 by minimizing KL divergence. To prevent quick convergence, a trust region constraint is employed, adjusting the objective function to include KL regularization towards the previous policy. The optimization process involves sampling actions from the prior distribution to optimize the parameter \u03b7 with a trust region constraint. Alternating gradient descent steps are taken using Adam, projecting \u03b1 back to the positive regime if needed. The policy parameters \u03b8 are optimized via stochastic value gradient under KL constraints. The optimization process involves sampling actions from the prior distribution to optimize the parameter \u03b7 with a trust region constraint. The policy parameters \u03b8 are optimized via stochastic value gradient under KL constraints, using the reparameterization trick for obtaining samples from the Gaussian policies. The optimization process involves sampling actions from the prior distribution to optimize the parameter \u03b7 with a trust region constraint. Gradient steps are taken alternately for \u03b7 and \u03b8 using Adam, with hyperparameters specified for different experiments. BCQ and BEAR algorithms were re-implemented for strong off-policy learning baselines. We re-implemented BCQ and BEAR algorithms for off-policy learning baselines, optimizing parameters with Adam. Ensembling of Q-functions was not used to avoid bias in comparisons. BCQ perturbative actions were generated with a range of [0.25, 0.25]. For the DDPG trained network, perturbative actions were generated with a range of [0.25, 0.25]. A latent dimensionality of 64 was chosen for the VAE. BEAR used a KL constraint instead of maximum mean discrepancy. The same optimization for the Langragian multiplier was used for both BEAR and the method described. The task setup for simulated and real robot experiments is detailed, with a description of the robot setup provided in a separate paper. The tasks were not specifically contributed for this paper but used as an evaluation test-bed. The robot used in the experiments is a Sawyer robotic arm with a Robotiq 2F-85 parallel gripper, interacting with a basket containing three cubes. Cameras track the cube using augmented reality tags. The tasks are modeled as an MDP using proprioceptive information and cube tracking data. Network parameters for multitask experiments include separate \"heads\" for each task selected based on a one-hot task vector. The architecture for the robot experiments includes separate \"heads\" for each task selected based on a one-hot task vector. Transitions are duplicated in replay for each task. Tolerance functions are defined with outputs scaled between 0 and 1. Additional experimental results show that the learned advantage weighted behavior model is superior to the standard behavior model, leading to less constrained RL policies. Full results for the simulated robot stacking task, including all 7 intentions, are presented. The simple behavioral model performs well on reaching and lifting tasks, but struggles with more difficult stacking tasks due to conflicting data. ABM provides a performance boost, especially for challenging tasks like block stacking and quadruped, with further improvement from the RL policy. The final performance of all methods on control suite tasks and simulated robotics tasks is shown in Tables 6 and 7 for comparison between algorithms. In additional experiments, omitting the policy improvement step and setting \u03c0 i+1 = \u03c0 prior (i.e. = 0) while learning the Q-values of the prior roughly recovers the performance of ABM+MPO. This simpler algorithm option may result in some performance loss, especially on complex domains. The setting ABM ( = 0, |\u03c4 | = 2) in the table requires choosing short trajectory snippets to allow \u03c0 prior to select the best action in each state."
