    "title": "SB 1143",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 208.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code defines \"juvenile facility\" and \"minor\" for the purpose of the section. A juvenile facility includes various types of facilities used for the confinement of minors or wards, while a minor is defined as a person under 18 years of age or under the maximum age of juvenile court jurisdiction who is confined in a juvenile facility. Room confinement is the placement of a minor or ward in a locked sleeping room with minimal contact. It should only be used after other options have been exhausted, unless there is a safety threat. Room confinement should not be used for punishment, coercion, convenience, or retaliation by staff. It should not compromise the mental and physical health of the minor or ward. They can be held up to four hours in room confinement, after which staff must either return them to general population, consult with mental health or medical staff, or develop an individualized plan for reintegration. If room confinement needs to be extended beyond four hours, specific steps must be taken by staff. If room confinement is extended beyond four hours, staff must document the reason, develop a reintegration plan, and obtain authorization every four hours. This section does not apply to minors in court holding or adult facilities and does not limit the use of single-person rooms for housing minors. No conflict with laws providing greater protections to minors is intended. During emergencies like natural disasters or threats, this section does not apply, allowing for necessary deviations from normal operations to address imminent risks. This section exempts minors or wards from being placed in locked cells or sleep rooms for medical reasons with written approval from a licensed physician or nurse practitioner. It does not apply during emergencies or when extended care is needed after medical treatment. The section will be effective on January 1, 2018. If the Commission on State Mandates finds that this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be provided according to the Government Code."
