    "content": "Interest in electric power storage (EPS) is increasing due to technological advancements, making it a practical way to integrate renewable power into the grid. This report discusses technical, regulatory, and policy issues related to EPS implementation, including barriers to deployment and areas of congressional interest. It also mentions power plants, transmission lines, and distribution lines as key components of the electric power system. Generating plants produce electricity using combustible fuels like coal, natural gas, and biomass, or non-combustible sources like wind, solar, and nuclear. Transmission lines carry electricity from power plants to demand centers, with higher voltage lines carrying more power. Policy discussions focus on high-voltage networks for long-distance power movement. Step-down transformers reduce voltage near customers for final delivery through low-voltage distribution lines. EPS can be used throughout the power system, with references to megawatts and megawatt-hours. Capacity and energy output are key concepts in the power industry. A megawatt measures a unit's capacity, while a megawatt-hour measures its energy output. Capacity is the potential output of a unit, while energy is the actual electricity generated or released. Units are typically expressed in kilowatts or megawatts. For example, a 1,000 MW power plant can generate 8.76 million Mwh in a year. EPS systems are evaluated based on their capacity to energy ratios. The storage of electricity involves converting it to another form like kinetic energy in a flywheel or potential energy in pumped water. EPS technologies, except for hydroelectric pumped storage, are still in development stages. The report discusses storage technologies and their applications, categorized into two groups. Centralized bulk power storage facilities, like hydroelectric pumped storage, store large amounts of electricity and can supply power to the grid for hours. This technology is the only form of EPS currently in commercial use. Hydroelectric pumped storage facilities release water from reservoirs to generate electricity using hydraulic turbines. 70% of the power used to pump water up is recovered. There are 37 operational facilities in the US with a total capacity of 19,696 MW. Most were built before 1991, and few new facilities are likely due to limited suitable sites and environmental concerns. Another form of centralized bulk power storage is compressed air energy storage (CAES). Compressed air energy storage (CAES) involves using compressors to inject air into a cavern within a geologic formation. The compressed air is later released, heated with a combustion turbine, and used to drive a turbine generator. Prototype CAES plants were built in Germany in 1978 and in Alabama in 1991. There are many potential sites in the US for CAES units, which have a small above-ground footprint and may face less public opposition than hydroelectric pumped storage developments. The technology is still evolving, with new projects announced but not yet under construction. The designers of the 1991 plant in Alabama are now seeking to build units using an improved \"second generation\" technology for centralized bulk power storage systems. This technology can help displace peaking generation by storing cheap power captured during low-demand hours for use during high loads. Price arbitrage can also be achieved by selling stored cheap power at a high price during the day. Additionally, centralized bulk storage can be used to compensate for the variability in output from wind and solar plants, capturing surplus wind power at night for use during the day. Stored electricity can also backstop wind and solar power. Distributed multipurpose power storage facilities can back up wind and solar power during unfavorable weather conditions. These facilities are dispersed throughout the power system to meet specific local power needs. Technologies such as batteries, flywheels, solar thermal storage, residential electricity storage, and commercial-scale cooling storage are still in the developmental stage. Commercial applications of battery technology exist in the United States. Commercial applications of battery technology exist in the United States and elsewhere. A 34-MW battery facility in Japan is used with a 51-MW wind farm, utilizing sodium sulfur (NaS) batteries. American Electric Power (AEP) deployed a 1-MW NaS battery in 2006 in Charleston, WV, funded in part by the Department of Energy (DOE). The battery helps alleviate overloading issues by charging during low-demand times and providing power during peak periods. Other planned battery installations include AES Energy Storage. AES Energy Storage, Xcel Energy, AEP, and the New York Metropolitan Transit Authority have installed various battery arrays using lithium ion and NaS technology in different locations across the United States. These installations aim to store off-peak power for various applications such as grid stabilization and natural gas compressor refueling. The installation of battery arrays funded by state, federal governments, and industry associations stores off-peak power for various services like grid stabilization and natural gas compressor refueling. Batteries can provide power for several hours, act as a backup source, and offer grid regulation. Flywheels store electricity as mechanical energy and can recover about 85% to 90% of stored power. Flywheel technology drives a generator, with individual units having a capacity of about 25 kilowatts and can be deployed in arrays to create megawatt-scale installations. Beacon Power operates a 2-MW pilot facility in Massachusetts and plans to expand to 5 MW. They have received grants and loan guarantees for larger plants in New York and Ohio to provide regulation services to the power grid. The power grid operators need to match supply and demand for electricity precisely to prevent instability and grid failure. Constant adjustments in power plant output increase fuel costs and wear on generators. Flywheels can provide power for up to 15 minutes but need to regulate power on and off the grid moment-to-moment. Regulation service may increase with more variable wind and solar power connected to the grid. Regulation service from conventional generators has been reliable, but storage devices like flywheels or batteries could offer more efficient options. Flywheels and certain batteries can provide this capability. Another crucial grid service is reactive power supply, supporting voltage control for system reliability. Reactive power is essential for operating the electric transmission system reliably. The importance of reactive power supply for electric transmission system reliability was highlighted in recent major power outages worldwide. The August 2003 blackout in the United States and Canada was attributed to insufficient reactive power. Dynamic capacitive reactive power supplies were depleted leading up to the blackout, emphasizing the need for additional reactive power injection. Specialized devices currently fulfill this role, with flywheels being a potential alternative option. Solar thermal and photovoltaic power offer alternative methods of generating electricity. Solar thermal plants, also known as concentrated solar power (CSP), use sunlight to heat a working liquid, producing steam to drive a turbine. They can store solar heat for electricity production when sunlight is weak by melting salts like sodium and potassium chloride. This technology offers an alternative way to harness sunlight for electricity generation. Molten salt storage is used in concentrated solar power plants to capture heat from the salt and produce steam for power generation. Up to 93% of stored energy can be recaptured for steam production. The technology is currently utilized at the Andasol 1 plant in Spain, allowing it to run at full load for 7.5 hours using stored heat. However, the addition of molten salt storage increases costs and complexity, as seen in the decision not to use it in the Ivanpah CPS project in California to reduce costs and ensure commercial viability. The decision to add storage to a project depends on balancing incremental costs with additional revenues from providing firm service over an extended operating day. Batteries can be used for in-home storage in conjunction with solar PV systems, but current technology is bulky, requires maintenance, and is expensive. Advanced battery technology could reduce costs and improve efficiency. Advanced battery technology could reduce costs and improve performance for in-home storage systems. PHEVs have battery packs that can be charged through a home's power system, using off-peak power. These systems are still under development but have garnered interest from government and industry. The interaction between in-home storage and the power system is complex, with the potential for utility control over battery operation. In-home storage systems rely on battery power during off-peak hours to meet peak demands, reducing the need for new infrastructure. However, utility control over charging and discharging cycles may be problematic for PHEV owners. Government regulation is necessary to prevent charging during peak periods, competing with net metering. Net metering allows utilities to purchase excess power from home PV systems. Multi-home electricity storage involves a centralized battery facility owned by the utility for peak shaving and backup power. This centralized approach offers economies of scale but homeowners lose control over storage. Additional metering and billing enhancements are needed for surplus power collection. Cooling storage devices use electricity during non-peak hours to turn water to ice, which can be used to cool air during peak demand times. This technology is currently economical for commercial and industrial establishments, reducing the need for high-priced natural-gas-fired peaking plants. The use of cooling storage devices shifts load to non-peak hours, reducing costs for consumers by avoiding high-priced natural gas peaking plants. This load shifting can impact total power costs by reducing the need for expensive peaking units and utilizing cheaper coal or natural gas combined cycle plants. In restructured markets, peak shaving can significantly lower power costs by reducing the need for high-cost generating units. Cooling storage devices shift load to non-peak hours, reducing costs by avoiding high-priced peaking plants. Efficiency gains from making ice during cooler evening hours can eliminate power losses in the storage process. An aggregator can improve the economics of cooling storage by combining multiple installations into a single resource for utilities. Storage capacity is limited by the amount of air conditioning load in buildings, but in climates with high demand, year-round peak shaving storage would be preferable. Power grid modernization proposals often fall under the \"smart grid\" concept. Power grid modernization proposals, known as the \"smart grid,\" involve advanced technologies that turn the grid into a computer network. This includes improved management of electricity demand, self-monitoring, and automatic protection schemes to enhance system reliability. The smart grid concept goes beyond current grid technology, integrating operations from homes to power plants. The smart grid system optimizes resources like distributed storage and generation for peak shaving, backup power, and electricity regulation. The development of storage is closely linked to smart grid policies, with EPS identified as a key functionality. The ability to accommodate various generation types and storage options is central to the smart grid concept. The smart grid utilizes diverse generation and storage options to meet consumer demand and support renewable energy technologies. Distributed resources help alleviate peak load, provide system support during emergencies, and reduce power costs. Technical challenges remain in fully deploying the smart grid, requiring anticipation of intermittency and balancing costs, reliability, and environmental emissions. The deployment of smart meters and the \"full\" smart grid, including optimization of storage and resources, has not progressed beyond pilot projects. Incorporating electric storage systems into market and grid operations is a complex task due to traditional utility planning and regulatory structures. Challenges exist in optimally scheduling the use of pumped hydroelectric facilities in a market with dynamic pricing. Despite these challenges, a future with many electric storage systems is foreseeable. The future envisions numerous electric storage systems deployed at various locations, requiring new algorithms, tools, and regulatory paradigms. Environmental, cost, regulatory, and institutional issues may hinder the deployment of Energy Storage Systems (EPS). Hydroelectric pumped storage is the only mature technology, but opportunities for new plants are limited. The cost of building new hydroelectric pumped storage (HPS) plants in the United States is high, ranging from $2,500 to $4,000 per KW of capacity. Environmental concerns, such as flooding valleys and damaging wildlife habitats, have also delayed the operation of completed HPS facilities. The construction of hydroelectric pumped storage (HPS) plants in the United States was completed in the mid-1980s but did not enter service until 2002 due to environmental litigation. The HPS capacity at the Harry S. Truman Dam and Reservoir in Missouri has never been used commercially for environmental reasons. Other storage technologies have high costs and may face environmental issues if they become more common. Storage systems generally return less power to the grid than they store. The cost of storage technologies is high due to factors like maintenance, battery replacement, and financing expenses. Despite evolving technology and potential cost reductions, energy storage is currently considered a high-cost option. Federal incentives and grants can help offset these costs, but long-term sustainability will require revenue from premium applications and multiple value streams. Energy storage technologies can generate revenue from various value streams, such as regulation services, emergency backup power, reactive power, and distribution system support. To monetize these services, the electric market needs rates and payment arrangements that recognize the benefits of energy storage. The regulatory framework for electric power storage is evolving in the United States. The regulation of electric power is a mix of federal and state authorities, with a distinction between traditional and restructured state markets. In traditional markets, utilities operate under a vertically integrated model, providing bundled retail service to consumers. In traditional markets, utilities operate under a \"cost-of-service\" model regulated by state public utility commissions. New investments require approval from the state commission. Restructured markets with more competition developed in the Northeast, New England, Midwest, Texas, and California in the 1990s to drive down electric rates. In restructured power markets, competition can lower rates and improve service. Key elements include utilities selling power plants to independent producers, centralized market makers setting wholesale prices, and regional transmission organizations managing market rules and tariffs. State commissions still provide the framework for these markets. In restructured power markets, state commissions set the framework for retail rates, but consumers are more exposed to market fluctuations. RTO markets determine wholesale prices based on the highest cost bid, leading to rates reflecting marginal prices. Both traditional and restructured markets are federally regulated, with FERC overseeing wholesale electricity and transmission rates. FERC has shifted towards market-based rates but still tightly regulates market operations. In restructured power markets, FERC tightly regulates all tariffs, rules, and activities impacting interstate power markets. These markets expose multiple services with varying prices, allowing storage projects to exploit revenue streams and engage in price arbitrage. However, complex market rules may not accommodate the specific characteristics of electricity storage. The Lake Elsinore Advanced Pumped Storage (LEAPS) project faced regulatory complications due to conflicting designations by FERC and the California ISO. This left the storage project in a state of uncertainty despite its use of a well-established storage technology. The regulatory environment for energy storage projects is complex, with challenges for transmission owners, distribution utilities, and generation companies. RTOs began changing rules in 2008 and 2009 to account for electricity storage. ISO New England and the New York region are among those making adjustments. ISO New England, the New York ISO, and the Midwest ISO (MISO) have implemented rule changes to facilitate the use of energy storage for regulation services. However, these changes do not address other storage services or the potential contribution of large-scale storage projects. FERC is exploring a national pricing policy for energy storage that could address issues such as storage devices acting as both generation and transmission facilities. In markets where rates are set for utilities by state commissions, storage projects face challenges due to lack of separate pricing for services like spinning reserve. Comparing energy storage with alternative technologies like combustion turbines shows higher costs and technical uncertainty for storage. Utility commissions may prefer known technologies despite storage's additional capabilities like price arbitrage. Regulators need to be willing to accept higher costs for storage solutions. In order to implement storage solutions that are more expensive than traditional options, regulators or governmental agencies need to be willing to invest in new technologies. Economic incentives for utilities are tied to the size of their capital investments, which can influence their willingness to adopt new technologies. Utility commissioners may be hesitant to spend ratepayer money on experimental technologies, despite the potential benefits of storage solutions. Analysts emphasize the need to expand the national transmission system for renewable energy development, congestion relief, and reliability improvement. Proposals for expansion include a national \"interstate highway\" system, major interregional projects, and regional development utilizing local resources. Regional development focuses on utilizing local and nearby renewable resources instead of distant ones, such as PV generation, off-shore wind farms, and hydroelectric power imports. Integrated Solutions involve considering non-transmission and non-generation alternatives like small-scale transmission projects, local renewable resources, demand response, energy efficiency, and electricity storage. This approach requires involvement from various stakeholders and complex analyses, making it a comprehensive planning approach for regional electric systems. Electricity storage can play a role in different approaches to transmission planning, such as large centralized facilities for national projects or distributed storage for regional planning. The consideration of Energy Storage Systems (EPS) varies in transmission planning, reflecting differing views on the future of the power system. One view sees the need for major long-distance transmission for accessing renewable power, while another believes local resource development can reduce the need for new transmission lines. Traditional utility approaches also face a divide in resolving power systems. The divide in resolving power systems is between traditional utility approaches and new approaches that rely on diverse resources like Energy Storage Systems (EPS). EPS does not easily fit into the traditional utility paradigm due to its distributed nature and ability to serve multiple purposes. The adoption of transmission planning approaches will be influenced by policy decisions informed by technical, cost, and political considerations. The role of EPS in these planning decisions may be influenced by federal policy. EPS faces regulatory, economic, and policy challenges. The concluding section of the report discusses oversight and legislative approaches to address barriers to EPS adoption, which is of interest to Congress. Electricity storage, along with other technologies like distributed generation and renewable power, challenges the traditional power industry paradigm. The power industry and regulators need to quickly pursue cost-effective new approaches. A DOE study highlights the adoption issue for utilities seeking cost recovery. The adoption issue for utilities seeking cost recovery of transmission or generation projects may deter investment in energy storage technology. State utility regulators may prefer proven technology over innovative energy storage solutions. Efforts are underway at state and federal levels to address regulatory barriers, but the decentralized nature of utility regulation in the US may prolong the process, warranting congressional oversight. Congress may need to monitor whether executive agencies are considering non-traditional solutions for power systems needs. Recent studies by DOE and FERC highlight potential oversight issues, such as integrating wind power into the electricity supply. The integration of wind power into the electricity supply requires steps to compensate for reduced or unavailable power due to weather conditions. Various options have been proposed, including quick-start natural gas-fired power plants, geographic dispersion of wind farms, improved forecasting techniques, demand response technologies, and aggregation of utility control areas. The need for Energy Storage Systems (EPS) remains uncertain for integrating large amounts of wind and renewable power capacity into the grid. The need for Energy Storage Systems (EPS) remains uncertain for integrating large amounts of wind and renewable power capacity into the grid. Various resources like demand response, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and storage capacity can help balance variable generation. Large-scale electricity storage is seen as critical for renewable power to replace fossil/nuclear plants. PJM Interconnection's chief believes in the importance of integrating 1,000 MW. The operator of the power grid in the Middle Atlantic and Midwest states believes over 1,000 MW of CAES is needed to support growing wind capacity. Two utilities in California have proposed CAES and battery projects for wind power integration. The DOE study should consider options like EPS and demand response for integrating wind power. A recent FERC study assesses demand response potential state by state for the period 2010-2019. The text discusses various approaches to demand response in the electricity sector, including dynamic rates, direct load control, interruptible tariffs, and programs for reducing demand from large industrial and commercial customers. These strategies aim to adjust electricity consumption based on wholesale power prices and scarcity, with some being easily implementable like interruptible tariffs and direct load control. The study examines the potential implementation of dynamic rates for residential customers, along with enabling technologies like smart meters, customer participation in dynamic pricing, and the use of enabling technologies. It questions whether FERC has limited options for reducing peak demands, mentioning battery storage and thermal energy storage as high-cost options that could shift peak demand to off-peak periods. The study explores ways to reduce peak demand by shifting it to off-peak periods, citing barriers like cost. It questions the effectiveness of smart meters, thermostats, and dynamic pricing compared to energy storage systems. The treatment of distributed generation in industrial and commercial sectors is also discussed. The curr_chunk discusses the treatment of electric power storage in legislative proposals, including S. 1091, H.R. 2454, and S. 1462. It highlights the importance of considering electric power storage as a demand response option for managing peak loads. The curr_chunk discusses financial incentives for EPS projects in legislative proposals like the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 and the American Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009. The STORAGE Act would provide tax incentives for EPS deployment, including a 20% business investment tax credit for EPS systems delivering stored power for sale and a 30% residential tax credit for home EPS systems. The STORAGE Act introduced in 2009 offers a 30% residential tax credit for EPS systems used to store and deliver renewable energy onsite to reduce peak power demand. The bill allows government and cooperative power agencies to issue Clean Renewable Energy Bonds for storage projects. The ACES Act passed in 2009 aims to increase renewable power use, reduce peak demand, and cut carbon emissions, potentially benefiting from cost-effective EPS. The ACELA energy bill introduced in 2009 includes provisions for transmission planning policies that consider various demand-side and supply-side options, such as energy efficiency, distributed generation, renewable energy, smart-grid technologies, demand response, and electricity storage. It also aims to reduce peak demand through the implementation of technologies like EPS. The ACELA energy bill introduced in 2009 includes provisions for transmission planning policies that consider various demand-side and supply-side options, such as dynamic pricing, smart grid technology, distributed generation, and electricity storage. The bill aims to support the development of new renewable energy generation capacity, cost savings, reliability enhancement, reduced power plant emissions, and maximizing the contribution of demand side management, energy storage, distributed generation resources, and smart grid investments. Transmission planning would be required to reflect these policy objectives. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) provided funding for electricity storage, with a focus on battery technology for electric vehicles. The act also included loan guarantees for transmission grid construction supporting renewable energy projects, which could potentially be used for energy storage projects. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) allocated $300 million for Department of Defense energy efficiency technology programs, including electricity storage. Additionally, $4.5 billion was designated for grid modernization and related technologies like electricity storage. The act also established a tax credit for manufacturing equipment used in electricity storage systems for electric vehicles and renewable energy. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) allocated $2.3 billion in credits for various technologies including advanced battery and battery system components. The law also established a $2.0 billion program for facility funding grants to manufacturers. Additionally, ARRA modified existing tax credits for plug-in vehicles and added $2.4 billion to an Energy Conservation Bond program for purposes such as advanced automobile batteries. Congress may want to oversee incentives for electricity storage devices beyond vehicle battery systems to promote widespread adoption of cost-effective EPS technologies in manufacturing."
