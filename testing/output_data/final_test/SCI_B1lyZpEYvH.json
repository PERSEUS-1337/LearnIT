    "content": "Neural models have improved natural language processing tasks but lack transparency. Progress has been made in single-aspect sentiment analysis for reviews, but existing models struggle with multiple aspects. A new neural model predicts multi-aspect sentiments for reviews by generating probabilistic multi-dimensional masks simultaneously. Evaluation shows the model outperforms baselines in the beer and hotel domain. Our model outperforms strong baselines in the beer and hotel domain, generating masks that are strong feature predictors, meaningful, and interpretable. Integrating interpretability in neural models can provide reasons for predictions and improve performance, especially in domains where automated predictions impact final decisions like medicine. Justifying predictions can be challenging, but various methods exist to find explanations in input text. Various methods exist to find justifications in input text, such as generating masks using reinforcement learning, unsupervised methods, or annotations during training. These masks contain text fragments that are sufficient for prediction, especially in single-aspect sentiment analysis for reviews. In this work, the focus is on interpretable multi-aspect sentiment classification. The model aims to predict sentiment for multiple aspects using a probabilistic approach, addressing the limitations of single-aspect models and the challenges of hard word assignments to aspects. The study focuses on interpretable multi-aspect sentiment classification by generating a probabilistic multi-dimensional mask for each aspect. The mask helps identify relevant parts of reviews and improves sentiment prediction accuracy without sacrificing interpretability. The model outperforms baselines in beer and hotel domains, providing strong feature predictors and meaningful masks. The study introduces a Multi-Aspect Masker (MAM) neural model for multi-aspect sentiment classification, offering fine-grained interpretability without compromising performance. The model generates probabilistic masks for different aspects in text reviews, highlighting key words for sentiment prediction. It outperforms baselines and attention models, with controllable interpretability levels through regularizers. Additionally, a new dataset for multi-aspect sentiment analysis is released. The curr_chunk discusses the development of interpretable models in neural research, focusing on identifying short text fragments for prediction. Various works have analyzed state activation, word vectors, and attention mechanisms. The system aims to provide explanations through coherent text fragments. Attention models have been shown to improve prediction accuracy, visualization, and interpretability. The most popular mechanism is soft attention. Standard attention modules may not provide safe and meaningful explanations. Our model includes two regularizers for interpretability and does not normalize over sequence length. Multi-aspect sentiment classification is approached using heuristic-based methods or topic models. Neural models have shown significant improvements with less features. In recent studies, neural models have shown significant improvements in multi-aspect sentiment classification without extensive feature engineering. While some models incorporate human rationales during training for interpretability, they can be costly and vary among annotators. Unlike related works that rely on annotations, our approach, similar to Li et al. (2016b) and Lei et al. (2016), focuses on generating hard rationales for single-aspect sentiment classification without the need for separate training. Our proposed model, the Multi-Aspect Masker, supports multi-aspect sentiment classification by generating soft multidimensional masks in a single training session. These masks provide interpretability and significantly improve performance. The Multi-Aspect Masker model supports multi-aspect sentiment classification by generating masks for words in a review, which are used by the Encoder to learn representations for the Classifier to predict target variables. The model architecture includes a Masker module, an Encoder, and a Classifier, with the Masker computing hidden representations for words using convolutional networks. The framework is versatile for various tasks and interchangeable with other neural models. The Multi-Aspect Masker model supports multi-aspect sentiment classification by generating masks for words in a review. The aspect distribution of input words is defined using the Straight Through Gumbel Softmax to approximate sampling from a categorical distribution. Parameters of the Gumbel Softmax distributions are modeled with a neural network, controlling sharpness with a temperature parameter. This approach differs from attention mechanisms. The Multi-Aspect Masker model uses word importance distributions to weight embeddings towards specific aspects. The Encoder module includes a convolutional neural network followed by max-over-time pooling to obtain fixed-length feature vectors. Commonalities and differences among aspects are exploited by sharing encoder weights. The Classifier block contains two-layer feedforward neural networks for each aspect. The Classifier block in the Multi-Aspect Masker model contains two-layer feedforward neural networks for each aspect to predict sentiment. A review of a stay at daulsol in September 2013 is positive, mentioning the great location near popular spots and helpful staff. The reviewer plans to return in September 2014. The reviewer had a positive experience staying at daulsol in September 2013, praising the great location near popular spots and helpful staff. They plan to return in September 2014. The hotel is basic but clean, with no issues in the bathroom or kitchen facilities. The receptionist was very helpful, even allowing them to stay after missing their flight. There are plenty of restaurants, supermarkets, and shops nearby. The reviewer loved the apartments so much that they booked to come back in September 2014. The text discusses optimizing sentiment loss in a Multi-Aspect Masker model by guiding it to produce long and meaningful word sequences. Two regularizers are proposed to control the number of selected words and favor consecutive words belonging to the same aspect. The text introduces a Multi-Aspect Masker model that calculates the probability of tagging words as aspects and minimizes cross-entropy with a parameter \u03bb p. It includes regularizers to discourage aspect transitions between consecutive words and trains the model in an end-to-end manner. The model is evaluated based on predictive performance and mask quality. The Multi-Aspect Masker model is evaluated based on predictive performance and mask quality. It is tested on a multi-aspect sentiment classification task using beer reviews from BeerAdvocat. The dataset is modified to suit the method's requirements, resulting in a subset with decreased sentiment correlation between aspects. This version is referred to as the Filtered Beer dataset, while the original is the Full Beer dataset. The Filtered Beer dataset is created for evaluating model robustness across domains using 140k hotel reviews from TripAdvisor. Each review includes ratings for aspects like Service, Cleanliness, Value, Location, and Room. Hotel reviews are longer, noisier, and less structured compared to beer reviews. The problem is binarized with ratings at three and above labeled as positive. The datasets are split into 80/10/10 for train, development, and test subsets. The Multi-Aspect Masker (MAM) is compared with various baselines, starting with a simple Sentiment Majority baseline. The study compares the Multi-Aspect Masker (MAM) model with different baselines to predict the majority sentiment of reviews. Various models are used, including a shared encoder with classifiers and a shared attention mechanism for interpretability. The goal is to achieve the best performance and fine-grained interpretability by visualizing the words the model focuses on and predicting aspect sentiment. In this section, different models were employed for sentiment analysis tasks, including NB-SVM and SAM. Two types of attention mechanisms were utilized: additive and sparse. The models were grouped based on levels of interpretability: None, Coarse-grained, and Fine-grained. The study aims to determine if fine-grained interpretability can be advantageous. The study compared different models for sentiment analysis, including NB-SVM and SAM, using various attention mechanisms. The Multi-Aspect Masker (MAM) model outperformed other baselines on both datasets, with fewer parameters and fine-grained interpretability. It achieved significant improvements in F1 scores for both synthetic and real-world datasets. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of sub-masks in improving model predictions and interpretability. By incorporating masks into word embeddings, a simple Encoder-Classifier achieved significant F1 score improvements compared to the Multi-Aspect Masker (MAM) model. Visualizations of reviews with sub-masks and attentions by different models were provided in the appendix. The study compared different models for aspect-based sentiment analysis. SAM outperformed NB-SVM and Encoder-Classifier in the Full Beer dataset. SAM provides fine-grained interpretability but sacrifices performance. Shared attention models perform similarly to Encoder-Classifier but offer only coarse-grained interpretability. In the study on aspect-based sentiment analysis, SAM shows high correlation between aspects but lacks interpretability. Sentiment Majority is outperformed in the Filtered Beer dataset due to low sentiment correlation. However, in the Full Beer dataset, Sentiment Majority performs better than NB-SVM. Multi-Aspect Masker improves performance and interpretability on the Hotel dataset. Encoder-Classifier with contextualized embeddings outperforms all models significantly. The Encoder-Classifier model 9 significantly outperforms all other models in aspect-based sentiment analysis, achieving the best individual F1 scores for each aspect. Visualizations of reviews with masks and attentions are available. Multi-Aspect Masker 8 performs slightly worse than aspect-wise attention models but with fewer parameters. Single Aspect-Mask 5 obtains the lowest relative macro F1 score across datasets, indicating it is not meant to provide rationales. The model Multi-Aspect Masker generates meaningful masks that improve performance and can be interpreted by humans. Evaluating justifications with short and coherent text pieces is challenging due to the lack of a gold standard. McAuley et al. (2012) provided beer reviews with aspect sentence-level annotations, while our model computes masks at a finer level. Trained models on beer reviews were used to extract selected words, showing strong predictive results. The Multi-Aspect Masker model generates masks that correlate best with human judgment, outperforming other models like SVM and attention models. The masks show higher precision and semantic interpretability, especially compared to Single Aspect-Mask models. The Multi-Aspect Masker model outperforms other models in generating masks that align closely with human judgment. It achieves the highest mean NPMI and superior results in most datasets, requiring only a single training. The model significantly outperforms SAM and attention models for N \u2265 20 in Hotel and Full Beer datasets. The Multi-Aspect Masker model outperforms SAM and attention models for N \u2265 20, with higher scores in four out of six cases for smaller N. It performs better for N \u2265 15 in the Filtered Beer dataset but is beaten by SAM for N \u2264 10. The model generates probabilistic multi-dimensional masks for aspect sentiment classification in reviews, showing better word sets compared to other methods. The Multi-Aspect Masker model outperforms SAM and attention models for aspect sentiment classification in reviews by generating probabilistic multi-dimensional masks. It improves sentiment prediction for all aspects in beer and hotel domains, surpassing strong baselines with interpretable masks. The model used dropout, gradient clipping, L2-norm regularization, and early stopping during training. Adam optimizer with specific parameters was employed, along with fixed temperature for Gumbel-Softmax distributions. Different regularizer terms were applied for different datasets, and experiments were conducted with specific settings and hardware. The code from Lei et al. (2016) was reused, and reviews were randomly sampled for analysis using the Multi-Aspect Masker model (MAM). The models MAM, SAM, MAA, and MASA were used to compute masks and attentions. Each model represents different aspects with varying confidence levels. Soft attentions were generated by all models except SAM, which uses hard masking. Samples from different datasets were analyzed, with the Multi Aspect-Masks (Ours) showing details of color, aroma, taste, and mouthfeel of the products.
