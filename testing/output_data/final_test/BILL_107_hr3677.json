    "content": "The Act is titled \"Safeguarding America's Retirement Act of 2002\" and includes new protections under ERISA fiduciary rules for participants and beneficiaries under 401(k) plans. Section 404(a)(2) of ERISA is amended to include requirements for individual account plans with a qualified cash or deferred arrangement. Compliance with these requirements is necessary for plan effectiveness. The requirements for individual account plans with a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under ERISA include limitations on investing employee contributions in employer securities based on years of participation. The requirements for individual account plans under ERISA include allowing participants to diversify their accrued benefits invested in employer securities and prohibiting any lockdown on these benefits. The term \"lockdown\" in individual account plans under ERISA refers to temporary restrictions on transferring accrued benefits from employer securities to other investment options, excluding reasonable transfer frequency restrictions. SEC. 3. ENFORCEMENT OF NEW FIDUCIARY RULES. Section 501 of ERISA is amended to impose criminal penalties for willful violations by plan sponsors, administrators, or fiduciaries. A fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment for up to one year, or both, may be imposed. Civil penalties are also outlined. The Secretary may assess civil penalties of up to $1,000 a day for each violation of certain requirements under ERISA, imposed on plan sponsors, administrators, or fiduciaries until the violation is corrected. The Secretary can impose civil penalties of up to $1,000 per day for violations of ERISA requirements on plan sponsors, administrators, or fiduciaries. Each violation is treated separately, and a conforming amendment is made to Section 502(a)(6) of the Act. SEC. 4. Nonforfeitability after 3 years of participation. Amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 now include a provision stating that an individual account plan with a cash or deferred arrangement must grant a participant with 3 years of participation a nonforfeitable right to 100% of their accrued benefit from elective deferrals. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 now require defined contribution plans with cash or deferred arrangements to grant participants with 3 years of participation a nonforfeitable right to elective deferrals. Participants in defined contribution plans with cash or deferred arrangements are granted a nonforfeitable right to 100 percent of their accrued benefit after completing 3 years of participation. SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE AND RELATED RULES. The amendments made by this Act apply to plan years starting on or after January 1, 2003, with a special rule for collectively bargained plans to adjust the effective date based on collective bargaining agreement termination dates. The Act's amendments apply to plan years starting on or after January 1, 2003, with special rules for collectively bargained plans. Plan amendments must be made by the first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2005, with retroactive application if the plan is operated according to the new requirements before that year."
