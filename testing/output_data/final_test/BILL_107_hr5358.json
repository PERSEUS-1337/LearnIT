    "content": "The \"Community Protection Against Wildfire Act of 2002\" includes provisions for wildfire control efforts, community and private land assistance, tree cutting limitations, forest restoration, and definitions of key terms. The Act defines key terms such as \"Center,\" \"Federal lands,\" \"Indian tribe,\" \"Micro-enterprise,\" and \"National Fire Plan.\" The National Fire Plan refers to strategies and projects by the Secretary concerned to address wildfire impacts on communities and the environment. It is based on reports from the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior, as well as Congressional directives for wildland fire management. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to specific individuals within the government. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to specific individuals within the government, including the Secretary of Agriculture or the appropriate Federal land manager for Federal lands described in paragraph (2)(A), and the Secretary of the Interior or the appropriate Federal land manager for Federal lands described in paragraph (2)(B). Additionally, a \"small enterprise\" is defined as a non-subsidiary business or cooperative employing between 6 and 150 people, while the \"wildland-urban interface\" refers to areas where homes and structures are within one-quarter mile of Federal lands with flammable vegetation. The conditions on lands with flammable vegetation are conducive to wildfire, with a significant probability of fire ignition and spread. SEC. 3. RESERVATION OF NATIONAL FIRE PLAN FUNDS FOR WILDFIRE CONTROL EFFORTS ON FEDERAL LANDS IN WILDLAND-URBAN INTERFACE. The Secretary concerned must allocate at least 85% of funds for hazardous fuels reduction and wildfire control in the wildland-urban interface on Federal lands. SEC. 4. COMMUNITY AND PRIVATE LAND WILDFIRE ASSISTANCE. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide grants to States and Indian tribes to enhance firefighting efficiency, protect against wildfires, educate communities on fire prevention, and create defensible spaces around homes. Grant funds will be administered by State foresters or equivalent officials. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide grants to States and Indian tribes for fuel hazard mitigation, invasive species management, wildfire planning, community protection planning, education programs, and special restoration projects in the wildland-urban interface. Activities on non-Federal lands require the owner's consent, and grant funds will be distributed by the Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary of Agriculture will distribute $1.5 billion over five years to States and Indian tribes based on the population of communities at risk to wildlife. SEC. 5. LIMITATION ON MAXIMUM DIAMETER OF LIVING TREES THAT MAY BE CUT. To ensure funds for the National Fire Plan are used to reduce wildfire threats, regulations limit tree diameter in hazardous fuels reduction projects funded by the plan. Regulations are based on a study by the National Academy of Sciences on diameter limitations for different tree species and forest types. The National Academy of Sciences will provide recommendations for regulations on tree diameter limitations in hazardous fuels reduction projects. The Secretary may grant exceptions for public safety reasons. The study must be completed within eight months, and final regulations issued within the same timeframe. The final regulations for hazardous fuels reduction projects and wildfire control efforts funded by National Fire Plan funds or grant funds under section 4 will be issued and apply from October 1, 2003. SEC. 6. FOREST RESTORATION AND VALUE-ADDED CENTERS. Establishment of Restoration and Value-Added Centers by the Secretary to improve collaborative restoration projects on Federal lands through cost-share grants or cooperative agreements. Centers provide technical assistance for creating natural-resource related enterprises, including restoration and processing techniques for byproducts. Additionally, they offer support in using scientific information for restoration and ecosystem health objectives. The Secretary establishes Restoration and Value-Added Centers to support collaborative restoration projects on Federal lands. The Centers offer technical assistance for natural-resource enterprises, workforce training, marketing support, technology development, funding access, and economic infrastructure development. Centers are located in Forest Service regions with high forested land in condition class 3. The Secretary may enter partnerships to establish Restoration and Value-Added Centers in Forest Service regions with high forested land in condition class 3. Proposals for Centers are selected by the Regional Forester and State Bureau of Land Management Director with input from advisory committees. The Secretary may provide cost-share grants for Restoration and Value-Added Centers, covering 75% of operating costs up to $1,000,000 annually. Federal funding for operating costs will decrease by 25% annually after five years of operation. The Secretary must notify relevant congressional committees within 30 days of approving a grant or cooperative agreement for a Center. The Secretary will provide cost-share grants for Restoration and Value-Added Centers, covering 75% of operating costs up to $1,000,000 annually. Federal funding will decrease by 25% annually after five years. A report assessing the Centers will be submitted to congressional committees, detailing organizations receiving assistance, projects implemented, and the number of beneficiaries. Any funds collected from hazardous fuels reduction projects or wildfire control efforts funded by National Fire Plan or grant funds shall be deposited in the Treasury's general fund, not considered as revenue from National Forest System or Federal lands under other laws."
