TANF funding is set to expire at the end of FY2012. This report outlines potential issues for discussion on extending TANF funding or reauthorization. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, a result of welfare reform in the mid-1990s, has a history dating back to the early 1900s with cash assistance programs for needy families. The 112th Congress will decide on extending TANF funding, which is set to expire at the end of FY2012. The visibility of cash assistance programs increased in the 1960s due to concerns about cost and effects. Welfare reform debates from the late 1960s to the mid-1990s focused on single mother families and the impact of cash assistance on work incentives. Research showed that cash assistance discouraged single mothers from seeking employment. There were concerns that cash welfare targeted at single parent families contributed to the rise in single, female-headed families. The effects of cash assistance on family structure are less conclusive than its impact on work incentives. The focus is on the effects of cash assistance on work, with concerns about the adequacy of benefits and variations in eligibility criteria. Research in the 1980s and 1990s showed some families experienced long-term welfare dependency, while mandatory welfare-to-work programs were effective in moving families into employment. TANF, created in 1996, addressed the concern that cash assistance discouraged work by requiring participation in activities leading to employment. The mid-1990s saw a shift in low-income assistance policies towards supporting the working poor, with expansions of the Earned Income Tax Credit. By 2010, cash assistance rolls had significantly decreased, reaching fewer poor children. Single mothers' employment rates were higher in 2010 than in 1995, despite the effects of the 2007-2009 recession. The child poverty rate increased in the 2000s, reaching a historical high with high rates of children born to unmarried mothers. This poses policy issues as research shows that being raised in a poor or single-parent family lowers chances of success later in life. The child poverty rate increased in the 2000s, reaching a historical high with high rates of children born to unmarried mothers. Factors like being raised in a poor or single-parent family can lower chances of success later in life. Despite the decrease in state-based cash assistance, overall spending for poor families with children has not declined due to expansions in programs like EITC, child tax credit, Medicaid, CHIP, SNAP, and SSI. Federal TANF funding is mainly in a $16.5 billion block grant to states. The federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program provides a $16.5 billion block grant to states annually, with states required to spend a minimum of $10.4 billion on TANF-related programs. The funding amounts were set in 1996 and have not been adjusted for inflation or changes in conditions. TANF also includes competitive grants for marriage and fatherhood initiatives, aiming to increase state flexibility in achieving assistance goals for needy families. The TANF program aims to assist needy families by promoting job preparation, work, and marriage, preventing out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and encouraging two-parent families. States have flexibility in using TANF funds to achieve these goals. Basic assistance only represents 30% of all TANF and MOE funds used in FY2010. In FY2010, TANF provided support to state child care subsidy programs, work supports like state tax credits, and various other activities such as services for at-risk families, early childhood education, youth programs, and responsible fatherhood initiatives. States have the freedom to set rules for cash assistance programs, with benefit amounts varying widely across states. The 1996 welfare reform law and TANF have work requirements and time limits for families receiving cash assistance. States have flexibility in setting benefit levels and implementing time limits. P.L. 112-96 extended TANF funding through FY2012 for various grants and programs. The 1996 welfare reform law and TANF have work requirements and time limits for families receiving cash assistance. P.L. 112-96 extended TANF funding through FY2012 for various grants and programs, including healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood competitive grants. It does not provide FY2012 funding for TANF supplemental grants. The extension also includes provisions to prevent electronic benefit transaction access to TANF cash at certain establishments and requires states to report TANF data in a manner that facilitates data exchange with other programs. President Obama's FY2013 budget did not propose a comprehensive reauthorization of TANF but suggested reviving TANF supplemental grants and making them permanent, as well as restructuring the TANF contingency fund. The proposed extension of TANF and lack of a longer-term reauthorization defers major budget and policy decisions related to the block grant. The Administration aims to strengthen the program's effectiveness by using performance indicators and working with lawmakers on policy issues. The Administration aims to improve TANF by using performance indicators for program improvement and ensuring states have flexibility in engaging recipients. They also plan to work with Congress to revise the Contingency Fund for economic downturns. The report will discuss budget issues, supplemental grants, performance measurement, response to recessions, subsidized employment, and responsible fatherhood initiatives. The Administration's responsible fatherhood agenda in the FY2013 budget includes policy options for TANF reauthorization. TANF is a mandatory spending program with grants provided in authorizing legislation. Funding is subject to budget rules requiring offsets for spending increases. Table 2 shows actual TANF grants for FY2011. The TANF baseline for future years is the same as the last year under current law, with no adjustments for inflation or other conditions. Supplemental grants are not included in the baseline due to budget rules, but the President's FY2013 budget proposal aims to reinstate and make permanent TANF supplemental grants. The FY2013 budget proposal would reinstate and make permanent TANF supplemental grants funded at $319 million per year, paid for through a reduction in current law funding for the TANF contingency fund. The TANF basic block grant and MOE are frozen at pre-1996 levels, disadvantaging states with high population growth. Congress provided TANF supplemental grants to 17 qualifying states to address disparities in funding based on historical population growth and grants per poor person. These grants aimed to reduce differences in funding per poor child, but the reduction was minimal. Supplemental grants had been frozen since FY2001. Supplemental grants were frozen since FY2001 and aimed to address disparities in funding per poor child. States like Texas and Nevada saw declines in grants despite high population growth. Funding for supplemental grants totaled $319 million per year from FY2001 to FY2010. FY2011 grants were reduced and only funded until June 30, 2011. No funding was provided for supplemental grants in FY2012. TANF performance measures focus on the cash assistance caseload. The TANF program previously used broad outcome measures to award bonuses based on state rankings, including job entry, retention, wage gains, work supports, and two-parent family percentages. These bonuses were repealed in 2006 due to the inability to tie them to state TANF programs. Currently, the main performance measure for assessing state programs is TANF work participation. The current main performance measure for assessing state TANF programs is the work participation standard for families receiving cash assistance. However, if Congress wants to measure TANF beyond cash assistance, challenges such as detailed program descriptions, data on program spending, and measuring program outcomes would need to be addressed. The Claims Resolution Act extended TANF through FY2011 and required states to submit supplemental expenditure reports detailing program expenditures on various activities. HHS reports confirmed that much of the additional spending is for families with children at risk of abuse and neglect. The Claims Resolution Act extended TANF through FY2011 and required states to submit supplemental expenditure reports detailing program expenditures on various activities. Congress recognized the need for more detailed information on TANF, suggesting modifications to existing reporting requirements rather than adding more reports. Options for modifying reports include describing all TANF-funded programs, using standardized forms for better comparisons, and establishing goals and outcome measures for each program. Congress could potentially expand reporting requirements for TANF-funded activities, including establishing goals, outcome measures, and effectiveness assessments. This may involve additional detail in expenditure reports and expanding caseload reporting to include subsidized jobs. Another option is to have each state set its own assessment measures due to TANF's flexibility in program implementation. The TANF work participation standard is a key performance measure used to assess the block grant, reflecting the welfare-to-work philosophy and efforts to help disadvantaged populations reintegrate into the workforce. It sets target rates for participation in work and self-sufficiency activities for a state's cash assistance caseload. The TANF statute sets work participation standards for a state's cash assistance caseload, with a target of 50% engagement in specified activities for families with an adult recipient. The national average work participation rate has been around 30% from FY2000 to FY2009, with most states meeting their standards due to credits for caseload reductions and additional spending. The TANF work participation rate is calculated based on various activities that help recipients achieve self-sufficiency, including educational and rehabilitative activities. There are limits on counting pre-employment activities, with job search and job readiness activities only countable for up to 12 weeks per fiscal year. Vocational educational training is only countable for one year in a recipient's lifetime, and completing secondary school or obtaining a GED credential is only countable in conjunction with work-related activities. Teen parents engaged in education can count towards the work standard, but their activities combined with vocational training cannot exceed 30% of all families engaged in work. Certain activities like unsubsidized employment and on-the-job training have no limits, while pre-employment activities like job search and education have restrictions. This raises questions about the effectiveness of the work participation rate in measuring state efforts to move families from welfare to work. The Claims Resolution Act requires states to report on engagement activities that do not count towards the official standard. States have failed to report some work activity, but this does not significantly change the overall percentage of recipients engaged in any activity. The Act also provides new information on individuals with zero hours of participation. The Claims Resolution Act requires states to report on engagement activities that do not count towards the official standard. New information provided includes the share of recipients exempt due to illness or disability and those in the process of being sanctioned. States may use TANF funds for employment and education activities for low-income parents not on cash assistance rolls. Congress could require states to report all activities, develop a broader measure of participation in self-sufficiency activities. The policy question is whether the work participation standard achieves the goal of engaging recipients in activities that could lead to employment. Credits against the participation standard have diluted its effect. Welfare-to-work programs before the 1996 law failed to achieve a 50% monthly participation rate due to the dynamics of the cash assistance caseload. Many states have withdrawn two-parent families from TANF to avoid the challenge of achieving a 90% participation rate. Past proposals focused on expanding education or rehabilitative activities. New education programs show promise in addressing limitations of past approaches. New education programs in the education arena show promise in addressing past limitations. Little research has been done on the effectiveness of rehabilitative activities for cash assistance recipients. Policy options to improve work participation among cash assistance families include strengthening participation standards and expanding exemptions. Policy options to improve work participation among cash assistance families include allowing exemptions for the first month on the rolls, eliminating the 90% participation standard for two-parent families, and using broader measures of participation. This includes counting more pre-employment activities against the standard and considering selected activities for those not receiving ongoing cash assistance, such as subsidized employment. The \"child-only\" caseload, representing families where all benefits are paid on behalf of the children, makes up a significant portion of the TANF assistance caseload. The \"child-only\" caseload in TANF includes families with parents on SSI, children living with non-parent caretakers, and citizen children with TANF-ineligible noncitizens. There is little federal policy or performance measurement for these families. The GAO recommended clarifying guidance and providing technical assistance for child abuse and neglect issues. During the recession of 2007-2009, the cash assistance caseload under TANF increased by 15%, adding about 250,000 families to the monthly benefit rolls. The number of families receiving benefits in June 2011\u20141.9 million\u2014is well below the peak of 5.1 million in March 1994. The adequacy of this response to the recession is questioned. The 15% rise in TANF cash assistance caseload during the recession is difficult to assess due to varying impacts on demographic groups. Unemployment rates differed between men and women, with young single mothers facing higher rates. Unemployment Insurance played a crucial role in reducing poverty during the recession, especially for children in single-mother households. During the 2007-2009 recession, Unemployment Insurance (UI) extensions and transfer programs helped mitigate income loss and poverty, particularly among children in single-mother households. TANF also responded to the recession by funding subsidized jobs and providing short-term aid to families. Policymakers have raised concerns about the effectiveness of policies outside of TANF in aiding families during economic downturns. During the recession, temporary measures like UI benefit extensions were enacted to aid families. The 1996 welfare law included a $2 billion contingency fund, which was exhausted by early FY2010. Congress created a $5 billion Emergency Contingency Fund (ECF) for FY2009 and FY2010 to support states that did not qualify for regular contingency funds. The Emergency Contingency Fund (ECF) was funded at $5 billion for two years, FY2009 and FY2010, to support states during the recession. It allowed access to funds based on increased expenditures in specific categories. However, the ECF expired on September 30, 2010, and the future of TANF's response to recessions remains uncertain. Congress may need to consider changes to the contingency fund to address TANF's ability to respond to future economic downturns. Congress may need to consider revising policies for structuring aid in future recessions, such as narrowing the types of expenditures reimbursed to target economic aid to families. This would help ration extra funding and prevent it from being diverted into fiscal relief. Revising economic criteria for state access to contingency funds could help target aid during economic slumps. The current criteria, including SNAP caseloads, may be met long after a recession ends. Subsidized employment has been a small part of TANF, but the ECF provided grants for job slots during FY2009 and FY2010. TANF-funded programs can be for those on cash assistance rolls or those who qualify but are not receiving cash assistance. Subsidized employment programs can benefit individuals by providing job experience, filling gaps in employment histories, and keeping them attached to the labor force. These programs can also provide more income for families than TANF cash assistance benefits. Additionally, subsidized employment programs benefit communities by producing goods or services valuable to the community. Subsidized employment programs may not always create new jobs, as research suggests that some positions may substitute for existing ones. The Obama Administration proposed building on TANF subsidized employment experiences, potentially through dedicated funding or non-financial incentives for states to expand these programs. The current cash assistance programs have roots in \"mothers' pension\" programs, with past welfare reform debates focusing on single mother families. Recently, there has been more attention on noncustodial fathers who are expected to pay child support. Child support collections have increased significantly through the Federal-State Child Support Enforcement program post-welfare reform. Child support collections rose 73% between FY1995 and FY2009, reaching $26.4 billion in FY2009. Despite successes, only 64% of current support and 7% of past-due support was collected. Noncustodial fathers face challenges in paying child support, with some being poor and facing educational and health barriers to employment. Stagnant wages for men contribute to difficulties in involving them in their children's lives. The inflation-adjusted median annual earnings of men have been stagnant since 1973, with wages falling for those with lower education levels. Fathers also face challenges in supporting their children due to high rates of incarceration, especially among African-American males. The stigma of a criminal record further hinders ex-offenders from finding employment. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 established grant programs for healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood initiatives, with funding of about $100 million per year for healthy marriage activities and $50 million per year for responsible fatherhood. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allocated $100 million annually for healthy marriage activities and $50 million for responsible fatherhood initiatives. The extension in the Claims Resolution Act provided equal funding of $75 million each for these programs. Congress has options to expand fatherhood programs, such as creating a new funding stream within the CSE program or utilizing existing TANF funds to serve disadvantaged noncustodial parents. TANF funds can be used to support noncustodial parents by continuing established programs, emphasizing employment services and subsidized jobs programs. States may count participants in subsidized employment towards work participation standards. P.L. 112-35 extended TANF grants for healthy marriage, responsible fatherhood, and child care through December 31, 2011. The TANF funding was extended through various bills in 2011 and 2012, including provisions for responsible fatherhood, healthy marriage grants, and child care funds. Cash assistance from TANF cannot be used in strip clubs, liquor stores, or casinos, and states must report data in a standardized format. The TANF funding was extended through bills in 2011 and 2012, requiring states to prevent cash assistance use in liquor stores, casinos, or strip clubs. Failure to implement policies could result in a funding reduction. Additional bills established an Emergency Contingency Fund and proposed reducing the TANF basic block grant. H.R. 2277 (Doggett) extends TANF supplemental grants through FY2011. H.R. 3193 (Fincher) requires drug testing for TANF applicants and recipients. H.R. 3226 (Lee) reestablishes the Emergency Contingency Fund for state TANF programs. H.R. 3573 (Moore) permanently reauthorizes TANF and increases the basic block grant. H.R. 3573 (Moore) would permanently reauthorize TANF, increase the basic block grant for inflation and child population growth, establish open-ended matching grants for subsidized employment, revise the TANF contingency fund, and provide open-ended matching grants for child care. It aims to reduce child poverty as the primary goal, prohibit full family sanctions, require a sanction review process before imposing penalties, set a minimum assistance period of 60 months, determine a family budget for basic needs, and penalize states for inadequate benefits. H.R. 3638 (Grijalva) establishes a $5 billion contingency fund for FY2012 and FY2013. H.R. 3659 (Paulsen) extends TANF grants and prohibits cash assistance use in certain establishments. H.R. 3722 (Pearce) requires drug testing for assistance applicants. S. 83 (Vitter) and H.R. 1769 (Boustany) mandate drug testing for states. S. 83 (Vitter) and H.R. 1769 (Boustany) propose drug testing programs for TANF recipients, with sanctions for those who fail. Various organizations have provided recommendations for TANF reauthorization."
