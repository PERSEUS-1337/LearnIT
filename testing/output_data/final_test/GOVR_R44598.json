    "content": "Active Protection Systems (APSs) are integrated into combat vehicles to automatically respond to threats like RPGs and ATGMs. The U.S. military is incorporating APS into its modernization plans, with potential deployment on thousands of vehicles. Congress is closely monitoring these efforts as the technology evolves. The proliferation of advanced RPGs and ATGMs is a concern for U.S. military officials. RPGs, in particular, are popular with insurgents due to their availability and low cost. Mitigation strategies include installing passive nets and bar armor on vehicles. The proliferation of advanced RPGs and ATGMs poses a threat to military vehicles. Hezbollah, Hamas, and Ukrainian separatists have acquired these weapons, including ones with tandem warheads designed to defeat reactive armor. Israeli Defense Forces lost tanks and soldiers to these ATGMs in a 2006 operation against Hezbollah. The Russian RPG-30, with a 105 mm tandem warhead, can penetrate steel armor, even behind reactive armor, using a decoy rocket feature. The use of advanced RPGs and ATGMs by various armed forces and non-state actors poses a threat to military vehicles. ATGMs offer tactical advantages over weapons like IEDs and RPGs, allowing gunners to attack targets from thousands of meters away. These weapons are utilized by 130 countries and groups like Jabhat al-Nusrah and ISIS in Syria. ATGMs provide tactical advantages by allowing gunners to attack targets from thousands of meters away. However, they can also have disadvantages such as reduced accuracy at extended ranges. Some experts point to Israeli combat experiences in 2006 and 2014 to demonstrate the value of APS. The war ended inconclusively with Israeli ground operations deemed \"ineffective\" due to Hezbollah's use of RPGs and ATGMs. ATGMs caused significant casualties to Israeli tanks and infantry forces. Lessons from the conflict led to the installation of Trophy APS on Israeli tanks and APCs in 2010. In 2014, Israel conducted military operations in response to rocket attacks on its cities and infrastructure. In response to rocket attacks on Israeli cities, military operations were conducted in the Gaza Strip until August 2014. Hamas anti-armor tactics were found to be less effective, with no confirmed IDF tank or Namer heavy APC losses. The Trophy anti-ATGM system on Merkava tanks, along with Israeli tactics, minimized the impact of Hamas anti-tank weapons. The effectiveness of APS against ATGM threats has garnered interest from U.S. defense officials following Israel's combat experiences. With concerns about a resurgent Russia as the top national security threat, the U.S. Army is seen as potentially outgunned by adversaries. The unpredictability of Russian leader Vladimir Putin's reactions has raised the possibility of war in Europe as a priority concern. The Army, Marines, and DOD are concerned about U.S. armored vehicles' vulnerability to anti-tank threats. An effective APS must meet technical and operational criteria, including detecting and classifying incoming projectiles using small radars or sensors, and calculating intercept points away from the vehicle. An effective APS must quickly detect and classify incoming threats, calculate intercept points, and deploy countermeasures to protect vehicles. Hemispheric coverage is ideal to defend against advanced weapons targeting vulnerable areas of armored vehicles. APSs must be able to address multiple incoming attacks, including swarm tactics with RPGs and ATGMs. It is crucial for APSs to quickly reload or \"reconstitute\" after an attack to respond to further threats. Hard-kill APSs detect, engage, and destroy threats before they hit a vehicle. The 2012 report by CBO discusses the \"soft kill\" features of APS, which include infrared jammers, laser spot imitators, and radar jammers. These countermeasures aim to prevent missile guidance from locking onto the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) by causing the missile to miss the target or preventing the warhead from fusing. Implementing countermeasures is challenging as they need to be tailored to specific threats and do not provide universal defense. Jamming techniques may have negative effects on friendly communications and electronic systems. Defensive electronic countermeasures, such as jamming techniques, can have negative effects on friendly communications and electronic systems. Small changes in parameters can greatly impact effectiveness, and the enemy has been adaptive in countering Army's countermeasures. Army officials emphasize the importance of both \"soft kill\" and \"hard kill\" aspects of APS for protection against ATGMs. The Army's focus on \"soft kill\" capabilities against ATGMs includes the use of EO/IR jammers and smoke/obscurants. Challenges in APS engineering are compounded by enemy tactics to neutralize defenses, ranging from sophisticated jammers to overwhelming with rocket-propelled grenades. The challenges of armored vehicle survivability and developmental issues are discussed, with a focus on avoiding unintended casualties. Most active protection systems use explosive rounds, raising concerns about injury to nearby individuals. The automatic launch of intercepting rounds without human intervention adds to these concerns. The United States and Israel have studied the issue of minimizing hazards to people outside vehicles with interceptors. Army officials acknowledge the debate on unintended casualties vs. effectiveness, noting that reactive armor also poses risks. The threat posed by APS to friendly soldiers and civilians may only be reduced, not eliminated, creating a dilemma for the military. Constraints on APS use in close proximity to soldiers or civilians could limit its effectiveness in certain combat scenarios. Hard-kill APS may pose a threat to private property, including religious and historically significant property, due to the risk of collateral damage. The avoidance of collateral damage is a significant concern for the military, potentially limiting the use of APS in combat scenarios involving structures and property. The Army officials are concerned about the potential collateral damage from counter-munitions used in APS, which could limit its effectiveness in combat scenarios. Operational limitations of APS could also provide tactical opportunities for adversaries. The effectiveness of APS on the battlefield is crucial, as technologies under development may not perform as expected in real combat situations. The CBO's 2012 report highlights various battlefield-related considerations, such as the time needed for APS to activate and potential issues with detecting incoming rounds. Enemy radar jammers and clutter can reduce the detection range of active protection systems, causing delays in detecting incoming threats. Once a threat is detected, the system must track it to determine if it poses a danger. While demonstrations show effectiveness in simple scenarios, challenges remain in complex situations with multiple threats and overlapping coverage areas. The challenges of coordinating defensive fire among vehicles equipped with active protection systems (APS) remain unanswered. Questions about communication, potential interference, and allocation of defensive fire from multiple systems in a protected area are technical issues that need solutions. APS may also impact a combat vehicle's electromagnetic signature. The challenges of integrating APS on the battlefield include limiting systems to avoid interference, operating successfully in a complex combat environment, and addressing the \"fog of war\" impact on system performance. APS components include threat detection, tracking, signal processing, and countermeasures systems mounted inside and outside vehicles, requiring power from batteries or vehicle-generated sources. U.S. APS systems could be retrofitted to existing combat vehicles. The challenges of integrating APS on the battlefield include limiting systems to avoid interference, operating successfully in a complex combat environment, and addressing the \"fog of war\" impact on system performance. U.S. APS systems could be retrofitted to existing combat vehicles, but difficulties may arise due to space constraints and power requirements. Legacy combat vehicles like the M-1 Abrams tank were not designed to support the additional size, weight, and power that APS would require. In contrast, vehicles under development are likely to incorporate APS size and power requirements into their design. Army officials point out the Israeli Merkava Mark 4 tank was designed around APS requirements. The Army's Modular Active Protection System (MAPS) effort aims to address challenges in integrating APS on the battlefield. The decision to use closed or open architecture systems will be crucial, with open systems allowing for easier adaptation to enemy tactics. The U.S. defense officials prefer open architecture for new APS development to quickly adapt to emerging threats. The Army is emphasizing open architecture based on DOD guidance and is working with industry to establish standards. Converting \"vendor locked\" APSs to meet safety requirements would incur significant costs. Industry argues their systems are not entirely closed and incorporate modular design features. The Army is considering open architecture for new APS development to adapt to emerging threats. They plan to install APS on M-1 Abrams tanks and expand its use to other armored vehicles. Affordability issues will influence the Army's APS programs. The Army is exploring the use of NDI APS for hundreds of vehicles, which could be costly due to high per-unit costs, training, installation, and maintenance expenses. TARDEC is involved in the design of Active Protection Systems. Active Protection Systems have been in development since the 1950s, with efforts to integrate them onto U.S. platforms facing challenges. DARPA led the development of the SLID system in the late 1990s for military vehicle defense. The Army's CAPS program in 1998 aimed to develop various capabilities for tank protection. APS development was a key focus of the Army's Future Combat System program starting in 1999. The Army's Future Combat System (FCS) program, initiated in 1999, included the development of an Active Protection System (APS) for combat vehicles. Despite the cancellation of the FCS program in 2009, work continued on APS development for urgent operational needs. Other nations have successfully fielded APS technology, with the Soviet Union developing the first operational APS, the Drozd, between 1977 and 1982 to protect against RPGs and ATGMs. The Drozd, developed by the Soviet Union between 1977 and 1982, was an early Active Protection System (APS) designed to protect against RPGs and ATGMs. It used millimeter-wave radar sensors on the tank's turret to detect incoming rounds, providing 80% success against RPGs in Afghanistan. Other countries like France and Israel have also implemented APS technology on their tanks, with Israel using the Trophy APS extensively in combat in 2014. Russia's newest tank, the T-14 Armata, features separate hard kill and soft kill APSs. The T-14 Armata tank from Russia has separate hard kill and soft kill Active Protection Systems (APS). However, the APS on the Armata only protects against threats lateral to the turret, leaving it vulnerable to air-launched guided missiles or top-attack modes. In 2006, Raytheon was awarded a $70 million contract to develop an APS for US combat vehicles, sparking criticism for favoring Raytheon's system over the Israeli-developed Trophy APS, allegedly leading to casualties among US forces in the field. The GAO report found no conflict of interest in the selection of Raytheon for the APS contract, stating that all offers were evaluated based on the same criteria. Raytheon was chosen for its technical merit and likelihood to meet requirements, despite having less mature technology. The Army had concerns about the Trophy system's single-shot capability and believed the Raytheon system would result in less collateral damage. They also noted that the Raytheon system had intercepted live warheads during testing. The Army found that none of the tested APS systems were mature enough for fielding, further development and testing were needed, industry claims were not demonstrated, and there was no U.S. military concept of operations for APS use. In 2013, evaluations revealed that commercially available APS systems were not fully deployable or tested under realistic conditions. In 2013, evaluations by U.S., British, and Canadian officials found that commercially available APS systems were deemed too high risk and not ready for fielding. Army officials now emphasize the need for APS-like capability due to changing battlefield threats. International industry surveys show various active protection systems in use or under development. These systems will require additional funding for testing and validation. The systems listed require additional funding for testing, validation, and integration into vehicles. Rafael claims Trophy is the world's only combat-proven APS with 360-degree protection, high kill probability, and built-in Hostile Fire Detection. Independent tests show minimal risk to civilians and friendly troops. Trophy can operate with other radio frequency systems. Iron Fist is a Soft-and Hard-Kill Active Protection System introduced in 2009 for Israel's Merkava MK4 main battle tank. U.S. Army officials have reservations about Trophy's capabilities, citing its compliance only with Israeli standards and performance claims based on Israeli testing. Iron Fist provides enhanced situational awareness and early warning using infrared and radar sensors. The Iron Fist Active Protection System offers enhanced situational awareness and defense against a variety of Anti-Tank threats. It includes electro-optical jammers, smoke screens, and a hard kill APS. The system has been tested in light and heavy armored vehicles, proving effective with wide angle protection and minimal weight penalty. Iron Fist APS, selected by the Israel Defense Forces for the Namer heavy infantry fighting vehicle, offers wide angle protection with minimal weight penalty. It is an open architecture system that can be integrated with other sensors and countermeasures. Raytheon's Quick Kill APS, developed since 2006, employs a maneuverable countermeasure approach to eject rounds when a threat is detected. Raytheon's Quick Kill APS employs a maneuverable countermeasure approach to eject rounds when a threat is detected. It is a \"hard kill\" system that is simpler, safer, and places a lower power burden on the defended vehicle compared to other APS systems. Quick Kill 2.0 will be compliant with the Army's Modular Active Protection System program. ARTIS produces the Iron Curtain APS, designed to protect against RPGs and shoulder-launched threats using high-speed sensing and parallel processing. Upgrading Iron Curtain to address ATGM threats could cost between $5 million to $24 million. ARTIS developed Iron Curtain to address ATGM threats, with a near-vehicle defeat feature to reduce collateral damage. The system is adaptable for various vehicles and can be upgraded to handle new threats with just software updates. Rheinmetall Defence Systems produces a similar Active Defence System with soft and hard kill defenses. The Active Defence System (ADS) utilizes electro-optical sensors to detect and neutralize threats quickly, with the ability to respond to multiple incoming threats and reduce collateral damage. It can be modified to fit various vehicles and has undergone successful testing. However, additional design work may be needed to meet U.S. safety requirements. Both Army and Marine APS efforts are not formal acquisition programs but vehicle capability assessments and technology demonstrations. The Army is working on two distinct APS efforts - Expedited NDI APS and Modular APS for M-1 Abrams tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles, and Stryker combat vehicles to address evolving threats. The Army's NDI APS plans involve installing and evaluating commercially available APS systems on selected platforms in FY2017 and FY2018. Testing will focus on APS performance and developing a baseline installation kit. Future decisions on NDI APS acquisition will be made in FY2018. The Army is considering acquiring limited NDI APS for use or shelving it for future fielding. Integration efforts include pairing the Trophy system with the M-1 Abrams, the Iron Fist system with the M-2 Bradley, and the Iron Curtain system with the M-1126 Stryker. Additionally, the Army is working on the Modular Active Protection System (MAPS) to enable the integration of APS subsystems for combat vehicles. MAPS is described as a modular framework that can accommodate various technologies without needing to be rewired or upgraded for each new component. The Army is developing the Modular Active Protection System (MAPS) to integrate APS subsystems for combat vehicles, allowing for rapid introduction of new technologies without being locked into a single vendor. They plan to continue developing a MAPS safety-compliant controller and integrating existing NDI APS. If successful, MAPS may transition to a Program of Record in the future. The Marines are conducting a technology demonstration by attempting to install an existing Trophy system. The Marines are conducting a technology demonstration to install an existing Trophy system on the M-1A1 tank, without integrating it with the tank's battle management systems. They are considering the need to \"harden\" the Trophy system for survivability, taking into account their unique amphibious assault mission requirements. The Trophy APS will likely require additional armor protection to withstand small arms and artillery fire in the Marines' anticipated operational environment. The Marines are considering adding an APS capability to their M-1A1 tanks, which would require additional armor protection. This could result in a 2.5 to 3-ton increase in vehicle weight, impacting its transportability by ship and ship-to-shore connectors like the LCAC. The added weight may also affect the tank's performance and maintainability. The Marine Corps is exploring the possibility of adding an APS to M-1A1 tanks, which could impact their transportability on ships like the LCAC. The addition of APS components may require dismounting before loading onto ships to maintain the load plan. Maintenance and corrosion protection for APS components during lengthy ship embarks are also key considerations. The House and Senate committees included APS-related provisions in their FY2017 authorization and appropriations acts, supporting the Army's strategy for vehicle APS tests and integration to address threats from anti-tank guided missiles and rocket-propelled grenades. The importance of vehicle APS capabilities for forward-deployed units, especially in the U.S. European Command area of operations, is acknowledged, with encouragement for expedited deployment. The committee supports expediting deployment of vehicle APS technology on ground combat vehicles for the European Reassurance Initiative. They encourage testing on Abrams, Bradley, and Stryker vehicles, and suggest exploring APS solutions for lighter-weight vehicles. The Secretary of the Army is directed to provide a briefing on deployment plans by March 1, 2017. The committee recommends increasing funding for the integration of active protection systems (APS) on Army armored fighting vehicles. Additional funding for APS was also included in the Chief of Staff of the Army's unfunded priority list. The Army is encouraged to rapidly acquire effective APS to protect ground combat vehicles. The committee recommends increasing funding for the integration of active protection systems (APS) on Army armored fighting vehicles, with key vehicles like M1 main battle tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles being a priority. The committee encourages the Army to acquire mature APS technology from allies for testing and integration, believing it will enhance force protection and combat power for close combat maneuver forces. The committee recommends prioritizing the acquisition of effective active protection systems (APS) for key armored fighting vehicles like M1 main battle tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles to protect ground combat forces from projectiles. They encourage the Army to integrate mature APS technology from allies to enhance force protection and combat power. Additionally, a pilot program for nontraditional contractors and small businesses is proposed for disruptive innovation prototyping. A pilot program is proposed for nontraditional contractors and small businesses to develop innovative military platforms. $250,000,000 from the Rapid Prototype Fund will be used for this program, established within the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Special Operations Command. The Secretary of Defense will submit a funding plan to Congress alongside the 2018 Department of Defense budget. The Secretary of Defense will submit a plan to Congress for funding and executing a pilot program for nontraditional contractors and small businesses to develop innovative military platforms. The plan will consider various methods to maximize use of resources and allocate up to $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2017. The Secretary of Defense will allocate up to $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2017 for a pilot program involving innovative military platforms such as swarming unmanned air vehicles, modular fixed-wing aircraft, vertical take-off and landing tiltrotor aircraft, directed energy weapons, unmanned underwater vehicles, small SAR satellites, active protection systems, and other designated systems. The Committee urges the Secretary of the Army to develop new armament systems for combat vehicles to enhance lethality and maintain technical superiority. The authority under this section expires on September 30, 2026. The Committee recommends developing new armament systems for combat vehicles to provide lethality overmatch and defeat multiple target sets, including active protection systems. An additional $10,000,000 is allocated for testing active protection systems to enhance survivability against threats like rocket-propelled grenades. The Marine Corps is leveraging Army investments on Abrams tanks, and the Secretary of the Navy is directed to consider similar demonstrations. The Senate report recommended developing new armament systems for combat vehicles, including active protection systems to enhance survivability against threats like rocket-propelled grenades. The Department of Defense approved a budget reprogramming request for the Army, adding $16.8 million for an expedited Non-Developmental Item Active Protection System effort on the Stryker vehicle to assess the 'Iron Curtain' APS system's reliability in mitigating RPG threats. This funding supports procurement of two prototype hardware solutions for integration onto the Stryker vehicle. The Army approved a budget reprogramming request to add $16.8 million for an expedited Non-Developmental Item Active Protection System effort on the Stryker vehicle to assess the 'Iron Curtain' APS system's reliability in mitigating RPG threats. An additional $11.0 million is allocated to support an expedited NDI APS effort on the Bradley vehicle to assess the 'Iron Fist' APS system's reliability against Anti-Tank Guided Missiles and RPGs. This funding will procure 4 prototype APS systems for assessment. The Army approved a budget reprogramming request to add $16.8 million for an expedited Non-Developmental Item Active Protection System effort on the Stryker vehicle to assess the 'Iron Curtain' APS system's reliability in mitigating RPG threats. An additional $11.0 million is allocated to support an expedited NDI APS effort on the Bradley vehicle to assess the 'Iron Fist' APS system's reliability against Anti-Tank Guided Missiles and RPGs. The estimated total cost of this effort is $26.3 million (FY2016, $11.0 million; FY2017, $15.3 million). Army officials noted that battlefield threats and the operational environment have changed, potentially driving the need for an APS-like capability. In 2010, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates criticized the services for seeking perfect solutions, suggesting a 70 to 80 percent solution in five years is better than waiting for a perfect outcome. Congress may need to examine the Army's and Marines' requirements for Non-Developmental Item Active Protection Systems (NDI APS) to determine if they are rushing to field a less-capable APS due to perceived threats. The Army is facing budget constraints in developing Non-Developmental Item Active Protection Systems (NDI APS) and Modular Active Protection Systems (MAPS). Dr. Daniel Gour\u00e9 suggests that the Army should consider buying NDI APS if it proves effective, rather than waiting for a perfect solution. The Army is considering the use of Modular Active Protection Systems (MAPS) to rapidly introduce new technologies and prevent vendor lock-in. Congress may need to examine the analytical basis for these assertions and potential areas for further examination include projected savings compared to integrating an APS directly into combat systems. The Army is evaluating the cost savings of using Modular Active Protection Systems (MAPS) compared to integrating an APS directly into combat vehicles. They are also considering the safety costs of installing NDI APS components on vehicles versus on existing MAPS architecture. Additionally, the impact on vehicle survivability and the potential budgetary limitations of outfitting combat vehicles with NDI APS are being assessed. In the near future, cost increases may impact longer-term MAPS efforts. Congress should examine MAPS-related technological and engineering considerations for effectiveness and cost. Concerns exist about potential degradation of NDI APS responsiveness and effectiveness when operating through MAPS interfaces. Industry worries about technical \"mismatch\" between commercially developed APS and DOD/Army MAPS requirements. Commercial technology advancements challenge DOD's ability to keep pace with technology adoption and countermeasures. Industry representatives have concerns about potential cost increases and technical mismatches in integrating APS systems into MAPS. The Army and Marines are in early phases of technology demonstration for APS efforts, requiring more detailed information as the projects progress for congressional oversight. The Army and Marines are in early phases of technology demonstration for APS efforts, requiring more detailed information as the projects progress for congressional oversight. Details needed include types of vehicles considered for NDI APS and/or MAPS installation, assessment of APS suitability for various mission profiles, number of vehicles by class to receive APS, and whether both Active and Reserve component vehicles will receive APS. The Army and Marines are in early phases of technology demonstration for APS efforts, requiring more detailed information as the projects progress for congressional oversight. Congress may wish to examine the adaptability of APS and MAPS in detecting and defeating various threats such as precision artillery, hypersonic missiles, and advanced electronic warfare. The Army and Marines are developing APS and MAPS to counter threats like attack helicopters, UAS, hypersonic missiles, and electronic defeat technologies. Understanding their capabilities and adaptability is crucial for Congress to evaluate the effectiveness of these efforts."
