    "content": "An array of budget process reform proposals are annually presented to refine the federal budget process. These proposals aim to establish legal mandates for specific budgetary objectives, such as a limit on deficit levels or a balanced budget. This report specifically focuses on creating a statutory limit on total spending, known as an overall spending cap. This cap includes long-term limits on federal spending, covering discretionary and direct spending. The report focuses on creating a statutory limit on total spending, including discretionary and direct spending. The proposed measures include an automatic enforcement mechanism for the spending limit, distinguishing it from other mechanisms without such enforcement. Total spending limits would be established annually in statute, informing Congress of projected spending totals. Congress would be informed of projected overall spending totals and potential breaches of statutory spending limits. If a breach occurs, automatic enforcement mechanisms would impose spending reductions, with possible exemptions for specific programs and suspension of enforcement during certain circumstances like war. The recent growth in spending has led to support for total spending caps, with some groups recommending detailed total spending limits. Some legislative proposals have been introduced in the 112th Congress, including S. 245 by Senator Bob Corker and H.R. 1605 by Representative John J. Duncan Jr. The House-passed budget resolution for FY2012, H.Con.Res. 34, includes a policy statement on budget enforcement calling for total spending limits. H.R. 2560, passed by the House, includes total spending limits for FY2013-FY2021. Total spending limits aim to address the recent growth in federal spending, with total federal outlays increasing from 18.2% of GDP in FY2000 to 23.8% in FY2010. Concerns have risen over the growing deficit and debt levels, with projections showing total outlays reaching 24.0% of GDP in FY2021. The budget deficit has been at record highs from 2009 to 2011, raising worries about its impact on the nation's fiscal and economic health. The budget deficit from 2009 to 2011 has been the highest ever in dollar terms and as a share of GDP since World War II. The federal debt is projected to continue growing faster than GDP, leading to concerns about sustainability. Lawmakers suggest a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases to address the deficit, while proponents of spending limits focus on reducing spending primarily. Investors may eventually refuse to finance unsustainable deficits. Statutory spending limits aim to reduce spending to address the growing deficit, complementing the congressional budget resolution. These limits provide a more stringent enforcement mechanism compared to points of order raised in budgetary legislation. Statutory spending limits would establish a more stringent enforcement mechanism to cut already enacted spending, overcoming institutional barriers. This automatic reduction mechanism ensures spending cuts even without legislative agreement on specific programs to cut. Setting total spending caps would establish a federal budgetary policy that facilitates agreement on substantive policy changes to achieve spending limits, alleviating future controversy over appropriate spending levels. No alignment is required between the President's budget proposal and the congressional budget resolution, but statutory limits on total spending would likely require alignment. Setting total spending caps would create a consistent federal budget policy despite changes in leadership. However, implementing spending limits may face challenges due to uncertainties in economic projections and unforeseen events impacting spending levels. Budget decisions based on projections are sensitive to small changes and subject to significant margins of error. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimates that budget deficit projections have margins of error, making programmatic changes based on projections likely to over- or under-shoot intended goals. Unforeseen events add uncertainty beyond current trends in fiscal and economic activity. Legislative spending increases in the past decade were influenced by these factors. Many legislative spending increases in the past decade were due to unforeseen events like the terrorist attacks of September 11, ongoing military operations, natural disasters, and the 2008 financial crisis. Implementing statutory spending caps may limit Congress's flexibility in responding to future unforeseen events, but proposals include mechanisms like waivers or emergency exemptions to address such situations. However, creating exemption mechanisms could compromise the overall goals of statutory spending caps. The inclusion of direct spending in overall spending targets poses intricate complications due to its automatic funding through permanent laws, unlike discretionary spending. Direct spending programs, making up over half of federal spending, are difficult to control or limit as they operate based on established criteria and payment formulas. The inclusion of direct spending in overall spending targets presents challenges as it is funded automatically through permanent laws. Adjusting eligibility criteria or payment formulas is necessary to control spending levels, but accurately predicting the budgetary impact of policy changes is difficult. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) report discusses challenges in capping mandatory spending, such as uncertainties in predicting costs and savings due to changes in eligibility criteria and non-cash benefits. These uncertainties make it difficult for Congress to achieve desired funding levels and complicate enforcement mechanisms like sequestration. The challenges in capping mandatory spending include uncertainties in predicting costs and savings due to changes in eligibility criteria and non-cash benefits. Implementing a direct spending program with a 4% automatic reduction is unclear, making it difficult to determine necessary policy changes to save money. Criticisms of spending limit proposals include concerns about accepting suboptimal solutions, increased conflict within Congress, and reliance on automatic reductions for budget fulfillment. Spending limit proposals may not always lead to reductions in debt or deficits as they do not consider revenue levels. Even if Congress adheres to specific spending limits to balance the budget, a deficit may still exist if revenue decreases due to economic conditions. Some argue that addressing a deficit or debt issue requires both spending cuts and revenue increases, suggesting a combination of changes to spending and revenue is necessary. Placing a cap on total spending may not reduce public debt unless revenue levels exceed spending levels to create a surplus for debt repayment. Placing a cap on total spending without limits on revenue decreases could lead to the conversion of spending programs into tax expenditures, favoring high-income households and corporations. This shift in policy emphasis may result in the deficit staying the same or growing, as spending limit proposals focus on procedure rather than direct policy changes to achieve budgetary goals. Some argue that budget process reforms may not address the actual budgetary problem, as they could be seen as a distraction from making tough policy decisions. Implementing spending limits should be accompanied by a policy package to achieve the desired purpose, as seen in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act of 1985. The Deficit Control Act of 1985, known as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, set annual deficit targets without including spending reductions or revenue increases due to lack of agreement. In contrast, the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, with discretionary spending limits and PAYGO, was successful as part of a reconciliation bill that reduced the deficit. Budget process mechanisms enforce agreements rather than force them, as noted by a former CBO director. Proposals for total spending caps specify actual limits in various forms. Proposals for spending limits specify actual limits in various forms, such as capping or freezing spending at a specific rate linked to economic or demographic factors like GDP, inflation, or population growth. Examples include S. 245 and H.R. 2560 setting outlays as a percentage of GDP for specific fiscal years. H.R. 4529 also proposed spending limits as a percentage of GDP, fluctuating between 21.6% and 24.1% before decreasing steadily over time. Some outside Congress recommend capping total spending to allow increases at inflation rate plus population growth or at inflation rate minus 1%. H.R. 5323 proposed limiting spending increases based on Consumer Price Index and annual population growth. Spending limits in proposals range from 24.8289% to 13% of GDP, compared to 23.8% in FY2010 and 25.0% in FY2009. The proposed federal spending levels in H.R. 4529 (111th Congress) would have been the lowest since 1941, with differing proposals on spending limits based on projected or actual levels of annual spending. Congress must make spending projections if relying on them, especially for total spending that includes challenging-to-project direct spending. Congress may need to pass legislation to adjust spending projections to meet statutory limits. Success in adhering to spending limits depends on enacting adequate spending reductions. However, inaccurate projections may result in not meeting the limits. If actual spending exceeds projections, Congress may not meet the limits despite legislative adjustments based on initial projections. In cases where actual spending surpasses projections, Congress may struggle to meet statutory limits, even with legislative adjustments. Suggestions include a \"look back\" provision to consider both projected and actual spending levels for compliance with limits, potentially leading to automatic reductions if actual spending significantly exceeds projections. Some proposals for total spending caps include exemptions and waivers to provide flexibility for Congress in budgetary decisions. Exemptions protect certain programs, while waivers allow for flexibility in dealing with future circumstances. Certain programs may be exempt from automatic enforcement mechanisms, and some proposals exempt specific spending, such as interest payments on the national debt. Exemptions create the potential for significant spending that is not subject to the limits. Some proposals include waivers to set aside spending limits and enforcement mechanisms under specific circumstances. Waivers may require a super-majority vote in either chamber to waive points of order. Additionally, proposals provide methods to waive or suspend overall spending limits in certain situations. Some proposals allow for waivers to suspend overall spending limits in specific situations, such as during war or economic downturns. Past statutory budget controls, like the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, have provided flexibility in the event of a recession, allowing Congress to enact joint resolutions to suspend deficit reduction provisions. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of 1987 allowed for the suspension of sequestration through joint resolutions introduced by the House or Senate majority leader. Similarly, H.R. 4529 in the 111th Congress included a provision for modifying the sequestration order through expedited procedures. Total spending limits with automatic enforcement mechanisms are discussed in the report. The report discusses automatic enforcement mechanisms for spending limits, which can be implemented after legislative action fails to meet the targets. This can involve automatic reductions or points of order raised during consideration of spending legislation in Congress. The report discusses automatic enforcement mechanisms for spending limits in Congress, which rely on Members raising points of order on the House or Senate floor against legislation that would exceed the limits. Points of order can be waived, typically through a special rule or by unanimous consent. Some proposals may require a super majority to waive points of order. Points of order in Congress may be made more difficult to waive by requiring a super majority, like two-thirds or three-fifths of the chamber to agree. They are often criticized for relying on elective action by Members and their potential for being waived. Points of order can only apply to new spending legislation, not previously enacted laws, which make up about 55% of total spending. Current mechanisms in the budget process rely solely on points of order to enforce spending levels, such as in the budget resolution. The automatic enforcement mechanisms in proposals for total spending limits aim to enforce limits on spending resulting from existing legislation. These mechanisms involve automatic cuts to spending programs when limits are exceeded, typically implemented by the President through programmatic spending reductions. Sequestration, as an enforcement mechanism, has been used in various budget and budget process reform acts to enforce spending limits and deficit targets. It is currently utilized to enforce Statutory PAYGO and is included in multiple proposals in Congress. The OMB conducts sequestration within 45 days of a fiscal year to eliminate excess outlays. Certain programs are exempt from across-the-board cuts, like Social Security, SNAP, and veterans' programs, totaling half of federal spending in 2010. In 2010, exemptions from across-the-board cuts accounted for half of federal spending. Some proposals, like H.R. 4529 (111th Congress), would protect payments for certain programs from reduction. Sequestration under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings tailored cuts to specific programs, such as Medicare and veterans' medical care, by only 1% in 1986 and 2% in subsequent years. Exempting certain programs from sequestration cuts would require larger cuts to non-exempt programs to achieve overall spending reduction. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus stated that exempting Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security would result in cuts too large for other programs to bear. Some proposals suggest that the amount of spending reduction should match the breach of the spending limit, with limits on how much can be cut through the automatic reduction mechanism. Some proposals suggest that if spending limits are not met, a sequestration will occur making cuts to all non-exempt spending programs. The maximum reduction achievable through a sequester would reduce overall spending to the level of the previous year. Some proposals may allow for cuts under sequestration to apply differently to different categories of spending. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (BEA) created a \"firewall\" between discretionary spending and direct spending, setting caps for discretionary spending enforced by sequestration. Cuts under sequestration applied differently to various spending categories, with reductions mainly affecting non-exempt discretionary programs. S. 245 proposes dividing spending into three categories for sequestration: direct spending, discretionary security spending, and discretionary non-security spending. Each category would receive a reduction based on the growth in outlays from the previous fiscal year, ensuring uniform cuts across programs. This process aims to prevent deficit increases and enforce fiscal responsibility. One proposal to address potential difficulties with sequestration is to protect programs already reduced through legislative action from automatic cuts. This could involve exempting them from cuts or limiting the amount of cuts. Expedited parliamentary procedures may be included to allow Congress to pass legislation meeting spending targets and avoid automatic reductions. These procedures, known as \"fast-track\" procedures, ensure timely consideration and voting on specific legislation. Under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, the President's sequestration order was due September 1 but would not take effect until October 15, giving Congress time to pass deficit reduction legislation. The act provided expedited procedures for Senate consideration of such legislation, treating it as reconciliation bills. S. 245 allows for Congressional action based on OMB projections, directing committees to change existing laws to meet deficit reduction goals. H.R. 4529 (111 th Congress) included expedited procedures for the consideration of spending reduction legislation, allowing for the introduction of a joint resolution to modify or provide an alternative to eliminate excess spending after the OMB director issues a final sequestration order. The Senate proposed measures to limit debate and amendments, with the goal of reducing total spending. The effectiveness of these mechanisms in actually reducing spending is questioned based on historical experience. Further examination is needed to determine the likely success of these proposals in achieving spending reductions. One assumption behind spending limit proposals is that spending reductions will be achieved through legislative action, not automatic enforcement. Congress and the President would need to negotiate an agreement on the reductions. If a limit on total spending is in place, an agreement to reduce spending might result if certain conditions are met. The imposition of statutory spending limits may lead Congress and the President to agree on budgetary policies, but adherence to these limits is not guaranteed. Budget policies are often set in the congressional budget resolution and the President's budget request, but unforeseen circumstances or shifting priorities can lead to deviations. Additionally, the threat of enforcement mechanisms may compel a negotiated compromise. The enforcement mechanism in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act was intended to force compromise through the threat of sequestration, but it did not always lead to the desired outcome. Sequestration was used in FY1986 and FY1990 when deficit targets were not met, leading to doubts about its effectiveness in prompting action. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act's sequestration mechanism was intended to prompt compromise but was not always effective. Despite some success in reaching deficit reduction agreements, the fear of sequestration has diminished over time, leading to doubts about its deterrent effect. President George H.W. Bush and Congress avoided sequestration in 1990 through a deficit reduction agreement. President Bush accepted revenue increases in a deficit reduction agreement in 1990 to avoid a sequester that would have significantly cut spending. Congress and the President may find it easier to allow automatic budget enforcement mechanisms to take effect rather than negotiate agreements, as inaction may be preferred. The design of automatic reductions and exempt programs play a crucial role in promoting negotiated solutions. Proponents of negotiated solutions may face challenges in designing unattractive enforcement mechanisms to promote agreements, as lawmakers may fear their use despite intentions. The threat of automatic reductions may not always lead to spending negotiation but can deter new program spending. Gramm-Rudman-Hollings was noted for hindering new initiatives by limiting, delaying, or reducing spending. Compliance with statutory spending limits is another assumption made by proponents. Compliance with statutory spending limits may not always result in actual spending reductions, as exemptions for \"emergency spending\" can lead to significant spending outside the limits. For example, emergency spending levels increased during the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, reaching $47 billion in FY2002. Compliance with statutory requirements does not always guarantee intended reductions in spending. Compliance with statutory spending limits can be achieved through various accounting devices that discount the actual effects of spending, such as advance appropriations or delaying obligations. Projections can be manipulated to appear compliant with limits even if actual spending exceeds target levels due to sensitivity to underlying assumptions. Optimistic assumptions can also be used to adjust projected levels to facilitate compliance. Under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, enacted spending legislation technically complied with budget limits, despite the deficit not decreasing as specified. Former CBO Director Robert D. Reischauer criticized the act for promoting reliance on optimistic assumptions and budget gimmicks. Compliance with the act did not lead to meaningful deficit reduction, as budgetary gimmicks added billions in costs over time. Budget projections under the act were deemed unrealistic. The Budget Enforcement Act limits OMB's flexibility in correcting inaccurate estimates and technical mistakes, making deficit projections unreliable. Advocacy for spending limits assumes future Congresses will adhere to them, but history shows interventions to alter the process. Congress passed the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act in 1987 when deficit targets were not met under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-119) revised deficit targets upward and extended the period to achieve a balanced budget. Congress passed legislation to avoid sequestration in years where deficit limits were expected to be breached. For example, the Military Construction Appropriations Act for FY2001 (P.L. 106-246) included a provision to prevent sequestration. Additionally, Congress exempted new spending and revenue legislation from applicable limits in some years, such as the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 (P.L. 106-113). The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of 1987 revised deficit targets and extended the period to achieve a balanced budget. Legislation was passed to avoid sequestration in years where deficit limits were expected to be breached. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 included provisions exempted from PAYGO scoring. Similarly, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2001 and Defense Appropriations Act for FY2002 reset the PAYGO balance to zero to avoid sequestration. The director reset the balances of the PAYGO scorecard for FY2001 and FY2002 to zero, removing $130.27 billion from budgetary enforcement. Despite potential complications and criticism of budgetary devices, spending limits can help reduce spending by focusing political and public attention. Automatic reduction mechanisms, if allowed to operate as prescribed, will reduce spending compared to current projected levels. Former CBO director noted the success of a similar enforcement mechanism, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, in preventing deficit escalation.

The current measures have not brought the deficit cows back into the barn, but they have kept them from stampeding over the cliff."
