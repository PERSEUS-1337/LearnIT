Annual reports on workload of United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims are required. The chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims must annually submit a report to the Senate and House Committees on Veterans Affairs summarizing the Court's workload for the previous fiscal year.

Annual report on expansion of facilities for United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is currently located in a commercial office building in the District of Columbia. A feasibility analysis in 2006 proposed a dedicated Veterans Courthouse and Justice Center. In 2007, the Court suggested leasing more space in the current location, which would involve relocating other government tenants. The General Services Administration's 2006 feasibility report did not analyze the feasibility of locating a Veterans Courthouse and Justice Center at the current Court location. Congress believes the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims should have suitable office space without disrupting other Federal entities. The Administrator of General Services must submit a report within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Administrator of General Services must submit a report to the Senate and House Committees on Veterans' Affairs regarding the feasibility of leasing additional space for the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims and using the entire building as a Veterans Courthouse and Justice Center. The report should include an analysis of the impact on Federal tenants of the building used by the Court. The Administrator of General Services must submit a report to the Senate and House Committees on Veterans' Affairs regarding the feasibility of relocating Federal tenants to office space that offers similar or preferable cost, convenience, and usable square footage. If relocation is not desirable, then the cost of constructing a new facility for use as a Veterans Courthouse and Justice Center should be considered. A comment period will be provided to Federal tenants before the completion of the report. Before the report is completed, Federal tenants will have the opportunity to comment on the subject and a draft of the report before it is submitted to congressional committees."
