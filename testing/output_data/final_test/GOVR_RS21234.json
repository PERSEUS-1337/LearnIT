Approximately 1.1 million metric tons of wheat remain in the Trust, with no funds ever being held. The Trust can release up to 500,000 metric tons of commodities for urgent humanitarian relief. The Bill Emerson Trust holds up to 4 million metric tons of wheat, corn, sorghum, and rice for emergency humanitarian food needs in developing countries. It can release up to 500,000 metric tons of eligible commodities for urgent relief. Commodities in the Trust can be exchanged for other U.S. commodities of equal value. The Trust is managed by the Commodity Credit Corporation, and when commodities are released, the CCC incurs a loss. The CCC incurs a loss when commodities are released from the Trust, and is reimbursed by P.L. 480 for the commodity costs based on actual costs or export market price. Reimbursement for non-commodity costs is through USDA appropriations. Funds for releases can come from past, current, or subsequent unobligated P.L. 480 funds. Commodities released for P.L. 480 programs are paid for from current fiscal year funds. The Trust may be replenished with commodities acquired through purchases from producers or the market, authorized by an appropriation act. The origins of the Trust date back to the 1970s when Congress debated creating a grain reserve for global food security. In the 1970s, Congress debated creating a grain reserve for global food security. Supporters argued that a reserve would strengthen farm prices during excess production, while others believed a fund with dollar resources would provide more flexibility in meeting urgent needs. The debate was overtaken by events in 1979 when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, leading to an embargo on U.S. grain shipments. To prevent revenue loss and adverse impacts on domestic commodity prices, the CCC offered to purchase grain previously committed to the USSR. The CCC acquired 4 million metric tons of wheat to establish a grain reserve in response to the Soviet Union embargo. The Food Security Wheat Reserve Act of 1980 codified this move to guarantee a wheat supply in times of need. The Act allowed wheat from the reserve to be used in the P.L. 480 program if unavailable through normal channels. The 1996 farm bill transformed the wheat reserve into the FSCR, including corn, sorghum, and rice, with criteria for stock release. The 1996 legislation increased the amount of commodities that could be released through the P.L. 480 Title II donations program each fiscal year to meet unanticipated needs without regard to the domestic supply situation. It also allowed the release of additional eligible commodities for urgent humanitarian relief. The 1996 Act removed the deadline for replenishing the reserve after stocks had been released. The 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171) extends the Emerson Trust through FY2007, established in the 1998 Africa Seeds of Hope Act. Wheat from the reserve was used on six occasions from 1980 to 1996 for P.L. 480 commitments and emergency needs. President Reagan released wheat in 1984 for famine relief, and in 1988, 1.5 million tons were authorized due to the U.S. drought. Corn, sorghum, and rice are eligible commodities for the reserve since 1996, but only wheat has been held. In response to supply shortages caused by the U.S. drought of 1988, President Bush authorized the release of 2 million metric tons of wheat for P.L. 480 program commitments. Additional releases were made in 1991 for disaster relief needs and in 1994 for emergency assistance to the Caucasus region. President Clinton delegated authority in 1996 to release up to 1.5 million tons of wheat for the program due to limited commercial availability. The P.L. 480 program faced limited availability of wheat in commercial markets, leading to the authorization of 1,280,779 tons for use. Section 401 of P.L. 480 requires the Secretary of Agriculture to determine available agricultural commodities for food aid programs, ensuring domestic supply is not compromised. In FY1996, USDA revised its initial estimate of 1.8 million metric tons of wheat for P.L. 480 due to lower-than-expected crop size. In January 1996, wheat prices rose to $4.83 per bushel due to lower-than-expected crop size. The USDA estimated 452 million bushels of wheat stocks for the 1996 marketing year, with a stocks-to-use ratio of just under 20%. The Secretary of Agriculture requested presidential authority to release up to 1.5 million metric tons of wheat from the FSWR for P.L. 480 programming in FY1996. In 2002 and 2003, releases from the Trust included 275,000 tons of wheat in June 2002 and 300,000 tons in August 2002 for humanitarian relief in southern Africa. In FY2003, the Secretary announced releases of 200,000 tons for emergency food needs in the Horn of Africa and 600,000 tons for emergency needs in Iraq. Of the 600,000 tons for Iraq, 200,000 will be made immediately available and 400,000 tons as needed. Concerns about price-depressing effects prevented wheat exchanges for rice. An estimated 1.1 million metric tons remain in the Trust. Experience with reimbursement and replenishment began in FY1985 with 300,000 metric tons of wheat reimbursed with $45 million of unobligated appropriations. In FY1987, P.L. 480 Title I and Title II appropriations were used to meet urgent humanitarian needs. The CCC was reimbursed $28 million in various ways, including unobligated balances and ocean freight differentials. Reimbursement for released commodities was done using current year P.L. 480 appropriations. Replenishing the Trust after releases can be done through purchasing or designating stocks from CCC inventories. In FY1985, wheat from CCC inventories was designated as replenishment for wheat sent to Sub-Saharan Africa. Initially, CCC policy was to immediately replace any drawdown of the reserve with available CCC inventory. In 1988, CCC changed its policy and entered into long-term contracts with warehousemen to designate wheat as part of the reserve, saving on storage costs. In 1990, USDA designated uncommitted CCC-owned wheat to the Food Security Wheat Reserve, restoring it to its full capacity by March 1991. The reserve was not replenished after drawdowns in 1994 and 1996. The Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2003 provided funds for the first replenishment of the Trust since 1990. The Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2003 provided funds for the first replenishment of the Trust since 1990, due to large humanitarian food aid needs in Africa and Iraq in FY2003. Reimbursement of the Trust is likely to be postponed to subsequent fiscal years."
