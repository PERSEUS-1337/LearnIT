    "content": "On September 8, 2008, President George W. Bush withdrew the proposed U.S.-Russia nuclear cooperation agreement due to military actions by Russia against Georgia. The agreement was removed from further congressional consideration, with the possibility of future reconsideration. This report will not be updated as a result of these developments. The report outlines the procedures for congressional approval of nuclear cooperation agreements, known as \"123 agreements,\" with Russia. These agreements must undergo a 90-day congressional review period before going into effect, unless a joint resolution disapproving the agreement is enacted. The report discusses legislative proceedings related to the proposed agreement with Russia, focusing on questions about implementation and intent of statutory requirements. It addresses issues such as submission to the President, introduction of resolutions of disapproval or approval, automatic discharge requirements, and potential congressional actions. The procedural regulations for congressional action on the nuclear cooperation agreement with Russia depend on three key features: no exemption needed for meeting requirements, provisions for \"large reactors,\" and limited to civil uses. The procedural regulations for congressional action on nuclear cooperation agreements with Russia include provisions for \"large reactors\" and cover only civil uses of atomic energy. The agreement may go into effect unless Congress disapproves it before a specified point. The President must submit the agreement to the Senate and House Committees for consultation, accompanied by a Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement for agreements not involving military-related uses. If the agreement involves large reactors, additional supporting documents must be submitted to Congress for a 60-day period. The President must submit nuclear cooperation agreements with Russia to Congress, including supporting documents, for a 60-day period. During this time, committees hold hearings and can recommend disapproval through a joint resolution. President Bush submitted the proposed agreement for civil nuclear cooperation with the Russian Federation to Congress on May 13, 2008, following the required procedures outlined for such agreements. The President submitted the civil nuclear cooperation agreement with Russia to Congress, including the necessary unclassified NPAS and a classified annex. This submission met the requirements of the Atomic Energy Act for the 30-day and 60-day review periods to begin. The President's letter stated that this submission fulfilled sections 123.b. and 123.d. of the Act. The President submitted the civil nuclear cooperation agreement with Russia to Congress, meeting the requirements of the Atomic Energy Act for review periods to begin. The agreement stipulated a 60-day period following a 30-day period, aligning with past practices of both the President and Congress. The President's message was referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. A joint resolution of disapproval was introduced in the House on May 14, 2008. On June 12, a hearing was held in the House Committee on Foreign Affairs regarding the U.S.-Russia agreement on nuclear weapons. John C. Rood testified as a witness. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations received a closed briefing on the same topic on June 17. The 30-day consultation period ended on June 23, and on June 24, joint resolutions were submitted in the House regarding the agreement. The House and Senate received resolutions to approve the U.S.-Russia nuclear cooperation agreement. The agreement specifies time periods in days of continuous session, with specific rules for session continuity and adjournments. The provision ensures that a period of continuous session only ends with the final adjournment of a Congress. Any day when either house is in a recess is not counted in the length of a continuous session. This prevents agreements from taking effect when Congress is not in session or adjourns before acting on a disapproval resolution. Congress can adjourn for more than three days by ending its annual session or taking a recess within the session. The \"non-legislative periods,\" or \"state\" work periods customarily scheduled around Memorial Day and Independence Day each year. Both houses grant consent through a concurrent resolution. The continuity of session is broken when Congress adjourns its last session for a sine die adjournment. The count of \"days of continuous session\" pauses on days when either house is not in session for a recess of more than three days. If both houses adjourn from Friday to Tuesday, the days in session count as continuous session. The days of continuous session in Congress are counted from the preceding week to the following week, including the extended weekend. However, the term of the 110th Congress expires on January 3, 2009, and must adjourn sine die before then. The sine die adjournment will end the period of continuous session. The sine die adjournment on June 12 will end the current period of continuous session in Congress. If Congress adjourns without acting on the proposed agreement before completing 90 days of continuous session, the agreement will not take effect until the next session begins. The 90-day period is measured separately in each house and only includes days when that house is in session. After President Bush submitted the nuclear cooperation agreement with Russia on May 13, 2008, Congress remained in continuous session until May 22, totaling nine days. The count of days pauses when either house takes a recess of more than three days, and resumes when both houses are back in session. After President Bush submitted the nuclear cooperation agreement with Russia on May 13, 2008, Congress remained in continuous session until May 22, totaling nine days. The House then entered a recess for Memorial Day, pausing the count of days of continuous session. On June 3, when the House reconvened, the count resumed, making that day the 10th day of continuous session. June 23 was the 30th day of continuous session, marking the end of the 30-day period for consultation. June 24 became the first day of the 60-day period for congressional action. Both houses adjourned for the Independence Day non-legislative period, with the House's recess extending from June 27 through July 7, and the Senate's from July 1. The House recessed from June 27 to July 7, while the Senate recessed from July 1 to July 6. The House's longer recess defined the excluded period from the count of continuous session days. The House had 33 days of continuous session before the recess on June 26, and 34 days upon return on July 8. Congress then entered a non-legislative period until September 8. The Senate held pro forma sessions to avoid adjournments over three days, while the House did not schedule any. The House did not schedule pro forma sessions during the recess, leading to an adjournment of more than three days. The count of continuous session days paused during this period. The House projected adjournment sine die on September 26, while the Senate did not provide a projection. If both chambers follow their schedules, September 8 will be the 59th day of continuous session. If Congress adjourns on September 26, 2008, before the 90th day of continuous session, the agreement with Russia will not take effect until the 111th Congress convenes. If Congress does not adjourn on September 26 and reaches the 90th day on October 9, the agreement could take effect on that date. The proposed agreement's fate depends on timely congressional action. If a disapproval resolution is vetoed by the President, the agreement will go into effect unless Congress can override the veto within 90 days. Congress may struggle to prevent the agreement from taking effect if initial action on the disapproval resolution is not completed by around the 88th day of continuous session. The 110th Congress could alter its session's duration in several ways, including adopting resolutions for additional recesses or reconvening for a \"lame duck\" session after the election. Congress could be reconvened by its leadership or the President's constitutional authority. Pro forma sessions could convert a scheduled recess into a continuous session, as seen in recent election years. The 110th Congress may avoid a \"lame duck session\" after the election by concluding business before election day. If a recess occurs, the 90th day of continuous session will depend on the dates of recess and reconvening. For example, if Congress recesses on September 26 and reconvenes on November 12, the 90th day could be on November 24. If the 110th Congress remains in session until a certain date without a disapproval resolution, the agreement with Russia can take effect. There is a possibility for Congress to be reconvened during a recess or adjournment if deemed necessary for the public interest. The President also has the authority to reconvene Congress during a scheduled recess or after an adjournment. If Congress is reconvened during a recess, those days would be considered as days of continuous session. The 110th Congress could potentially adjourn before the agreement with Russia takes effect, but if reconvened before January 3, 2009, it would still be considered the 110th Congress. The continuity of session would not be broken, and the count of days of continuous session would resume. The 110th Congress may reach a 90-day continuous session before the agreement with Russia takes effect. The way Congress reconvenes would determine if it resumes the second session or starts a new third session. Maintaining continuity of session is crucial in either scenario. Pro forma sessions are held as a formality without conducting legislative business, counting as days of session for adjournment purposes. In 2008, pro forma sessions were scheduled every fourth day to maintain continuity during non-legislative periods. During non-legislative periods, pro forma sessions held every fourth day prevent adjournment of more than three days in either house, counting as days of continuous session. During non-legislative periods, pro forma sessions held every fourth day prevent adjournment of more than three days in either house, counting as days of continuous session. Days of recess during non-legislative periods will only count as days of continuous session if both chambers hold pro forma sessions; if only one chamber holds pro forma sessions, the days of recess will not count. For example, the August 2008 non-legislative period authorized only the Senate to schedule pro forma sessions, excluding those days from the count of continuous session days. During non-legislative periods, pro forma sessions held every fourth day prevent adjournment of more than three days in either house. Days of recess during non-legislative periods will only count as days of continuous session if both chambers hold pro forma sessions. If only one chamber holds pro forma sessions, the days of recess will not count towards the continuous session days. For example, in August 2008, only the Senate was authorized to schedule pro forma sessions, excluding those days from the count of continuous session days. If the 110th Congress adjourns before the 90th day of continuous session after May 13, 2008, the agreement with Russia will not take effect. Congress could reconvene to consider a disapproval resolution and prevent the agreement from entering into force by default. The agreement with Russia will be postponed until the 111th Congress convenes in January 2009. If the 110th Congress fails to complete the required periods, the approval process may need to start over in the 111th Congress. The submission of an agreement triggers a single process of congressional action that may carry over into a subsequent Congress. The definition of \"continuous session\" implies that a new period would begin automatically with the convening of the 111th Congress. This could mean that the 111th Congress would not have to repeat statutory requirements already accomplished in the 110th Congress. For example, if the President has already submitted the agreement and met all requirements in the 110th Congress, he may not need to do so again in the 111th Congress. During the 110th Congress, 30-day consultation period was completed after the submission of the text on May 13, 2008. If the full period of 90 days of continuous session is not completed within the 110th Congress, the entire period must begin de novo in the 111th Congress. If the 30-day consultation period is not completed within the 110th Congress, the process must start over in the 111th Congress. It may be necessary for the President to resubmit the agreement to Congress in the new session. The interpretation of the AEA suggests that the agreement with Russia would need to be resubmitted with the required documents for approval. The NPAS agreement with Russia would go into effect at the end of 90 days of continuous session after submission to the 111th Congress, unless a resolution of disapproval is enacted. Newly constituted committees in the 111th Congress may not want to rely on the previous session's consultations. The newly constituted committees in the 111th Congress may not wish to rely on the consultations of their predecessors. Any resolution of disapproval from the 110th Congress would need to be reintroduced in the 111th Congress. Differences in purpose are noted between the 30-day consultation period and the 60-day congressional action period under section 123. The President must consult with committees for at least 30 days regarding proposed agreements' consistency with non-proliferation provisions. Approval and determination in writing are required to ensure common defense and security. Congressional action begins after submission of the agreement and NPAS. Section 123.d. addresses the President's approval and determination, similar to section 123.b. The President's submission of the agreement to Congress for approval may not align with the statutory scheme, as it does not explicitly require the President's approval following consultation with committees. The 60-day period required by section 123.d. may not run concurrently with the 30-day period prescribed by section 123.b., but instead follow it. The President's submission of the agreement to Congress for approval may not align with the statutory scheme, as it does not explicitly require the President's approval following consultation with committees. The submission of the agreement to Congress is considered as also submitting the text to the committees, fulfilling the requirements of both sections 123.b. and 123.d. The 30-day and 60-day periods required by the statute may not start concurrently, with the chief reason against doing so being the presumption that the President's \"agreement and determination\" should be submitted separately. The President's submission of the agreement to Congress for approval may not align with the statutory scheme, as it does not explicitly require the President's approval following consultation with committees. The President's declaration of approval at the outset of the 30-day period could be seen as undermining the consultive purpose of that period. Section 130.i.(1) of the AEA specifies the form a joint resolution to disapprove a proposed agreement for nuclear cooperation must take for expedited consideration. Section 130.i.(1) defines a joint resolution as a resolution of approval or disapproval for proposed agreements for cooperation transmitted by the President to Congress. The resolution must be appropriately selected based on whether Congress favors or does not favor the agreement. The AEA outlines the process for introducing joint resolutions for proposed agreements for cooperation, which are automatically introduced in each chamber by designated members. The resolutions are introduced \"by request\" and signify that the introducing members do not necessarily support the measures. The automatic introduction occurs on the day a proposed agreement is submitted to Congress, marking the start of a 60-day period for congressional consideration. The resolutions introduced for congressional consideration are mandated by the AEA. They are referred to the appropriate committees in each chamber, with the House introducing H.J.Res. 95 and the Senate introducing S.J.Res. 42. The House resolution is a joint resolution of disapproval. The House resolution is a joint resolution of disapproval, while the Senate resolution is a joint resolution of approval. The Senate's resolution does not prevent or hasten the agreement from taking effect, interpreting the statutory direction differently. A joint resolution to disapprove the proposed agreement (H.J.Res. 85) was introduced in the House, but not at the beginning of the 60-day period as required by statute. If enacted before the end of the 60-day period, this resolution could prevent the agreement from going into effect. The 60-day period is crucial to prevent the agreement from taking effect. Consultations with committees are required during this time. Committees must hold hearings and submit a report recommending approval or disapproval. If a resolution of disapproval is recommended, the report could accompany it. The report accompanying an approval resolution or serving as an explanatory document may not always be tied to legislation. Initial congressional action on the proposed agreement with Russia began with hearings by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and a closed briefing with the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. The Department of State officials' presence at these sessions could fulfill the consultation requirements outlined in section 123.b. It is unclear if these sessions also met the requirements of section 123.d. for hearings on the agreement itself after submission to Congress. It is unclear if hearings held after the agreement has been submitted to Congress could satisfy the requirements of section 123.d. of the AEA. Even if earlier sessions do not meet this requirement, it seems that procedural action on the floor cannot enforce it. Committees are automatically discharged from further consideration of disapproval resolutions after 45 days, ensuring timely floor consideration even if no action is taken. The statute does not define the time period for timely floor consideration in each chamber. In the House of Representatives, \"legislative days\" are construed as days of session, which are slower than days of continuous session. This difference affects the pace at which days elapse in each chamber. The House of Representatives interprets \"legislative days\" as days of session, which are slower than days of continuous session. This difference affects the pace at which days elapse in each chamber, potentially causing delays in considering a disapproval resolution before an agreement takes effect. The Senate may interpret \"day\" as a calendar day unless specified otherwise. The House of Representatives may face delays in considering a disapproval resolution for an agreement with Russia due to the interpretation of \"legislative days\" as slower than days of continuous session. This could result in committee discharge occurring after the agreement has already gone into effect, potentially limiting the House's ability to act on the matter during the 110th Congress. During the 110th Congress, the Senate faced delays in discharging a resolution to the Committee on Foreign Relations, which was scheduled to happen within 45 calendar days. The Senate's non-legislative period and pro forma sessions may have further delayed the discharge until the Senate returned for business in September. The Senate faced delays in discharging a resolution to the Committee on Foreign Relations during the 110th Congress. The measure is expected to be available for Senate floor consideration by September 8, well before the 60-day period for congressional action expires on October 9. If the Senate adopts a joint resolution of approval, it would not impact the statutory procedure authorizing the agreement unless disapproved within 60 days of continuous session after June 24. The discharge of the committee from joint resolution of approval could impact the possibility of congressional disapproval of the proposed agreement. The Senate may interpret the provision to mean that once a joint resolution is discharged, no other resolution on the same matter can be discharged. This could prevent a disapproval resolution on a proposed agreement from reaching the floor if the approval resolution is discharged first. The joint resolution to disapprove a nuclear cooperation agreement will be placed on the chamber's calendar for consideration under expedited procedures to ensure Congress can vote before the agreement takes effect. Specific procedures for floor consideration are not specified in the provision, with the Senate following a procedure from another statute and the House using a special rule from the Committee on Rules. The joint resolution of disapproval under expedited procedures allows the Senate to consider and vote on the agreement before it takes effect. The procedure limits debate to 10 hours, prohibits amendments, and allows for a motion to further limit debate. Section 130.i.(5) of the AEA authorizes the Committee on Rules to report a special rule for consideration of a resolution of disapproval, which would likely limit debate and prohibit amendments to maintain consistency with the expedited procedure. Section 130.i.(6) of the AEA allows for automatic \"hookup\" between chambers to ensure final action on the same measure in the same form. The final action in both houses will occur on the same measure in the same form without the need for a conference committee. However, this procedure assumes that the measures passed by both chambers will be similar. If one measure is a disapproval resolution and the other an approval resolution, an \"automatic hookup\" could lead to conflicting outcomes. In practice, if two resolutions address the same matter in opposite senses, the chamber acting second would consider the provision for automatic hookup inoperative. It could then vote on the adoption of its own measure and take various actions such as sending it for concurrence, acting on the measure received from the other chamber under general procedures, or amending the measure received from the first chamber and returning it for concurrence. The proposed nuclear cooperation agreement with the Russian Federation will take effect after 90 days of continuous session unless a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted before that time. Congress must pass a disapproval resolution that becomes law to prevent the agreement from taking effect. This requires the President to sign it, allow it to pass without his signature, or for Congress to override his veto. The President has 10 days to act on a measure presented to him. If a resolution of disapproval is presented with fewer than 10 calendar days remaining in the 90-day period, the President could render it moot by not acting until the period expires. If the President vetoes the resolution, the agreement takes effect unless Congress overrides the veto within 90 days of continuous session. The President is likely to veto a resolution disapproving an agreement he has already approved. Congress must present the resolution with at least 11 days of continuous session remaining in the 90-day period for effective disapproval. A longer period would give Congress a better chance to override the veto. The specific implications for the agreement with Russia depend on assumptions about the sine die. The agreement with Russia's implications depend on assumptions about the sine die adjournment of Congress. If Congress recesses until November 12 after September 26, they would have until November 24 to prevent the agreement from entering into effect by overriding a potential veto. If Congress recesses until November 12 after September 26, they would have until November 24 to prevent the agreement from entering into effect by overriding a potential veto. Congress might effectively ensure the disapproval of the agreement only if both houses could complete action to override the veto on that same day. If Congress were to adjourn sine die shortly after adopting the disapproval resolution, the President could pocket veto it. The agreement could not go into effect until the 90th day of continuous session after the convening of the 111th Congress, and only if no congressional disapproval was achieved. Congress is not required to use expedited procedures for disapproval, as disapproval could also be done through regular procedures or legislative riders. Congress has the power to determine the status of agreements through legislative measures, such as riders on appropriations bills. In the past, Congress enacted measures to impose conditions on nuclear cooperation agreements, like with China in the 99th Congress. These alternative measures must be passed before the agreement's deadline to prevent automatic implementation. However, they do not qualify for expedited procedures for disapproval. Congress can impose conditions on nuclear cooperation agreements through legislative measures, like with China in the 99th Congress. Any approval with conditions to an agreement with Russia would need to specify that its provisions apply \"notwithstanding section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.\" Without such a provision, automatic unconditional approval could still apply after 90 days unless a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted into law. The President could potentially bypass Congress's attempt to place conditions on the approval of a nuclear agreement with Russia by vetoing any measures. If Congress cannot override the veto, the agreement would go into effect without conditions. Congress could also pass a measure for immediate effect without conditions, but a simple statement of favor would not be sufficient under current statutory provisions. The President could bypass Congress's conditions on approving a nuclear agreement with Russia by vetoing measures. Any measure must explicitly allow the agreement to take effect upon enactment, not just state approval."
