    "content": "The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) is the main federal funding source for child care subsidies for low-income working families. Coined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the term encompasses various funding streams including federal discretionary child care funds, federal mandatory child care funds, state maintenance-of-effort funds, and federal funds transferred to the CCDF. In FY2012, states spent roughly $8.6 billion from combined federal and state funding streams for child care subsidies. Additionally, states spent around $2.8 billion in TANF-direct child care expenditures, which are not subject to CCDBG Act rules. In FY2012, states spent $2.8 billion in TANF-direct child care programs, boosting total child care spending by 33%. Federal appropriations to the CCDF represent the minimum federal investment in child care, with states having the flexibility to supplement funding through transfers or TANF-direct spending. This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of child care funding trends. The report reviews trends in total child care spending from the CCDF and TANF since FY2000, highlighting the legislative evolution of these funding streams. The 1996 welfare reform law established the current federal landscape, with the federal government determining basic program rules for the CCDF and states deciding on TANF funds for child care. Historical expenditure data and information on children served are presented in the report. The report highlights trends in child care spending from CCDF and TANF since FY2000, with observations on the significant role of TANF contributions and implications of the CCDBG reauthorization law. It does not cover spending from other federal programs or tax provisions. Total combined CCDF and TANF spending on child care increased from $10.2 billion in FY2000 to $11.4 billion in FY2012, a $1.2 billion increase (+12%). However, adjusting for inflation, spending decreased from $13.7 billion in FY2000 to $11.4 billion in FY2012, a $2.3 billion decrease (-17%). Total combined CCDF and TANF spending on child care peaked in FY2009 at $14.0 billion in nominal dollars and nearly $15.0 billion in constant dollars, driven by additional appropriations from the ARRA. Federal spending accounted for 70% of expenditures, with CCDF making up the majority. CCDF spending accounted for about 75% of all child care expenditures during this period. Total combined CCDF and TANF spending on child care peaked in FY2009 at $14.0 billion in nominal dollars, with CCDF accounting for about 75% of all child care expenditures. TANF-direct child care spending made up the remaining 25% and TANF transfers peaked in FY2000, declining thereafter. In FY2012, TANF transfers accounted for 39% of discretionary CCDF expenditures and 16% of all CCDF expenditures. Data on the number of children served are not collected. The number of children served by TANF-direct child care is not collected, but data on children served by the CCDF show a decline since FY2006. The caseload peaked at 1.8 million children in FY2001 and dropped to 1.5 million in FY2012. The CCDF evolved from federal child care supports pre-1996. Before 1996, four federal programs supported child care for low-income families: AFDC Child Care, Transitional Child Care, At-Risk Child Care, and the Child Care and Development Block Grant. AFDC Child Care, Transitional Child Care, and At-Risk Child Care were associated with AFDC and funded jointly by the federal government and states. AFDC Child Care and Transitional Child Care were open-ended federal entitlements, while At-Risk Child Care was a \"capped entitlement\" to states. The CCDBG program, established in 1990, provided child care support for low-income families not connected to the AFDC welfare system. Unlike AFDC-related programs, CCDBG was funded with discretionary appropriations and did not require states to match federal funding. The program fell under the jurisdiction of the Education and Labor Committee in the House and the Labor and Human Resources Committee in the Senate. The 1996 welfare reform law repealed AFDC and its associated child care programs, creating a consolidated block grant for child care entitlement to states. This new block grant was targeted towards families receiving welfare, transitioning off welfare, or at risk of welfare, and required mandatory funds to be combined with discretionary CCDBG allotments at the state level. The law also reauthorized and amended the CCDBG Act, establishing five goals focused on flexibility. The 1996 law amended the CCDBG Act to provide flexibility for states and parents in child care programs. It increased the federal income eligibility threshold and aimed to promote self-sufficiency through work. The 1996 law aimed to streamline child care programs by creating a single consolidated block grant to simplify delivery and administration at both state and federal levels. It replaced AFDC with TANF, allowing states to provide a wide range of child care services. The 1996 law created the TANF block grant to provide benefits and services for low-income families. States can transfer up to 30% of TANF funds to the CCDF for child care services, or provide child care directly through TANF programs. Transferred TANF funds must be spent according to CCDF rules, augmenting the consolidated child care program established by the law. The TANF program allows states to use funds for child care services, either through the CCDF or TANF-direct programs. TANF-direct child care is not subject to CCDF rules, leading to potential discrepancies in child care program standards. States have flexibility in using TANF funds to achieve statutory goals, including assisting needy families and promoting self-sufficiency through work. The TANF program allows states to use funds for child care services to support needy families and promote self-sufficiency through work. States have flexibility in using TANF funds for various benefits and services, including cash assistance, child care, pre-kindergarten programs, and work support initiatives. The dollar amount of the basic TANF block grant has remained unchanged since the program's inception, requiring states to carefully consider how to distribute annual grant funds. This report presents expenditure data from multiple child care funding streams within the CCDF and TANF. This section briefly reviews key concepts related to child care funding streams within the CCDF and TANF. Expenditure data in this report represent spending by states and the District of Columbia; spending by tribes, tribal organizations, territories, or HHS is excluded. CCDF expenditures are tracked against the year in which they were initially awarded or allocated. The CCDF expenditure data are tracked against the year of allocation for categorical spending requirements. This includes limitations on administrative costs and mandates for quality improvement activities. Discretionary CCDF spending includes funds from annual appropriations under the CCDBG Act and optional TANF transfers. The discretionary CCDBG appropriations varied from FY2000 to FY2012 due to annual appropriations and TANF transfers. The amounts allocated to states were based on factors like the number of children under age five, children receiving free or reduced-price lunches, and per capita income. The CCDBG Act requires states to obligate and spend discretionary appropriations within a specific timeframe. Funds not obligated may be reallotted to other states. FY2012 data is the most recent available due to these rules. FY2015 expenditure data has not been released yet, and FY2014 data will be available after FY2016. Federal statute allows states to transfer up to 30% of their TANF block grant allotments to the CCDF without state maintenance-of-effort or matching requirements. This transfer limit applies to combined amounts transferred to the CCDF and/or the SSBG, with any transfers to the SSBG reducing the amount available for the CCDF. While TANF transfers are included in discretionary CCDF expenditure data, this report estimates the amount and share of TANF transfers. The report estimates TANF transfers within discretionary CCDF expenditures, totaling between $1.370 billion and $2.305 billion annually. The number of states transferring funds has decreased from 43 to 29 between FY2000 and FY2012. States can transfer up to 30% of their TANF block grant to the CCDF without matching requirements. States can transfer TANF funds to the CCDF within the same fiscal year they become available. Once transferred, funds must be obligated within two years and spent within three years, with the option to transfer back to TANF before the two-year window ends. This flexibility may result in varying amounts shown on CCDF expenditure reports over time. Expenditure reports may show negative amounts for TANF transfers when states transfer more funds back to TANF than to CCDF. Mandatory CCDF funds consist of guaranteed and matching funds allocated to states. States receive $1.178 billion annually from guaranteed funds and must obligate them by the end of the fiscal year. Remaining mandatory funds are discussed in the next section. States receive guaranteed mandatory CCDF funds annually, totaling $1.178 billion, which must be obligated by the end of the fiscal year. There is no expenditure deadline for these funds, but states typically spend them within a few years of receiving the grant award. Mandatory matching funds available to states have remained flat at $1.674 billion since the early years of the FY2000-FY2012 window. Federal matching funds totaling $1.674 billion have remained flat since FY2006. States must meet MOE and matching requirements to receive their full share of these funds. Funds must be obligated by the end of the fiscal year and spent within one additional year. Any unobligated funds are redistributed by HHS. States qualify for mandatory matching funds by spending 100% of their own state funds in FY1994 or FY1995. States must meet MOE and matching requirements to receive federal matching funds totaling $1.674 billion, which have remained flat since FY2006. The required state MOE comes to nearly $888 million annually, with some states exceeding this minimum level. Connecticut, Nebraska, and Ohio consistently exceed their required MOE levels. Total state MOE expenditures vary but always exceed the minimum level. States qualifying for federal matching funds must match the federal amounts they receive at the Medicaid matching rate. If states do not provide the full match required, HHS can redistribute funds to other states. The total state matching funds needed annually vary based on federal allotments and state FMAP rates, representing about three-quarters of federal matching funds. Some states exceed the minimum match level, with at least three states contributing excess funds each year. At least three states consistently exceeded required match levels since FY2005, including California, Iowa, and Wyoming. TANF expenditure data is separate from CCDF data, with detailed TANF reports released annually. TANF funds can be used for child care subsidies, known as \"TANF-direct\" child care. Federal TANF dollars are commonly used by states to provide child care services, known as \"TANF-direct\" child care. Between FY2000-FY2012, 29 or more states utilized TANF funds for child care, totaling between $1.168 billion and $1.787 billion. There are no expenditure deadlines for TANF block grant funds, but there are restrictions on how funds can be spent after the initial fiscal year. Transfers from TANF to CCDF are only allowed in the year the funds are awarded to the state. Under the TANF MOE requirement, states must spend a share of the amounts they spent on TANF's predecessor programs on TANF or TANF-related programs, totaling roughly $10.4 billion annually. States can double count state spending on child care towards both the CCDF and TANF MOE requirements, up to a limit. This report estimates TANF \"excess\" MOE spending on child care by subtracting total reported CCDF MOE expenditures from TANF child care MOE reported amount. Any positive difference is counted as TANF excess MOE to avoid double counting funds towards both TANF MOE and CCDF MOE. In FY2012, child care spending totaled $11.4 billion, with three-quarters coming from the CCDF and the remaining from TANF-direct child care. Discretionary CCDF expenditures included TANF transfers, accounting for the largest share of all child care spending. TANF transfers were lowest in FY2010 and FY2012, totaling $1.4 billion in FY2012. In FY2012, federal dollars accounted for two-thirds of child care spending, totaling $7.6 billion, with state funding streams contributing $3.8 billion. Child care spending in constant dollars has generally been outpaced by inflation. Mandatory CCDF and state contributions have been stable, while discretionary CCDF, partly due to declining TANF transfers, has shown more fluctuations. Total combined CCDF and TANF spending on child care experienced fluctuations, with increases and decreases from FY2000 to FY2012. In nominal dollars, spending grew from $10.2 billion to $11.4 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion (+12%). Total combined CCDF and TANF spending on child care increased from $10.2 billion in FY2000 to $11.4 billion in FY2012, a $1.2 billion (+12%) rise. However, adjusting for inflation, spending decreased from $13.7 billion to $11.4 billion, a $2.3 billion (-17%) drop. The peak in spending occurred in FY2009 at nearly $15.0 billion in constant dollars, driven by additional appropriations from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The peak for spending on child care in constant dollars was $14.6 billion in FY2002, driven by various funding streams including TANF transfers and CCDF appropriations. In nominal dollars, the pre-ARRA peak was $12.2 billion in FY2008, with increases starting in FY2006 due to federal legislation and state decisions. Federal spending accounted for roughly 70% of all child care spending from FY2002 to FY2008, with state contributions making up the remaining 30%. CCDF expenditures were the majority of federal spending, while TANF-direct federal child care accounted for 10-15%. State-level decisions led to an increase in CCDF state contributions and TANF-direct child care spending during this period. Between FY2000 and FY2012, TANF-direct child care spending ranged from 21% to 27% of all expenditures, with state TANF excess MOE funds accounting for the majority of spending from FY2006 to FY2012. The number of states with excess TANF MOE child care spending decreased over this period, indicating a shift towards more state TANF MOE dollars being spent. More than half of all states used federal TANF funds for child care in each year covered by the report. Between FY2000 and FY2012, TANF funds were used for child care in 21% to 27% of all expenditures, with state TANF excess MOE funds being the main source from FY2006 to FY2012. The number of states using federal TANF funds for child care decreased over time, with TANF-direct programs representing roughly one-quarter of all child care expenditures annually. The overall share of contributions from TANF programs has declined due to decreases in TANF transfers to the CCDF. Reporting on children and families served by TANF-direct child care expenditures is not required by the CCDBG Act. TANF-direct child care programs, accounting for a quarter of expenditures annually, do not report on the number of children served or their care settings. They are not subject to CCDBG Act rules, potentially leading to more spending on direct services for children. Eligibility rules for TANF-direct child care services may differ from CCDF income requirements. Total spending within the CCDF, including TANF transfers and state contributions, fluctuated from FY2000 to FY2012. In nominal dollars, spending increased from $7.6 billion to $8.6 billion, but in constant dollars, it decreased from $10.2 billion to $8.6 billion. Peak spending occurred in FY2009 at $10.7 billion. CCDF expenditures peaked in FY2009 at $10.7 billion in nominal dollars and $11.5 billion in constant dollars, driven by additional appropriations from ARRA. Prior to ARRA, the peak occurred in FY2002 at $11.3 billion in constant dollars. Spending has generally been declining since FY2002, with exceptions in nominal dollars, such as the peak of $9.1 billion in FY2007. The FY2007 nominal peak in CCDF spending was driven by state-level decisions, with federal funding accounting for three-quarters of expenditures. The largest increase occurred in FY2006 due to federal legislation, with mandatory CCDF funds making up one-third of all expenditures. CCDF funds typically make up over 40% of expenditures, including TANF transfers. Many states exceed minimum spending requirements, with some surpassing their CCDF MOE requirement. TANF transfers have decreased but still contribute significantly to CCDF expenditures. In FY2010 and FY2012, TANF transfers hit a low of roughly $1.4 billion. By FY2012, 29 states transferred $1.4 billion from TANF to CCDF, a 40% decrease from FY2000. The CCDF caseload dropped from 1.8 million children in FY2001 to 1.5 million in FY2012, a 20% decrease. The CCDBG Act imposes categorical spending requirements on CCDF dollars, including reserving 4% for quality improvement activities. Changes in rules related to health, safety, licensing, inspections, and monitoring were made in the 2014 CCDBG Act. These requirements may lead states to allocate more funds to quality activities, administrative costs, or non-direct services, potentially reducing subsidies for children. State child care programs receive federal funds from CCES, TANF, and CCDBG Act rules. TANF-direct spending, not subject to CCDBG Act rules, accounts for over $2.3 billion annually. This section reviews current authorization status of child care funding streams in relation to 1996 reforms. The importance of multiple funding streams for state child care programs for low-income families is highlighted by spending trends. These funding streams rely on federal authorizations such as discretionary CCDF funds, mandatory CCDF funds, and TANF block grants. While the CCDBG Act was reauthorized in 2014, the CCES and TANF have not been reauthorized in over 10 years. The DRA in 2005 increased child care funding by $1 billion over five years, totaling $2.917 billion for FY2006 to FY2010. Funding for TANF and CCES has been extended through short- and medium-term extensions, with the most recent extension funding until September 30, 2016. TANF and CCES funds make up a significant portion of federal and state child care spending. The CCDBG Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-186) reauthorized the law for the first time since 1996, focusing on strengthening health and safety requirements, licensing, enforcement, and quality of care. States are now required to establish and enforce minimum health and safety standards, provide training on health and safety topics, set group size limits and child-to-provider ratios, and conduct licensing inspections. The CCDBG Act of 2014 requires states to conduct pre-licensure and annual unannounced inspections for all licensed CCDF providers, establish qualifications for inspectors, conduct background checks on child care providers, and increase spending on quality improvement activities. The new requirements apply to mandatory CCDF funds and TANF funds transferred to the CCDF, but not TANF funds spent directly on child care within state TANF programs. The CCDF has been the primary source of child care spending, accounting for three-quarters of total spending. However, states also spend at least $2.3 billion annually on TANF-direct child care, which is not subject to CCDF rules. Data on TANF-direct child care programs and the families they serve are not collected, making it difficult to assess their impact. The Obama Administration's FY2017 President's budget submission proposed applying CCDBG Act health and safety standards to TANF-direct child care to ensure consistent protections for all children receiving child care assistance. However, it did not address the possibility of applying CCDF-comparable reporting or spending requirements to TANF-direct child care programs. The TANF program allows states to decide whether to allocate funds to child care, with significant contributions being made over the years. This raises questions about the adequacy of funding for the CCDF program, but also highlights the flexibility states have in supporting important programs and services. Federal TANF-related contributions for child care services have been declining, with the share of expenditures dropping from 52% in FY2000 to 34% in FY2012. The number of states not using TANF funds for child care has tripled from three to nine, while states using both TANF options have decreased by over 40% from 29 to 17. The decline in federal TANF-related contributions for child care services has raised concerns about the stability of funding. TANF grants have decreased in value by over 30% since 1996, making it challenging for states to maintain funding levels. The 2014 reauthorization of the CCDBG Act made changes to federal child care policies. After the 2014 reauthorization of the CCDBG Act, states may struggle to maintain child care services due to increased spending requirements for quality improvement and oversight activities. The number of children served by the CCDF has been declining, possibly due to rising costs and decreased funding value. The rising costs of child care and decreasing value of CCDF dollars may impact state decisions on supporting child care programs with TANF funds. States could increase TANF transfers to CCDF to comply with the 2014 reauthorization law, or focus on TANF-direct child care programs instead. Total federal TANF-direct spending has been declining over the years. The 2014 CCDBG reauthorization law may not significantly impact TANF spending patterns, as child care is just one of many possible uses for these block grants."
