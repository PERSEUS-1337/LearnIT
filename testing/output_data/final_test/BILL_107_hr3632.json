    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Worker's Freedom of Choice Act\" and includes findings. The \"Worker's Freedom of Choice Act\" recognizes that workers paying dues to labor organizations should not be required to support activities unrelated to the National Labor Relations Act's express purposes. Congress aims to protect employees' freedom of association and strengthen labor organizations' ability to represent all employees within the Act's defined scope. Some labor organizations may use dues paid by employees for purposes unrelated to the National Labor Relations Act, such as supporting political candidates or lobbying for causes not directly related to the Act's statutory purposes. Employees' rights and freedoms of association are violated when funds collected from workers are used for purposes unrelated to the National Labor Relations Act. This violates individuals' rights to make choices about the causes they support and forces them to support causes that may go against their beliefs, infringing on their First Amendment rights of free speech and freedom of association. Employees' rights and freedoms of association are violated when funds collected from workers are used for purposes unrelated to the National Labor Relations Act, infringing on their First Amendment rights of free speech and freedom of association. Employees subject to a valid labor agreement cannot be required to pay dues or fees unrelated to core purposes like collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment. If there is a discrepancy in the amount of fees collected, employees can take legal action against the labor organization for damages. Employees can take legal action against a labor organization for damages, including 10 times the amount of dues accepted in violation, interest, liquidated damages, punitive damages up to $1,000, equitable relief, and revocation of tax-exempt status. An action for damages or equitable relief can be brought against a labor organization in federal court by employees, individually or collectively. The court may award attorney's fees, expert witness fees, and other costs to the plaintiff. The action must be filed within 5 years of the employee becoming aware of dues misuse by the labor organization. The period for filing an action against a labor organization for violation of the Act is generally 2 years, but can be extended to 3 years in cases of willful violation. SEC. 4. NOTICE. Employers with union-represented employees must post a notice informing them that unions cannot use dues for non-work-related activities. SEC. 5. DISCLOSURE TO WORKERS. (a) Expenses Reporting.--Labor organizations must report expenses verified by an independent audit in detail to allow members to determine their necessity in representing employees on labor-management issues.\n(b) Disclosure.--The Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act is amended to include employees required to pay dues or fees to the organization in the disclosure requirements. The Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 is amended to require the Secretary to provide complete copies of reports upon written request. SEC. 6. RETALIATION AND COERCION PROHIBITED. Labor organizations cannot retaliate against employees for exercising their rights under this Act. SEC. 7. REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Labor will establish regulations within specific timeframes. SEC. 8. CONSTRUCTION. Employees can voluntarily contribute to endorsed charities without restriction. SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE AND APPLICATION. The Act will be effective immediately upon enactment, with sections 4 and 5 on worker consent taking effect after 90 days, and section 6 on disclosure taking effect after 150 days."
