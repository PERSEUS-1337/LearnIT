    "content": "Extradition is the formal surrender of a person by a State to another State for prosecution or punishment. The United States has extradition treaties with over a hundred nations, but some countries may extradite based on comity. Federal law governs how the U.S. honors its extradition treaty obligations, and extradition is generally limited to crimes specified in the treaty. Extradition treaties typically specify extraditable crimes, with newer treaties allowing for extradition of all felonies. Modern treaties also outline offenses for which extradition may be denied, commonly excluding political offenses. The political offense exception has been a longstanding feature of extradition treaties, but its interpretation has been contentious. The political offense exception in extradition treaties is often interpreted in various ways. American courts generally require fugitives to show that crimes were committed in the context of a violent political disturbance. Contemporary treaties address this exception by excluding terrorist offenses, extending it to politically motivated prosecutions, or aligning with multinational agreements. Several multinational agreements incorporate offenses into extradition treaties, specifying that certain activities are not political offenses. Some nations have abolished capital punishment but retain the right to deny extradition in capital cases. Countries may refuse extradition in capital cases due to opposition to capital punishment or execution methods, despite the absence of such provisions in extradition treaties with the United States. Dual criminality in extradition treaties addresses the reluctance to extradite a fugitive for conduct considered innocent by the host nation. Extradition treaties historically handle dual criminality in various ways, such as listing extraditable offenses or requiring dual criminality provisions. Today, most international agreements prevent extradition if the offense is not recognized as punishable in both nations. Extradition treaties often require dual criminality, meaning the offense must be punishable in both the requesting and requested state. Some treaties struggle to find equivalents for certain crimes like attempt or conspiracy. Modern treaties address jurisdictional elements and may include provisions for tax and customs offenses. The United States claims broad extraterritorial application for its criminal laws due to terrorism and drug trafficking, leading to mixed success in negotiating new extradition treaty provisions. The United States faces challenges in negotiating extradition treaties due to conflicting views on extraterritorial jurisdiction and the right to refuse extradition based on nationality. However, recent treaties show a shift towards limiting nationality exemptions for extradition requests, indicating a potential weakening of this obstacle. Extradition treaties now often include clauses requiring consideration of prosecution at home for nationals whose extradition is denied, along with provisions to prevent double punishment or jeopardy. Historic clauses may bar extradition for the \"same acts\" or \"same event,\" rather than just the \"same offenses.\" The new model limits exemptions to fugitives convicted or acquitted of the same offense. The Restatement explains that extradition treaties often include clauses regarding lapse of time or statute of limitations, which can affect extradition. If a treaty does not mention the effect of a lapse of time, extradition may not be barred by either state's statute of limitations. Some treaties allow for extradition regardless of the passage of time, while others leave it to the discretion of the requested state. In cases governed by U.S. law, statutes of limitation and due process determine prosecution, and speedy trial provisions govern delays. The extradition process typically starts with a request to the State Department, and provisional arrest may be requested if there are concerns about the fugitive fleeing. The extradition process in the United States involves requesting extradition and provisional arrest through the State Department. The Department of Justice then handles the arrest of the fugitive, with a hearing scheduled to determine extraditability. Bond is typically opposed in extradition cases. The extradition process in the United States involves a hearing scheduled to determine extraditability. If found extraditable, the Secretary of State decides on surrendering the fugitive to the requesting government. The fugitive may waive the hearing process, and OIA arranges for transfer to the requesting country's agents. Extradition orders are not appealable, but the fugitive can petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The district court's decision on the writ can be appealed, and extradition may be stayed if ordered by the court. An extradition hearing in the United States involves determining the validity of the extradition treaty, confirming the identity of the person sought, ensuring the offense is extraditable and meets double criminality requirements, establishing probable cause, presenting necessary documents according to US law, and following treaty requirements and statutory procedures. The hearing is a preliminary examination, not a final trial for conviction or acquittal. The extradition hearing in the United States involves determining if there is probable cause to hold the accused for extradition. The judicial officer conducts the hearing to establish probable cause based on evidence presented, including warrants and depositions. Affirmative defenses are not considered, and hearsay evidence is admissible. The purpose is to determine if the individual committed an offense covered by the extradition treaty. Extradition hearings in the United States allow hearsay evidence and do not consider affirmative defenses. The Miranda rule, Sixth Amendment rights, and Fifth Amendment rights may not apply. However, due process can prevent extradition of informants promised confidentiality by the government. The \"noninquiry rule\" may lead to extradition without examining the requesting country's justice system or considering potential mistreatment of the extraditee. Extradition hearings in the United States may not allow certain rights like the Miranda rule, Sixth Amendment rights, and Fifth Amendment rights. The requesting government can bring a new complaint if the court refuses to certify the case, but if certified, the fugitive has limited review under habeas corpus. Habeas corpus can only inquire about jurisdiction and treaty compliance. Extradition hearings in the United States may not allow certain rights like the Miranda rule, Sixth Amendment rights, and Fifth Amendment rights. The appellate courts will only examine the magistrate judge's determination of probable cause to see if there is any evidence to support it. Limitations on review or application of the rule of noninquiry may be modified by treaty or statute, which can be a complicated issue. For example, the U.N. Convention Against Torture (CAT) provides that no State Party shall extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture. Congress enacted Section 2242 of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (FARRA) to implement the policy regarding extradition of fugitives. Some fugitives have argued that CAT or FARRA serve as exceptions to the noninquiry rule, leading to mixed outcomes in appellate courts. The Fourth Circuit found that FARRA barred habeas review of a fugitive's torture claim, while the Ninth Circuit determined that FARRA required the Secretary of State to assess such claims. Ultimately, the Secretary of State has discretion in determining extradition after a judge or magistrate certifies the fugitive. The Secretary of State has discretion in determining whether a fugitive should be released or surrendered for extradition based on policy. Extradition treaties outline procedures for surrender, including handling requests from multiple countries and allowing for temporary surrender for prosecution. Extradition of a fugitive from overseas back to the United States is governed by the laws of the country of refuge and applicable extradition treaties. The Department of State requests extradition for trial or execution of a criminal sentence. The extraditability of a fugitive is determined based on factors such as the presence of an extradition treaty, citizenship, dual criminality, statutes of limitation, and capital punishment issues. Extradition is governed by laws and treaties, considering factors like dual citizenship, dual criminality, and where the crime was committed. The crime must be on the list of extraditable offenses or be a crime in both the US and the country of refuge. Some treaties require the offense to be committed within the US. Timing is also important, with a requirement for a good faith effort to bring a fugitive to trial promptly. Extradition treaties may have provisions such as prohibiting extradition for capital offenses or requiring assurance that a death sentence will not be carried out. Prosecutors can request provisional arrest of a fugitive if there is a risk of flight, even before final extradition documentation is prepared. The Justice Department encourages judicious use of provisional arrest. If approved, extradition requests are forwarded to the State Department and then to the country from which extradition is sought through diplomatic channels. After extradition, the fugitive may face limitations such as the doctrine of specialty, which allows prosecution only for offenses described in the extradition treaty or the charge for which they were extradited. This limitation aims to prevent prosecution for different offenses but does not completely bar prosecution. The doctrine of specialty limits prosecution to offenses described in the extradition treaty or the charge for which the individual was extradited. It may not completely prevent prosecution for different offenses, and there is debate over whether a defendant has standing to claim its benefits. Additionally, a fugitive may lack standing to allege a rule of specialty violation if extradited under a different agreement. Courts have agreed that the surrendering State may consent to trial for crimes other than those for which extradition was had. The existence of an extradition treaty does not preclude the United States from acquiring personal jurisdiction over a fugitive by other means. Waiver or \"simplified\" treaty provisions allow a fugitive to consent to extradition without an extradition hearing. The United States has had success in encouraging other countries to surrender fugitives without requiring extradition, using processes similar to deportation or expulsion. U.S. immigration procedures are less accommodating and are used only when extradition is not possible. Alternative methods to extradition, such as denaturalization, deportation, and irregular rendition, are sometimes used by the United States when extradition is not feasible. Irregular rendition, a last resort option involving kidnapping or deceit, is typically reserved for cases involving terrorists or drug traffickers. These methods allow the U.S. to acquire jurisdiction over fugitives without relying solely on extradition treaties. When extradition to the United States is not possible, alternative methods like denaturalization, deportation, or irregular rendition may be used. Irregular rendition, involving kidnapping or deceit, is a last resort for cases involving terrorists or drug traffickers. This can strain diplomatic relations and may lead to foreign prosecution of individuals involved in the abduction. Trial within the country of refuge is another option when extradition is not available, especially if the crime can be prosecuted by both countries. When extradition is not possible, trial within the country of refuge is an option, especially if the crime can be prosecuted by both countries. This can avoid the cumbersome and expensive alternative of dual prosecution and align with U.S. policy objectives."
