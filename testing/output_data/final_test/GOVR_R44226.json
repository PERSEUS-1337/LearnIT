    "content": "Senator Grassley and Representative Goodlatte introduced parallel sentencing reform bills with bipartisan cosponsors, amending mandatory minimum sentence provisions in federal drug and firearms laws. The Senate proposal, S. 2123, includes an extensive corrections title, while the House proposal, H.R. 3713, lacks this feature. The bills target violations of the Controlled Substances Act and the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, focusing on trafficking large amounts of highly addictive substances. The bills S. 2123 and H.R. 3713 aim to amend mandatory minimum sentence provisions in federal drug and firearms laws, targeting trafficking of highly addictive substances. The legislation includes reducing mandatory minimum sentences for repeat offenders and allowing courts to sentence qualified defendants below the statutory minimum. To qualify for reduced sentencing under the U.S. Sentencing Commission's Guidelines, a defendant must not have used violence, played a managerial role in a group offense, caused death or serious injury, and must disclose all information to the government. Additionally, the defendant must have a clean criminal record with no more than 1 criminal history point assigned based on prior convictions. The Sentencing Commission's report recommended expanding safety valve eligibility for defendants with 2 or 3 criminal history points to address disproportionate sentencing impact on drug offenders. Drug offenses have increased mandatory minimums for repeat offenders, leading to potential disparities in treatment among similarly situated drug offenders due to varying state laws on drug possession and prosecutorial discretion. The Sentencing Commission's report suggested expanding safety valve eligibility for defendants with 2 or 3 criminal history points to address sentencing disparities for drug offenders. S. 2123 and H.R. 3713 aim to modify the safety valve by allowing eligibility with 3 or fewer criminal history points and creating additional waivers for criminal history disqualifications. The proposed mini-safety valve would reduce a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence for drug trafficking to 5 years for eligible defendants with no prior serious drug or violent felony convictions. It would only apply to future convictions and have specific criteria for eligibility. Additionally, there are two firearms-related offenses with mandatory minimum sentences, including the Armed Career Criminal Act imposing a 15-year sentence. The Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) imposes a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence on offenders with three prior convictions for drug offenses or violent felonies. Another provision, 18 U.S.C. 924(c), mandates imprisonment for using a firearm during a drug offense or crime of violence. S. 2123 and H.R. 3713 aim to reduce the mandatory minimum penalty from 15 years to 10 years, retroactively applicable. H.R. 3713 proposes reducing mandatory minimum penalties for firearm offenses retroactively, considering post-sentencing conduct and the seriousness of the offense. The retroactivity would not apply to defendants with prior serious violent felony convictions. Section 924(c) imposes various minimum sentences for firearm-related offenses in federal drug or violent felony cases. Section 924(c) imposes different mandatory minimum sentences for using or possessing a firearm during a federal crime of violence or drug trafficking. The minimums range from 5 to 30 years depending on the circumstances, such as brandishing, discharging, or using specific types of firearms. Prior convictions can result in higher minimum sentences. Section 924(c) imposes varying mandatory minimum sentences for using or possessing a firearm during a federal crime, with penalties ranging from 5 to 30 years based on the circumstances. Repeat offenders can face even harsher sentences, including life imprisonment for certain offenses. Proposed sentencing reform bills aim to clarify when prior convictions can be considered for enhancing mandatory minimums and reduce the repeat offender minimum to 25 years. The proposals aim to reduce the repeat offender mandatory minimum sentence from 25 years to 15 years, but expand it to include recidivists with prior violent state crime convictions. Courts may apply the changes retroactively, except for defendants with prior serious violent felony convictions. Additionally, there is a firearms amendment in both bills that increases the likelihood of imprisonment by adjusting sentencing guidelines. The two bills propose increasing sentences for firearms offenses, such as false statements in firearm purchases and possession by disqualified individuals, from 10 to 15 years. The Controlled Substances Act initially did not differentiate between powder and crack cocaine, but the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act introduced a 100-1 sentencing ratio between the two. The 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act established a 100-1 sentencing ratio between crack cocaine and powder cocaine. The 2010 Fair Sentencing Act changed this ratio to 500-28, making penalties for crack cocaine offenses more aligned with powder cocaine. The Sentencing Commission adjusted guidelines to reflect this change, allowing for retroactive application at the court's discretion. The FSA reductions apply to offenses committed after its enactment and can also be applied to previous offenses if sentencing occurred post-enactment. Federal courts have the discretion to reduce sentences based on revised guidelines. The FSA does not apply to sentences imposed before its enactment. S. 2123 and H.R. 3713 aim to allow courts to reduce sentences for offenses committed before the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA) to align with its provisions. H.R. 3713 does not introduce new mandatory minimums, while S. 2123 establishes them for interstate domestic violence and certain IEEPA violations. The FSA does not apply to sentences imposed prior to its enactment. S. 2123 proposes mandatory minimum sentences for interstate domestic violence, increasing penalties for life-threatening or disfiguring acts, and the use of dangerous weapons. It also leaves penalties for interstate stalking unchanged. S. 2123 would create mandatory minimum sentences for three types of IEEPA violations, including providing defense articles to embargoed countries, supplying goods for weapons of mass destruction, and furnishing restricted goods to foreign entities. The bill also calls for an inventory of federal crimes. The Attorney General and agency heads must compile an inventory of federal statutory crimes and regulatory offenses, detailing penalties, mens rea, and prosecution frequency. They are also required to create a publicly available online index of these offenses."
