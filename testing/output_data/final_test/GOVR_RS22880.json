    "content": "Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. \u00a71337) allows U.S. companies to protect themselves from imports that infringe on U.S. intellectual property rights. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) handles investigations related to unfair trade practices, with a focus on patent infringement cases. For copyrights and trademarks, the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) can address IPR infringement on the spot. U.S. companies must meet specific requirements to address unfair competition. U.S. companies must meet three requirements to assert unfair competition under Section 337: importation or sale of infringing products into the U.S., unfair competition related to the imported goods, and sufficient domestic activity. Section 337 investigations must be completed promptly, with target dates set by the ITC. The ITC sets target dates for completing investigations, which have been extended due to increased complexity and workload. Section 337 investigations involve multiple steps over several months, with companies needing to submit detailed complaints to initiate the process. The ITC assigns an ALJ and an investigative attorney to oversee Section 337 investigations. A target date is set for completion, and a formal evidentiary hearing is conducted within seven to ten months. The ALJ issues a preliminary ruling based on the merits of the case, such as patent infringement issues. The ALJ evaluates U.S. patent cases for infringement issues. An Initial Determination must be issued four months before the target date. Within 45 days, ITC Commissioners decide whether to review it. They may adopt, change, reject, or remand the ruling. A \"Final Determination\" is typically issued within three months, considering public interest. Some cases are settled before a final decision. Complainants and respondents can move to terminate an investigation. The Final Determination in U.S. patent cases is sent to the President for review based on national security considerations. If not disapproved, respondents engaging in infringing activities risk losing a significant amount of money, with the bond often being 100% of the imported products' value, serving as a deterrent. The President rarely overturns the Final Determination, making the decision enforceable within 60 days if no action is taken. The President rarely disapproves of ITC Final Determinations, making them enforceable within 60 days. Appeals can be filed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit within this period. Section 337 was amended to comply with GATT, ensuring fair treatment of foreign companies. The ITC adjudication process is faster than litigation in federal district courts, raising concerns about foreign companies' ability to defend themselves. The ITC is required to complete investigations promptly, granting exclusion and cease and desist orders as remedies. Exclusion orders prohibit infringing goods' importation into the U.S., effective for as long as the patent is valid. Limited exclusion orders target specific parties named in the ITC. Cease and desist orders require termination of infringing activities, often issued alongside exclusion orders for imported infringing goods. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection enforces exclusion orders, which prohibit importation of specific infringing goods. General exclusion orders are broader, impacting all infringing goods of a certain kind, potentially disrupting international trade. The ITC enforces cease and desist orders on U.S. importers of infringing goods, with penalties up to $100,000 per day. U.S. companies can request expedited temporary relief proceedings for preliminary injunctions based on the likelihood of success and impact on domestic industry. In temporary relief proceedings, a Final Determination is granted 90 days after institution for standard cases and 150 days for complex cases. Complainants must put up a bond if they receive a temporary remedy. If the preliminary injunction is not upheld, the complainant may lose the bond money. In FY2008, the ITC reported 88 active Section 337 investigations, including new cases and ancillary proceedings in advanced technology areas. In FY2008, there was a significant increase in new Section 337 investigations, with over 90% involving alleged patent infringement. The rise in international IPR infringement and increased corporate awareness of the benefits of filing a Section 337 case have contributed to this trend. The ITC has seen a general uptick in cases since 2002, with nearly four times more new cases in FY2008 compared to FY2000. Additionally, there were over 50% more active cases in FY2008 than in FY2007, partly due to increased publicity of the ITC as an IPR border enforcement entity. In FY2008, the average length for investigations at the ITC increased to 16.7 months, with two general exclusion orders, five limited exclusion orders, and 14 cease and desist orders issued. U.S. companies can also file lawsuits in U.S. district courts for monetary damages and injunctions against infringers. The federal courts do not have direct authority to block imports, as exclusion orders are enforced by the ITC. Enforcing court orders against infringers without assets in the US can be challenging. Some Members of Congress are concerned about the lack of immediate relief for US companies facing unfair import competition in the Section 337 venue. Proponents argue that delays in investigations could harm the US economy and public health. ITC proponents argue that increased Section 337 activity has led to longer investigation times and heavier dockets for ALJs. Recent cases involve more complex products and multiple respondents. ITC investigations are faster than federal court litigation. Concerns exist about CBP enforcement of exclusion orders due to limited resources. CBP reported 66 exclusion orders in effect as of July 2007. The number of exclusion orders in effect reported by CBP has declined since FY2002. Challenges remain in IPR enforcement due to limited resources and priorities within CBP."
