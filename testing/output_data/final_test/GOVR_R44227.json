The Internet of Things (IoT) and related technologies like SMAC are transforming cities into interconnected environments where people and objects interact in real-time. This hyperconnected world may lead to the merging of cyberspace and human space, with significant societal and cultural impacts. There is no single federal agency responsible for overseeing the IoT, similar to the lack of a central authority for cyberspace. Federal agencies have various responsibilities for the functioning and security of their IoT devices, with some technologies falling under the jurisdiction of multiple agencies. Entities using wireless communications for IoT devices must adhere to spectrum allocation rules, with the FCC allocating spectrum for nonfederal entities and the NTIA fulfilling that role in the Department of Commerce. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in the Department of Commerce, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have various responsibilities for regulating and enforcing consumer protection policies, coordinating security for critical infrastructure sectors, and addressing cybersecurity issues for IoT devices. The FDA, DOJ, DOE, and DOT have responsibilities related to cybersecurity and IoT. The DOE focuses on high-performance buildings and energy programs, while the DOT coordinates programs for connected vehicles and systems. Several federal agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Defense, are involved in IoT activities. The Department of Defense has been a pioneer in IoT technology development for combat missions and logistical support. Additionally, agencies like the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program (NITRD) are engaged in IoT-related research and development. The NITRD Cyber Physical Systems Senior Steering Group coordinates IoT R&D programs across various federal agencies, including FDA, NASA, NIH, VA, and DOD. The White House has initiated a smart-cities project to advance IoT research and development. Despite its potential, IoT faces challenges in technical and policy realms that may hinder its progress. The growth and use of IoT face technical limitations, including a lack of new Internet addresses under IPv4, high-speed and wireless communication availability, and lack of consensus on technical standards. IPv4 is close to saturation with about 4 billion addresses, hindering the development of IoT. Predictions suggest that Internet traffic for IoT objects will surpass other devices, with over 25 billion IoT objects in use by 2020. IPv6 allows for a huge increase in the number of IP addresses, accommodating over 10^38 addresses. To meet the growing demand for IoT devices, IPv6 implementation will likely be necessary. Adoption of IPv6 has been slow, with fewer than 10% of IP addresses in most countries using it as of September 2015. Adoption is highest in some European countries and the United States. Adoption of IPv6 has been increasing globally, with the United States and some European countries leading the way. However, it is uncertain if the growth rate will be enough to support the expected growth in the IoT. Challenges such as security issues, system replacements, and resource availability need to be addressed for successful deployment. Federal government adoption of IPv6 has been higher than in industry or academia, but there are variations among agencies, with some data suggesting a plateau in adoption since 2012. The growth of IoT adoption by federal agencies may be affected by their adoption of IPv6. Access to high-speed Internet and broadband is crucial for IoT use, but many rural areas lack this infrastructure. Resolving issues related to access to the electromagnetic spectrum is essential for IoT device functionality and interoperability. The development of IoT devices relies on spectrum allocation for wireless communication. There is a lack of universal technical standards for IoT, hindering interoperability and scalability. Some doubt the feasibility of a universal standard due to the diverse nature of IoT objects. Various de facto standards are being developed, with formal standards not expected until 2017. Several technical issues may impact the development and adoption of IoT. For example, if an object's software cannot be updated securely, it could affect function and security. Some suggest smart objects have remote updating capabilities, but this could increase power requirements and security risks. Energy consumption is also a concern, especially for IoT objects isolated from the electric grid relying on batteries for power. The electric grid's reliance on batteries for power can be problematic, especially for applications with many objects or in hard-to-reach locations. Alternative approaches like energy harvesting from sources like solar are being explored. Cybersecurity is a major concern in the IoT space, with cyberattacks leading to data theft and physical damage. The potential losses from cyberattacks are estimated to be in the hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars. As the number of connected IoT devices increases, so does the risk of intrusions and associated costs. Cybersecurity involves protecting information systems, components, and networks from attacks. IoT objects are vulnerable to cyberattacks due to limited cybersecurity capabilities. Interconnected devices can serve as entry points for hackers to access other parts of a network, leading to potential data exfiltration or modification. Smart objects can be hacked to perform cyberattacks or cause destruction, as seen with the Stuxnet malware. Concerns about vulnerabilities in smart weapons and connected objects have led to efforts to improve IoT security. New security approaches may be necessary due to the complexity of networks and the automation of functions like authentication. IoT cybersecurity may vary among economic sectors, with each sector developing unique best practices. The federal government plays a role in securing information systems and critical infrastructure. Legislation in Congress addresses issues relevant to IoT, such as data breach notification. The IoT has implications for safety, with both improvements and risks. Objects embedded in pipelines can monitor conditions and control machinery. The Internet of Things (IoT) has implications for safety, with benefits such as expedited shutoffs in case of leaks and crash avoidance technologies in connected vehicles. However, malfunctions in IoT applications can lead to catastrophic system failures, posing significant safety risks like flooding or cyberattacks compromising privacy and causing device malfunctions. The Internet of Things (IoT) can lead to safety benefits but also compromise privacy by allowing access to sensitive information. Privacy concerns include data ownership, processing, and government data collection. The U.S. Supreme Court has been cautious about privacy expectations under the Fourth Amendment with new technologies evolving. Congress may update regulations in response to these concerns. The evolving privacy expectations of the public in response to IoT and new technologies may lead to updates in laws such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. Challenges in interpreting privacy laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and state laws arise from IoT applications. Federal agencies are involved in various aspects of IoT, with discussions on the role of public/private partnerships and concerns about government regulations and policy. Some concerns exist regarding government regulations and policy in the IoT space, including coordination among federal agencies and potential involvement of state, local, and foreign governments. Despite challenges in overall coordination, there are calls for a national strategy for the IoT, with some interagency initiatives already in place. For example, specific frameworks have been developed for smart cities under the White House initiative. A framework for smart cities has been developed as part of the White House initiative involving federal agencies, local governments, and the private sector. The radio frequency spectrum is crucial for IoT communications, with concerns that current policy may favor consumer-oriented mobile services over emerging IoT markets like transportation and manufacturing. Congress may need to consider revising current spectrum policy to accommodate the projected billions of new IoT devices. The FCC adopted an order in February 2015 to protect net neutrality, banning broadband providers from blocking or throttling lawful content and prohibiting paid prioritization. These rules aim to prevent harm to consumers and content providers, and have been in effect since June 12, 2015. The FCC adopted net neutrality rules in February 2015 to protect consumers and content providers. The rules, in effect since June 12, 2015, have faced challenges in court. The impact of FCC regulations on IoT devices and services remains uncertain, with some seeing it as positive for openness and nondiscrimination, while others fear it may hinder investment and innovation. Certain specialized services are exempt from the regulations. IoT services and devices are categorized based on the degree of network management needed. Several bills related to IoT applications have been introduced in Congress, but none have been enacted as of September 2015. Some bills address issues relevant to IoT applications, such as cybersecurity, privacy, and data breaches. Two resolutions on the IoT have been submitted in Congress. Two resolutions on IoT have been submitted in the 114th Congress, one in the House and one in the Senate, calling for a U.S. strategy for IoT development to improve social well-being, innovation, and protection against misuse. The House version also emphasizes the use of cost-benefit analysis, energy optimization, and cybersecurity. Hearings on IoT have been held in both the House and the Senate in 2015. In 2015, hearings on the Internet of Things (IoT) were held in the Senate and the House. Witnesses discussed the growth, uses, and economic potential of the IoT, along with issues like privacy, regulation, security, spectrum management, and standards. Congressional caucuses on cloud computing, cybersecurity, the Internet, and high-performance buildings may address IoT issues. New caucuses specifically focused on the Internet of Things and smart transportation were announced in this session.
