    "content": "A major global donors' conference was held in New York on March 31, 2010, where donors pledged over $5 billion for Haiti's reconstruction. The United States pledged $1.2 billion, and the Haitian government presented an action plan estimating $11.5 billion for recovery. President Pr\u00e9val is expected to rule by decree after May 10, and a State of Emergency Law was passed on April 20. The international community is urging Haiti to hold elections in November 2010. Humanitarian assistance focuses on emergency shelter, sanitation, and basic needs. The relief effort in Haiti is providing waterproof emergency shelter, improving sanitation, and meeting basic needs for the displaced and vulnerable. Most U.S. military forces will withdraw by June 1, 2010, following the devastating earthquake on January 12, 2010. Thousands of buildings collapsed, leaving many homeless, and estimates suggest a third of Haiti's population may be affected. The Inter-American Development Bank estimated the earthquake damage in Haiti to be between $8 billion and $14 billion, comparing it to other catastrophes. The total recovery and reconstruction needs were estimated at $11.5 billion in a country already designated as one of the 50 \"least developed countries\" by the United Nations. The earthquake in Haiti caused extensive damage, with housing, hospitals, schools, and government buildings collapsing. Basic services like electricity and water were disrupted, and major transportation routes were damaged. The Port-au-Prince airport control tower was destroyed, but air traffic control authority was quickly transferred to U.S. personnel. Commercial air traffic resumed on February 18. The main port in Haiti suffered heavy damage, with U.S. troops repairing the facilities. Relief flights into Haiti have decreased from 160 to 75 per day. The use of airfields and ports in the Dominican Republic has helped ease the burden on Haitian facilities. Haitian government officials are working in makeshift conditions, with the Presidential Palace and Parliament buildings collapsing. President Pr\u00e9val is operating from a small room in a police headquarters. The Parliament convened in the National Police Academy after 28 out of 29 Ministry buildings were destroyed in Haiti. The United Nations, with a strong presence in the country, is leading the on-the-ground response for security and humanitarian aid. Their headquarters collapsed, resulting in 101 confirmed dead U.N. personnel, including the head of the U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti and his deputy. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon sent Assistant Secretary General Edmond Mulet to direct immediate response efforts. The Haitian government has made progress in various areas of development with assistance, including security, judicial reform, and jobs creation. Parliamentary elections have been delayed, with plans for joint parliamentary and presidential elections in November 2010. President Pr\u00e9val's term ends in February 2011, and Haiti's long-term development plans will be significantly impacted by the earthquake's destruction. After the earthquake in Haiti, the government and international donors began planning a long-term recovery strategy. A global donors' conference in New York pledged $5.3 billion for the first 18 months of reconstruction, with a total of nearly $10 billion pledged for long-term efforts. The Inter-American Development Bank emphasized the importance of donor coordination for successful reconstruction. The Obama Administration is requesting $2.8 billion in FY2010 supplemental funding for relief and reconstruction support in Haiti. The U.S. pledge of $1.2 billion is included in that request. An estimated 3 million people have been affected by the earthquake, with 230,000 deaths reported. Haiti and international donors have established a Multi-Donor Trust Fund for coordination and distribution of funds. In the aftermath of the earthquake in Haiti, over 2 million people have been displaced, with 1.69 million in settlements in Port-au-Prince and 300,000 in areas outside the city. A total of 16,000 Americans in Haiti have been located, with 16,704 U.S. citizens evacuated. President Pr\u00e9val has called for international assistance due to the dire conditions in the country. President Pr\u00e9val described the conditions in Haiti as \"unimaginable\" and requested international assistance for search and rescue operations, medical units, electricity generation, and communications equipment. He emphasized the need for political stability and long-term reconstruction and development planning, hoping for support from the international community in the short, mid, and long term. The government was previously working with organizations to incorporate disaster risk management into Haiti's development strategy. The Haitian government was working to incorporate disaster risk management into its development strategy, focusing on hurricanes rather than earthquakes. Calls for international assistance and concerns about the government's response capabilities were raised after the last major earthquake 150 years ago. Some Haitians criticized President Pr\u00e9val for his perceived absence following the disaster. The earthquake in Haiti destroyed thousands of buildings, including 21 out of 22 Ministry buildings, leading to the loss of government records. Re-establishing transparency in government spending will be challenging. Delivery of services is hindered by difficulties in transporting supplies. The need for services has significantly increased, with ministries focusing on long-term housing for the homeless. Relief efforts are ongoing, with food and water being delivered to makeshift camps in Port-au-Prince. The government is providing free transportation for evacuees to cities unaffected by the earthquake. The Haitian government is evacuating people from the capital to cities unaffected by the earthquake, with plans to relocate up to 482,000 individuals. Various government agencies and international actors are collaborating to maintain security and coordinate relief efforts. Haitian officials are working with small cities to establish priorities, while senators have formed commissions to oversee aid distribution and agreements with organizations. President Pr\u00e9val and Prime Minister Bellerive attended an international donors' conference on March 31. The Pr\u00e9val Administration presented a 10-year recovery action plan at an international donors' conference seeking $3.9 billion for the first 18 months of Haiti's reconstruction. The priorities include preparedness for the 2010 rainy and hurricane seasons, assisting earthquake-affected populations, reducing dependence on foreign aid, incorporating environmental factors in recovery activities, providing employment and vocational training. The Haitian government is focusing on reconstruction activities, providing employment and vocational training, decentralizing basic services, creating a social safety net, and establishing growth poles to support displaced populations. International donors are asked to aid in reviving agriculture to create jobs and keep relocated Haitians in the provinces. Concerns about corruption in the government may impact recovery efforts, despite progress made in recent years. The government of Haiti has made significant progress in reducing corruption and increasing transparency, qualifying for debt relief. A new Action Plan includes the establishment of the Interim Commission for the Reconstruction of Haiti and the Multi-Donor Trust Fund. Concerns about transparency and oversight have arisen due to the lack of functioning legislature, which has granted broad powers to the executive branch under a State of Emergency law passed in April. The State of Emergency Law passed in Haiti on April 20 grants the President broad powers. The terms of the Chamber of Deputies and one-third of the Senate will expire on May 10, leading to uncertainty about the government's functioning. President Pr\u00e9val is expected to rule by decree, while political tensions may rise as the remaining Senators retain power to dismiss the Prime Minister. The international community urges Haiti to hold elections in November 2010, with Pr\u00e9val promising to step down in February 2011. The U.N. Security Council established the U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti in 2004 under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter. The U.N. Security Council extended the mandate of MINUSTAH in Haiti until October 15, 2010, with the intention of further renewal. The Council increased the overall force levels of MINUSTAH to support recovery, reconstruction, and stability efforts, consisting of up to 8,940 troops and 3,711 police. The Council monitors MINUSTAH's activities through semiannual reports and reviews the levels of troops and police as necessary. The U.N. Security Council increased MINUSTAH's force levels to 8,940 troops and 3,711 police to support recovery efforts in Haiti. The military component totaled 8,306 troops and 2,178 police officers as of April 13, 2010. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon proposed MINUSTAH to lead coordination of international efforts for humanitarian and recovery operations. Ban proposed that MINUSTAH take the lead in coordinating international electoral assistance for the 2010 elections and reconfigure its military component to include more engineers. He also recommended increasing the police component by adding 680 personnel. The U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti headquarters was destroyed in the earthquake, resulting in the death of 101 U.N. staff members. On March 31, 2010, Ban appointed Edmond Mulet as the Special Representative for Haiti and Head of MINUSTAH, following the deaths of Hedi Annabi and Luiz Carlos da Costa. Kevin Kennedy and Nigel Fisher were also appointed as Deputy Special Representatives. President Obama requested $96.5 million for U.S. contributions to MINUSTAH in a supplemental budget request to Congress. The March 24 supplemental request included $45 million for U.S. contributions to MINUSTAH, specifically to support U.S. personnel with police advisers, corrections advisers, and a drug specialist. This would increase the U.S. police and corrections officer contribution to MINUSTAH. Relief operations are divided into phases such as search and rescue, treatment, relocation, recovery, and reconstruction, which can be delayed due to transportation issues. The relief effort in Haiti faces challenges such as transportation delays, lack of infrastructure, bureaucratic issues, and coordination difficulties. The massive humanitarian operation requires ongoing strategic planning to address logistics and coordination issues. In Port-au-Prince, damaged infrastructure and limited communication systems further hinder relief efforts. The relief effort in Haiti faces challenges with transportation delays, lack of infrastructure, and coordination difficulties. Humanitarian supplies are coming in via Port-au-Prince and Santo Domingo. The airport in the Dominican Republic is used as a staging area for relief teams and supplies. Priorities include search and rescue, providing food, water, medical assistance, and setting up infrastructure. The relief effort remains ongoing three months after the earthquake. The relief effort in Haiti continues to be a critical priority amidst discussions on early recovery and reconstruction. Security concerns persist due to escaped prison inmates and reports of criminal activities in camps and along roads. Authorities are urging Haitians to report escaped criminals while implementing specific security interventions. The Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) was completed in time for the March 31 conference in New York, providing critical information for recovery and reconstruction efforts in Haiti. The United Nations established Disaster Assessment and Coordination teams to coordinate onsite response efforts. The UNDAC team coordinated the Onsite Operations and Coordination Center (OSOCC) in Haiti, with sub-OSOCCs in Jacmel and Leogane. OCHA continues to coordinate search and rescue teams, assistance efforts, and humanitarian priorities. They work closely with the government of Haiti, military, and donors. The Humanitarian Country Team meets regularly, with OCHA leading coordination efforts on the ground. A Joint Operations Tasking Centre (JOTC) was established on January 26 in consultation with MINUSTAH and international military forces. The Joint Operations Tasking Centre (JOTC) in Haiti, established on January 26, focuses on civil-military coordination and logistics. The OCHA Civil-Military Coordination (CMCoord) team, formed on January 31, brings together points of contact from humanitarian organizations, MINUSTAH, and international military forces. A Debris Management Planning Task Force was created on February 23. Relief sectors in Haiti are organized into twelve clusters led by various agencies to coordinate partners, prioritize resources, and facilitate planning. The humanitarian aid response in Haiti is organized into clusters led by different agencies, including UNDP, UNICEF, IFRC, WFP, WHO, PAHO, and others. Initially criticized for a slow response, the cluster system is now seen as effective, although some clusters perform better than others. Cluster arrangements have been set up in various locations, including Leogane, Jacmel, and Gonaives. Emergency shelter was in short supply after the earthquake in Haiti, with 97,000 houses destroyed and 188,000 damaged. Approximately 1.9 million people lost their homes, and 597,000 relocated to other departments. Prices of basic commodities increased, and 90% of new arrivals stayed with host families. In early April, the number of displaced in Port-au-Prince increased to 1.69 million, while those outside the city decreased to 300,000. The adjustment reflects more accurate numbers from IDP registrations and a \"pull factor\" as services improve. 86% of IDPs have received emergency shelter materials, but concerns remain about waterproof shelter, unsafe settlements, sanitation, and weakened buildings post-earthquake. The earthquake aftermath in Haiti has left houses weakened, adding to the rubble that needs removal. Finding shelter for the displaced is a challenge, with options including returning to safe homes, temporary shelters, staying with host communities, or relocating to new sites. Humanitarian relocations have begun, with vulnerable families moving to temporary sites in Port-au-Prince. Additionally, over 3,000 people have been relocated to Corail Cesselesse.

Finding shelter for the displaced is a challenge, with options including returning to safe homes, temporary shelters, staying with host communities, or relocating to new sites. Humanitarian relocations have begun, with vulnerable families moving to temporary sites in Port-au-Prince. IOM reported that 49% of IDPs in the area were renters, making long-term shelter provision more difficult. Owners of private schools have evicted people to reopen schools. Decisions on where to build permanent shelters and the type of structures needed are crucial. Food and water aid is reaching people daily, but the needs remain constant, with an estimated 2 million people in Haiti requiring regular food assistance.

The heads of three U.N. agencies \u2013 WFP, FAO, and IFAD formed a new Task Force for Food Security in Haiti to assist the government with a coordinated food security strategy. The WFP is transitioning to focus on long-term food security and investments in human capital programs. The health cluster in Haiti is focusing on basic primary health care services, including maternal child health, rehabilitation services, and chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. Limited follow-up care is available for amputees and the government is shifting towards primary health care, health centers, and hospitals. Sanitation and medical assistance are still needed, with a focus on assisting the Haitian population with food assistance, shelter, sanitation, and education. Post-operative care for amputees is among the longer-term assistance required.

Vaccination programs and targeted immunization for populations in temporary settlements have begun. Mental health care and psychosocial support for trauma survivors are priorities. Logistics for food aid and emergency telecommunications are being managed by WFP in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. UNHAS is operating flights between Santa Domingo and Port-au-Prince. WFP is prepositioning food and non-food items for the hurricane season. Child protection activities are being carried out in settlements, orphanages, and hospitals. Child protection activities in settlements, orphanages, and hospitals focus on the needs of separated and unaccompanied children. Security against crime is a critical concern due to displacement. Water supply strategy is planned to improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation in spontaneous settlements, with a priority on increasing sanitation support to prevent disease spread, especially during the rainy season. Plans are in place to phase out water trucking and develop more sustainable options. Plans are underway to increase water and sanitation services in communities, with schools gradually reopening after the earthquake. Approximately 700 schools have reopened in Port-au-Prince, with efforts to provide temporary schools with necessary facilities. Over 95,700 people have been employed in UNDP's cash-for-work program for early recovery activities like clearing drainage canals and rubble removal. In Haiti, natural disasters like hurricanes have prompted international assistance through the United Nations. Specific disasters include floods, hurricanes, and the 2010 earthquake. Experts emphasize the need to develop disaster response capacity to sustain reconstruction efforts. The international community, including the United Nations and other partners, is actively involved in providing humanitarian assistance in Haiti in response to natural disasters. Various international actors are contributing through financial aid, relief supplies, and emergency personnel, requiring coordination among different entities. The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is collaborating with the Haitian Red Cross Society (HRCS) and other national red cross societies, including the American Red Cross, to aid earthquake survivors in Haiti. The IFRC is working with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on medical assistance, tracing missing persons, restoring family links, and collecting mortal remains. ICRC delegates have visited detainees in Port-au-Prince and Cap Haitien. Representatives from over 20 national societies met in Montreal to discuss a comprehensive approach to Haiti's needs.

Entities have been established to enhance development planning and coordination. The Interim Haiti Recovery Commission and Multi Donor Trust Fund, with the World Bank as the fiscal agent, have been approved. Haitian capacities were limited before the earthquake, and foreign control through these mechanisms is a concern for some Haitians. President Pr\u00e9val and Prime Minister Bellerive acknowledge the necessity of these entities in their action plan. The Haitian government will lead a Steering Committee to decide on fund allocation, with the World Bank ensuring legal compliance. The U.S. Agency for International Development aids in tracking donor pledges.

Haiti was in an acute environmental crisis with only 2% forest cover remaining. The President of the Inter-American Development Bank called Haiti the most fragile of its member countries. Despite progress, a report recommended a strategy for economic security. The U.N. Security Council found a window of opportunity for sustainable development during a visit in 2009. President Pr\u00e9val is in his second term as President of Haiti. During his five-year term as President of Haiti, Pr\u00e9val focused on establishing political stability, building institutions, and creating favorable conditions for private investment. His Administration's National Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction met IMF requirements for debt relief in 2009. With support from MINUSTAH, security conditions improved, and both U.S. Administrations praised Pr\u00e9val for his efforts to improve economic conditions and establish the rule of law. President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton met with Pr\u00e9val in 2009 to discuss cooperation on counternarcotics efforts.

Facing corruption charges, his return could lead to political instability. Haiti's National Assembly, rebuilding after the earthquake, is working with international aid to function again. Political tensions are rising ahead of parliamentary elections. Political tensions were escalating before the parliamentary elections in Haiti in 2010. President Pr\u00e9val formed a new movement, Unity, leading to accusations of bias by the electoral council. Concerns were raised that Unity winning a majority could result in constitutional amendments allowing Pr\u00e9val to run for another term, despite the two-term limit. Pr\u00e9val had promised to step down when his term ended in 2011. In February 2010, Haiti's electoral council postponed elections indefinitely to determine legislative seats. Tensions rise as terms expire without replacements elected. A State of Emergency Law passed, granting President Pr\u00e9val broad powers to rule by decree. The international community urges Haiti to hold elections in November 2010 amidst political instability and natural disasters. Haiti, plagued by political instability and natural disasters, remains the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Over half the population lives in extreme poverty, with widespread hunger. To achieve its goal of eradicating poverty by 2015, Haiti would need significant GDP growth, which the IMF deems unlikely. Haiti's per capita real GDP has declined by 30% over the past 40 years, making it unlikely to achieve the goal of 3.5% annual economic growth as suggested by the IMF. Despite some growth since 2004, economic forecasts have been impacted by recent storms, the global economic crisis, and a drop in remittances. The significant income distribution gap in Haiti further hinders the potential for economic growth to reduce poverty. Haiti has the second largest income disparity in the world, with over 68% of national income going to the wealthiest 20% of the population. The capacity of economic growth to reduce poverty in Haiti is minimal due to this high level of inequality. The National Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction, supported by international donors, focuses on areas such as agriculture, tourism, infrastructure, and human development. The Haitian government's strategy focuses on three pillars: modernization, human development, and democratic governance. After devastating hurricanes in 2008, a new plan called \"Haiti: a New Paradigm\" was introduced, emphasizing strategic infrastructure, economic governance, and business environment improvements. The Haitian government's strategy focuses on modernization, human development, and democratic governance. The government is making progress towards its growth and poverty reduction goals, with optimism for sustainable development. Investors are returning to Haiti, but the earthquake has set back progress. The strategy will need to be reviewed and revised to incorporate new conditions and needs. The Pr\u00e9val Administration will present a revised vision statement at a donors conference and fully revise its strategy after a post-disaster needs assessment. The U.S. Department of State was collaborating with the Pr\u00e9val Administration on a new strategy towards Haiti, which needs to be revised after a post-disaster needs assessment. The assessment highlighted the need for a comprehensive approach for sustainable stability and economic growth, investment in Haitian-led plans, better coordination of donor assistance, expanded reach through partnerships, and improved accountability. The State Department's plan focused on agriculture, energy, health, and security, with governance and education also needing attention in the short term. At the March donors conference, donor countries agreed to principles including aligning assistance with Haitian government priorities, strengthening coordination, and consulting with key communities for accountability. The government of Haiti and donors agreed to increased accountability and transparency in the use of assistance. The international community pledged long-term commitment to Haiti's reconstruction, emphasizing the need to rebuild better. Analysts and donors see the crisis as an opportunity to address underlying issues contributing to poverty and underdevelopment in Haiti. The Action Plan aims to address Haiti's endemic poverty and underdevelopment by rebuilding its agricultural capacity to broaden the economy and reduce reliance on food imports. However, obstacles such as deforestation, topsoil erosion, lack of investment in technology, and unclear land titles hinder agricultural development. Efforts are being made to incorporate post-earthquake needs into Haiti's environmental rehabilitation plan with the help of a coalition of U.N. agencies, government agencies, NGOs, and technical institutes. A Haiti Regeneration Initiative was launched by a coalition of U.N. agencies, government agencies, NGOs, and technical institutes to support the revised Haitian development strategy. The focus is on decentralization to catalyze economic growth and provide services outside of Port-au-Prince. Assistance programs including food, shelter, and job opportunities are being delivered to communities around the country to help them cope with the influx of people from the capital. The current crisis in Port-au-Prince presents an opportunity to address the unsustainable urban-rural distribution of resources. Some suggest not rebuilding the city due to earthquake risks. Property rights issues are a concern as relocation settlements and infrastructure development are planned. The U.S. will support decentralization efforts, while Canada and France will focus on education in Haiti's reconstruction phase. Haiti's schools were inadequate before the earthquake, with many destroyed. Education is crucial for lifting Haitians out of poverty by providing necessary skills for job opportunities. Job creation must be paired with education programs. The focus on energy development is essential as current sources are inefficient and destructive, contributing to deforestation. Clean energy technology could help Haiti break free from poverty traps. Developing small-scale alternative energy sources locally is suggested for rebuilding efforts. Developing small-scale, alternative energy sources at the local level in Haiti is crucial for improving quality of life and economic growth. The United States is focusing on health care in the reconstruction phase due to the lack of basic services and medical resources exacerbated by the earthquake. Job creation is a key part of the recovery strategy, with UNDP launching cash-for-work programs. UNDP has launched cash-for-work programs to stimulate the local economy and provide humanitarian assistance in earthquake-damaged areas in and outside of Port-au-Prince. The program aims to employ 220,000 people, indirectly benefiting about one million Haitians. Jobs include clearing streets of rubble and disposing of debris. Donors are also creating job programs outside the capital to support communities receiving an influx of people. Plans for economic growth involve restoring and expanding industrial exports, with emphasis on comprehensive strategies to avoid over-reliance on any one sector. The Haiti supplemental proposal requests $1.1 billion for Recovery and Reconstruction funding, primarily for new activities in support of the Haitian government's Action Plan. U.S. programs funded through the request focus on urgent infrastructure repairs, critical health care, governance, and security. The 111th Congress has shown bipartisan support for assisting Haiti, responding to the crisis generated by the January earthquake with a desire for a massive, coordinated international effort. Witnesses emphasized the need for a coordinated international effort for immediate humanitarian needs and long-term development in Haiti. Strategies should focus on creating a sustainable Haiti and increasing Haitian capacity to utilize foreign aid effectively. Concerns were raised about the Obama Administration's $2.8 billion request for Haitian relief, with some questioning the priorities and approach of aid programs. Critics argue that U.S. assistance may be neglecting crucial areas like improving the educational system. Some experts suggest developing small-scale, alternative or clean energy sources at the local level in Haiti to improve quality of life and economic growth. Concerns have been raised about insufficient funding for children's needs and psychological support in the supplemental request for Global Health and Child Survival. The revised Haitian development strategy aims to catalyze economic growth and provide services to reduce poverty. The Haitian government and donors aim to correct the urban-rural imbalance by decentralizing services and opportunities outside of Port-au-Prince. The supplemental request includes funds for immediate needs of displaced populations and long-term development in less developed areas, focusing on strengthening local governance, infrastructure, and agriculture. Scientists are assisting in selecting less vulnerable areas for development. Officials support the strategy of decentralizing services and opportunities outside of Port-au-Prince to address the urban-rural imbalance in Haiti. However, they acknowledge the high cost of developing neglected areas and caution against forcibly relocating populations. Experts emphasize the need for targeted poverty reduction programs, as economic growth alone is not sufficient. Capacity building is seen as crucial for Haitians to eventually take responsibility for projects, but there is a challenge in balancing effectiveness and efficiency with the time and resources required. Aid organizations are under pressure to show measurable outcomes despite the long-term nature of capacity building efforts. Aid organizations face pressure to demonstrate measurable outcomes in short-term contracts. Experts advocate for thorough training and coordination with Haitian ministries in foreign aid programs, which may require more time, funding, and personnel. The United States is a major contributor to humanitarian relief efforts, with bipartisan congressional support. Immediate emergency relief may deplete disaster accounts, as seen with President Obama's $100 million aid pledge for Haiti drawn from existing funds. The international community also contributes to meeting immediate needs. After the 2004 tsunami disaster, concerns were raised about funding for subsequent international disasters or aid priorities being jeopardized. Accounts were fully restored through supplemental appropriations, with some arguing that American private donations for tsunami victims alleviated the need for additional aid transfers. In Haiti, the full extent and cost of aid efforts are being assessed. The State Department reports that disaster accounts are being drawn down to provide relief to Haiti, and resources need to be replenished by June 1, 2010 to respond to future humanitarian crises. The relief funding in the current FY2010 supplemental request would provide reimbursement for funding already provided or obligated. Congress may reevaluate U.S. assistance priorities to Haiti, including democracy building, development assistance, security enhancement, counternarcotics efforts, and disaster recovery. The earthquake disaster in Haiti has garnered global attention, with various entities urging governments to offer assistance. However, it is unclear if donor figures represent pledges or actual contributions. The allocation of relief funds and the sharing of costs among international donors will become clearer over time. Comparing USG and international aid is challenging due to the different forms of assistance provided. As the situation in Haiti stabilizes, a more comprehensive understanding of the disaster's actual costs will emerge. Sustaining donor interest in Haiti post-earthquake recovery could be challenging, compounded by the need to secure funds for other disaster areas worldwide. Criticisms of slow international aid delivery include lack of food, water, medical care, and search/rescue efforts. Some argue against unfair criticism of aid efforts due to Haiti's weakened government capacity and damaged infrastructure. The delayed aid effort in Haiti was hindered by the weakened government capacity, damaged infrastructure, logistical challenges, and bureaucratic red tape. Evaluations of the relief response will continue as coordination issues persist. Lessons learned from this disaster will benefit future disaster responses. The U.N. Inter-Agency Real Time Evaluation Mission in Haiti aims to improve future disaster responses. Concerns about elections in Haiti include the need for timely presidential and legislative elections to prevent political instability. Conducting elections before the end of the year faces significant obstacles. There are significant obstacles to conducting elections in Haiti before the end of the year due to the destruction caused by the earthquake. Election experts were killed, U.N. offices and election buildings were destroyed, and many citizens lost their identity cards. Despite this, some experts believe it is possible to hold elections this year with immediate preparations. On January 13, 2010, DHS temporarily halted Haitian deportations and granted TPS to Haitian nationals for 18 months. Haitian orphans eligible for adoption by U.S. residents were given humanitarian parole to come to the United States. Approximately 1,200 orphans are expected to receive parole under this program. On January 29, 2010, 10 U.S. citizens were arrested in Haiti for child kidnapping and criminal association after trying to cross the border with 33 children they claimed were earthquake orphans. The U.S. citizens were released on their own recognizance on February 11, as no evidence showed criminal intentions. Charges dropped against 9 U.S. citizens arrested in Haiti for child kidnapping. Remaining U.S. citizen to be tried for arranging \"irregular travel.\" Haitians granted humanitarian parole are eligible for federal benefits. Newly arriving legal permanent residents barred from major federal benefits for 5 years. President requests $220.0 million for HHS to cover costs for Haitian evacuees in FY2010 supplemental request. The FY2010 supplemental request includes funding for Medicaid and CHIP costs for eligible Haitians, as well as assistance for repatriation. Additionally, $15 million is allocated for fee waivers and processing adoption of Haitian orphans. There are 54,716 Haitians with approved petitions waiting for visas. Advocates are urging humanitarian parole for these individuals. Secretary Napolitano plans to grant humanitarian parole to Haitians with approved visa petitions, aiming to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Haiti and increase remittances. Opponents argue that expediting Haitian admissions may not be in the national interest and could be unfair to other foreign nationals. Concerns about mass migration from Haiti persist, with a history of Haitians arriving in the US by boat without proper documentation dating back to the 1970s. The U.S. Coast Guard has been interdicting vessels suspected of transporting undocumented Haitians. Nearly 90 Haitians were returned to northern Haiti in early February, but there is no sign of a mass exodus. Congress may need to balance immigration control with humanitarian concerns in light of Haiti's disaster. Non-U.S. citizen Haitians with serious injuries were airlifted to Florida for medical care after the earthquake. Governor Charlie Crist requested assistance from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for these patients. Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, activated the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) to coordinate medical evacuees to other states and cover their care costs. NDMS consists of three components for mass casualty incidents: rapid deployment of medical providers, medical evacuation for seriously ill or injured victims. NDMS provides medical evacuation for seriously ill or injured victims using U.S. military assets and medical personnel. Participating U.S. hospitals agree to treat NDMS evacuees voluntarily and receive federal reimbursement. The first NDMS component is frequently used for domestic disasters and international relief efforts, while the second and third components are rarely activated. The NDMS hospital component had not been activated for Haitian medical evacuees brought to Florida by U.S. military flights. The HHS Secretary has discretion to activate NDMS without specific legal triggers. NDMS will reimburse hospitals for 30 days of care for evacuees from Haiti, regardless of citizenship. No funding mechanism exists for extensive NDMS deployments beyond 30 days. President Obama has requested emergency funding of $220 million for HHS to support the Haiti earthquake response, including reimbursing NDMS hospitals for caring for medical evacuees. Congress passed the HAITI Act to increase charitable donations for Haiti relief, allowing taxpayers to deduct donations made in early 2010 on their 2009 income tax returns. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates a $2 million revenue loss due to the HAITI Act. Information on making charitable donations is provided in Appendix I. The U.S. Congress has implemented tariff preferences to support economic development in Caribbean countries, including Haiti, through acts like the CBTPA and the Haiti HOPE Act. These acts provide generous tariff preferences for Haiti's apparel assembly business, seen as a key driver of economic growth. The HELP Act extends these benefits through FY2020, with bipartisan support. The HELP Act, with bipartisan support, extends tariff preferences for Haiti's apparel industry through FY2020. It aims to expand apparel exports and stimulate job creation in Haiti. Increased investment is needed for the industry to recover from earthquake damage and grow. The earthquake in late 2009 severely impacted Haiti's apparel industry, with one plant destroyed and four others seriously damaged. Currently, 19 plants are operational, two are being relocated, and two are closed. Employment levels have decreased from 26,500 to 23,300, and monthly apparel exports have declined. Trade assistance is focused on the sector to create employment in the short term, but critics argue for a broader development plan to diversify growth. Critics argue for broader development assistance in Haiti to address job opportunities and reconstruction. The HOPE Act includes labor provisions for firms to adhere to international standards. Lawmakers are assisting constituents in finding missing persons and facilitating departures from Haiti. Commercial air traffic has resumed, ending emergency evacuations. In response to the Haiti earthquake, lawmakers are aiding in evacuations and facilitating adoptions of Haitian orphans. Information on how to contribute to relief efforts is provided.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 allocates funds for assistance to combat drug trafficking, violence, and organized crime in the Caribbean Basin, including Haiti. The Act emphasizes the importance of judicial reform, institution building, education, anti-corruption, rule of law activities, and maritime security. It also requires a detailed spending plan to be provided to the Committees on Appropriations within 45 days of enactment. The Act to Accelerate the Income Tax Benefits for Charitable Cash Contributions for the Relief of Victims of the Earthquake in Haiti, allows taxpayers who donate to Haiti earthquake relief between January 11, 2010, and March 1, 2010, to claim those contributions on their 2009 tax return.

The United States plays a significant role in providing emergency assistance for foreign disasters through various U.S. agencies. The definition of humanitarian assistance is flexible and can include urgent food, shelter, and medical needs, with funding being adjusted based on the circumstances. The U.S. provides emergency assistance for foreign disasters through various agencies like USAID, which coordinates with international organizations and governments. OFDA in USAID's DCHA provides immediate relief and non-food humanitarian assistance. USAID can quickly assemble Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) to assess conditions and has wide authority to borrow funds, equipment, and personnel. USAID also administers emergency food aid through Food For Peace (FFP) and provides relief and development food aid. The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) provides post-disaster transition assistance, focusing on short-term peace and democratization projects. The Department of Defense (DOD) Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid (OHDACA) funds three humanitarian programs: the Humanitarian Assistance Program (HAP), Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) Program, and Foreign Disaster Relief and Emergency Response (FDR/ER). OHDACA provides humanitarian support for stabilization efforts. Disaster Relief and Emergency Response (FDR/ER) involves providing humanitarian support in emergency situations, including food, shelter, medical evacuations, and defense equipment. The Denton program offers transportation for humanitarian goods. Assistance is typically provided for 30 to 90 days after a disaster by OFDA and Department of Defense.
