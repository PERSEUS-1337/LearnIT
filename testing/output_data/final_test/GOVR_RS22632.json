The 9/11 Commission Report highlighted the need for sanctuaries for terrorist groups to plan attacks, pointing to Pakistan's unpoliced regions as attractive to extremists. The Commission saw President Musharraf's government as key to stability in the region and recommended long-term support from the United States for Islamabad's efforts against extremism. In January 2007, the Director of National Intelligence highlighted Pakistan's dual role in the war on terror - as a frontline partner but also a major source of Islamic extremism. Al Qaeda was identified as the greatest terrorist threat with active connections in Pakistan. This raised concerns for U.S. policy makers regarding the country's commitment to combating extremism. The United States is concerned about Pakistan's role as a terrorist base and the response of the Islamabad government. There are worries about indigenous extremist groups and cross-border infiltration of Islamist militants into India. Domestic terrorism in Pakistan and separatist violence in India's Jammu and Kashmir state are also significant issues. The separatist violence in India's Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir state has been ongoing since 1989, with concerns about cross-border infiltration of Islamist militants from Pakistan. The United States and India have received pledges from Islamabad to combat terrorism, but doubts remain about the effectiveness of Pakistani government efforts. Western experts have doubts about US policies towards Pakistan and Islamabad's strategy of reconciliation with pro-Taliban militants. Islamabad asserts its self-interest in closer relations with the US since 2001 and emphasizes the importance of socioeconomic uplift in combating religious militancy. Pakistani officials believe solely military efforts will fail and advocate for resolving disputes in the Muslim world. The outcomes of U.S. policies towards Pakistan since 9/11 have not effectively reduced religious extremism or stabilized neighboring Afghanistan. Observers suggest re-evaluating reliance on the Pakistani military and President Musharraf, shifting funds towards programs for long-term stability. President Bush pledged a $3 billion aid package for Pakistan in 2003, with annual installments split between military and economic aid starting in FY2005. The 108th Congress endorsed The 9/11 Commission Report's recommendations by calling for sustained U.S. aid to Pakistan at FY2005 levels. The 110th Congress passed H.R. 1 in 2007, requiring a long-term U.S. strategy for engaging Pakistan and linking aid waivers to democratic reform and parliamentary elections. The 110th Congress passed a provision in 2007 that would end U.S. military assistance and arms sales licensing to Pakistan in FY2008 unless the President certifies efforts to end Taliban activities on Pakistani soil. This move may signal pressure from a Democratic-controlled Congress on the Bush Administration's Pakistan policy. The Bush Administration opposes this certification provision and instead suggests a reporting requirement. The Pakistani National Assembly's Defense Committee passed a resolution threatening to reduce cooperation on counterterrorism if U.S. aid to Pakistan becomes conditional. Pakistan has received nearly $1.5 billion in direct U.S. security-related assistance since 2001, with a significant portion allocated for coalition support payments. The Bush Administration requested $1 billion in emergency coalition support funds for FY2007, but H.R. 1591 only approved $300 million. Additional requests for $1.7 billion in coalition support for FY2008 have been made. Major U.S. defense sales to Pakistan have included advanced aircraft and missiles, with Foreign Military Sales agreements worth $836 million in FY2003-FY2005. Sales of F-16 combat aircraft raised the FY2006 value to nearly $3.5 billion, with a planned FMS for Pakistan worth up to $5.1 billion in June 2006. In 2006, the Pentagon notified Congress of a planned Foreign Military Sales (FMS) deal for Pakistan worth up to $5.1 billion, involving advanced F-16s, refurbishments, munitions, and equipment. The sale is aimed at bolstering Islamabad's counterterrorism and border security efforts, including training and equipping new Pakistan Army Air Assault units for targeting terrorist elements. U.S. security assistance programs also include road-building projects, night-vision equipment, communications gear, protective vests, and transport helicopters and aircraft. The U.S. is providing security assistance to Pakistan to strengthen law enforcement capabilities, including training and advanced identification systems. However, Pakistani shortcomings such as poorly trained and equipped personnel may hinder U.S. efforts. Recommendations have been made to adjust the proportion of funds between military and economic aid programs. Currently, funds are split evenly between economic and security-related aid programs. One recommendation is to better target U.S. assistance programs in Pakistan to benefit its citizens more effectively. This could involve making U.S. aid more visible to ordinary Pakistanis and potentially conditioning aid based on the government's performance in modernizing and democratizing the country. The task force recommended directing two-thirds of U.S. aid to economic programs and one-third to security assistance in Pakistan, conditioning aid on progress in reform agenda. Some analysts suggest focusing on building political and social institutions rather than rewarding leadership. Others argue that conditioning aid has a history of failure and could be counterproductive. Some critics warn that additional pressure on the Musharraf government could lead to political instability in Islamabad. The Bush Administration has been criticized for prioritizing its relationship with Musharraf over democratization processes in Pakistan and for overlooking issues like nuclear proliferation and human rights abuses. Pakistan watchers have long cautioned against relying too heavily on Musharraf at the expense of democratic institutions and civil society development. In 2006, former U.S. diplomats urged the Bush Administration to broaden its focus beyond Pervez Musharraf and engage with pro-democracy civil society elements in Pakistan. Improved military relations could benefit U.S.-Pakistan relations and goals in South Asia. Sanctions imposed on Pakistan in 1990, including the suspension of military training programs, had negative consequences for U.S. interests in the region. Encouraging exchanges between Pakistani and U.S. militaries is seen as crucial for promoting a liberal, secular outlook among Pakistan's officer corps. In mid-March, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Boucher met with Pakistani leaders in Islamabad to announce a new $750 million aid initiative for development programs in Pakistan's tribal regions. The Administration plans to seek Pentagon authority to spend $75 million to improve the capacity of Pakistan's Frontier Corps."
