Congress finds that tuberculosis is a significant health and economic burden in impoverished nations and a threat to the United States and other industrialized countries. Tuberculosis kills 2 million people annually, making it the second greatest infectious killer after HIV/AIDS. It is the leading cause of death for women of reproductive age and HIV-positive individuals. One-third of the world's population is infected with the tuberculosis bacterium, with 10-15 million cases in the United States. 46% of tuberculosis cases in the US in 2000 were in foreign-born individuals. In 2000, foreign-born individuals accounted for 46% of tuberculosis cases in the US, compared to 24% in 1990. Left untreated, active tuberculosis can infect 10-15 people annually. Pakistan and Afghanistan are among the countries with the highest tuberculosis burden globally. Tuberculosis and AIDS epidemics are interconnected, with tuberculosis often being the first sign of AIDS. Tuberculosis is often the first sign of AIDS in over 50% of cases in developing countries, leading to 40% of AIDS-related deaths globally. Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS) is a low-cost cure for tuberculosis, costing as little as $10 in low-income countries. Proper DOTS treatment is crucial to prevent multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. The Global Fund fights AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria as a global partnership. Global Fund fights AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria as a global partnership to combat infectious diseases killing 6,000,000 people annually. Expansion of effective tuberculosis treatment programs is a key investment component. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms like \"DOTS\" for tuberculosis treatment, \"Global Alliance for Tuberculosis Drug Development\" for a partnership to develop new medications, and \"Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis\" for a plan to control the disease. The Global Tuberculosis Drug Facility (GDF) is part of the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership, which aims to increase access to high-quality tuberculosis drugs for DOTS expansion. The Stop Tuberculosis Partnership involves the World Health Organization, donors, high burden countries, and agencies committed to controlling and eliminating tuberculosis as a public health issue. Assistance for tuberculosis prevention, treatment, control, and elimination is provided through the Global Tuberculosis Drug Facility (GDF), which is part of the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership. This partnership aims to increase access to high-quality tuberculosis drugs for DOTS expansion. Congress recognizes the global issue of tuberculosis and the importance of controlling and treating it through the Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis. The foreign assistance program aims to address this disease by investing in mechanisms like the Global Tuberculosis Drug Facility. Coordination with organizations like the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control is expected. The Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis aims to detect 70% of infectious cases and cure 85% by specific deadlines in high burden countries. $200 million is authorized annually for this program from 2003 to 2005. Funds appropriated under this paragraph are authorized to remain available until expended. Not less than 75 percent of the amount authorized shall be expended for antituberculosis drugs, supplies, patient services, and training in diagnosis and care to increase DOTS coverage. Additionally, a portion of the funds will be allocated for the Global Tuberculosis Drug Facility. The President must report annually to Congress on the increase in people treated and cured of tuberculosis through US foreign assistance. Funding allocations include 7.5% for the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership and 2.5% for the Global Alliance for Tuberculosis Drug Development."
