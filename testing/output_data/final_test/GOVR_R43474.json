    "content": "During the Obama Administration, CMS and the IRS took actions to modify ACA implementation, focusing on expanding private insurance coverage. The report discusses administrative actions through February 2015, primarily for reference purposes. The Obama Administration made multiple decisions to address issues with the implementation of specific provisions of the ACA. These decisions included delays and changes before and during the 2014 open enrollment period. The 2015 enrollment period had fewer problems. Administrative actions also focused on the ACA's tax provisions, with the 2014 tax filing season being the first to require individuals to indicate their health insurance coverage status.

Administrative actions also focused on ACA tax provisions, with the 2014 tax filing season requiring individuals to indicate their health insurance coverage status. The CRS compiled a table of significant ACA-related administrative actions, not intended to be comprehensive, grouped under general topics with brief summaries and explanatory material. The Obama Administration made decisions to address ACA implementation issues, including delays and changes during the 2014 open enrollment. Administrative actions also focused on ACA tax provisions, with the 2014 tax filing season requiring individuals to indicate their health insurance coverage status. The most controversial administrative action was delaying enforcement of the ACA's \"employer mandate\" until 2015. The ACA's employer mandate, effective January 1, 2014, requires large employers to offer affordable health coverage to full-time employees or face penalties. The IRS granted employers with 50-99 employees an extra year to comply. Enforcement was delayed until full implementation of reporting requirements. The Administration allowed insurers to renew noncompliant health insurance policies in response to cancellations due to ACA standards, extending the policy for two years. Special enrollment periods were criticized for being created excessively. The Administration faced criticism for creating multiple special enrollment periods allowing individuals to enroll in exchange plans outside the annual open enrollment period. Special enrollment periods were established for various events affecting insurance coverage, and hardship exemptions from the ACA's individual mandate penalty were also introduced. State-run exchanges were urged to adopt similar special enrollment periods as federally facilitated exchanges. The ACA mandates most U.S. citizens and legal residents to have ACA-compliant health coverage since 2014. Those without coverage for three or more consecutive months face a penalty unless they qualify for exemptions. Some exemptions are tied to special enrollment periods, like for individuals enrolling in an exchange plan after the 2014 open enrollment period. Opponents of the ACA argue that the Obama Administration's actions are effectively rewriting the law to make it work. The Obama Administration's actions to delay enforcement of the employer mandate under the ACA were criticized as potentially illegal and undermining the President's duty to uphold federal law. The Administration defended its actions as necessary temporary corrections to address challenges in implementing the complex law, citing factors like lack of funding, technological issues, and the need to phase in various components. The Obama Administration's delay of the employer mandate under the ACA was defended as necessary to avoid disruption in employment and insurance markets. Critics question if the delays exceed executive discretion and undermine the law. Critics argue that the Obama Administration's actions in delaying the ACA employer mandate show a blatant disregard for the law, leading to a resolution authorizing a lawsuit against the President. Mr. Boehner accused the Obama Administration of creating his own law by waiving the ACA employer mandate and penalties. A lawsuit filed on November 21, 2014, alleged constitutional violations for delaying the mandate and challenged cost-sharing subsidies without appropriated funding."
