    "content": "Latin America plays a central role in global illicit drug markets, with drug cultivation, production, trafficking, and consumption occurring in the region. South America is the main producer of cocaine, Mexico and Colombia supply opiates to the US, Mexico and the Caribbean are major sources of cannabis, and Mexico is the primary source of methamphetamine. Major drug crops include coca bush for cocaine and opium poppy for opiates. Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia are key coca bush source zones. Colombia has been the largest producer of coca bush, but cultivation has declined. Peru and Bolivia have seen increases in cultivation. Opium poppy source zones include Mexico, Colombia, and Guatemala. Cannabis is cultivated in many countries, with Mexico and Jamaica as notable exporters. Peru has the highest potential production of pure cocaine. Central America also has cocaine production, with a large-scale processing plant found in Honduras in 2011. The key chemical ingredients used to process coca bush and opium poppy into refined products are diverted for illegal drug trade in Central America. Precursor chemicals are imported from countries like India and China. Cocaine use is increasing in countries along major transit routes, while marijuana remains the most widely used drug in the region. According to the State Department, most Andean cocaine heading to the US passes through the Mexico-Central America corridor. Traffickers use various methods to transport drugs from South America, with Honduras being a key landing spot for drug flights. The Central America-Mexico corridor is now the main transit zone, a shift from the Caribbean route used in the past. The region also sees the flow of opiates, foreign-produced marijuana, and methamphetamine through these pathways. Activity along the Central America-Mexico route may surge in the future as U.S. counternarcotics cooperation with Venezuela has decreased. Venezuela has become a major transit point for drug flights to the United States and Europe. Jamaica and the Bahamas are also significant transit countries for drugs. Latin American drugs, especially cocaine, are shipped to Europe through various routes, including West Africa. Europe has seen an increase in cocaine consumption, making it the second-largest market after North America. The number of European users has been increasing over the last decade as North American users decline. Latin America's role in the illicit drug market is due to its unique position as the world's only source region for coca and cocaine. Factors contributing to the region's prominence in the drug trade include poverty, inequality, and proximity to the United States. Weak security forces and corruption have allowed drug trafficking to flourish in the region. Less than 5% of murders in Latin America result in criminal convictions, giving drug traffickers an advantage. Latin American drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) control various aspects of the drug supply chain and vary in capabilities, organizational structures, and levels of violence. Some groups possess paramilitary and counterintelligence capabilities, rivaling state security forces and operating with impunity through corrupt networks. Successful groups have shifted from hierarchical leadership to networked structures. Latin American drug trafficking organizations have evolved from hierarchical leadership to a more networked structure, making them more resilient to law enforcement pressure. Mexican and Colombian DTOs are the most prominent in the region, generating billions in drug proceeds annually. They operate transnationally, expanding into Europe, West Africa, and other regions with low law enforcement capacity and high corruption. Mexican and Colombian DTOs have a strong presence in Europe, West Africa, and Asia-Pacific regions, engaging in various criminal activities and collaborating with other criminal and terrorist groups. U.S. government reports highlight Mexican drug trafficking organizations as the top organized crime threat to the United States, dominating drug supply and distribution in over a thousand U.S. cities. Drug-related violence in Mexico has escalated since 2006 due to increased security measures by President Calder\u00f3n. The Mexican drug trafficking landscape has seen a shift in power dynamics, with the Sinaloa organization and Los Zetas now competing for dominance. Previously, Colombian DTOs like the Cali and Medell\u00edn cartels were prominent before being dismantled, leading to the emergence of the Norte del Valle DTO. This new generation of DTOs is described as less hierarchical and more decentralized, composed of smaller organizations or \"baby cartels.\" In the late 1990s, left-wing insurgent groups and right-wing paramilitary groups in Colombia became extensively involved in the drug trade. The main left-wing insurgent groups, FARC and ELN, are primarily funded through drug production and trafficking operations, controlling multiple aspects of the drug supply chain. FARC has international contacts with foreign terrorist groups and organized crime. The largest right-wing paramilitary group in Colombia, the United Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), formed in the 1980s with the goal of defeating leftist guerrillas. Some paramilitaries demobilized in 2003, but others have returned to illegal activities. Paramilitary elements are now involved in the drug trade, forming new criminal gangs. In Peru, Sendero Luminoso has revived terrorist and drug activities, attacking police and military forces. Sendero Luminoso in Peru has reestablished ties with coca growers, taxing the industry for protection and fair prices. International terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah have funded activities through connections with drug trafficking organizations in South America. The Lebanese Canadian Bank was sanctioned for money laundering linked to Hezbollah. The Lebanese Canadian Bank was sanctioned for money laundering linked to drug trafficking. The Department of Justice indicted Lebanese citizen Ayman Joumaa for coordinating cocaine shipments from Colombia through Central America for sale to Mexican drug trafficking organizations. Joumaa allegedly laundered millions of dollars in drug proceeds from various countries. A drug trafficking organization operates in Lebanon, West Africa, Panama, and Colombia, laundering proceeds through various channels and paying fees to Hezbollah. The Latin America and the Caribbean region has high crime rates, with increasing homicide rates. UNODC reports show a rise in homicides in the region, particularly in Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and parts of South America. The Latin America region has high crime rates, with a significant percentage of homicides committed with firearms and attributed to organized crime and gangs. Drug trafficking is a major contributing factor behind rising homicide rates in the region, particularly in drug production and transit zones. Violence is associated with protecting drug trafficking routes and syndicate power struggles. Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) engage in violence to protect routes and power struggles. They corrupt institutions and use extreme tactics like car bombs and assassinations. This has led to an increase in related crimes such as kidnapping and money laundering. The violence has escalated in recent years, with DTOs battling each other and the government for control of smuggling routes into the United States. Targets include rival gang members, police, military, government officials, journalists, and civilians. The escalating violence in northern Mexico has raised concerns among U.S. officials about potential spillover violence into the United States. Drug-related murders have reportedly increased in some parts of Colombia despite progress in reducing crime since 2002. Central American and Caribbean countries are vulnerable to violent crime fueled by drug trafficking due to their geographic location. Traffickers are using Honduras as a transshipment point for cocaine, leading to heightened levels of violence in those countries. Combating drug production and trafficking in Latin America and the Caribbean has been a major focus of U.S. efforts for at least 30 years. Drug production and trafficking in Latin America and the Caribbean is a major focus of U.S. international drug control efforts. U.S. counternarcotics assistance to foreign countries plays a key role in the counterdrug strategy, aiming to stop drug production and trafficking at the source. The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy oversees the overall strategy, while counterdrug assistance programs in the region are funded by the U.S. Department of State. Counterdrug assistance programs in Latin America and the Caribbean are funded by the U.S. Department of State, USAID, and DOD. The State Department coordinates and funds most programs, with DOD providing specific assistance to enhance counternarcotics capabilities. U.S. antidrug obligations from 1980 to 2010 totaled $16.2 billion. In FY2011, U.S. State Department appropriations for counternarcotics programs in Latin America and the Caribbean totaled $425.2 million. U.S. drug control programs in the region began in the mid-1970s, focusing on countries like Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, and Mexico. There were debates on involving the U.S. military in anti-drug efforts, leading to increased aid to the region through the 1980s. In the 1980s, U.S. aid to combat drug trafficking in Latin America increased gradually, with a focus on interdiction efforts in transit countries. Pressure for U.S. military involvement grew as officials were concerned about combating well-armed drug cartels. The threat of international drug trafficking became a national security priority under Presidents Reagan and Bush. In the 1980s, combating drug trafficking in Latin America became a national security priority for the United States. President Reagan issued NSDD-221 in 1986, declaring narcotics trafficking a concern, with a focus on the Western Hemisphere. President Bush followed with NSD-18 in 1989, prioritizing counternarcotics programs in the Andean region and directing the Pentagon to include counternarcotics as a core mission. The \"Andean Initiative\" was launched to support Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia in counternarcotics efforts. In the 1990s, Congress authorized DOD to provide counternarcotics support in the Andean region, leading to increased assistance to South America in FY2000. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) aimed to aid Colombia and neighboring countries with eradication, development, interdiction, and capacity building. Counterdrug assistance in the Western Hemisphere is shifting, with a decline in aid to Colombia and the Andean region, while funding for Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean has increased due to initiatives like the M\u00e9rida Initiative, CARSI, and CBSI. DOD counternarcotics assistance is also ongoing. The U.S. has been focusing on counterdrug efforts in the Andean region for three decades, with strategies including coca crop eradication, cocaine interdiction, and alternative development programs. Successful efforts in Peru and Bolivia inadvertently shifted cultivation to Colombia, which has been the largest producer of coca leaf and cocaine for over a decade. Colombia's coca cultivation declined from 74% in 2000 to 43% in 2009, with a further decrease in 2010. Peru's cocaine production surpassed Colombia's in 2010, indicating a shift in production. Plan Colombia, implemented in 1999 with U.S. support, aimed to reduce coca cultivation and combat drug production in Colombia. Plan Colombia, in collaboration with U.S. advisors, aimed to end Colombia's armed conflict, combat drug trafficking, and reduce illicit drug cultivation by 50% over six years. Despite not meeting the goal for coca and cocaine, progress was made with opium and heroin. The U.S. provided over $8 billion in support between FY2000 and FY2012, with an additional $332 million requested in FY2013. Aid to Colombian military and police is contingent on vetting and human rights conditions. The U.S.-Colombian partnership, initially focused on counternarcotics, shifted in 2002 to fight drug trafficking and terrorist groups. President \u00c1lvaro Uribe aggressively embraced Plan Colombia, successfully pushing back the FARC and ELN insurgencies. Uribe also negotiated an agreement with Colombia's rightwing paramilitaries that led to the group's disbandment in 2006. The leftwing insurgencies in Colombia were weakened by military operations with U.S. support. President Uribe modified Plan Colombia in 2007 to consolidate state presence in areas affected by violence, poverty, and illicit crops. The National Consolidation Plan (NCP) integrates security, eradication, interdiction, and development. The U.S. Colombia Strategic Development Initiative (CSDI) supports Colombia's efforts in remote areas. President Juan Manuel Santos re-launched the National Consolidation Plan. President Juan Manuel Santos re-launched the National Consolidation Plan in 2010 to focus on fewer municipalities and integrate newly consolidated areas into Colombia's development plans. The United States began nationalizing Plan Colombia programs in 2008, gradually reducing funding while improving security conditions in Colombia. Proponents and U.S. officials praise Plan Colombia for reducing violence, weakening armed groups funded by drugs, and decreasing the role of narcotics in the Colombian economy. However, critics argue that aerial spraying has negative effects like displacing populations and causing environmental damage. They also claim the strategy lacks promotion of human rights, sustainable economic alternatives for farmers, and reducing drug availability in the U.S. Colombia still produces over 95% of seized cocaine in the U.S. Both governments aim to maintain progress made under Plan Colombia. The U.S. and Colombian governments aim to sustain progress made under Plan Colombia by transferring security and counterdrug responsibilities gradually to Colombia. The State Department's core goals include nationalizing security and counternarcotics programs while balancing aid between security and economic/social assistance. Despite declining U.S. assistance, Colombia provides antidrug training to other countries and has not yet transitioned to a \"post conflict\" phase. Colombia continues to provide antidrug training and technical assistance to other countries, sharing its expertise in combating drug trafficking. Despite improved security conditions, the country remains a major drug-producing nation. U.S. bilateral antidrug aid to Andean countries has been scaled back, with Peru receiving steady assistance and remaining a close counternarcotics partner with the United States. In Peru, there is a debate over eradication versus alternative development. Venezuela suspended cooperation with the U.S. DEA in 2005, while Bolivia's assistance declined after shutting down DEA operations. Ecuador, a transit country for drugs, terminated a U.S. lease for a drug monitoring base in 2009. U.S. assistance in the Andean region is likely to focus on Colombia due to budget constraints. Due to budget constraints, U.S. assistance in the Andean region will likely focus on Colombia and Peru. Mexico is a major producer and supplier of illicit drugs to the U.S., with Mexican DTOs dominating the drug trade in the United States. U.S.-Mexican antidrug cooperation has intensified as DTOs fight for control of smuggling routes into the U.S. U.S.-Mexican cooperation to eradicate marijuana and opium poppy fields declined after the assassination of a U.S. DEA agent in Mexico in 1985. Bilateral cooperation stalled in the mid-1980s to late 1990s due to mistrust and concerns about Mexican government's ties to drug leaders. Mexican government was hesitant to accept U.S. assistance due to opposition to drug certification procedures. Cooperation improved after signing a Binational Drug Control Strategy in 1998, leading to increased U.S. assistance totaling $397 million from FY2000-FY2006. U.S. assistance to Mexico from FY2000-FY2006 focused on combating drug production and trafficking, strengthening the rule of law, and countering money-laundering. Despite improvements in Mexico's counterdrug efforts, seizures remained low and corruption hindered bilateral efforts. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, implemented in response to President Calder\u00f3n's prioritization of combating drug trafficking, significantly increased U.S.-Mexican cooperation in the last five years. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, announced in October 2007, aimed to combat criminal organizations, strengthen border controls, improve justice systems, and reduce gang activity in Mexico and Central America. It involved U.S. assistance without a military presence in Mexico, focusing on training and equipping Mexican security forces. The initiative also addressed drug demand and trafficking of firearms and currency to Mexico. The Obama Administration developed a new four-pillar strategy for U.S.-Mexican security cooperation, focusing on disrupting organized criminal groups, institutionalizing the rule of law, building a 21st-century border, and building strong communities. This strategy expanded the scope of the M\u00e9rida Initiative to include efforts to facilitate secure flows through the U.S.-Mexico border and improve conditions in violence-affected communities. The U.S. gradually shifted its efforts from federal to state and local levels, including police assistance and community development programs. The Obama Administration's four-pillar strategy for U.S.-Mexican security cooperation expanded the scope of the M\u00e9rida Initiative to include efforts at the state and local levels, focusing on disrupting organized criminal groups, institutionalizing the rule of law, building a 21st-century border, and strengthening communities. Congress has appropriated over $1.9 billion in M\u00e9rida assistance for Mexico from FY2008-FY2012, with additional funding requested in the FY2013 budget. As of December 31, 2011, $896.0 million in assistance had been provided to Mexico, with ongoing debates on measuring the impact and evolution of the M\u00e9rida Initiative. The M\u00e9rida Initiative was created in response to Mexico's security needs, with a focus on providing equipment, training, and technical assistance. The initiative has evolved to include U.S. operational support, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, to gather intelligence on organized crime activities. The specific type of assistance and level of U.S. involvement may change over time based on Mexico's requests, especially after the 2012 Mexican elections. President Obama identified every Central American country as a major drug transit country after the 2012 Mexican elections. Drug trafficking organizations have increased operations in Central America due to pressure from counternarcotics efforts in Colombia and Mexico. This has led to rising violence, corruption, and weakening support for democratic governance in the region. U.S. counterdrug programs in Central America have mainly focused on interdiction and anti-money laundering. Prior to the M\u00e9rida Initiative, U.S. counterdrug assistance in Central America primarily targeted Guatemala and Panama, the main drug transit countries in the region. Despite efforts to aid in antidrug operations and prosecutions, challenges such as political will, budget constraints, and corruption hindered the sustainability of U.S. assistance. Increased cooperation between the U.S. and Central America on security issues was prompted by concerns over rising narcotics flows and escalating crime and violence in the region following President George W. Bush's visit in 2007. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, later split into CARSI, aimed to provide security assistance to Central America to counter criminal threats. However, officials from the region felt they were not sufficiently involved in its formulation and that it could be more responsive to their priorities. CARSI currently offers equipment, training, and technical assistance to build institutional capacity and supports community-based programs addressing economic and social conditions in Central American communities. CARSI aims to create safe streets, disrupt criminal movements, support strong governments, establish state presence, and enhance security cooperation in Central America. Congress has allocated $466.5 million since FY2008, with an additional $107.5 million requested for FY2013. The Obama Administration supports CARSI and broader U.S. efforts in the region. The Obama Administration, through CARSI, aims to complement Central American government efforts and those of other donors in the region. A Group of Friends of Central America, including the United States, revised a regional security plan in 2010 to address new threats. Donors pledged $1.1 billion in new funding at a conference in 2011 to support specific projects and the regional security strategy. Many Caribbean nations serve as transit countries for illicit drugs from South America to the U.S. and Europe. President Obama identified four major drug-producing or transit countries in the Caribbean in 2011. The United States provides antidrug assistance to Caribbean countries through various programs. The Bahamas has cooperated extensively with the United States on interdiction efforts through Operation Bahamas and Turks and Caicos (OPBAT), a multinational interdiction effort first established in 1982. In 1999, the United States began utilizing forward operating locations in the Dutch territories of Cura\u00e7ao and Aruba for counternarcotics detection and monitoring flights. Congress dedicated $2.5 million in funding each for Haiti and the Dominican Republic for FY2008 and FY2009. President Obama announced engagement with Caribbean Community (CARICOM) member countries at the Fifth Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago in April 2009. President Obama announced the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) to address challenges like transnational crime and illicit trafficking in the Caribbean. The U.S. and Caribbean countries pledged to work together on reducing illicit trafficking as a strategic priority. The Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) aims to reduce illicit trafficking, advance public safety and security, and promote social justice in the Caribbean. The second annual Caribbean-U.S. Security Cooperation Dialogue in 2011 emphasized these strategic priorities, with a keynote address by Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano reaffirming the Obama Administration's support for the region's security. The CBSI aims to reduce illicit trafficking, increase public safety and security, and promote social justice in the Caribbean. The U.S. and Caribbean nations reaffirmed their commitment to the CBSI partnership, with U.S. funding totaling $62 million in FY2010, $77 million in FY2011, and an estimated $64 million for FY2012. Funding supports maritime and aerial security cooperation, law enforcement capacity building, and other assistance programs. The U.S. supports various initiatives in the Caribbean, including law enforcement capacity building, border/port security, justice sector reform, and crime prevention for at-risk youth. The U.S. Department of Defense provides counterdrug support to Latin America and the Caribbean, including training and equipping security forces. Coordination of U.S. counterdrug assistance is the responsibility of the Secretary of State, with DOD programs complementing State Department initiatives. However, DOD programs are not fully integrated into State Department-led efforts. The Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics and Global Threats is a key source of support. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics and Global Threats is the main authority for counternarcotics policy in the Western Hemisphere. The U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) covers Latin America, while the U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) includes Mexico and the Bahamas. DOD has been mandated as the lead federal agency for detecting and monitoring illegal drug transit into the United States since FY1990. Their responsibilities include supporting foreign law enforcement agencies in detecting and monitoring drug trafficking towards the U.S., which has evolved to include military deployments and infrastructure support. The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) provides various types of foreign assistance support for counternarcotics purposes, including military deployments, infrastructure support, intelligence support, and operational support. Legislative authorities define the types of support DOD can provide, with Colombia being a focus of DOD counterdrug efforts in the region. Assistance to Colombia includes training and equipping the military and police, as well as assisting with budget and logistics organizations. The U.S. Department of Defense has been assisting the Colombian government with demobilization programs, providing humanitarian aid to populations affected by drugs, and pursuing a \"unified campaign\" against narcotics trafficking and designated terrorist organizations in Colombia. DOD is shifting its focus away from Colombia towards other countries like Mexico due to budget cuts. Future assistance levels may need adjustment as DOD faces potential budget reductions. $490 billion in planned programs through FY2021 due to Budget Control Act of 2011. SOUTHCOM implemented cost-saving measures in 2011. Congress conditions aid for counterdrug efforts on performance measures to ensure cooperation with U.S. foreign policy priorities. Beginning in 1986, Congress introduced an annual procedure to withhold certain types of foreign assistance from major drug producing and transit countries. The certification process has lost much of its strength as a diplomatic tool. President Obama identified 22 drug majors for FY2012, with 77% in the Western Hemisphere. Twelve Latin American and Caribbean countries have been on the drug majors list for over a decade, with three new additions in FY2011. The drug majors are evaluated based on their efforts to combat drugs and cooperate with the U.S. government. If a country is not certified, it may face sanctions and lose certain types of bilateral assistance. Decertification of drug majors in FY2012, including Bolivia and Venezuela, led to potential aid sanctions. President Obama waived sanctions for both countries, allowing for bilateral assistance to continue. Conditions on counternarcotics assistance are outlined in current law. Several conditions exist in current law for counternarcotics assistance, including prohibitions on aid to security forces and drug eradication-related conditions. The Secretary of State must certify that countries have met performance criteria for counterdrug funding to be released. These restrictions are seen as either supporting counternarcotics goals or creating bureaucratic obstacles. Aid conditions for Mexico under the M\u00e9rida Initiative have caused delays in funding, leading to policy frustration. Congress has taken steps to prevent U.S. security assistance from going to foreign security forces. The State Department has developed vetting procedures to ensure that U.S. security assistance is not provided to foreign security forces associated with gross human rights violations. The Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense must receive \"credible evidence\" or \"credible information\" of such violations to restrict assistance or training. The term \"security forces\" is not clearly defined in the provisions. In practice, provisions often affect assistance to foreign counternarcotics units. Restrictions on assistance to security forces of certain countries aim to address human rights concerns. In FY2012, aid to countries in Latin America was conditioned on human rights reporting. DOD aid is generally not subject to the same human rights conditions. Colombia is a key recipient of aid. Colombia receives U.S. assistance for eradicating drug crops through aerial herbicide application, subject to conditions. Funds for aerial eradication require implementation of alternative development programs for small growers and communities. Aerial eradication in national parks or reserves is allowed only if no effective alternatives exist and is in accordance with Colombian laws. Congress shapes U.S. antidrug programs in Latin America, with a focus on counternarcotics policy. The United States has sustained counterdrug partnerships with countries like Peru and Colombia in South America, as well as multilateral support from the U.N. and Organization of American States. However, some policymakers in the region believe that the current U.S.-led counterdrug approach needs re-evaluation, leading to reduced U.S. participation in counternarcotics efforts in certain countries like Bolivia and Venezuela. This has also sparked growing support in some countries for alternative drug policy approaches, including drug decriminalization. There is increasing criticism of U.S. drug policy from prominent observers and leaders in key partner countries. Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina suggests legalizing drug use and transport due to the failure of the current \"war on drugs\" to curb consumption and violence. Other leaders agree that a debate on the effectiveness of current efforts is needed, echoing a report by former world leaders advocating for supply reduction alternatives. Former presidents of Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, along with U.S. drug policy experts, argue for focusing on demand and harm reduction efforts over supply reduction and incarceration strategies. Vice President Biden stated that the Obama/Biden Administration will not change its policy on drug legalization. The 112th Congress has held hearings on foreign assistance programs in Latin America and citizen security initiatives. The Senate has approved legislation to create new penalties for border tunnels and illegal chemical shipments for drug production. Congress will consider questions on U.S. drug control programs in Latin America, focusing on regional support for alternative policies and improving planning and evaluation of counterdrug efforts. Some Members of Congress are questioning the effectiveness of current counternarcotics policies in Latin America, citing fragmented management and duplicative agendas among agencies. They suggest a more integrated approach, including a multi-year drug strategy developed by the State Department. The Obama Administration has taken steps to coordinate regional antidrug programs in Latin America and appointed a coordinator within the State Department to oversee these efforts. The Office of National Drug Control Policy is also working on a Western Hemisphere Counterdrug Strategy with federal agencies and policy experts. The Obama Administration is working with federal agencies and policy experts to develop a Western Hemisphere Counterdrug Strategy focused on interdiction, disrupting criminal organizations, institutional strengthening, community building, and drug demand reduction. Colombia and Mexico are supporting the Central American Security Strategy, and there is an emphasis on ensuring non-aid programs align with U.S. counterdrug goals in Latin America. Non-aid programs related to drug policy complement U.S. counterdrug assistance goals. This includes Drug Kingpin Sanctions targeting financial assets of drug kingpins and related entities. International Trade Incentives to the Andes support trade preferences for the region. The U.S. government historically offered trade benefits to Andean nations through the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) and its successor, the Andean Trade Preference and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA), to combat drug production and trafficking. Bolivia was suspended from the program in 2008, Peru's benefits expired in 2010 due to a free trade agreement with the U.S., and Colombia and Ecuador's benefits were extended in 2011. The extension of ATPA for Colombia and Ecuador was enacted by the 112th Congress on October 12, 2011, under the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (P.L. 112-42). ATPA was renewed for both countries until July 31, 2013. U.S. intelligence and law enforcement activities play a crucial role in identifying and dismantling drug networks, with the Department of Defense (DOD) collecting and sharing intelligence through assets like JIATF-South and CSLs to combat illegal drug flows in the Western Hemisphere. International drug interdiction efforts in the Western Hemisphere, led by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), account for a majority of global cocaine interdictions. The DEA operates multiple offices in Latin America and the Caribbean, collaborating with other law enforcement agencies to prosecute international criminals using legal tools like extradition. Additionally, the DEA provides training and operational support for counternarcotics missions in the region. These programs are a key component of U.S. counterdrug efforts in Latin America. The evaluation of U.S. drug policy programs in Latin America, conducted by various agencies with separate budgets and missions, is crucial for determining their effectiveness. Congress may consider incorporating non-foreign assistance programs into the counterdrug strategy for the region. Monitoring progress and adjusting ineffective programs are essential components of a well-integrated drug policy. Traditional evaluation methods like crop eradication and drug interdiction may not always capture the true progress made in combating drug trafficking. Measuring the effectiveness of drug control programs in Latin America is crucial, but traditional evaluation methods may not capture the true progress. There is a need to develop performance indicators that measure societal outcomes resulting from U.S. efforts. Congress may suggest new ways for the Administration to assess the effectiveness of drug control programs across different agencies. The Administration assesses drug control program effectiveness across agencies and funding streams. Congress may increase funding for evaluations in foreign appropriations. Funding for eradication programs in the Andean region has decreased, while drug interdiction programs in Mexico and Central America have seen increases. Eradication remains controversial, with some officials questioning its effectiveness in certain situations like Afghanistan. In conflict or post-conflict environments like Afghanistan, eradication programs may be ineffective or counterproductive. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke halted U.S.-funded eradication programs in Afghanistan, emphasizing the need for alternative livelihoods and security conditions before undertaking eradication. Analysts warn that involuntary eradication programs risk alienating poor farmers and driving them into the hands of insurgent groups like FARC in Colombia and Shining Path in Peru. Insurgent groups in Colombia and Peru provide security and protection to farmers growing illicit drug crops. In some areas, farmers seek government help for alternative crops to combat drug traffickers. Congress evaluates foreign aid for eradication in the Andes and its sequencing with development programs. Eradication methods include manual removal, mechanical removal, and aerial spraying. It can be voluntary or involuntary. The United States supports programs to eradicate coca, opium, and marijuana in Latin America, primarily in Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Guatemala, and Mexico. Manual eradication is preferred in areas with illicit plants mixed with licit crops, while aerial eradication is only allowed in Colombia. Aerial spraying has been credited with reducing coca plant productivity in Colombia, but the percentage of crops eradicated through this method has declined since 2006. Despite criticism, eradication efforts in Colombia have been mixed. Manual eradication is time-consuming and costly, while aerial spraying has faced legal and feasibility challenges in many countries. Critics argue that aerial spraying has caused harm to humans, animals, and the environment, but reports from the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission and the Secretary of State suggest otherwise. Despite mixed results, eradication efforts in Colombia have shown declines in overall coca cultivation and cocaine production since 2008. Farmers have adapted to eradication strategies by moving cultivation locations, increasing harvest cycles, and using various coping mechanisms to evade detection. Critics question the effectiveness of eradication without a credible threat. Critics question the effectiveness of eradication efforts in Colombia and suggest alternative strategies like developing licit livelihood options in drug-producing areas. However, finding viable income alternatives in remote, underdeveloped regions for impoverished peasants is a challenge. In conflict regions, alternative development may not be feasible, and even in the best-case scenarios, it can take years to show results, making it an ineffective short-term solution. Recent studies have shown that a combination of eradication, alternative development, and interdiction is more effective in Colombia. In La Macarena, the government focused on improving security, providing government services, and coordinating eradication with food security and alternative livelihoods projects. Analysts suggest implementing alternative development programs before eradication. The USAID does not disqualify entire communities from participating in projects if some families are involved in coca production. The U.S. is concerned about how domestic drug demand impacts counterdrug efforts in Latin America. The Obama Administration recognizes that U.S. drug demand drives the global drug trade and violence in Latin America. The 2011 National Drug Control Strategy emphasizes reducing U.S. drug demand. The Obama Administration's National Drug Control Strategy aims to reduce U.S. drug demand by 15% among youth over five years. While some experts commend the focus on consumption reduction, there are criticisms about the modest budget increases for treatment programs. The federal government's allocation of funds for demand reduction programs is questioned, with a majority of the budget still going towards supply reduction efforts. State, local, and nonprofit agencies also contribute to demand reduction initiatives."
