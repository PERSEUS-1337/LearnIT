    "title": "AB 2462",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2699.3 of the Labor Code is amended to require written notice by certified mail to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency and the employer before a civil action can be filed by an aggrieved employee for alleged violations of specific code provisions. The employer can cure the alleged violation within a 33-day period. If not cured, the employee must notify the Labor and Workforce Development Agency and the employer by certified mail. The agency must notify the employer and the employee by certified mail if it does not investigate the violation within 30 days. If no notice is provided within 33 days, the employee can start a civil action. The agency must notify the employer and the employee by certified mail of its decision within 33 calendar days if it intends to investigate the alleged violation. If no citation is issued within 158 days or if timely notification is not provided, the employee can commence a civil action. A plaintiff can add a cause of action under this law to an existing complaint within 60 days. For a civil action alleging a violation of Division 5, notice must be given to the relevant agencies and employer before commencing the action. The employer can cure alleged violations within a 33-day period, if not, the employee must notify relevant agencies. The Division of Occupational Safety and Health will inspect the alleged violation. If the Division of Occupational Safety and Health issues a citation, the employee cannot take legal action. The division must notify the employee and employer within 14 days if the violation is corrected. If the division does not issue a citation by the end of the inspection period, the employee can challenge this decision in court following precedents of the Occupational Safety and Health Appeals Board. If the court orders the division to issue a citation, the employee cannot file a civil action. The superior court requires a complaint alleging a violation to include notices provided to the division and employer. Nonmaterial differences in facts or theories between notices and the complaint will not lead to dismissal. If the division fails to investigate, the employee can start a civil action. The division's authority to permit long-term abatement periods remains unchanged. An employee cannot file a civil action under Section 2699 while the employer is in consultation with the division to address worksite conditions. Employers cannot enter into consultation with the division after receiving notice to avoid action under this section. The superior court must approve any settlement for violations of Division 5 to ensure it meets state and federal law standards. The division can comment on health and safety provisions in the settlement, and civil actions by employees for violations must meet specific requirements. The employee must notify the Labor and Workforce Development Agency and the employer in writing of alleged violations, allowing the employer 33 days to cure the violation. If not cured, the employee can then commence a civil action. No employer can use the notice and cure provisions more than three times in a 12-month period for the same violation. If the employee disputes that the violation has been cured, they must provide written notice to the employer and agency. Within 17 days of receiving notice of a violation, the agency reviews the employer's actions to cure it and notifies the employee and employer of its decision. If the violation is not cured or if no notification is provided, the employee can proceed with a civil action. If the violation is deemed cured but the employee disagrees, they can appeal to the superior court. These periods do not count towards the time limit for initiating a civil action for penalties."
