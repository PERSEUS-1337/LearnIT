    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Economic Growth and Development Act\". Congress finds that sustainable economic growth is crucial for lifting people out of poverty and addressing development challenges. Private sector investment and economic growth have been key in successful development stories. There has been a significant shift in capital flows to developing countries, with the private sector now contributing the majority. Eleven of the 15 largest importers of United States goods and services are countries that graduated from United States foreign assistance, and 12 of the 15 fastest growing markets for United States exports are former United States foreign assistance recipients. With multiple government entities involved in foreign assistance delivery, it is challenging for U.S. businesses to navigate opportunities. Despite efforts to enhance private sector coordination, agency-specific strategies need integration for coherence. President Obama's 2010 Policy Directive on Global Development established an Interagency Policy Committee (IPC) for Global Development, but it lacks a streamlined mechanism for coordinating with the private sector. To maximize the impact of U.S. foreign assistance and promote sustainable economic development in partner countries, involving the private sector in development planning and programming is crucial. Private sector perspectives and market data would greatly enhance decision-making on program prioritization and resource allocations in various development strategies. By involving the private sector in development planning, programs can attract investment and promote partnerships. The Millennium Challenge Corporation and Partnership for Growth analyze growth constraints but need to be integrated into development strategies for more effective guidance. SEC. 3.

PURPOSE. The purpose of this Act is to enhance coordination between United States development programs and the private sector, integrate private sector input into planning processes, analyze constraints to growth, and ensure accountability for progress. The President, in consultation with relevant agencies, will establish a mechanism to assist the private sector in coordinating development programs with private sector investments. This mechanism will streamline liaison functions, utilize development tools to attract private sector participation, and provide a single point of contact for partnership opportunities.

The Secretary and the Administrator will include private sector consultation in all development strategies. SEC. 7. ANALYSIS OF CONSTRAINTS TO GROWTH AND INVESTMENT IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND SECTORS.

This includes identifying constraints related to critical infrastructure, rule of law, tax codes, and economic sectors like agriculture and transportation. The analysis required for development strategies must be conducted by teams composed of representatives from relevant US agencies, consulting with international organizations, the private sector, and other stakeholders. The results of the analysis should be incorporated into development strategies and used to guide resource allocation. The analysis conducted by teams from various stakeholders should inform development strategies and guide resource allocations. SEC. 8. REPORT.
