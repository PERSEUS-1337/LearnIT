    "content": "This report outlines the Aegis ballistic missile defense program, conducted by the Missile Defense Agency and the Navy, to equip Navy Aegis cruisers and destroyers for BMD operations. Congress must decide on DOD acquisition strategies and funding for the program, which could impact U.S. BMD capabilities and the industrial base. For more context, refer to CRS Report RL32665 on Navy Force Structure and Shipbuilding Plans by Ronald O'Rourke. The Aegis ship combat system, developed in the 1970s, equips Navy Aegis cruisers and destroyers for defense against various threats. The system includes sensors, computers, software, displays, weapon launchers, and weapons. A total of 27 CG-47 class cruisers were procured between FY1978 and FY1988, with 22 ships currently in operation. The Navy procured a total of 62 DDG-51 destroyers between FY1985 and FY2005. The first 28 ships are Flight I/II DDG-51s, while the next 34 are Flight IIA DDG-51s with design changes. No DDG-51s were procured in FY2006-FY2009, instead, three Zumwalt (DDG-1000) class destroyers were acquired. DDG-1000s do not use the Aegis system or have BMD capabilities. Procurement of DDG-51s resumed in FY2010, with a total of 20 being procured in FY2010-FY2019. DDG-51s built in FY2017 and onwards are of a new design. The Navy procured 20 DDG-51 destroyers in FY2010-FY2019, with newer versions built from FY2017 onwards. These newer versions, known as Flight III, are equipped with the more advanced Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR). Allied countries like Japan, South Korea, Australia, Spain, and Norway operate Aegis-equipped ships, with Japan planning to make all of theirs BMD-capable in the future. The Aegis system's capabilities can be enhanced by modifying ships with BMD interceptor missiles. Different variants of the Aegis BMD system exist, with increasing capabilities such as the 3.6.X, 4.0.3, 4.1, 5.0 CU, 5.1, and 6.X variants. These variants are correlated with the phases of the European Phased Adaptive Approach for European BMD operations. The Aegis BMD system, part of the European Phased Adaptive Approach, is designed to intercept theater-range ballistic missiles. It can also pass detection and tracking data to other U.S. BMD systems for intercepting intercontinental ballistic missiles. The system is now being evaluated for potential ICBM interception capabilities. The National Defense Authorization Act directed DOD to test the SM-3 Blk IIA missile interceptor against an ICBM threat. The interceptor could provide additional defense against rogue states' long-range missile capabilities and ease the burden on the GBI system. Congress has directed DoD to examine the feasibility of the SM-3 Blk IIA against an ICBM-class target. The DoD will test the SM-3 Blk IIA missile interceptor against an ICBM-class target in 2020. This new capability will be used to thicken defensive capabilities for the U.S. homeland in a crisis or conflict. Testing will involve intercepting and destroying an enemy ICBM from a Navy ship at sea using the SM-3 Block IIA missile. The Pentagon plans to test the Raytheon-built SM-3 IIA missile interceptor against ICBMs next year. The missile has shown promise in recent testing and could potentially intercept and destroy enemy ICBMs in space, closer to the earth's atmosphere. The Pentagon plans to test the SM-3 Block IIA missile against ICBMs to assess its effectiveness in intercepting and destroying enemy missiles in space. The missile could potentially add a layer of protection to the currently deployed GMD system. The SM-3 missile is designed for exo-atmospheric intercept of ballistic missiles in the midcourse phase. It has a \"hit-to-kill\" warhead and plans for more advanced versions like the SM-3 Block IIA are in progress. The Block IIA version features improvements in target seeker, signal processor, and course adjustment systems. The SM-2 Block IIA version has a larger diameter of 21 inches, allowing for more rocket fuel and a higher burnout velocity. The United States and Japan collaborated on its development, with Japan funding a significant portion. It is designed for endo-atmospheric intercept of ballistic missiles with a blast fragmentation warhead. The existing inventory of SM-2 Block IVs was modified from intercepting aircraft and ASCMs. The Navy is now procuring a more capable terminal-phase BMD interceptor based on the SM-6 air defense missile, which can be used for air defense or ballistic missile defense. A prototype project aims to increase the speed and range of the SM-6 by adding a larger rocket motor, improving offensive and defensive reach. The Navy is developing a Dual Thrust Rocket Motor for the SM-6 missile, creating the SM-6 Block IB variant. The Obama Administration introduced the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for regional BMD operations, with the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) focusing on defense against ballistic missile threats from countries like Iran. Phase I involved deploying Aegis BMD ships and a land-based radar in Europe by 2011, Phase II included the Aegis Ashore site in Romania with SM-3 IB interceptors in 2016, and Phase III will establish the Aegis Ashore site in Poland with SM-3 interceptors. The completion of construction of the Poland Aegis Ashore site with SM-3 IIA interceptors has been delayed by at least a year due to contractor performance issues. Each Aegis Ashore site in the EPAA will house an Aegis system similar to that on Aegis ships and 24 SM-3 missiles launched from a relocatable Vertical Launch System. The number of BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships is projected to increase from 38 to 59 by the end of FY2024. The number of BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships is projected to increase from 38 to 59 by the end of FY2024. As part of the EPAA, four BMD-capable Aegis ships were forward-homeported at the naval base in Rota, Spain, releasing about six U.S. Navy BMD-capable Aegis ships for missions elsewhere. Japan is modifying its Aegis destroyers to include Aegis BMD capability, with plans to have a total of eight BMD-capable Aegis destroyers by 2020. Japan plans to procure and operate two Aegis Ashore systems equipped with the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) in Akita and Yamaguchi Prefectures. The systems will be operated mainly by the Ground Self-Defense Force and are expected to enter service in 2020 and 2021. The U.S. and Japan are jointly developing next-generation radar technology using Japanese semiconductors to enhance the Aegis missile defense system's detection range. South Korea plans to purchase ship-based SM-3 interceptors for defense against North Korean ballistic missile attacks. Other countries like the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Denmark, and Australia are potential naval BMD operators with Aegis ships in operation or under construction. Australia, along with other countries like the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Denmark, and Japan, are involved in operating, building, or planning Aegis ships for ballistic missile defense (BMD) operations. The Aegis BMD program is primarily funded through the Missile Defense Agency's (MDA) budget, with additional funding from the Navy for BMD-related efforts. Congress faces the decision of approving, rejecting, or modifying MDA's FY2019 procurement and research funding requests for the program, including funding for Aegis Ashore sites and operations and maintenance. The Navy's 2016 Force Structure Assessment sets the requirement for 54 BMD-capable ships out of 104 large surface combatants to support defense of the sea base and limited expeditionary land base sites. Congress is concerned about the potential shortfall in available BMD-capable Aegis ships compared to the required number. The Navy's requirement for 54 BMD ships is based on unique operational needs, including meeting CVN escort demand, independent BMD deployment demand, operational timelines in USINDOPACOM and EUCOM. Congress is concerned about the burden BMD operations place on the Navy's fleet of Aegis ships and potential alternatives like Aegis Ashore sites. The U.S. Navy's Chief of Naval Operations wants to end ballistic missile defense patrols at sea and shift the mission to shore-based assets due to strain on surface combatants. Adm. John Richardson emphasized the challenges of intercepting incoming missiles at sea and expressed the need to free up ships for other global missions. Adm. John Richardson wants to shift ballistic missile defense from sea to land-based assets due to strain on surface combatants. The Navy's capability is good for emergencies, but in the long term, a different solution is needed. Richardson aims to move towards dynamic missile defense and free up ships for other global missions. The BMD mission is straining the readiness of the surface fleet due to threats from China, Russia, and North Korea. Adm. Richardson emphasizes the need to focus on missile defense for Navy assets as enemies develop anti-access technologies. He suggests shifting ballistic missile defense from sea to land-based assets to free up ships for other missions. The U.S. Navy's surface fleet is under strain due to the increasing demands of ballistic missile defense (BMD) patrols. The deployment of advanced BMD shooters like the SPY-6 radar on DDG Flight III ships is a response to the evolving threats from Russia and China. However, the focus on BMD missions is limiting the fleet's ability to perform other critical tasks such as anti-submarine patrols and freedom-of-navigation missions in the South China Sea. The U.S. Navy's surface fleet is strained by the demands of ballistic missile defense (BMD) patrols. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson highlighted the deployment of six sophisticated cruisers and destroyers on BMD duty at sea. The Navy aims to be more flexible and dynamic in its approach to BMD patrols, moving away from costly standing requirements on ships underway. The U.S. Navy is considering shifting BMD patrols from ships to fixed shore-based sites to reduce costs and increase capabilities in response to active threats. The Navy plans to increase the number of BMD-capable ships from 38 to 60 by 2023 to meet growing demand. The focus is on finding the best way to fulfill the commitment to ballistic missile defense while considering long-term threats. The U.S. Navy is considering shifting BMD patrols from ships to fixed shore-based sites to reduce costs and increase capabilities in response to active threats. Bryan McGrath, a retired destroyer skipper, raised concerns about the potential unintended consequences of this shift, suggesting that it could lead to a decline in the number of large surface combatants. McGrath proposed the idea of having more smaller, multi-mission ships instead of larger, more expensive ones, highlighting the importance of considering the impact on fleet architecture and roles and missions.

Bryan McGrath raised concerns about unintended consequences, suggesting more smaller, multi-mission ships instead of larger, expensive ones. McGrath emphasized the importance of considering the impact on fleet architecture and roles and missions. A Navy official acknowledged a shift in language on BMD since the 2000s. The Navy is considering shifting BMD patrols to shore-based sites to enhance capabilities in response to active threats. The strategic environment has changed significantly, with China and Russia seeking to reshape the environment in their favor. The Navy is exploring options to employ BMD ships in great power competition to compete, deter, and win against potential adversaries. The Navy is considering shifting BMD patrols to shore-based sites to enhance capabilities in response to active threats. Adm. John Richardson expressed frustration over ships being tasked with protecting static assets on land for a decade, suggesting the need to focus on challenging Chinese and Russian adventurism in the South China Sea and North Atlantic. Japan is enhancing its ground-based sensor and shooter capabilities and deploying Aegis radar and missile defense systems on its ships to free up American vessels for ballistic missile defense missions. Congress is concerned about burden sharing in regional BMD efforts, especially in light of U.S. defense spending constraints and calls for increased allied defense contributions. The US Navy Chief of Naval Operations suggested halting dedicated warships for Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) missions in Asia and Europe, favoring existing land-based BMD systems like Patriot, THAAD, and Aegis Ashore. The debate has quieted down since then, with speculation that the CNO was reined in by the Pentagon. The US Navy Chief of Naval Operations proposed stopping dedicated warships for Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) missions in Asia and Europe, preferring land-based BMD systems like Patriot, THAAD, and Aegis Ashore. Experts believe the Pentagon reined in the CNO for going beyond the debate. Concerns arise about next-generation hypersonic cruise missiles potentially defeating land-based BMD systems, while Aegis-equipped warships offer high-speed mobility and stealth for greater survivability. Japan is preparing to acquire its first Aegis Ashore BMD system. Japan's decision to deploy Aegis Ashore can fill in any gap created by a possible US Navy cessation of BMD patrols. The land-based option is more reliable, less logistically draining, and could provide reassurance to the Japanese people and US government. Aegis Ashore introduces doubt into North Korean missile calculations, but fixed sites in Japan could be vulnerable. Aegis vessels offer flexible forward-defense with limited reaction times. The Trump administration has urged allies to pay more for their defense needs and support US troops deployed overseas. Tokyo needs to proceed cautiously with the Aegis Ashore deployment over Japanese airspace, as neighbors may see it as an aggressive defense posture. The potential shift in US defense posture in the western Pacific is a sensitive topic in Washington and Tokyo. If the US ditches the BMD patrol mission, it could be viewed as menacing by China and North Korea, enhancing the US Navy's maritime warfare capabilities. Congress may need to decide on converting the Aegis test facility in Hawaii into an operational land-based Aegis BMD site. The Department of Defense is considering converting the Aegis test facility in Hawaii into an operational land-based Aegis BMD site to enhance the defense of Hawaii against North Korean missile capabilities. The United States aims to stay ahead of any potential threats and will evaluate the viability of this option, developing an Emergency Activation Plan for quick operationalization within 30 days of a decision by the Secretary of Defense. The Defense Department is considering converting Hawaii's Aegis Ashore Missile Defense Test Center into an operational resource, with a plan to be delivered to USDA&S, USDR&E, and USDP within six months. Lt. Gen. Sam Greaves mentioned potential funding breakdown between the Navy and the Missile Defense Agency for operational crews and research. Congress may also need to address ship-based lasers and electromagnetic railguns. The potential issue for Congress involves ship-based lasers, electromagnetic railguns, and gun-launched guided projectiles contributing to Navy terminal-phase BMD operations. Technical risks and test evaluation in the Aegis BMD program are also a concern, as highlighted in a December 2018 report from DOD's Director, Operational Test and Evaluation. The Aegis BMD system has shown capability to intercept various types of ballistic missiles in midcourse phase, but there are gaps in addressing all threat types and ground ranges. FTM-45 successfully demonstrated organic engagement capability and corrective actions, while FTM-29 had partial success in demonstrating EOR capability due to missile failure. Communication between SM-3 Block IIA missile and KW was shown until signal loss, but not all aspects were exercised after KW eject. This failure highlights a shortfall in ground testing. The FTM-29 failure highlighted a shortfall in ground testing, leading to process improvements for identifying and fixing common failures. SM CTV-03 demonstrated the Aegis BMD 4.1 upgrade's capability to fire an SM-6 Dual I missile. FS-17 showcased the Aegis BMD 4.0.3 interoperability with NATO partners during missile engagements. JFTM-05 Event 2 demonstrated inter-ship communication between U.S. and Japanese destroyers using a realistic communications architecture for ballistic missile prosecution. Pacific Dragon exercise demonstrated interoperability between U.S. Aegis BMD assets, Japanese destroyers, and Republic of Korea naval assets. Aegis BMD has shown engagement coordination with THAAD firing units but not with Patriot. MDA ground tests have highlighted the need for improved inter-element coordination and interoperability. Collaboration with DOT&E and Under Secretary of Defense aims to establish an affordable ground testing approach for reliability assessments of SM-3 missiles. Additional ground test data is required for DOT&E to assess SM-3 missile reliability confidently. The MDA is working with DOT&E to determine if existing ground test venues can provide needed missile reliability data. Recommendations include ensuring ground tests use the same configuration as flight tests, scoring acceptance ground test data for production missiles, and funding high-fidelity M&S RFRs for Aegis BL 9.2 SM-3 Block IIA and SM-6 Dual II scenarios. The SM-6 missile remains effective and suitable, with the exception of a classified deficiency identified in a previous report. In FY17-18, the Navy developed and tested software improvements for SM-6 BLK I to address performance issues from IOT&E. The Navy should continue to enhance software based on test results and conduct flight tests to verify corrective actions. Congressional action on FY2020 MDA procurement and research funding for Aegis BMD program is summarized in Table 2. Aegis BMD system has achieved 33 successful exo-atmospheric intercepts since January 2002, as shown in Table A-1. Since January 2002, the Aegis BMD system has achieved 40 successful intercepts in 49 attempts, including intercepts using SM-3, SM-2 Block IV, and SM-6 missiles. Additionally, a BMD-capable Aegis cruiser successfully shot down an inoperable U.S. surveillance satellite in 2008."
