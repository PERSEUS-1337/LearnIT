    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Small Business Development Fund Act of 1997\" and includes provisions for imposing a tax on capital gains reduction strategy amount. This tax is part of an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Small Business Development Fund Act of 1997\" imposes a 1 percent tax on the capital gains reduction strategy amount for taxpayers with a 50 percent strategy-based reduction for the taxable year. This tax is determined based on the use of applicable tax reduction strategies by the taxpayer. The Secretary determines tax implications based on transactions with similar non-tax results. The capital gains reduction strategy amount is the excess of certain values. An applicable tax reduction strategy refers to any product used in a transaction. The term 'applicable tax reduction strategy' refers to products or actions used to reduce capital gains tax, identified by the Secretary in quarterly lists published in the Federal Register. Sec. 1203 imposes a tax on capital gains reduction strategy amount, contingent on a decrease in the maximum Federal tax rate on capital gains in 1997. The amendments will only take effect if the conditions are met and will apply to taxable years after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, Section 385 of the Code denies interest deduction on certain debt instruments if the capital gains rate decrease is not enacted in 1997. The text chunk discusses how certain interests with over a 40-year maturity or payable in stock are treated as stock for tax purposes. The weighted average maturity of an interest is calculated, and any right to extend or renew is considered exercised. Certain interests with over a 40-year maturity or payable in stock are treated as stock for tax purposes if they meet specific criteria. This includes mandatorily convertible interests, those tied to the value of stock, or part of a larger stock-related arrangement. Certain interests with over a 40-year maturity or payable in stock are treated as stock for tax purposes if they meet specific criteria, such as being part of an arrangement designed to result in payment with stock. Certain interests with a maximum weighted average maturity of more than 15 years are subject to special rules, including not being solely characterized in financial statements by footnotes or disclosures. An issuer will be treated as described in certain circumstances when issuing such interests to a related person. Certain interests with a maximum weighted average maturity of more than 15 years are subject to special rules when issued to a related person, excluding leveraged leases. Exceptions to the subsection include demand loans, redeemable ground rents, and other specified interests. Persons are considered related if their relationship is described in certain sections. The effective date depends on the maximum Federal tax rate applicable to capital gains in 1997. The amendment applies to taxable years after the enactment of the Act. The Small Business Development Fund is established under a new section in the tax code. The Small Business Development Fund is created in the tax code, with appropriations from taxes on capital gains reduction strategy amounts or other applicable taxes. Amounts in the fund are available for purposes outlined in the Small Business Development Fund Act of 1997. The Small Business Development Fund is established in the tax code, with funding from taxes on capital gains reduction strategy amounts. Applications for assistance must meet minimum requirements set by the Secretary of Commerce, including being a credit union, community development corporation, job creation entity, or financial institution in need of capital for small business activities in low-income communities. The Small Business Development Fund provides financial assistance to entities such as credit unions, community development corporations, job creation entities, and financial institutions through various means like equity investments, loans, and grants. The term \"community development corporation\" is defined in the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994."
