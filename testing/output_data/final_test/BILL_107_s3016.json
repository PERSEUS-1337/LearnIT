    "content": "The Act titled \"Sun Grant Initiative for Renewable Energy and Biobased Products Act\" establishes research, extension, and educational programs on biobased energy technologies and products under Title IX of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002. The programs established under this section aim to enhance national energy security, promote agricultural diversification and environmental sustainability, and boost economic diversification in rural areas through biobased energy and product technologies. The term 'land-grant colleges and universities' refers to specific institutions as defined in relevant legislation. The Secretary will establish programs to provide grants to sun grant centers at specific institutions, including 1890 and 1994 Institutions. The grants will be used to enhance national energy security, promote agricultural and economic diversification through biobased technologies. The Secretary will establish sun grant centers at specific institutions in different regions of the United States to promote national energy security and biobased technologies. The regions include states like Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Wyoming, Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Puerto Rico, United States Virgin Islands, Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas. The Secretary will establish sun grant centers at specific institutions in different regions of the United States. A western center at Oregon State University will cover Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Washington. A northeastern center at Cornell University will cover Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The Secretary will provide equal grants to sun grant centers in specified states for fiscal year funding. Centers must use funds for science, engineering, and economics programs to promote agricultural purposes through educational institutions. The sun grant center established for a region provides competitive grants to land-grant colleges and universities for research, extension, and educational programs on technology development and implementation. The sun grant center provides grants for educational programs on technology implementation, allocating at least 20 percent of funds for each program type. Additionally, the center may recover indirect costs up to 19 percent for grant-making. The sun grant center may recover indirect costs up to 19 percent for grant-making to other land-grant colleges and universities. Sun grant centers, in collaboration with other institutions and private industry, will develop a plan for grants to facilitate the development of biobased products industries and biobased transportation fuels production. The sun grant center prioritizes grants for biobased products industries and transportation fuels production, with a focus on hydrogen production systems by 2018. Grants to other land-grant colleges and universities have a maximum term of 5 years and must align with the approved plan. Collaboration with institutions and industry is key for developing biobased products industries. The sun grant centers must develop a plan for coordination with the bioenergy and biobased product programs of the Secretary of Energy, including Oak Ridge National Laboratory and National Renewable Energy Laboratory. They also need to maintain a Sun Grant Information Analysis Center for data management support and submit annual reports to the Secretary describing their program's policies, priorities, and operations. Authorization of Appropriations: $100,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2003 through 2020 to facilitate priorities, with $4,000,000 allocated annually for subsection (h) activities. SEC. 3. BIOMASS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. The Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000 is amended to include a representative of the Cooperative Research, Extension, and Educational Service on the Board. Additionally, the Technical Advisory Committee undergoes amendments to its structure. The Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000 is amended to include a representative of sun grant centers specified in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 on the Board."
