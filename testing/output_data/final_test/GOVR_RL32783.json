    "content": "House-Senate conferees concluded negotiations on H.R. 1268, the emergency FY2005 supplemental appropriation, agreeing to an $82 billion total. The bill was passed by the House on May 5 (368-58), followed by the Senate on May 10 (100-0), and signed by President Bush on May 11. The conference agreement closely matched the President's request but included changes in funding allocations and policy provisions, including immigration legislation. The Senate initially passed H.R. 1268 with $81.3 billion, slightly less than the President's request and the House level. P.L. 109-13 provides $75.86 billion for defense-related expenses, falling between the House and Senate totals. The enacted bill for the emergency FY2005 supplemental appropriation provides higher benefits to survivors of combat-related deaths and falls about $500 million below the President's request for State Department and foreign aid programs. It includes a $1 billion rescission of aid to Turkey, resulting in a net foreign policy total $1.5 billion less than proposed. The bill also includes funding for U.S. embassy in Iraq, U.N. peacekeeping missions, humanitarian assistance for Darfur, global food aid, Africa refugee relief, and support for Haiti. The enacted bill for the emergency FY2005 supplemental appropriation includes provisions from the REAL ID Act of 2005, expands terror-related activity criteria for aliens, allows waivers for constructing barriers at U.S. borders, and permits additional non-agricultural seasonal workers. This supplemental funding focuses on the global war on terrorism and homeland security, with no spending limits on foreign assistance. The emergency supplemental funding for the global war on terror includes $268.7 billion provided by Congress for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, enhanced security, and foreign aid for reconstruction. The total war-related funding in this administration would reach $350.6 billion if the request is enacted, with the majority allocated to military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Department of Defense (DOD) has received a total of $276 billion for missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the global war on terror from FY2001 to FY2005. An additional $74.9 billion is requested for FY2005, bringing the total projected cost to $98 billion. This is a significant increase from the $64.9 billion provided in FY2004. The conference bill allocated $277 billion to the Department of Defense for missions from FY2001 to FY2005. The supplemental increased the U.S. foreign policy budget to $34.5 billion, a 16% increase from FY2005. This is the largest foreign policy budget since fiscal 1985, 41% higher than pre-9/11 levels. The DOD request for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan totaled $44.9 billion, with $35.5 billion for Iraq and $9.4 billion for Afghanistan. Additional funds were allocated for training and equipping security forces in both countries. $5 billion was designated for the Army's modularity initiative and Marine Corps restructuring. The remaining funds were not allocated by specific mission. The DOD's procurement included funds for upgrading Army units, force protection items, and classified programs. The President's request for FY2005 supplemental funding would support various foreign policy activities, including diplomatic costs, reconstruction programs, humanitarian relief, and aid for countries like Jordan and Pakistan. Additionally, the request addressed homeland security and global war on terrorism matters, such as Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation. The FY2005 supplemental funding includes $110 million for radiation detection equipment and training at overseas posts, $112 million for Coast Guard port security in the Persian Gulf, $80 million for expanding the Terrorist Screening Center, $8 million for DEA's Counternarcotics Implementation Plan in Afghanistan, and $250 million for additional personnel at the Director of National Intelligence. The FY2005 supplemental funding includes $250 million for additional personnel and a new building for the new Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to oversee the intelligence budget. Capitol Police receive $60 million, Judiciary Branch receives $100 million for additional case workload costs. The Senate focused on immigration proposals, including increasing visas for foreign temporary non-agricultural workers and border security funding. The House included the Real ID Act tightening asylum standards and creating driver's license standards. The Real ID Act tightens asylum standards and creates driver's license standards that could impact immigrants. The Senate-passed bill did not include the REAL ID Act, but the conferees retained immigration provisions from both chambers. The House-passed version of H.R. 1268 included immigration provisions from a previous bill. The REAL ID Act of 2005 modifies eligibility criteria for asylum and withholding of removal. The REAL ID Act of 2005 makes changes to asylum eligibility criteria, limits judicial review of immigration decisions, eliminates the Breach Bond Account, expands terror-related activity grounds for inadmissibility, and requires minimum security standards for state-issued driver's licenses. The conferees accept the Real ID Act with modifications to asylum and withholding of removal, dropping the section on bonds. The compromise allows asylum seekers to demonstrate multiple motives for persecution and removes the cap on the number of asylum recipients who can become legal residents. Senator Barbara Mikulski's amendment increases visas for foreign temporary nonagricultural workers. Senator Barbara Mikulski's amendment increases the availability of visas for foreign temporary nonagricultural workers, known as H-2B workers, by exempting returning H-2B workers from the cap of 66,000 annually if they have held the visa in the past three years. The amendment also imposes a cap of 33,000 H-2B slots for the first six months of a fiscal year, requires regular reporting to Congress on the program, introduces a fraud-prevention fee for employers, and allows for additional penalties in certain cases. The Senate passed the Mikulski amendment by 94-6. The Senate passed the Mikulski amendment, as modified, by 94-6, which includes provisions for employment-based immigration such as reserving H-1B visas for Australian nationals and creating permanent employment-based visas for nurses. Additionally, funds were allocated for border patrol and immigration enforcement activities in response to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. The Senate did not include provisions from Senator Craig's AgJOBS bill in the Senate bill, which aimed to streamline the process for bringing in foreign workers under the H-2A program. Senator Chambliss also proposed an amendment for a new temporary worker program, but it was not included in the bill. The Senate failed to limit debate on the Chambliss amendment regarding funds for Iraq and Afghanistan security forces. The Administration requested $1.3 billion for Afghan security force assistance and $5.7 billion for Iraq security forces for training and equipping military personnel. The Defense Department requested funds for training and equipping Iraqi and Afghan forces under the authority of the Secretary of Defense. The request did not specify details on force numbers or training schedules, allowing flexibility for expenses until funds are exhausted. Past assistance for Iraq security forces was managed by the Defense Department on the ground, while funds were initially controlled by the Coalition Provisional Authority. The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) shifted authority from the Department of State to DOD for the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF) in FY2004. Congress earmarked $3.2 billion for security activities, but the Administration sought to re-prioritize funds for security and law enforcement programs to $5.05 billion in September 2004. The Administration sought congressional approval for transfers exceeding authorities provided in P.L. 108-106 to increase funding for security and law enforcement programs to $5.05 billion. Congress granted these transfers in P.L. 108-309, with funds primarily managed by the Defense Department for activities such as police training, border enforcement, facilities protection, Iraqi Armed Forces support, and Iraqi National Guard operations and equipment. The Administration sought congressional approval for transfers exceeding authorities provided in P.L. 108-106 to increase funding for security and law enforcement programs to $5.05 billion. Congress granted these transfers in P.L. 108-309, with funds primarily managed by the Defense Department for activities such as police training, border enforcement, facilities protection, Iraqi Armed Forces support, and Iraqi National Guard operations and equipment. Guard operations and personnel\u2014$232 million (DOD). Iraqi National Guard equipment\u2014$92 million (DOD). Iraqi National Guard facilities\u2014$359 million (DOD). Iraqi Security Forces Quick Response program\u2014$120 million (DOD). Commander's Humanitarian Relief and Reconstruction\u2014$86 million (DOD, Multinational Force-Iraq, and USAID). For Afghanistan, security assistance funding since early 2002 has been provided exclusively through the Foreign Operations Subcommittee regular Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and Peacekeeping (PKO) accounts. FMF aid finances the acquisition of military articles, services, and training, supports U.S. regional stability goals, and enables friends and allies to improve their defense capabilities. Policy direction and funding allocations fall under the responsibility of the State Department, while DOD executes the program on the ground. Broadly, PKO activities support non-U.N. voluntary operations, but in the case of Afghanistan, Peacekeeping appropriations have been. The supplemental proposal seeks to shift funding and authority for Afghan National Army training and equipping from State Department to DOD resources under the Secretary of Defense. This move has raised concerns about the shift in funding responsibility. Concerns were raised about the shift of funding and management of Iraqi and Afghanistan security forces assistance from the State Department to the Department of Defense. Some argued for maintaining civilian authority over the program, especially for foreign police assistance. Secretary of State Rice defended the proposal, citing the unique war zone situation in Iraq and the need for a coherent strategy for training and equipping security forces. Secretary Rice defended the shift of funding and management of Iraqi and Afghan security forces assistance to the Defense Department, citing the unique war zone situation. She emphasized the importance of integrating Afghan security forces in operational efforts and ensuring close collaboration between agencies. The conference bill provides full funding for Iraq and Afghan Security Forces but requires additional congressional oversight and involvement of the Secretary of State. The conference bill requires congressional oversight and involvement of the Secretary of State for funding and management of Iraqi and Afghan security forces. Funds must be reported to defense committees in advance of transfers, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State. Emergency appropriations do not count against budget ceilings but increase the budget deficit. Members of Congress are closely monitoring the supplemental funding. The Administration's FY2006 proposal aims to tighten the definition of emergency requirements exempt from Budget Enforcement Act mechanisms. It defines emergencies as sudden, urgent, unforeseen, and not permanent expenditures, including national security-related contingency operations. Military operations and regular foreign aid costs should be part of base funding, not covered under emergencies. In recent hearings, the Senate Budget Committee and Senate Appropriations Committees discussed whether all elements in the FY2005 supplemental were appropriately classified as emergency spending. Members questioned the \"emergency\" nature of several proposals within the foreign policy portion of the request, including funds for a new embassy in Baghdad. The Department sought $658 million in the supplemental budget, with concerns raised about insufficient peacekeeping funds and additional assistance for Jordan, Pakistan, and Ukraine. Scrutiny was also placed on the Afghan reconstruction request of $2 billion following previous appropriations. The $400 million for coalition members and partner countries in the war on terrorism was challenged as new initiatives. Some argued that longer-term tsunami related reconstruction assistance should be debated later in the regular FY2006 Foreign Operations bill, adding pressure on the Administration to defend a sizable foreign policy increase. Questions were raised about funds for the Army's modularity initiative and whether it fits the emergency criteria. Funding for modularity and additional military personnel was approved by the conferees and both houses, despite some questioning the emergency nature of the request. The cost of DOD's military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan was also debated, with some arguing that the operations were not unanticipated. While most of the President's supplemental request was approved as an emergency, some non-emergency areas were not funded, including cuts to Afghanistan reconstruction, economic programs for southern Sudan, and U.N. peacekeeping contributions. The House Appropriations Committee rescinded $1 billion in FY2003 economic aid for Turkey to offset portions of foreign policy supplemental spending for various countries, including Jordan, Pakistan, Ukraine, the Palestinians, Afghanistan reconstruction, and USAID operating expenses in Iraq. Emergency funds were limited to situations posing a direct threat to life and property, with non-emergency items offset by the Turkey aid rescission. The House-reported measure denied funding for certain foreign policy activities, including reconstruction support and counter-narcotics programs for Afghanistan. Lawmakers adopted an amendment prohibiting funds for embassy security, construction, and maintenance during House floor debate. The Senate debated reducing funding for the U.S. embassy in Iraq, but ultimately tabled the amendment. House appropriators fully funded the Army's request to address challenges and stress on active-duty combat forces. The conference bill includes language calling for a budget amendment by September 1, 2005, for future military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Administration is called upon to submit a budget amendment by September 1, 2005, for FY2006 military operations, along with detailed cost estimates. Questions have been raised about the classification of military construction requests as emergency, with concerns raised about projects like the new prison facility in Guantanamo for detainees. An amendment to cut funding for Guantanamo was defeated by a vote of 27 to 71. H.R. 1268 designated all amounts as an emergency in the FY2005 Supplemental, with a total request of $74.96 billion. The Defense Department requested an additional $25 billion for war-related costs, bringing the total anticipated amount for Iraq and Afghanistan in FY2005 to $98.0 billion. Major defense issues were raised, including increasing accountability for costs in the global war on terror. The conference report on H.R. 1268 closed the gap between the House and Senate versions by providing $75.86 billion for the Defense Department. This included expanding death benefits for service members and covering the costs with an additional $765 million. The conference version of H.R. 1268 includes $765 million for higher benefits, which would lapse by September 30, 2005 without additional provisions. It also introduces a new insurance rider for traumatic injury protection, providing $25,000 to $100,000 retroactively and in the future. The full $7.0 billion requested for training Afghan and Iraqi security forces is approved, with a shift from detailed reporting requirements to a call for \"strategies of success\" and performance indicators to assess security in Iraq. The conference version of H.R. 1268 includes provisions for higher benefits and a new insurance rider for traumatic injury protection. It also approves the full $7.0 billion requested for training Afghan and Iraqi security forces, with a focus on assessing security in Iraq through \"strategies of success\" and performance indicators. Additionally, the conference version prohibits the cancellation of the C-130J transport aircraft and the retirement of the 12th carrier, the Kennedy. The conferees cut DOD's request for Operation and Maintenance funds by about $1 billion, transferring funds from Afghan and Iraq Security Forces Funds to cover Army training costs. They also reduced the military construction funds request by $300 million due to concerns about long-term presence in the region. All projects in the United States to support Army and Marine Corps restructuring plans were funded, with additional funds for Marine Corps restructuring facilities. The conference version of the bill increases benefits for survivors of those who die in combat areas or combat-related activities. It includes $765 million for these benefits, with retroactive payments to eligible survivors from October 7, 2001. Members can increase their life insurance to $400,000 with premiums paid by DOD for those in combat areas. Spouses must be notified if the member opts for less than the maximum level. Higher death gratuity is available immediately, while higher insurance levels will take effect later. The death gratuity is available immediately, but higher insurance levels would start 90 days after enactment. If someone dies within those 90 days, DOD would pay an additional $150,000. The higher insurance levels and death benefit would lapse on September 30, 2005, unless changes are made in the FY2006 defense authorization. The bill includes meal and telephone services for soldiers recovering from injuries incurred in Afghanistan or Iraq, but this provision expires on September 30, 2005. The basic housing allowance for dependents of those who die in Iraq and Afghanistan is extended to a year instead of six months. The conferees adopt Senate-proposed provisions for increased benefits for service members injured in Iraq and Afghanistan, including extended allowance for dependents and traumatic injury protection. They also prevent the termination of the C-130J program. The Air Force plans to terminate the C-130J program due to cost increases and meeting requirements issues, with potential termination costs of $1.6 billion. The Senate amendment requires the Navy to keep 12 carriers and extend the life of the U.S.S. John F. Kennedy. The Defense Department believes 11 carriers are sufficient, and prohibits DOD from a winner-take-all competition for the DD(X) destroyer. The conferees express concerns about accountability in report language. The conference bill retains the Sense of the Senate language calling for future war costs to be included in the Defense Department's regular appropriations act. It also requires DOD to report its costs for Iraq and Afghanistan semi-annually, provides $7.0 billion for the Afghan and Iraq Security Fund accounts, and outlines procedures for fund transfers and reporting. The Senate and House provide funding for stability and security in Iraq, with differences in allocated amounts for coalition and ally support. Senate and House amendments are listed in Tables 2 and 3, with ongoing debates on the long-term costs of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Administration has not provided a required projection of DOD costs for FY2006-FY2011. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that DOD's costs for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and enhanced security could total $537 billion through FY2015, with costs gradually declining from 300,000 personnel in FY2006 to 74,000 by FY2010. DOD had already received $201.2 billion for these operations through previous appropriations, and an additional $75.6 billion was allocated in the supplemental. The Democratic staff of the House Budget Committee projected future costs of the Iraq war under two scenarios. One scenario involves withdrawing all forces by 2009, estimating total costs of $461 billion. Another scenario, assuming a more gradual withdrawal, estimated costs through FY2015 at $646 billion. The Administration's FY2006 defense request did not include funds for war-related expenses, but the FY2006 budget resolution includes a reserve Fund of about $50 billion for FY2006. The CBO estimated a deficit of $394 billion in FY2005 and $370-$375 billion in FY2006, including war-related spending. Concerns were raised about the lack of information on future war costs. H.R. 1268 includes language calling for detailed cost estimates for ongoing military operations. Attempts to add amendments for investigating war-time contracting failed during H.R. 1268 debate. Concerns raised about $200 billion spent on \"global war on terror\" and DOD's misuse of funds. Senate passed amendment to include war costs in DOD's regular appropriations and require overdue reports. DOD has not submitted two reports on war costs. The House rejected an amendment to set up a select committee to investigate war contracts and funding. Instead, they approved a $1 million fund for the Defense Department to provide information on success standards in Iraq. DOD has not submitted required reports on war costs and estimates. The conference bill includes provisions for uparmoring HMMWVS and prohibits torture or cruel punishment. The Defense Department requested $98.0 billion for FY2005, a significant increase from previous years. This includes recurring costs for military operations and investment costs to replace damaged equipment. The FY2005 budget for the Defense Department saw a significant increase from $3 billion to almost $18 billion, with funds allocated for equipment replacement, support for other nations, and operating costs. This included provisions for uparmoring HMMWVS and prohibiting torture or cruel punishment. DOD requested a transfer of funds to cover ongoing war-related expenses through May 2005, with 70% for operational costs like higher pay for deployed forces, activating reservists, and maintenance. The FY2005 supplemental request included a $10 billion increase for military operations, with $3.5 billion for fuel costs and $3.5 billion for operating tempo. Military personnel costs remained similar to FY2004, with anticipated forces in Iraq declining. The Defense Department anticipated a decline in forces in Iraq from 160,000 to 138,000 after the Iraqi elections, with forces in Afghanistan remaining at 18,000. Little information was provided about the 300,000 military personnel deployed or supporting operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. One-third of deployed personnel had served two or more deployments by the end of FY2004, indicating DOD policies were not being met. The FY2005 Supplemental request included $1.7 billion for costs. The FY2005 Supplemental request included $1.7 billion for additional military personnel to reduce stress on current forces. Some Members argued that these personnel will be needed long-term due to Afghanistan and Iraq, suggesting the expense should be in DOD's regular budget. The Defense Department stated the personnel will be temporary until new units are created in FY2007. Military police, civil affairs, and intelligence personnel billets will increase while artillery personnel will decrease. The conference version of the bill provides about $500 million more than the request for military personnel, primarily for higher death benefits. Both bills reduce DOD's operation and maintenance funding by about $1 billion, mainly by cutting funds for allies in the global war on terror. DOD's FY2005 request applied savings from peacetime training to wartime costs. The FY2005 Supplemental request included $376 million for higher death benefits for families of service members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. The proposed changes would increase the death gratuity to $100,000 and raise the limit on Servicemembers Group Life Insurance to $400,000, retroactively applying to those who died since October 7, 2001. Survivors of those killed would receive an additional $238,000 in benefits. The FY2005 Supplemental request included $376 million for higher death benefits for families of service members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. General Myers and the Chiefs of the individual services supported enhanced benefits for all service members who died. The conference bill raised life insurance to $400,000 and death gratuity to $100,000 for survivors of combat-related deaths. Several bills were introduced in Congress to provide these benefits. The conference version of the bill proposed higher benefits for survivors of service members who die in combat or combat-related activities, including an additional $238,000 in insurance and death benefits. The death benefit would increase from $12,000 to $100,000, and members could purchase up to $400,000 in life insurance. DOD would pay the premiums for the additional $150,000 of insurance for those serving in combat areas. The House version proposed an additional $150,000 for survivors of active duty service members who die in the line of duty, with unclear coverage details. The cost could range from $95 million to $300 million according to Representative Obey. The Senate adopted a different criterion, providing $150,000 to survivors of members who die in combat-related activities in Afghan or Iraqi theaters. The Senate bill increased the death gratuity for active-duty service members from $12,000 to $100,000 retroactively to October 12, 2001, with broader benefits that would apply in the future. Service members could also increase their coverage under Servicemembers Group Life Insurance from $250,000 to $400,000, with written spousal consent required for opting out of full coverage. The conference version of the bill raised the maximum insurance level to $400,000 and required spouses to be informed if the member opts for insurance less than the maximum. For those serving in a combat zone, DOD pays the premium for $150,000 in coverage. The bill also increased the one-time death gratuity to $100,000 for all service members who die in the future. Eligibility for the death gratuity was expanded to include all service members, not just those dying in combat or combat-related activity. The conference bill adds a traumatic injury rider to DOD's life insurance policy providing $25,000 to $100,000 for members, retroactively available. It rejects federal government covering pay difference for reservists who are federal civilian employees. Other proposals include free mails and telephone benefits for recuperating service members and expanded travel eligibility for family members. DOD will need to reallocate funds for these benefits. In the FY2005 supplemental, DOD requested $17.8 billion for investment, significantly higher than the $3 billion in the FY2004 supplemental. In the FY2004 supplemental, DOD requested $17.8 billion for procurement, research, development, test and evaluation projects, and military construction. This funding aimed to provide additional equipment for units, reorganize and reequip Army and Marine Corps units, and build facilities in Afghanistan, Iraq, and surrounding countries. The $16.1 billion in procurement included replacing battle losses, providing equipment for deploying and returning forces, and additional force protection equipment. The Army requested $4.1 billion for modularity equipment and $250 million for Marine Corps Force Structure Review Group Initiative in the FY2004 supplemental. Some Members questioned the urgency of the funding for the Army's modularity initiative, which aims to reorganize and convert brigades. The increase in funding from $2.8 billion to $5.0 billion may be due to the accelerated conversion plans announced by the Army. The Army's modularity initiative, funded in the FY2004 supplemental, aims to reorganize and convert brigades. Critics argue that these costs should be part of the regular budget, not supplemental funding. The initiative is meant to make Army units more lethal and transportable, reducing stress on forces by providing more deployable units. The $2.7 billion procurement request includes force protection equipment like armored Humvees, night vision goggles, and devices to combat IEDs. Additionally, $1.3 billion is allocated for military construction, with $1 billion overseas and $0.3 billion for the Army's modularity initiative. The military construction projects in Iraq and Afghanistan, totaling $1.3 billion, were controversial due to perceived long-term U.S. presence. Some projects, like supply road construction, lacked convincing justification compared to safety-focused projects like concrete billets. The House added $2.0 billion to DOD's request, with $1 billion included in the conference bill. Total procurement amounted to $17.4 billion. The House added funding to DOD's request, totaling $17.4 billion for procurement. The additional funds would accelerate Army purchases of trucks, upgrades to tanks, force protection equipment, and other items. The additions are intended to fulfill emergent requirements and accelerate requested programs. The conferees fully funded the Army's $5 billion request for modularity. The conference bill includes a $5 billion request for modularity to create additional combat brigades and ensure equipment availability for deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. It cuts overseas military construction by $300 million and adds $32 million for Marine Corps restructuring needs. The SAC raised concerns about the Administration's $1.0 billion request for overseas military construction. The SAC noted the challenges for construction projects to meet emergency funding criteria due to the long duration of the \"global war on terror\" and the need for temporary facilities in the U.S. presence. The committee recommended that projects with enduring presence characteristics should be part of long-term plans and included in the normal budget process for careful consideration by authorization and appropriations committees. As a result, four military construction projects were cut by the conferees, including a $57 million fuel tank farm and a $32 million prime power generation plant. The House expressed dissatisfaction with the Department of Defense for not submitting a comprehensive master plan for basing U.S. forces, leading to the withholding of funds for projects in Afghanistan, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates. The FY2005 supplemental proposed creating new accounts to train Afghan and Iraqi security forces, with $1.3 billion for Afghan forces and $5.7 billion for Iraqi forces. The Secretary of Defense would have the authority to use the funds until they are fully expended. The FY2005 supplemental proposed creating new accounts to train Afghan and Iraqi security forces, with $1.3 billion for Afghan forces and $5.7 billion for Iraqi forces. The provision would transfer policy and funding authority from the Secretary of State to the Secretary of Defense for training foreign military forces. The authority for training foreign military forces is proposed to be transferred from the Secretary of State to the Secretary of Defense. Secretary of State Rice and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld support this transfer due to the current wartime situation. The transfer would broaden the authority beyond what is currently available to the Secretary of State. However, details about the funds breakdown, personnel, training rates, equipment, and fund usage are lacking from the Department of Defense. In contrast, the State Department provides substantial details on how it has used and plans to use funds for training and equipping foreign military forces. The Department of Defense plans to distribute $5.7 billion for Iraqi security forces, covering costs through July 2006. This includes funds for front line security forces, support forces, police, quick response funding, and institutional training. There has been debate in Congress about the effectiveness of training Iraqi security forces. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld reported that 136,000 Iraqi forces had been trained as of February 16, 2005. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld reported that 136,000 Iraqi forces had been trained, including Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Interior forces. The Iraq transitional government has fielded over 90 battalions, but most are lightly equipped and armed with limited capabilities. The Senate's reporting requirements for the Iraq Security Forces fund were dropped in favor of report language. Both the SAC and the House approved the DOD's request for $1.3 billion to train Afghan security forces and $5.7 billion for Iraqi security forces. The proposed language for funding Iraqi security forces includes reporting requirements such as funds availability until the end of FY2006, concurrence of the Secretary of State, notification to congressional defense committees, and quarterly reporting on transfers. The Secretary of Defense would still have discretion on distributing funds for training activities and security forces, including receiving contributions from other nations. The Senate version of H.R. 1268 included detailed statutory reporting requirements for funding Iraqi security forces and other support for allies in the global war on terrorism. The Administration requested $2.9 billion for various purposes, including coalition support, Lift and Sustain funds, Commander's Emergency Response Program, equipment reimbursement for the Afghan Army, setting up a Special Operations Training Center in Jordan, and DOD's counternarcotics program. The DOD has received substantial funds for its counternarcotics program since the 9/11 attacks. The request for funds to reimburse allies in Iraq and Afghanistan did not include reporting for \"lift and sustain\" or counternarcotics programs. The conferees reduced the request by several hundred million but provided $500 million for \"lift and sustain.\" The conferees provided $500 million for \"lift and sustain\" for Afghan, Iraq, and neighboring security forces, $1.2 billion for \"coalition support\" for Pakistan, Jordan, and other cooperating nations in the \"global war on terror,\" and supported the $854 million request for the Commanders Emergency Response Program (CERP). In FY2004, DOD obligated all funds appropriated, with the Army receiving the largest share due to its role in Iraq and Afghanistan. The difference between FY2004 and FY2005's estimates was mainly in investment accounts and funds for training Afghan and Iraqi forces. The Army and Marine Corps received more funding than requested, while the Navy's request was reduced by $300 million. Defense-wide and Air Force funding remained close to the original request. The President requested $6.3 billion in FY2005 supplemental funding for various foreign policy activities, including diplomatic costs, reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan, counternarcotics programs, humanitarian relief in Darfur, aid in Sudan, War on Terrorism assistance, Palestinian aid, Ukraine assistance, U.N. peacekeeping contributions, broadcasting programs in the Middle East, and tsunami recovery. FY2005 total spending for foreign policy programs would have increased by roughly 50% over pre-9/11 levels, even with Congressional reductions. The House and Senate approved $5.78 billion in new appropriations for State Department, foreign aid, and other foreign policy activities, which is a $512 million reduction from the President's request. This includes rescinding $1 billion in FY2003-appropriated funds for aid to Turkey. The total appropriation in H.R. 1268 is $4.78 billion, designated as emergency appropriations. The $512 million cut may impact Congress' consideration of regular FY2006 appropriations for Foreign policy programs. Congress approved $5.78 billion in new appropriations for State Department and foreign aid, a $512 million reduction from the President's request. This includes rescinding $1 billion in FY2003-appropriated funds for aid to Turkey. The pending FY2006 request faces challenges due to potential additions from the FY2005 supplemental conference agreement. The budget resolution for FY2006 assumes a reduction in foreign policy funding request of about $2.4 billion. The House approved $4.92 billion for foreign policy programs in H.R. 1268, $1.37 billion less than requested. The House Committee excluded items not well justified or could be funded by other donors. They redesignated $995 million as non-emergency spending and offset costs by rescinding $1 billion in unspent aid for Turkey. The net total for foreign policy programs in the House version was $3.92 billion. An amendment added $100 million for humanitarian relief in Darfur. The Senate passed its version of H.R. 1268 on April 21, providing $5.74 billion.

The State Department estimates needing $1.06 billion in FY2005 to manage activities of American personnel in Baghdad and regional offices. Additional funds are sought for Mission operations, logistics, and security for the rest of FY2005 and extraordinary security and logistical expenses in FY2006. The regular FY2006 budget includes $65 million as a funding base. The State Department's request for $658 million in supplemental funds for a new embassy in Baghdad includes a funding base for basic operations and contingency amounts. The department plans to complete the embassy construction in 24 months, with a target completion date of May 2007. Critics point out that Congress has already allocated $20 million in previous supplementals. The State Department requested $658 million in supplemental funds for a new embassy in Baghdad, including $20 million already allocated by Congress. Critics argue that the proposal does not qualify as an \"emergency\" requirement, as plans for the facility were well underway in 2004. The conference agreement on H.R. 1268 provides $592 million for embassy construction, $66 million below the request, and includes a $250,000 earmark for a scholar-rescue program. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a reduction of $66 million for embassy construction in Baghdad, but during floor debate, an amendment was adopted prohibiting the use of funds for embassy security, construction, or maintenance. Critics argue that the embassy proposal did not qualify as an emergency requirement.

The supplemental proposed $2.046 billion for Afghanistan out of foreign policy budget accounts. The Administration proposes $1.1 billion for FY2006 to support the newly elected Karzai government and complete high impact projects in Afghanistan. The funds are divided into components including U.S. Mission operations and security ($60 million), infrastructure and economic development ($795.8 million), and capacity-building of the Afghan government ($265 million) to strengthen democratic institutions. Key projects include road construction, power generation, health sector reforms, school construction, Provincial Reconstruction Teams infrastructure, clean water, agriculture projects, and other reconstruction activities. The Afghan government is set to receive $265 million for strengthening democratic institutions, including government salaries, infrastructure, support for parliamentary elections, and rule of law activities. Additionally, $25 million is allocated to complete the Kabul airport. Anti-terrorism training and protection will receive $17.1 million for President Karzai's security. Congress approved $18.8 million for similar programs in FY2005, with an additional $18.4 million sought for FY2006. Police training will receive $400 million for Task Force Police training, equipment, and salary payments. Police training, equipment, and salary payments ($399 million) are allocated for counternarcotics efforts, including eradication, interdiction, law enforcement, and public information programs. An additional $248.5 million is designated for alternative livelihood programs, with a portion replenishing aid accounts and the rest expanding programs in seven provinces. Authority is also sought to transfer up to $46 million to ESF programs in support of alternative livelihood activities.

Conferees approved $1.78 billion for Afghan programs covering various costs, including reconstruction, counter-narcotics, police training, and security for President Karzai. The conference measure redistributed funds differently than requested, fully funding U.S. mission operations, counter-narcotics activities, and President Karzai's security, while reducing police training funding. The most debated element was the economic reconstruction portion, with the conference measure trimming $220 million from the President's request. The conference measure trims $220 million from the President's $1.1 billion request, finding some projects not fitting the \"emergency\" nature of the supplemental. It assumes full funding for health programs and expenses of provisional reconstruction teams. Conferees recommend $5 million for women-led NGOs in Afghanistan and $5 million for displaced persons, earmarking $2.5 million to assist families and communities of Afghan civilians affected by military operations. The House-passed bill rejected funding for aerial eradication efforts and denied money for various reconstruction projects. The House Appropriations Committee reviewed community housing projects during consideration of the FY2006 Foreign Operations appropriations. The Senate shifted funds from helicopter fleet maintenance to a program training Afghan police forces. The Administration requested $100 million for the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in Sudan. The State Department requested $100 million in supplemental funding for Sudan to support the implementation of a peace agreement, with most of the funds targeted for needs in southern Sudan. This included assistance for National Commissions, security sector reform, rehabilitation, reconstruction, and refugee repatriation programs. The total supplemental requested for Sudan was compared to previous and proposed allocations for FY2005 and FY2006. The Administration recommends shifting assistance from USAID's Development Assistance account to the Transition Initiative (TI) account for post-conflict, fragile countries like Sudan. The $100 million supplemental proposal includes $63 million for Sudan rehabilitation and reconstruction under the TI account. This funding transfer is part of a broader initiative proposed in the regular FY2006 budget request. The conference agreement and House-passed bill support security, governance, and refugee programs but exclude $63 million for southern Sudan reconstruction. The Senate approved $100 million for programs related to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The supplemental sought $242 million for humanitarian relief in Darfur and eastern Chad, in addition to existing emergency funds. The crisis in 2004 exceeded budget assumptions, leading to a $48.4 million refugee aid request and funds for disaster relief and emergency shelter. The conference agreement approved $238 million for Darfur-related support, including $150 million in food aid to address emergency shortfalls globally. The Senate bill had proposed $320 million in food assistance, which could also be used worldwide. Additionally, $90 million in food aid was added for global use, with the possibility of some being allocated to Darfur if needed. The transfer of $50 million was also permitted for peacekeeping funds for the African Union's operation in Darfur. The House panel approved an amendment to restore $150 million in food assistance for Darfur, in addition to the $100 million for refugee aid. This brings the total humanitarian assistance to $342.4 million, including support for African Union peacekeeping operations in the region. The House approved an amendment by Representative Jackson for $100 million in food aid and $100 million for refugee and disaster relief in Darfur. The Senate passed H.R. 1268 with $242.4 million for humanitarian aid in Darfur and Chad, with potential increases from amendments by Senator Kohl and Senator Corzine. Kohl's amendment added $320 million for food assistance globally, while Corzine's allocated $90.5 million for Darfur, with $50 million for African Union peacekeeping efforts. The Administration proposed $750 million in direct aid for Jordan, Pakistan, and other coalition partners in the war on terrorism. Jordan would receive $200 million in economic and military aid to help offset costs and address security threats. Pakistan would receive $150 million in military aid. The Administration requested $700 million for Pakistan in FY2005, with $300 million for military aid. Congress appropriated $148.8 million and authorized an additional $150 million transfer. The Administration sought an extra $150 million but did not receive it. For FY2006, the request remains at $700 million, with $300 million for military aid. Additionally, a Solidarity Fund of $200 million was proposed. The supplemental proposed $200 million in military and security assistance for countries that have deployed troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Solidarity Fund of $200 million would help partners address budget problems related to their presence in both countries. The Global War on Terrorism Partners Fund of $200 million would provide economic aid to countries supporting the U.S. in the Global War on Terror. Secretary of State Rice proposed a contingency Fund exempt from restrictions, allowing transfers to support coalition partners who are not deploying troops in Iraq or Afghanistan but are aiding in other ways. This raised concerns among Members of Congress about additional aid to Jordan and Pakistan, despite previous aid packages approved in FY2005. The FY2005 appropriation included $150 million in military aid for Pakistan, raising concerns about financial support for countries with troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. The request for the Global War on Terrorism Partners Fund faced challenges due to its lack of specificity and flexibility. Congress has rejected similar requests in the past three years. The Administration seeks $100 million for a Conflict Response Fund for FY2006, focusing on post-conflict and weak states. The conference agreement supports the Solidarity Fund with $200 million and adds $30 million for peacekeeping funds for Global War on Terror purposes. Resources for the Partners Fund are not approved. The House and Senate bills provide full funding for additional assistance to Pakistan and Jordan. The Senate measure includes $200 million for the Solidarity Fund for peacekeeping resources. The Senate-reported bill recommended $40 million for the Partners Fund, but the total was reduced to $26.5 million during floor debate. The Administration sought $780 million to support U.N. peacekeeping missions, citing a funding gap of $780 million. The Administration identified a $780 million funding gap for new U.N. operations in various countries. The FY2006 request was $1.035 billion, including $680 million for U.N. peacekeeping missions. The approved amount could be reduced further if $50 million is used for African Union peacekeeping operations in Darfur. The President used $50 million for African Union peacekeeping operations in Darfur, as permitted by legislation. The conference total is higher than the House or Senate bills. The House provided $580 million, including $55 million for a Sudan war crimes tribunal. The Senate passed $533 million, with $147 million shifted to U.S. border security. The Senate denied funds for the tribunal, unlike the House. The conference agreement does not mention appropriations for the tribunal. In his State of the Union address, the President announced a $350 million aid package for the West Bank and Gaza, with $200 million proposed in the FY2005 supplemental. The FY2006 request includes the balance of $150 million. The Administration is proposing a $150 million aid package for the West Bank and Gaza, with some funds potentially going directly to the Palestinian Authority for training and equipping civilian security services. Secretary of State Rice argues for the need for direct PA funding to help prepare for governing Gaza after Israeli withdrawal. Previous U.S. assistance for the region has averaged $75 million annually, mostly channeled through non-governmental organizations. Restrictions on direct aid to the PA have been waived by the President in the past. The conference agreement provides $200 million in U.S. assistance for the Palestinians, with $50 million allocated for Israeli-built checkpoints. Funds are also designated for projects managed by NGOs, Holy Family Hospital in Bethlehem, and healthcare activities by Hadassah. The bill does not include the $50 million set-aside for Israel and other earmarks recommended by the Senate. The Senate bill does not include direct financing for the Palestinian Authority, and the President's waiver for such aid does not extend to the supplemental funds. The President could issue a new waiver based on authority granted in the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The House had prohibited the use of supplemental funds for direct aid to the PA, while the Senate Appropriations Committee reminded of existing conditions on aid to the West Bank/Gaza and PA restrictions. The Senate provision in the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act allowed the President to use a national security waiver for direct aid to the Palestinian Authority with supplemental funds. The Administration proposed $60 million in supplemental economic support for Ukraine, including funds for anti-corruption programs, economic reforms, civil society outreach, HIV/AIDS activities, nuclear safety, parliamentary election assistance, and political transition aid. This is in addition to the $79 million regular appropriation for FY2005 and the State Department's proposed $88 million for FY2006. The State Department proposes $88 million for FY2006, with conference agreements providing the full $60 million request for Ukraine. The House Appropriations Committee intends for the funds to support the Yushenko government and assist in parliamentary elections. The Senate bill recommends an increase in support for Ukrainian civil society organizations. Additionally, $5 million each is added for democracy programs in Belarus and humanitarian needs in Chechnya and the North Caucasus. The supplemental includes $4.8 million for broadcasting programs in the Middle East and South Asia. The State Department proposed $88 million for FY2006, with full support for Ukraine. The House included $4.8 million for broadcasting programs in the Middle East and South Asia. An additional $2.5 million was allocated for transmitting system upgrades in Tajikistan to boost signals to Pakistan and Central Asia. The State Department also created the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization with $9.4 million in supplemental funding for start-up costs. The FY2006 budget proposal includes $24 million to expand the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization by 57 positions. The supplemental request also includes $7.8 million to develop a civilian staff for a ready-response capacity within the State Department. Conferees settled on $7.7 million for the Office, with funds expected to be used for personnel in Washington and Sudan. This is less than half of the amount requested. The Senate supported the full $17.2 million requested, while the House recommended $3 million exclusively for the Coordinator's Office. The tsunami in December 2004 resulted in over $12 billion in aid pledges and commitments. The United States pledged $350 million for immediate relief efforts after the tsunami, increasing it to $600 million in a supplemental request. The total amount included replenishing USAID and Defense Department emergency aid accounts, with $581 million allocated for long-term infrastructure projects. Up to $45 million could be used for debt relief for affected countries. The conference agreement reduces the Tsunami Recovery and Reconstruction Fund by $45 million, granting authority for the Administration to defer or reschedule debt owed by affected countries. Additional earmarks in the conference bill include $5 million for environmental recovery activities and $10 million for the creation of tsunami warning systems. The conference agreement includes funding for various projects such as environmental recovery activities, economic opportunities for women, programs protecting women and children, needs of people with disabilities, microenterprise programs, children's needs, and Avian influenza prevention. It does not include funding for teacher training programs in Aceh and Sri Lanka. During House floor consideration of H.R. 1268, an amendment to bar funds for tsunami relief was defeated. The amendment's author argued against using American taxpayer funds due to existing budget constraints and disaster needs in the U.S. Opponents highlighted the need to repay foreign aid accounts and justified the full U.S. government pledge for tsunami relief. The House adopted an amendment increasing the Tsunami Fund by $3 million, with supporters hoping for a U.S. contribution to the UNFPA. However, the amendment did not specify the use of the $3 million for UNFPA, only to supplement the Tsunami Recovery and Reconstruction Fund. Conferees did not include the extra $3 million in the final report. The Maloney amendment added $3 million but did not mention UNFPA in the conference report. U.S. funding for UNFPA has been controversial due to its programs in China involving coercive family planning. The Bush Administration found UNFPA in violation of U.S. law, blocking funding in FY2002-FY2004. Review of FY2005 funding status is pending."
