    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1203 of the Penal Code is amended to define probation and conditional sentence as suspension of sentence with conditions, either under supervision of a probation officer or established by the court. Both options are authorized for infractions or misdemeanors. Before judgment is pronounced, a felony convict eligible for probation must be referred to a probation officer for investigation and report on the crime circumstances and the person's history. The probation officer will provide recommendations on probation granting, denial, and conditions. The probation officer's report must include information on the defendant's custody as a minor and may consider juvenile crimes for aggravating circumstances. For sex offenders, the report should include results from the State-Authorized Risk Assessment Tool. The probation officer's report may recommend the amount of restitution fine and whether the court should require restitution as a condition of probation. The probation officer's report must be provided to the court, prosecuting and defense attorneys at least five days before the hearing, or nine days upon request. It should be filed with the court clerk as a record for the case. A continuance based on a failure to provide the report on time may be granted only with good cause. At a scheduled time, the court will review probation applications and determine suitability. The court will consider probation officer reports, including SARATSO results, if applicable. If deemed appropriate, the person may be placed on probation. If probation is denied, the report is sent to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The court may waive the preparation or consideration of a report with written or oral stipulation from prosecuting and defense attorneys, with court consent. If the defendant is sentenced to state prison, a probation report must be completed. If the defendant is not represented by an attorney, the probation officer must discuss the report with them. If a person is convicted of a misdemeanor, the court may refer the matter to the probation officer for investigation or pronounce a conditional sentence. If the offense requires sex offender registration, the court must obtain a report from the probation officer based on a risk assessment tool. The court may consider any relevant information in sentencing the person. The court must inform the person convicted of a misdemeanor of the information to be considered in a probation report and allow them to respond before sentencing. If requested, the court must grant a continuance before pronouncing judgment. Probation shall not be granted to persons convicted of specific crimes or using a deadly weapon in connection with the crime. Persons convicted of specific crimes or using a deadly weapon in connection with the crime are not eligible for probation. Additionally, individuals who have committed certain offenses such as inflicting great bodily injury, torture, or multiple felonies are also ineligible for probation. Any person previously convicted of a felony or public offense involving a deadly weapon, great bodily injury, or torture is not eligible for probation. (7) Any public official or peace officer who accepted bribes, embezzled public money, or committed extortion in the line of duty.\n(8) Any person who knowingly distributes phencyclidine.\n(9) Any individual who caused great bodily harm during arson or set fire to inhabited structures.\n(10) Any person who inflicts great bodily harm or causes death with a firearm from a moving vehicle on a public street. (11) Possession of prohibited firearms or devices.\n(12) Conviction under specific sections of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n(13) Individuals described in certain sections.\n(f) Court must specify reasons for granting probation in relevant cases. If a person is ineligible for probation, the judge must refer the case to the probation officer for investigation of relevant facts for determining a restitution fine. The probation officer will investigate the crime, the person's history, and make a recommendation for the fine amount to the court. If a defendant is convicted of a felony, the probation officer may include the victim's comments in the probation report, unless the victim has already testified in court. A probationer must have their case referred to the Administrator of the Interstate Probation and Parole Compacts before being released to another state. They also need to reimburse the county for the costs of processing their request for interstate compact supervision. The court may order a defendant to undergo a financial evaluation by a county financial evaluation officer to determine their ability to pay restitution. Failure to pay may result in probation violation or enforcement as a civil judgment if unpaid by the end of the probationary period. Probation or sentence suspension is not allowed for individuals convicted of violent or serious felonies while on probation for a previous felony offense."
