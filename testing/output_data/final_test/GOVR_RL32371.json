    "content": "The United States and its trading partners use trade remedy laws to mitigate the impact of trade practices on domestic industries. These laws must align with international trade agreements. The report discusses congressional interest in these laws, recent legislation, AD and CVD laws, safeguard statutes, and provides a statistical overview of existing cases. An Appendix outlines U.S. trade remedy statutes. The three main U.S. trade remedy laws are antidumping, countervailing duty, and safeguards, enforced by the International Trade Administration and the International Trade Commission. Antidumping laws address imports sold below fair market value, countervailing duty laws target subsidized imports, imposing additional import duties. The safeguard laws provide relief to domestic industries from import surges of fairly traded goods. The most commonly used safeguard law, Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, aims to help domestic industries adjust to new competition. Relief can include temporary import duties, quotas, or a combination of both, requiring presidential action for implementation. This report outlines the statutory authority, investigative procedures, and outcomes of U.S. safeguard actions. Other trade remedy laws, such as Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, are not discussed in this report. The report discusses trade remedy laws such as Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and Sections 301-310 of the Trade Act of 1974, which give authority to the United States Trade Representative to enforce U.S. rights under international trade agreements. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs provide assistance to firms and workers affected by increased imports. These trade remedy laws have been a focus of domestic and international debate. Some in Congress support increased enforcement of trade remedies to protect U.S. firms and workers from unfair international competition, while others, especially those representing importers and export-oriented businesses, seek revisions to trade remedy laws that could make relief harder to obtain. Legislation has been introduced to address these issues. Some WTO member countries are concerned about the increasing use of trade remedies, leading to negotiations on changes to the WTO Antidumping and Subsidies Agreements. Developing nations like India and South Africa are using trade remedy actions more frequently, previously used mainly by developed nations. Possible modifications to the WTO Antidumping and Subsidies agreements could impact U.S. trade remedy laws. WTO dispute settlement panels found that certain U.S. trade remedy provisions violated WTO obligations, leading to the repeal of the Antidumping Act of 1916 and the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act. The CDSOA was repealed in 2006, allowing disbursements to continue until October 1, 2007. The practice of \"zeroing\" in AD and CVD investigations was challenged in a WTO dispute, leading to modifications by the Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce modified its practices in AD/CVD calculations in response to WTO determinations, prompting calls for greater congressional scrutiny. In the 112th Congress, bills were introduced to address currency misalignment in AD and CVD cases. The bills introduced in the 112th Congress aim to address concerns about currency misalignment in AD and CVD cases, including imposing countervailing duties on undervalued currencies and providing a process to investigate transshipment of merchandise. Additionally, there is a specific bill targeting non-market economy countries like China and Vietnam. The bill aims to address concerns about currency misalignment in AD and CVD cases, specifically targeting non-market economy countries like China and Vietnam. A ruling in the Court of International Trade and a WTO Appellate body finding suggest a potential \"double remedy\" issue when CVD and AD actions are simultaneously applied on imports from NME countries. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that CVD laws cannot be applied to products from NME countries, potentially impacting existing CVD orders on products from China and Vietnam. The U.S. Trade Representative and Commerce Secretary plan to pursue judicial options to address subsidies in non-market economy countries like China. They are urging Congress to enact legislation clarifying the application of CVD law to subsidized goods from NME countries. The deadline for petitioning for a review is March 5, 2012. The U.S. Trade Representative and Commerce Secretary are taking action to address subsidies in non-market economy countries like China. They are urging Congress to clarify the application of CVD law to subsidized goods from NME countries. The CVD orders cover various competitive U.S. manufacturing products with a total annual value of $4.7 billion. Debate continues in the WTO on possible multilateral AD and CVD reforms as part of the Doha Round negotiations launched in 2001. The WTO Antidumping and Subsidies Agreements are under scrutiny for being protectionist, with proposed revisions issued in April 2011. The statutory authority for AD investigations and remedial actions is found in the Tariff Act of 1930. The law allows for the imposition of antidumping duties if the ITA determines that foreign merchandise is being sold in the US at less than fair value and the USITC determines that a US industry is being harmed by imports. CVD investigations are authorized by the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, when a countervailable subsidy is provided by a foreign government. The USITC must determine if a country is providing a countervailable subsidy for imported merchandise. AD and CVD investigations are initiated by a petition from a domestic industry or by the ITA. Industry representatives may include manufacturers, producers, or wholesalers. The USITC must determine countervailable subsidies for imported merchandise. Investigations are initiated by a petition from a domestic industry or the ITA. Petitioners may allege subsidies or sales below fair value. If initiated by petition, the ITA must assess the accuracy and industry support within 20 days. Antidumping laws are regulated by GATT and the Antidumping Agreement. The Uruguay Round Antidumping Agreement and the Subsidies Agreement, negotiated during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, outline procedures for antidumping investigations and regulations on subsidies. The Subsidies Agreement defines subsidies as financial contributions by governments that confer benefits and categorizes them as prohibited, actionable, or non-actionable. Specificity to an industry is required for subsidies to be covered by the Agreement. The Subsidies Agreement outlines rules for subsidies, categorizing them as prohibited, actionable, or non-actionable. Specificity to an industry is required, with transitional and special treatment rules for different country categories. Other trade agreements, like NAFTA, also include AD and CVD articles allowing parties to apply their antidumping and countervailing duty laws. The NAFTA agreement includes provisions for review of statutory amendments and final AD and CVD determinations by a bi-national panel. It also establishes a consultation and dispute settlement system for challenging statutory changes. AD and CVD investigations may be conducted simultaneously on a targeted product, leading to similar investigation processes and economic effects. Prior to the imposition of an AD or CVD order, the ITA and the USITC conduct a detailed investigative process. Some critics argue that the administrative nature of these investigations makes it easier to implement protectionist measures, as decisions are delegated to administrative agencies rather than the President and Congress. The process is designed to limit public and media scrutiny, leading to concerns about bias in favor of domestic industries. Supporters of trade remedies argue that AD and CVD procedures are detailed to ensure transparency and provide a voice for all parties. The USITC investigates if there is injury when a petition is filed, with a preliminary determination made within 45 days. If the determination is negative or imports are negligible, the proceedings end. The ITA initiates investigations on unfair practices, with specific timelines for preliminary determinations in CVD and AD cases. If affirmative, subsidy margins or dumping margins are estimated for exporters, and duties on imports are suspended until the case is resolved. The ITA suspends imports of targeted merchandise until the case is resolved and requires cash deposits or bonds to cover duties. Final determinations must be made within specific timelines, with a hearing held upon request before issuing a final determination. The ITA holds hearings upon request and issues final determinations. If the determination is negative, proceedings end, and suspensions are terminated. If affirmative, liquidation is suspended, and the investigation continues to the USITC for a final determination within specific timelines. The USITC holds hearings before making a final determination. If the USITC's decision is affirmative, the ITA issues a duty order based on calculated margins. If the decision is negative, no duties are imposed, and any suspensions are terminated. In cases of alleged critical circumstances, additional investigation steps are required. The ITA determines critical circumstances in AD cases based on history of dumping, importer's knowledge, and massive imports over a short period. If affirmative, suspension of liquidation is extended retroactively. If final determination is affirmative, ITA includes additional determination on subsidies or dumping. The ITA's final determination on critical circumstances can result in retroactive duties or the release of bonds if negative. If both the USITC and ITA affirm critical circumstances, AD or CVD duty orders apply to goods with retroactive suspension. The ITA may terminate or suspend antidumping or countervailing duty proceedings at any point in favor of an alternative agreement with the foreign government or exporters. Public interest factors are considered in making these decisions, including the imposition of duties and the volume of imports. The ITA may suspend an investigation if the government or exporters agree to eliminate the subsidy or dumping margin, offset the subsidy completely, or cease exports of the subject merchandise into the United States within six months. The ITA may suspend an investigation if the government or exporters agree to eliminate the subsidy or dumping margin, offset the subsidy completely, or cease exports of the subject merchandise into the United States within six months. Before suspending an investigation, the ITA must be satisfied that the suspension is in the public interest and that the agreement can be effectively monitored by the United States. Each year, during the anniversary month of the publication of an AD or CVD duty order, any interested party may request an administrative review of the order. During the review process, the ITA recalculates the amount of the net subsidy or dumping margin and may adjust the amount of AD or CVD duties on the subject merchandise. The ITA must make preliminary and final determinations in CVD administrative reviews within specific timeframes. Similarly, preliminary and final determinations in AD reviews must also be made within set timeframes. Administrative reviews are mandated under certain circumstances by the WTO Antidumping and Subsidies Agreements, requiring periodic reviews of the need for continued imposition of duties. Interested parties can request examinations to determine the necessity of ongoing duties. The ITA conducts reviews to determine the necessity of ongoing duties, including \"changed circumstances\" reviews upon request. If there is good cause, the results must be issued within specific timeframes. Requests from exporters or producers not affiliated with the initial investigation may lead to individual AD or CVD rates being established. During a new shipper review, the ITA may establish individual AD or CVD rates for exporters or producers, which can take up to 180 days (or up to 300 days if \"extraordinarily complicated\"). Final duty rate determinations may take 90 to 150 days. Importers have the option to post a bond instead of a cash deposit until the review is completed. Some U.S. producers have raised concerns about importers exploiting the new shipper bonding privilege to avoid paying AD/CV duties. For example, Louisiana crawfish producers found that Customs collected only a portion of the duties owed between 2002 and 2004. Between 2002 and 2004, Customs collected only $25.5 million of about $195.5 million in AD duties owed on crawfish. Abuse of the new shipper bonding privilege accounted for 40% of uncollected duties from 2001 to 2007. The provision suspending the privilege from April 1, 2006, to June 30, 2009 has expired and not been renewed. Before the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, AD and CVD orders had no set termination date. Sunset reviews are conducted by the ITA and USITC to determine the likelihood of dumping or subsidies continuing if an order is revoked. If affirmative, the duty remains; if negative, the order is revoked. Sunset reviews are required in WTO agreements. Between 1980-2008, there were 1,632 AD/CVD cases with final dispositions. Between FY1980-FY2008, there were 1,632 AD/CVD cases with final dispositions. Of the 1158 AD investigations, 63 were withdrawn before the preliminary USITC determination. 193 AD cases received a negative preliminary determination, and 156 were terminated before the final determination. The USITC made a negative final determination in 241 investigations and 505 affirmative determinations. For the 474 CVD cases, 54 were terminated. Between FY1980-FY2008, there were 1,632 AD/CVD cases with final dispositions. Of the 474 CVD cases with final determinations, 54 were terminated before the USITC preliminary determination, 89 had a negative preliminary USITC determination, and 88 were terminated or withdrawn between the preliminary and final USITC determinations. At the final stage, 111 had a negative final determination, and 132 received an affirmative final determination. As of July 2011, there were 306 duty orders in place\u2014258 AD and 48 CVD. Steel mill products are the largest group subject to AD/CVD orders, with 66 orders currently in force. Iron and steel products, including pipe products, account for a significant portion of current AD and CVD orders, making up approximately 44% of all orders. Other products such as wooden furniture, coated paper, and hand tools also have a notable presence, comprising about 18% of orders. Additionally, competing imports of chemicals and pharmaceuticals, like solid urea and citric acid, make up around 15% of current AD and CVD orders. Agricultural products represent about 9% of orders. Agricultural products, minerals, and metals make up a significant portion of current AD and CVD orders, with agricultural products accounting for about 9% of orders. Other product categories have relatively few AD or CVD orders, such as plastics, rubber, stone, glass, textiles, apparel, transportation, machinery equipment, electronics, and communications. However, there have been high-profile trade remedy investigations in certain categories like plastics and rubber products. The United States has AD and CVD orders for products from 42 countries, with China leading with 90 AD orders and 22 CVD orders. Other countries with significant orders include India, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Brazil, Italy, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, Ukraine, Thailand, Germany, Vietnam, and Turkey. The number of orders changes frequently due to reviews and investigations. Initiations of worldwide AD and CVD processes peaked in 2001, declined until 2008, and then rose again, possibly due to the global financial crisis. The trend from 2003-2007 may be attributed to increasing globalization, leading to reduced interest in trade remedy cases among U.S. domestic manufacturers importing products from overseas. For instance, a 2004 AD investigation on wooden bedroom furniture from China sparked controversy in the U.S. furniture industry, highlighting the impact of globalization on industry willingness to petition for trade remedies. The case involving AD duties on furniture imported from China sparked controversy in the U.S. furniture industry. Some companies were importing furniture from China while still producing high-end items domestically. Retailers feared higher prices from AD duties would hurt sales and lead to layoffs, while manufacturers argued that more jobs were being lost in manufacturing. The ITA found only slightly more than half of the industry supported the petition, and AD duties ranging from 2.3% to 198.08% were imposed on the targeted merchandise. Some observers suggest that multinational corporations with plants worldwide may contribute to the decrease in trade remedy actions. The largest steel manufacturer in the US, ArcelorMittal USA, is a subsidiary of a global firm based in Luxembourg, which may import goods from foreign subsidiaries instead of favoring trade remedy actions. Additionally, the decline in trade remedy initiations in recent years may be linked to the world economy's growth rate. AD and CVD petitions tend to increase during economic recessions and decrease during growth periods. The increase in AD initiations in 2008 could be due to economic pressures from the global crisis. Some economists believe the rise was not as significant as expected. Countries implemented new policies like trade remedies, stimulus packages, and bailouts to assist industries during the crisis. The Antidumping Act of 1916 in the US made it illegal to import goods at lower prices to harm domestic industries. The Antidumping Act of 1916 in the US made it illegal to import goods at lower prices to harm domestic industries. The law was repealed in 2004 due to violations of U.S. WTO obligations. The Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000 redistributed duties collected from AD and CVD orders to affected domestic producers for qualifying expenditures. The Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000 redistributed duties collected from AD and CVD orders to affected domestic producers for qualifying expenditures, totaling millions of dollars annually. The act was controversial for encouraging the filing of AD and CVD petitions, limiting benefits to petitioners, and causing market inefficiencies. The Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000 redistributed duties to U.S. companies, but was found to violate WTO agreements. Retaliation measures were authorized by the WTO, with countries like the European Union and Canada imposing additional tariffs on targeted U.S. goods. The CDSOA, which imposed tariffs on various imports, was repealed in 2006. Despite this, industries continued to receive disbursements due to a time gap between the repeal and the end of distributions. The CDSOA, imposing tariffs on imports, was repealed in 2006. Despite this, industries still received disbursements due to a time gap between the repeal and the end of distributions. AD and CV duties are not assessed until the product is liquidated and enter the US commerce, applied retrospectively, and collected long after goods enter the US. CDSOA payments are disbursed early in the fiscal year following receipt, ensuring continued payments for petitioners and industry supporters. The CDSOA payments were affected by Section 822 of P.L. 111-291, delaying the full impact of the repeal. The European Union, Canada, Mexico, and Japan continued to retaliate against the disbursements. The European Union and Japan are still imposing monetary sanctions on some U.S. products. \"Zeroing\" is an administrative practice used in the calculation of dumping margins in U.S. law. The ITA calculates the margin by identifying U.S. transactions, sale prices, and levels of trade for targeted merchandise. Model types are aggregated into \"averaging groups\" to calculate the weighted average export price. Comparisons are made between export prices and normal values to establish the overall dumping margin. When calculating dumping margins in the U.S., authorities aggregate model types into averaging groups to establish the overall dumping margin of the targeted product. Negative margins in subgroups are treated as zero to prevent skewing the results, especially if the subgroup with negative margins represents a significant portion of export sales. This practice is also used in administrative reviews of AD orders or suspension agreements. The U.S. practice of zeroing in calculating dumping margins has been challenged in the WTO. Disputes have arisen regarding its violation of WTO obligations, with the EU claiming that zeroing skews results in AD cases. Despite some decisions in favor of the U.S., the Appellate Body found zeroing problematic in initial investigations. The Appellate Body found zeroing to be inconsistent with WTO rules in original investigations, leading to its prohibition in antidumping proceedings. The United States agreed to implement the rulings without requiring legislative action, and the ITA recalculated dumping margins in EU cases to comply with WTO regulations. The ITA recalculated dumping margins in EU cases to comply with WTO regulations, announcing final margins for eleven cases on May 1, 2007. Implementation in the twelfth case was delayed due to a clerical error. The ITA requested public comments to revise regulations for calculating dumping margins, aiming to provide offsets for non-dumped comparisons in a manner consistent with WTO methodology. The ITA extended the public comment period for safeguard trade laws, which provide relief for domestic industries from import surges. Presidential action is required for relief under these statutes. Safeguard measures are seen as less objectionable than AD or CVD actions due to their temporary nature, higher injury threshold, and requirement of Presidential action. Section 201-204 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, provides relief for imports from all countries, known as \"section 201 investigations.\" Section 406 provides relief for market-disruptive imports from communist countries, while Section 421 applies only to injurious imports from China. Section 302 of the NAFTA Implementation Act provides relief for injurious imports from Canada or Mexico. Investigations can be initiated by various industry representatives. A section 201 action can be initiated by various industry representatives, including the President, USTR, or USITC. The goal is to help domestic industries adjust to import competition. The petition must include specific purposes for relief and a plan for industry adjustment. Relief can apply to imports from all countries or specific ones causing the issue. The WTO Safeguards Agreement allows contracting parties to take emergency action on imports of specific products causing serious injury to domestic industries. Safeguard measures must be time-limited, non-selective, and progressively liberalized while in effect. The WTO Safeguards Agreement allows contracting parties to take emergency action on imports causing serious injury to domestic industries. Members may agree on compensation if negotiations fail, the exporting Member may suspend concessions. NAFTA Article 8 allows parties to use \"emergency actions\" for import surges or duty reductions causing serious injury. Consultations are required, and the remedy allowed is a suspension in duty reduction or an increase in duty rate. Under NAFTA, parties can apply emergency actions for import surges or duty reductions causing serious injury to domestic industries. The safeguard provisions limit the duration of actions to three years and allow for global safeguard actions under GATT Article XIX. Emergency actions proposed are not subject to dispute settlement proceedings under NAFTA. The USITC determines if imported merchandise is causing serious injury to domestic industries, providing remedy recommendations to the President within 180 days of the petition. If critical circumstances are alleged, provisional relief may be requested. The USITC must make a determination on critical circumstances within 60 days of receiving the petition. If affirmative, the USITC must recommend relief to prevent injury and report findings to the President. The President may proclaim provisional relief for up to 200 days if warranted, especially for perishable agricultural products. Industry representatives can request monitoring of imports for such products from the USTR. The USTR determines if imported perishable agricultural or citrus products are causing serious injury to the domestic industry. If affirmative, the USITC monitors and investigates imports for up to two years. Provisional relief requires 90 days of monitoring and a request from the petitioner. The USITC reports findings to the President for further action. The USITC makes a determination on import relief, and the President can proclaim provisional relief within seven days if necessary. If the determination is negative, no relief is given. The President is instructed to take appropriate action within 60 days of an affirmative determination to help the domestic industry adjust to import competition. Relief can be granted for up to four years and extended multiple times. The USITC can recommend import relief for up to four years, extendable to a total of eight years. If the President disagrees, Congress can override his decision within 90 days. The USITC monitors the effects of the relief and conducts a midterm review if it exceeds three years. Interested parties can participate in hearings, and the USITC advises the President on the economic impact of any changes to the relief. The President may modify, reduce, or terminate import relief based on USITC review and advice from the Secretary of ITA and Secretary of Labor. This can happen if the domestic industry fails to adjust to import competition or if economic circumstances change. Industry representatives can petition for termination, modification, or reduction of the action. The President can also extend the action, with a mandatory investigation by USITC six to nine months before termination to determine if an extension is necessary. The USITC conducts investigations to determine the necessity of extending import relief and the domestic industry's adjustment to competition. In 73 Section 201 safeguard investigations, relief was recommended in 47% of cases, with the President granting relief in 35.6% of instances. Tariff increases are the most common form of relief granted. Figure 5 displays Section 201 safeguard petitions and outcomes by product group. The largest number of petitions has been filed in the category of miscellaneous manufactures, such as footwear, stainless steel flatware, fishing tackle, and clothespins. Agricultural products are the second largest category, including asparagus, mushrooms, shrimp, honey, roses, and cut flowers. President Bush requested a broad section 201 investigation on steel import surges, covering more than 500 steel mill products. The USITC investigated imports of various products into 33 categories to determine if they caused serious injury to the domestic steel industry. After hearings, they made an affirmative determination in 16 categories and recommended trade safeguard remedies. President Bush implemented safeguard measures for all but two steel specialty categories. The President's implementation of safeguard measures on steel faced international challenges through the WTO, leading to retaliatory tariff penalties by the European Union. Despite initial controversy, the safeguard measures were terminated in December 2003 after a midterm review of the steel industry's progress in adapting to competition and economic changes. The United States faced $2.2 billion in increased tariffs from the European Union due to WTO dispute settlement findings. President continued monitoring imports of certain steel products and delegated the function to the Secretary of the ITA. Section 406 of the Trade Act of 1974 provides a remedy against market disruption caused by imports from Communist countries. This provision addresses concerns about rapid influx of imports from Communist governments. Section 406 investigations provide relief against market disruption from imports of Communist countries. Relief can last up to five years, with a possible three-year extension. A country-specific safeguard on imports from China is found in section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974. The legislation implemented an anti-surge mechanism under the U.S.-China Bilateral Trade Agreement, scheduled to terminate 12 years after China's WTO accession. Import relief may be granted to prevent market disruption, with retaliation possible if relief remains in effect for more than two or three years. The section 421 safeguard provides relief for subject merchandise from China only. The section 421 safeguard provides relief for subject merchandise from China only, with consultations required with Chinese trade authorities. The standard for relief is \"market disruption,\" and the USITC and USTR are involved in the procedure. Seven section 421 investigations have been completed to date, with affirmative determinations in five cases and negative determinations in two cases. President Obama imposed remedies on certain passenger and light truck vehicle tires from China, marking the first implementation of a section 421 safeguard. The remedy included additional tariffs on Chinese tires for a three-year period, starting at 35% ad valorem and decreasing over the years. This decision followed an affirmative ruling by the USITC in a section 421 investigation. The USITC ruled in favor of imposing additional duties on certain merchandise for a three-year period, starting at 55% ad valorem and decreasing by 10% each year. Adversely impacted workers and firms may receive expedited consideration for Trade Adjustment Assistance. The USTR was required to make a recommendation to the President within 55 days, with a final decision to be made within 15 days. Congress generally supports trade remedy laws for mitigating adverse effects. Some in Congress support trade remedy laws to mitigate adverse effects of international trade on domestic industry and workers. Increased import competition can harm key industries, leading to factory closures and job losses. Offshore outsourcing also affects service sector workers. Strengthening trade laws is crucial to enforce them rigorously in international negotiations. However, some argue that trade remedy actions introduce inefficiencies in economies, decreasing economic welfare. Some in Congress are concerned about the additional costs to U.S. producers using imports subject to trade orders in finished products like steel for manufacturing automobiles and buildings. The distinctions between domestic and foreign producers are becoming less clear in a global trading environment. Balancing multilateral commitments with the need to regulate unfair trade practices presents challenges for Congress. The challenge for Congress is to balance multilateral commitments with regulating unfair trade practices, as the global trading environment blurs the lines between domestic and foreign producers."
