    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hospital Quality Report Card Act of 2006\". Its purpose is to provide a short title for the legislation. The Hospital Quality Report Card Act of 2006 aims to expand hospital quality reporting through the Hospital Quality Report Card Initiative under the Medicare program. This initiative ensures that hospital quality measures data are easily accessible to assist patients, consumers, purchasers, insurers, healthcare providers, and policymakers in making informed decisions and improving healthcare quality. The Hospital Quality Report Card Initiative, established under the Medicare program, aims to provide easily accessible hospital quality measures data to assist various stakeholders in making informed decisions and improving healthcare quality. The Hospital Quality Report Card Act of 2006 mandates the establishment of a Hospital Quality Report Card Initiative to report on healthcare quality in subsection (d) hospitals within 18 months of enactment. The Initiative will provide quality measurement reports for hospitals based on at least 2 quality measures. The Secretary is required to publish reports on hospital quality at least twice a year, including data on effectiveness, safety, timeliness, efficiency, patient-centeredness, and equity. The reports will also include information on staffing levels of nurses and other hospital staff. The Secretary is required to publish reports on hospital quality at least twice a year, including data on staffing levels of nurses and other health professionals, rates of nosocomial infections, volume of procedures, availability of interpreter services, hospital accreditation, quality of care for different patient populations, and availability of emergency services. The Secretary publishes reports on hospital quality, including data on staffing levels, nosocomial infection rates, procedure volume, interpreter services, accreditation, care quality for different populations, availability of emergency rooms, intensive care units, obstetrical units, burn units, health information technology, telemedicine, electronic medical records, patient safety initiatives, and other relevant measures determined by the Secretary. The Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality can adjust and publish hospital reports with quality measures tailored to specific regions, states, or local areas. The Secretary may also adjust quality measures to account for differences in hospital and patient characteristics. The Secretary may adjust quality measures based on patient characteristics like health status, severity of illness, insurance status, and socioeconomic status. Unadjusted data must be made available to the public if risk-adjusted quality measures are reported. Additionally, data on average hospital costs for ICD-9 conditions with quality measures collected must be compiled. Quality measures data are collected and reported for cost comparisons among subsection (d) hospitals. The Secretary may verify the accuracy of reported data and disclose the methodology to relevant organizations and hospitals before public release. Public input is also required. The Secretary must allow public review and comment on quality measures for subsection (d) hospitals for at least 60 days before finalization. Reports must be electronically available in an understandable format for various populations, including those with low health literacy. The Secretary will establish procedures for making report findings available to the public in a non-electronic format, such as through a toll-free telephone number. The methodologies and limitations on data sources used to develop and disseminate comparative data will be identified and acknowledged, including appropriate and inappropriate uses of the data. The Secretary will compare quality measures data submitted by hospitals annually to detect false improvements, including adverse selection against patients with severe illness and provision of substandard care. The Secretary will develop safeguards to protect hospital data from unauthorized use or disclosure, ensure accuracy of information, and prevent identifiable patient data from being released to the public. Grants and technical assistance may be awarded by the Secretary. The Secretary may award grants to organizations for hospital quality improvement. The Hospital Quality Advisory Committee will provide advice on quality measures data. The Hospital Quality Advisory Committee will include representatives from various healthcare organizations, including the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Health Resources and Services Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, national membership organizations, hospitals, healthcare professionals, patients, insurers, and experts in healthcare quality. The Hospital Quality Advisory Committee, comprised of representatives from healthcare organizations and experts in healthcare quality, will review and provide guidance on the establishment of the Initiative, integration of Federal quality measures data submission requirements, legal and regulatory barriers, and necessary assistance for quality measures data collection and reporting. The Hospital Quality Advisory Committee will be provided with staff and resources for its functioning and will terminate within 5 years. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2007 through 2016. A conforming amendment is made to the Social Security Act regarding data usage by the Secretary. The Secretary will use data submitted for the Hospital Quality Report Card Initiative under section 1898. The Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality will evaluate and report to Congress on the effectiveness of the Hospital Quality Report Card Initiative. The evaluation will be used to enhance the Initiative's usefulness for patients."
