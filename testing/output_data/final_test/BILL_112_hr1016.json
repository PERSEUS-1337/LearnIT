Congress finds that on January 12, 2010, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti near Port-au-Prince, resulting in over 316,000 deaths, including American citizens and UN personnel. Additionally, an estimated 3 million people were directly affected. The 2010 earthquake in Haiti affected an estimated 3 million people, displacing over 2.1 million from their homes. The disaster caused extensive casualties, infrastructure damage, and economic losses totaling $7.8 billion, equivalent to 120% of Haiti's GDP in 2009. Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, faced a devastating earthquake in 2010. More than 70% of Haitians lived on less than $2 per day before the disaster, ranking 149 out of 182 countries on the UN Human Development Index. House Resolution 1021, passed on January 21, 2010, expressed condolences for the loss of life and bipartisan support for Haiti's recovery. The initial emergency response from the US Government, led by the United States Agency, was crucial. After the devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010, the United States Government, through agencies like USAID and US Southern Command, swiftly deployed urban search and rescue teams from various locations to assist in disaster response efforts. A month later, the House of Representatives unanimously passed House Resolution 1059 in support of Haiti's recovery. House Resolution 1059 expressed gratitude to USAR units for their efforts in Haiti, where they rescued over 130 people from the rubble. The international community, including the Haitian diaspora in the US, supported Haiti through various means such as fundraising and remittances. Significant challenges remain in Haiti as it works to recover and rebuild, with approximately 680,000 people still in camps. Reconstruction has been slow, and irregularities in the 2010 elections caused unrest. The elections in Haiti in November 2010 led to violence, while an outbreak of cholera in October was worsened by Hurricane Tomas, causing widespread disease. Over 4,766 deaths and 270,991 infections were reported by March 2011. The United States has provided over $62 million in assistance to combat the cholera epidemic in Haiti, reducing the mortality rate from nearly 7% to 1.7% of all cases by February 25, 2011. The people of Haiti have shown resilience, dignity, and courage throughout the crises. On March 20, 2011, Haiti held presidential and parliamentary elections without major disruptions. An international donors conference on March 31, 2010, pledged over $5 billion to support Haiti, with $1.9 billion disbursed and $2 billion committed. Haiti will require ongoing international support to address the cholera epidemic and promote reconstruction and development. SEC. 3. REPORT. The President, in consultation with relevant agencies, must report to Congress on post-earthquake efforts in Haiti, including cholera prevention and treatment.

It will also assess coordination among US agencies, with Haitian ministries, and other donors. The report to Congress will evaluate US and international efforts in Haiti, focusing on programs for vulnerable populations, water, sanitation, and health improvements.
