    "content": "Since 1971, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) has operated as a self-supporting governmental entity, replacing the previous U.S. Post Office Department (USPOD) which relied on annual appropriations from Congress. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1971 transformed the USPS into an independent establishment that covers its operating costs through revenue from postage sales and services, with minimal reliance on appropriations. The USPS operates as a self-supporting entity with an annual appropriation of $90 million, which is 0.1% of its $65 billion operating revenue. Congress provides this appropriation to compensate for free mailing privileges to blind persons and overseas voters. The Postal Service Fund is off-budget, not subject to congressional controls. Additionally, the USPS has two other accounts: the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund (RHBF) and the Competitive Products Fund (CPF), established by the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006. The USPS operates as a self-supporting entity with an annual appropriation of $90 million, which is 0.1% of its $65 billion operating revenue. Congress provides this appropriation to compensate for free mailing privileges to blind persons and overseas voters. The Postal Service Fund is off-budget, not subject to congressional controls. The USPS has two other accounts: the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund (RHBF) and the Competitive Products Fund (CPF), established by the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006. The RHBF is an account for annual prepayments towards employees' retirement benefits, while the CPF holds revenues from competitive products and services. The USPS can borrow money from the U.S. Treasury's Federal Financing Bank, with debt limits set by federal statute. The USPS's financial condition is assessed through metrics like profitability, revenues, expenses, debt, and liquidity, with data from quarterly and annual financial statements. The USPS incurred $5.4 billion in operational losses during FY2014, driven by a $5.7 billion charge for the RHBF. Between FY2005 and FY2014, the USPS had two profitable years followed by eight unprofitable years, resulting in deficits totaling $51.0 billion. Losses began in FY2007 when payments into the RHBF started, despite a $2.1 billion increase in revenue from FY2006 to FY2007. In FY2006 and FY2007, USPS revenue increased to $74.8 billion from $72.7 billion, while expenses rose to $80.1 billion from $71.7 billion. The $8.4 billion expense increase was mainly due to RHBF funding requirements. Despite RHBF payments impacting profitability, USPS would have still faced deficits from FY2009 to FY2012. Excluding RHBF payments, USPS would have had surpluses in FY2013 and FY2014. Non-RHBF deficits since FY2009 total $13.6 billion. The USPS faced deficits from FY2009 to FY2012 due to a drop in revenues, partially recovered in FY2013 and FY2014. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act separated USPS products into market-dominant and competitive categories. Market-dominant products have limited rate increases, while competitive products have more pricing flexibility. In January 2014, USPS raised rates by 1.7%. In January 2014, USPS raised rates by 1.7% on market-dominant products and 2.4% on competitive products. A temporary 4.3% surcharge was approved for market-dominant products, currently under litigation. USPS's FY2014 revenues were $67.8 billion, with $47 billion from market-dominant products. Rate increases for 2015 are on hold pending a court decision. The USPS's revenue grew between FY2005 and FY2008, reaching a high of $74.9 billion. However, a rapid decrease in mail volume during the recession led to four consecutive years of revenue decline between FY2009 and FY2012. Revenue increased again in FY2013 and FY2014, but FY2014 operating revenue of $67.8 billion was still lower than FY2005 revenues. Mail volume dropped sharply to 155.4 billion pieces in FY2014, 27.1% below its FY2006 peak. The USPS's expenses in FY2014 were $73.2 billion, 1.5% higher than FY2013. Despite the increase, expenses fell in the fourth quarter of FY2014. Operating expenses have increased from $68.3 billion. The USPS's operating expenses have increased from $68.3 billion to $73.2 billion in the past 10 years. Without the RHBF portion, expenses decreased over the decade. Expenses grew from $68.3 billion to $71.7 billion before the establishment of the RHBF in 2007. After the PAEA, expenses (minus the RHBF) declined from $74.7 billion in FY2007 to $67.5 billion in FY2014. The USPS reached its $15 billion debt cap in late FY2012 and continues to have no remaining borrowing authority through FY2014. In FY2012, USPS's debt grew due to falling revenues and $17.9 billion payments into the RHBF. By FY2014, revenues were $7.1 billion lower than in FY2007 and FY2008. The USPS had $4.9 billion in cash at the end of FY2014, an increase from $2.3 billion in FY2013. Limited liquidity and lack of borrowing authority hinder operational upgrades. The Competitive Products Fund balance was transferred to the Postal Service Fund in FY2012 to address liquidity concerns. The Retiree Health Benefits Fund had $48.8 billion in November 2014, with a total obligation of approximately $97.7 billion. USPS is prohibited from drawing funds from the RHBF until FY2017, contributing to its lack of liquidity. The USPS has not made benefit payments for FY2011-FY2014, resulting in a $22.4 billion default. It anticipates not having enough liquidity for FY2015 and FY2016 payments. Despite revenue growth in FY2013 and FY2014, expenses have not decreased enough to meet prefunding commitments, raising concerns about long-term financial sustainability. The USPS's revenue has remained lower than 10 years earlier, indicating a weakening demand for its products and services. To address its weak cash position, the agency implemented operational realignments in 2013 and announced further consolidations in 2014 to reduce costs and strengthen finances. The Postal Service implemented operational realignments in 2013 and announced further consolidations in 2014 to reduce costs. Despite revenue increase in FY2013, legislative change is projected to be necessary for liquidity improvement. Insufficient funds could lead to payment prioritization and deferral of expenditures. The USPS's financial condition needs reforms to address short-term liquidity, increase revenue, reduce costs, fund retiree benefits, decrease debt, and achieve long-term financial sustainability."
