    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Good Neighbor Social Security Office and Community Protection Act of 2012\". Congress acknowledges the importance of Social Security Administration field offices for the 61,000,000 Americans receiving benefits, but notes financial constraints and lack of community input in the ongoing closure of these offices. The Social Security Administration's process for closing field offices lacks transparency and community input. Social Security beneficiaries and surrounding communities should be notified of closures, given the opportunity to comment, and have their input considered to minimize service disruptions. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nAdministration: Social Security Administration\nClosure: includes realignment, consolidation, or merger of an Administration field office\nCommissioner: Commissioner of Social Security\nState: each of the 50 States, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands\n\nSEC. 4. GUIDELINES AND STANDARDIZED PROCEDURES FOR CLOSURE OF SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION FIELD OFFICES. The Commissioner will develop financial guidelines and closure procedures for identifying Social Security Administration field offices for possible closure within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The guidelines will not mandate immediate closure of identified offices. The Commissioner will develop a proposal for office closure and service continuity, including financial justification, estimated savings, closure costs, customer traffic data, and locations of nearby offices. The Administration plans to provide estimated travel times, steps to mitigate hardship, notify agencies and organizations, and provide addresses for public comments prior to final closure decision for field offices. The Commissioner must provide copies of the office closure and service continuity proposal to relevant authorities and publish it in newspapers. The Commissioner must publish the closure proposal in newspapers and broadcast it on radio stations in the affected areas. Records of these actions must be maintained. A public hearing for comments must be held before a final decision on closing an Administration field office is made. The public comment hearing on the proposed closure of an Administration field office must be held at least 21 days after notice is given and at least 60 days before the proposed closure date. The Regional Commissioner for the region where the office is located must attend the hearing.

Notice of the final closing decision must be provided at least 45 days before the closing date.

No action can be taken to close the office before providing notice, including terminating leases, agreements with unions, expenditures, or contracts related to the closure. The Commissioner may grant extensions for closure.
