    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Super Pollutant Emissions Reduction Act of 2013\" or the \"SUPER Act of 2013.\" Congress finds that carbon dioxide contributes significantly to manmade global warming, with short-lived climate pollutants also playing a major role. These pollutants, known as \"super pollutants\", have shorter lifespans but cause more warming per molecule. They not only harm human health and crop yields but also contribute to increased agricultural production. International efforts are underway to address short-lived climate pollutants, with existing technologies available for reduction. The Federal Government has scattered programs aimed at reducing emissions of these pollutants. The Government Accountability Office reported on the lack of coordination among agencies in reducing pollutants, particularly diesel emissions containing black carbon. Executive Order 13514 mandates plans to reduce hydrofluorocarbons and methane, but few agencies have focused on these compounds in their sustainability plans. Reducing global emissions of short-lived climate pollutants can have a quick impact due to their short atmospheric lifetimes. Global emissions of short-lived climate pollutants can significantly reduce the rate of global temperature rise by 2050 and help stabilize temperatures below 2\u00b0C by 2100 when combined with carbon dioxide reductions. This can also cut the projected global sea-level rise in half. Steps to reduce these pollutants can have air quality and public health benefits. The purpose of the Act is to coordinate and optimize federal efforts in addressing short-lived climate pollutants, reduce overlap, and encourage federal operations and policies. The Act aims to coordinate federal efforts in reducing short-lived climate pollutants by ensuring effective programs, coordinating with state and industry efforts, and supporting local initiatives. The Act establishes a Task Force on Super Pollutants. The President shall establish the \"Task Force on Super Pollutants\" within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Task Force will review existing policies to reduce short-lived climate pollutants, identify duplicative Federal programs for consolidation, and recommend new programs to fill gaps. The Task Force on Super Pollutants will recommend programs and activities to reduce short-lived climate pollutants, focusing on industry standards and public-private partnerships. It will also identify and evaluate best practices for mitigation projects at various levels with the greatest potential for reduction. The Task Force on Super Pollutants, including representatives from relevant Federal agencies, will recommend programs to reduce short-lived climate pollutants and submit a report to Congress within 18 months of enactment. The Task Force on Super Pollutants, with representatives from various government offices, councils, and industry sectors, will recommend programs to reduce short-lived climate pollutants. This includes collaboration with State, local, and tribal governments, academic organizations, and relevant industry sectors such as energy, transportation, and agriculture. In this Act, the term \"short-lived climate pollutant\" includes black carbon, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, tropospheric ozone and its precursors, and emissions from banks of ozone-depleting substances. Sectors targeted for reduction programs include agriculture, wastewater, buildings, and others as determined by the President."
