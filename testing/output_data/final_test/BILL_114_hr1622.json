Congress acknowledges the importance of scientific discoveries and technical innovations for the economic and national security of the United States. Maintaining leadership in STEM fields requires a diverse population with the necessary skills and tools. A digital revolution in fabrication will enable individuals to create a wide range of products, including communication devices, solar-powered housing, and advanced manufacturing tools. The Center for Bits and Atoms at MIT has advanced digital fabrication through fab labs. MakerSpaces and TechShops also provide access to these capabilities. Fab labs serve as a model for national labs connecting local manufacturing facilities. A national public-private partnership is needed to accelerate infrastructure for learning skills and creating businesses. Federal charter for National Fab Lab Network added to Title 36, United States Code, creating a new chapter. The National Fab Lab Network (NFLN) is granted a Federal charter as a network of fab labs that provide fabrication tools and scanning tools to the public. The NFLN aims to create a national network of connected local fab labs to empower individuals and communities in the United States. The National Fab Lab Network (NFLN) aims to establish fab labs across the United States to promote STEM skills, innovation, job creation, and community empowerment. Their goal is to have at least one fab lab per every 700,000 individuals in the country within the first ten years of operation. The National Fab Lab Network (NFLN) aims to establish fab labs across the United States, coordinating the creation of a national network of local fab labs and issuing guidelines for their sustainable operation. The NFLN serves as a resource for organizations and communities seeking to create fab labs. The National Fab Lab Network (NFLN) aims to establish fab labs across the United States by providing information, assessing suitability, advising on the lab lifecycle, accepting funds from various sources, distributing funds to non-profit organizations, facilitating communication between organizations, promoting membership benefits, and participating in synergistic programs. The National Fab Lab Network (NFLN) has the authority to facilitate workforce training, job creation, research impacts, and civic infrastructure production. It can also amend its constitution, choose personnel, make contracts, acquire property, borrow money, collect dues, and engage in legal actions. The National Fab Lab Network (NFLN) is restricted from issuing securities or paying dividends, distributing income or assets to directors, officers, or members, making loans to directors, officers, or employees, or claiming congressional approval. It must keep accurate records of accounts. The NFLN must maintain accurate records, including minutes of meetings and member information.

An annual report must be submitted to Congress. The NFLN is required to submit an annual report to Congress, specifically to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate, detailing its activities during the previous fiscal year. The report must be submitted concurrently with the audit report and cannot be made public."
