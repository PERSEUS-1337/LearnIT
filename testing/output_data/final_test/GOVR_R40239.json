CDC has been engaged in global health efforts since 1958, initially focusing on malaria control. Over the years, its mandate has expanded to include efforts in smallpox eradication, disease surveillance, and partnerships in disease control and prevention for HIV/AIDS, influenza, polio, malaria, measles, tuberculosis, and emerging diseases. CDC's global health efforts address various diseases such as influenza, polio, malaria, measles, tuberculosis, and emerging diseases. Congress appropriates funds for these programs through Labor-HHS appropriations. The Center for Global Health receives the bulk of funds historically through budget lines for Global HIV/AIDS, Global Malaria, Global Disease Detection, Global Immunization, and Other Global Health. CDC implements programs in collaboration with U.S. agencies, international organizations, foreign governments, foundations, and nonprofit organizations. Funding levels between FY2001 and FY2012 are illustrated in the Appendix. The CDC Center for Global Health receives funding from various sources to support its global health initiatives, including funds from the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator and USAID. The Division of Global HIV/AIDS provides technical assistance in over 75 PEPFAR countries and employs various healthcare professionals. The Division of Global HIV/AIDS (DGHA) employs a range of public health experts to assist in implementing and strengthening HIV prevention, treatment, and care services in PEPFAR countries. Specific activities include developing evidence-based programs, building sustainable public health capacity, and supporting in-country surveillance systems. President Bush announced PEPFAR in 2003 to fight global HIV/AIDS, leading to increased CDC spending on global HIV/AIDS programs. CDC's appropriations for HIV/AIDS programs slightly declined from $124.9 million in FY2004 to $118.7 million in FY2011. OGAC transferred $3.4 billion to CDC for global HIV/AIDS activities from FY2004 to FY2008, accounting for nearly 80% of CDC's global health spending. OGAC transferred about $1.3 billion to CDC in FY2009 for PEPFAR programs. According to the 2012 Congressional Budget Justification (CBJ), U.S. agencies, including CDC, supported HIV/AIDS treatments for 3.2 million people by the end of FY2010. CDC played a crucial role in expanding access to HIV/AIDS treatments and preventing mother-to-child transmission. PEPFAR support enabled 334,000 HIV-positive mothers to give birth to HIV-free babies between 2004 and 2009. Additionally, 114,000 infants were born HIV-free through PEPFAR-supported programs by the end of FY2010. Experts, including those at CDC, emphasize the importance of expanding vaccine coverage to reduce vaccine-preventable diseases in children under five. Expanding vaccine coverage, particularly for polio, measles, and DPT, is a cost-effective way to improve global health. CDC focuses on preventing vaccine-preventable diseases in children under five, with appropriations growing from $3.1 million in FY1991 to $150.8 million in FY2011. Most funds are earmarked for polio and measles interventions, while other VPDs are addressed through leveraging funds from other sources. CDC provides technical assistance on immunization-related epidemiologic and laboratory science, introducing newer vaccines globally and implementing immunization programs through international partnerships. CDC staff offer support in improving vaccine-preventable disease surveillance and using immunizations effectively. Additionally, CDC officials serve on the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI Alliance). CDC officials are actively involved in global initiatives such as the GAVI Alliance, GIVS, and the Decade of Vaccines initiative, aimed at accelerating the introduction of vaccines in developing countries to reduce child mortality. The Decade of Vaccines aims to sustain gains in eradicating polio and eliminating measles by ensuring universal application of routine immunizations. CDC spent $1.5 billion from FY2001 to FY2011 on expanding global access to polio and measles immunizations. Polio is a highly contagious virus that mostly affects children under five years old and can only be prevented through immunization. Global eradication efforts have reduced polio cases by more than 99% from 1998 to 2010. CDC has played a crucial role in the global effort to eradicate polio, with a significant decrease in cases from 350,000 in 1998 to 1,349 in 2010. The organization has helped establish a network of 145 laboratories worldwide, processing nearly 200,000 lab specimens in 2010. CDC's laboratory methods are considered the gold standard in the global polio network. Additionally, CDC collaborates with other partners in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative and has spent approximately $1.1 billion on polio immunizations from FY2001 to FY2011. Measles is a highly contagious virus that mostly affects children under five years old. In 2008, it caused about 164,000 deaths worldwide, with severe effects on malnourished individuals. Survivors may suffer from blindness, encephalitis, diarrhea, ear infections, or pneumonia. Up to 10% of measles cases in underprivileged populations result in death. CDC has been instrumental in eliminating measles in various countries globally. The CDC has played a crucial role in eliminating measles in several countries worldwide. They partnered with PAHO in 1996 to develop a measles elimination strategy, leading to the disease's eradication in the Americas by 2002. The CDC also supports the Measles/Rubella LabNet, a global network of 679 laboratories aimed at eliminating measles globally. They have invested $438.9 million from FY2001 to FY2011 in measles control activities in African and Asian countries, purchasing over 200 million vaccine doses and providing technical support for vaccination campaigns. The CDC has been instrumental in reducing measles-related deaths globally through large-scale vaccination campaigns and epidemiological investigations. Partnering with organizations like WHO and UNICEF, the Measles Initiative led to a 74% decrease in measles deaths from 2000 to 2008, with significant improvements in the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa. By 2008, CDC's efforts contributed to reducing measles-related deaths from 733,000 to 164,000. The CDC's malaria programs have significantly reduced deaths from 733,000 to 164,000 in 2008. They conduct research, provide technical assistance, and implement prevention and control efforts bilaterally and with multilateral partners like WHO and UNICEF. Their work includes policy development, program guidance, laboratory research, and monitoring and evaluation. The CDC collaborates with UNICEF, the Global Fund, and the World Bank to focus on global malaria efforts. They utilize data, research, and evidence-based strategies for prevention and control, including training, supervision, monitoring, and evaluation. Activities also involve evaluating the impact of interventions like LLINs, monitoring insecticide resistance, improving surveillance with technology, and conducting household surveys in remote areas. CDC collaborates with UNICEF, the Global Fund, and the World Bank on global malaria efforts, utilizing data and evidence-based strategies. They conduct household surveys in remote villages, evaluate health worker performance, and improve diagnosis and treatment services for malaria. CDC has allocated $111.7 million from FY2001 to FY2011 for global malaria programs, providing insecticide-treated nets, treatments to prevent malaria transmission, and anti-malarial treatment doses. President's Malaria Initiative, led by USAID and implemented by CDC, aims to halve malaria deaths in 15 African countries with a $1.2 billion budget from FY2006 to FY2010. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) in Africa, led by USAID and implemented by CDC, aims to reduce child mortality rates through malaria interventions. USAID transferred funds to CDC for global malaria programs from FY2006 to FY2009. CDC's Global Disease Detection (GDD) program, established in 2004, strengthens global public health capacity to identify and contain disease threats worldwide. CDC's Global Disease Detection (GDD) program leverages international expertise to enhance public health surveillance, training, and laboratory methods for emerging infectious diseases. By FY2010, eight GDD centers were established in various countries to build public health capacity. Due to budget cuts, the Kazakhstan center no longer serves as a GDD regional center, leaving CDC managing seven regional centers focusing on core capacities like disease detection and response. Since 2006, CDC's Global Disease Detection (GDD) program has assisted in 665 outbreak investigations and public health emergencies, addressing various diseases such as typhoid fever, influenza, Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever, anthrax, dengue, and Rift Valley fever. CDC has allocated approximately $248.6 million for GDD activities worldwide from FY2001 to FY2011, with additional funding requested in FY2012 for programs aimed at building public health capacity in recipient countries. The Health Capacity Development activities include the Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP), Sustainable Management Development Program (SMDP), Global Safe Water Sanitation and Hygiene, Maternal and Child Health, Afghanistan Health Initiative, and Health Diplomacy Initiative. The budget category was previously called \"Other Global Health\" and funded FETP and SMDP programs. The FY2012 budget proposes funding other programs through the new Global Public Health Capacity Development program. FETP and SMDP are two programs authorized by Congress for support by the Center for Global Health. The Field Epidemiology Training Program (FE(L)TP) is a two-year postgraduate applied public health training program for public health leaders. Participants spend 25% of their time in the classroom and 75% in field placements, providing public health services to host countries' health ministries. CDC has supported 41 FE(L)TPs and similar programs in 57 countries from 1980 to 2010, and as of March 2011, supported 18 programs covering 34 countries. In 2010, CDC supported 335 trainees in the FE(L)TPs who conducted outbreak investigations and planned investigations. The Sustainable Management Development Program (SMDP) was established in 1992 to strengthen public health systems by enhancing leadership and management capacity of health workers. SMDP conducts outbreak investigations, planned investigations, and surveillance studies. It collaborates with partners to provide technical assistance for programs addressing HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and district public health programs. CDC also works with other groups to assess organizational leadership quality and management skills, identifying performance gaps in health systems. Through SMDP, CDC assists health leaders in developing action plans for capacity development. The Sustainable Management Development Program (SMDP) was established in 1992 to enhance leadership and management capacity of health workers. CDC provides post-course technical assistance and incentives to support sustainable management development programs. Graduates from SMDP's Management for Improved Public Health (MIPH) course focus on planning, budgeting, and supervision skills. Over 60 countries have participated in the program, with 414 faculty members graduating from the MIPH course. CDC's Global Health Leadership Forum in 2010 gathered 42 participants from 15 countries to strengthen health systems. CDC allocated $49 million from FY2001 to FY2011 for global health programs, including TB, influenza, and neglected tropical diseases. CDC collaborates with partners to provide technical assistance for disease outbreaks, chronic diseases, disaster response, and reproductive health. CDC collaborates with U.S. and multilateral partners to provide technical support in the global effort to eliminate TB. Key activities include research, improvement of TB screening and diagnostics, surveillance of TB/HIV prevalence and MDR-TB prevalence, laboratory strengthening, infection control, program evaluation, outbreak investigation control, and expertise for policy development. CDC also provides technical assistance to multilateral efforts to contain TB. The CDC collaborates with global partners to support TB elimination efforts through various activities such as research, surveillance, laboratory strengthening, and outbreak investigation. They also work with WHO on drug-resistant TB surveillance and influenza prevention and response worldwide. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, CDC provided test kits and expertise to countries to strengthen their capacity. The CDC collaborates with global partners to strengthen laboratory capacity and train health experts to control the spread of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus. Global influenza operations are implemented bilaterally with countries and in cooperation with groups such as DOD and WHO. Congress has funded U.S. efforts to train health workers in foreign countries to prepare for and respond to a pandemic that might occur from any influenza virus. CDC has received funding from Congress to support influenza-related activities, with a focus on global efforts. CDC has been working for over two decades to reduce illness, disability, and death caused by neglected tropical diseases through various programs and partnerships. Their current work primarily targets seven NTDs. CDC's focus is on seven NTDs that can be controlled through mass drug administration. Congress provided roughly $3.5 billion for global health activities from FY2001 to FY2011, leading to a 50% increase in CDC's global health budget by FY2011. HIV/AIDS programs received nearly half of the funds in FY2001, with additional support for Global Disease Detection and health system strengthening by FY2011. In the early 2000s, concerns about HIV/AIDS led to the development of initiatives like the LIFE Initiative, International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative, and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Congress provided substantial funding for these efforts, primarily through the State Department-coordinated PEPFAR. By 2004, there was increased congressional support for programs to strengthen countries' capacity to respond to infectious disease outbreaks, leading to funding for Global Disease Detection and \"Other Health Programs.\" In 2004, Congress funded Global Disease Detection and \"Other Health Programs,\" leading to a decrease in HIV/AIDS funding as a portion of CDC's global health budget. The FY2011 operating plan allocated $340.2 million for CDC's global health programs, with a request for $381.2 million in FY2012. The budget request included support for parasitic diseases and global malaria programs. The FY2012 budget request renamed the \"Other Global Health\" program to \"Global Public Health Capacity Development\" program, combining support for FELTP, SMDP, water and sanitation, and maternal and child health. The Afghan Health Initiative and Health Diplomacy activities are now requested to be funded through this new budgetary category."
