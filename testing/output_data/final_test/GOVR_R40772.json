    "content": "The 111th Congress prioritized health reform, sparking debates on noncitizen rights and requirements under potential reforms. This report examines noncitizen health insurance coverage, their use of safety-net providers, and the impact of unauthorized aliens on the healthcare system. It discusses noncitizen eligibility for health insurance, coverage rates, and their contribution to the number of uninsured individuals in the US. Additionally, it explores noncitizen utilization of emergency Medicaid. The report discusses noncitizen healthcare utilization, including emergency Medicaid and federal health center care eligibility. It highlights challenges in analyzing the noncitizen population due to varying terminology and study populations. Noncitizens in the United States can access health insurance and pay for healthcare. Some noncitizens travel to the U.S. for high-quality medical care. Employers are not required to verify a worker's legal status for health insurance. Medicare-participating hospitals must provide emergency medical services to all patients, including noncitizens, regardless of their ability to pay. The 1996 PRWORA established restrictions on noncitizens' eligibility for public benefits, including healthcare services, with exceptions for those with a U.S. work history or military connection. Nonqualified aliens are generally not eligible for federal public benefits, with some exceptions for emergency-related benefits. Additionally, nonqualified aliens, nonimmigrants, or aliens paroled into the U.S. for less than one year are not eligible for state or local public benefits. Noncitizens ineligible for federal public benefits, except for emergency-related benefits. Nonimmigrants or aliens paroled for less than one year not eligible for state or local public benefits. Public benefits defined as various assistance programs provided by the U.S. government. Noncitizens ineligible for federal public benefits, except for emergency-related benefits. Exemptions to restrictions include medical assistance, emergency disaster relief, public health services, and specified programs by the Attorney General. The Attorney General has the authority to specify in-kind services at the community level that do not depend on the recipient's income or resources and are necessary for life or safety. Exemptions from alienage restrictions for public benefits include ambulance services, medical and public health services, and mental health assistance. Noncitizens have specific eligibility requirements for public benefits, including means-tested programs like Medicaid and CHIP. Emergency medical services may be covered for eligible noncitizens. Federally Qualified Health Centers, including community health centers, are not considered federal public benefits, so there are no specified eligibility requirements for noncitizens. The Medicaid program is authorized by Title XIX of the Social Security Act and provides medical assistance through a federal/state matching program. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is a federal/state matching program that provides medical assistance to low-income individuals, including children, pregnant women, and qualified aliens. Eligibility for federal Medicaid and CHIP benefits for noncitizens is based on immigration status and arrival before August 22, 1996. Most legal permanent residents (LPRs) are barred from Medicaid and CHIP for five years after entering the US, but may be eligible for CHIP and Medicaid at the state's option. States can use funds to cover pregnant women and children who are LPRs within the first five years. Refugees and asylees are eligible for Medicaid and CHIP for seven years after arrival. LPRs with a substantial US work history or military connection are eligible without the five-year bar. LPRs sponsored for admission after 1997 have their sponsor's income and resources considered for eligibility. Unauthorized aliens are ineligible for Medicaid but may qualify for emergency Medicaid. States can use their own funds to cover noncitizens ineligible for Medicaid or CHIP. Unauthorized aliens are generally ineligible for Medicaid, except for emergency Medicaid which can cover their care. Emergency Medicaid may pay for the care of unauthorized aliens, nonimmigrants, and LPRs within the first five years of arrival for emergency conditions if they meet the eligibility requirements of the Medicaid program. Aliens who are otherwise eligible for Medicaid except for their immigration status may receive medical assistance for necessary emergency services. This provision was enacted as an amendment to the Medicaid provisions of the Social Security Act. Emergency Medicaid covers unauthorized aliens, nonimmigrants, and LPRs within the first five years of arrival for emergency conditions. Eligibility requires meeting Medicaid program requirements, including being a state resident. Unauthorized aliens seeking emergency hospital care during illegal entries often struggle to prove residency. Additionally, to qualify for emergency Medicaid, aliens must belong to a Medicaid eligible category and meet income requirements. Medicare is a federal insurance program that covers health care services for qualified beneficiaries, including individuals 65 and older and permanently disabled individuals under 65. Emergency Medicaid may help low-income, uninsured noncitizens pay for emergency medical care at Medicare-participating hospitals. Working-age single males are generally not eligible for Medicaid regardless of financial status or residence. Medicare-participating hospitals must treat medically unstable patients and women in active labor regardless of immigration or insurance status. Medicare covers hospitalizations, physician services, prescription drugs, skilled nursing facility care, home health visits, and hospice care for individuals 65 and older, as well as permanently disabled individuals under 65. Eligibility is based on working for at least 40 quarters in Medicare-covered employment and being 65 years old. Noncitizens legally present in the US and LPRs in the country for five continuous years are also eligible. Health reform proposals aim to increase health insurance coverage for the majority of US residents. The section discusses current health insurance coverage for noncitizens, analyzing characteristics affecting insurance status using data from the March 2008 supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS is a household survey conducted by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), with weighted data reflecting the population. Findings from select articles that couldn't be analyzed by CPS are also presented. All discussed differences are statistically significant at the .05 level. The comparisons in this report are based on three groups residing in the United States: native-born U.S. citizens, naturalized U.S. citizens, and noncitizens. The CPS data does not differentiate between legal and illegal aliens or different categories of noncitizens. Respondents may have multiple types of health insurance during the year, and an uninsured respondent is someone who lacked any type of health coverage. The CPS data does not differentiate between legal and illegal aliens or different categories of noncitizens. An uninsured respondent is someone who lacked any type of health insurance during the past year. The types of health insurance used in this report are private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, and military or veterans coverage. Noncitizens are more likely to be uninsured compared to native-born and naturalized U.S. citizens. Noncitizens have the lowest rates of health insurance coverage, with 42.5% having private insurance, the lowest Medicare coverage, and slightly lower Medicaid coverage compared to native-born citizens. Naturalized citizens have the highest Medicare coverage and the lowest Medicaid coverage. Noncitizens have the lowest rates of health insurance coverage, with 42.5% having private insurance, the lowest Medicare coverage, and slightly lower Medicaid coverage compared to native-born citizens. Noncitizens must be legal permanent residents to join the armed forces, resulting in much lower rates of military/veterans coverage (0.8%) than naturalized (2.3%) and native-born citizen (4%) populations. Health insurance coverage patterns follow a similar trend across noncitizen, native-born, and naturalized populations, with differences in rates of private insurance and uninsurance, especially in the 65-and-older populations possibly due to Medicare coverage. Noncitizens, especially those over 65, have significantly higher rates of being uninsured compared to native-born citizens, possibly due to differences in Medicare coverage. Noncitizen children are also more likely to lack health insurance compared to their U.S. citizen counterparts. Additionally, noncitizens between 18 and 64 have lower rates of private insurance coverage than naturalized and native-born citizens. Noncitizens, especially those over 65, have higher uninsured rates compared to native-born citizens. Noncitizens aged 18-64 have lower private insurance coverage than naturalized and native-born citizens. The uninsured rate is higher among noncitizens over 65 compared to native-born citizens. Noncitizens over 64 are less likely to have private insurance than native-born citizens, with higher Medicaid coverage. Medicare coverage is high for all U.S. citizen populations aged 65 and older. Noncitizens over 64 are more likely to lack health insurance compared to native-born and naturalized citizens, with disparities decreasing as educational attainment increases. Even at the highest educational level, noncitizens are more likely to be uninsured. Private insurance rates for noncitizens lag behind those of native-born and naturalized citizens at all education levels. Noncitizens without a high school diploma have lower rates of private insurance and Medicaid coverage compared to native-born and naturalized citizens with similar education levels. Only 23.6% of noncitizens without a high school diploma have private insurance, while 14% are covered by Medicaid. In contrast, 42.8% of native-born citizens and 39.5% of naturalized citizens without a high school diploma have private insurance, with Medicaid coverage rates of 21.7% and 20.8% respectively. Noncitizens with high school diplomas have lower rates of private health insurance coverage compared to naturalized and native-born citizens with similar educational attainment. Only 39.3% of high school graduate noncitizens have private insurance, while 54.8% of naturalized citizens and 64.8% of native-born citizens with high school diplomas are covered. Additionally, noncitizens with a high school diploma have lower rates of Medicare coverage compared to their naturalized and native-born counterparts. Only 5% of high school graduate noncitizens have Medicare coverage, while 25.8% of naturalized citizens and 23.3% of native-born citizens with high school diplomas are covered. Noncitizens with high school diplomas have lower rates of private insurance coverage compared to naturalized and native-born citizens with similar education levels. Only 39.3% of noncitizens have private insurance, while 54.8% of naturalized citizens and 64.8% of native-born citizens are covered. Noncitizens also have lower rates of Medicare coverage, with only 5% having Medicare compared to 25.8% of naturalized citizens and 23.3% of native-born citizens with high school diplomas. Additionally, noncitizens with some college education have lower rates of private insurance coverage (53.3%) than naturalized citizens (72%) and native-born citizens (75.4%). Noncitizens also have a lower rate of Medicare coverage (3%) compared to naturalized citizens (12.9%) and native-born citizens (14.3%). Noncitizens with college diplomas have higher rates of private insurance compared to those with high school diplomas. College-educated noncitizens are three times more likely than college-educated native-born citizens to lack health insurance. The percentage of uninsured naturalized citizens with college diplomas falls between that of noncitizens and native-born citizens. Noncitizens with college diplomas also have lower rates of Medicare coverage than native-born and naturalized populations. Coverage for noncitizens, naturalized, and native-born populations is smallest for those with advanced degrees. The majority of all three groups have private insurance, with 83.1% of noncitizens and 89.9% of native-born citizens having private insurance. Noncitizens with advanced degrees are more than twice as likely to be uninsured compared to native-born citizens. More than a quarter of noncitizens and naturalized citizens live in California, while almost half of native-born citizens reside in the Midwest or South. Noncitizens are less likely than citizens to have private insurance or Medicare in every region and the five states with the highest noncitizen populations. Noncitizens in Texas have the lowest rates of private insurance compared to native-born and naturalized citizens. In California, noncitizens have the second lowest rate of private insurance. Native-born citizens in California have a higher rate of private insurance than those in the South, including Florida and Texas. Noncitizens in the South, including Florida and Texas, have lower rates of private insurance compared to those in the Northeast and Midwest. Noncitizens in Texas, Florida, and other Southern states are more likely to be uninsured, with higher percentages compared to native-born and naturalized citizens. For example, 60% of noncitizens in Texas are uninsured. Noncitizens in Texas have a high uninsured rate of 60%, while noncitizens in New York have lower rates but still significantly higher than native-born and naturalized citizens. Year of arrival in the US impacts health insurance coverage for noncitizens and naturalized citizens, particularly affecting Medicare coverage. The arrival year in the US affects private insurance coverage for noncitizens and naturalized citizens. Private insurance rates peak for noncitizens who arrived in the 1970s and decrease for more recent arrivals. Naturalized citizens generally have higher private insurance rates than noncitizens, with the highest coverage for those who arrived in the 1980s. Medicare coverage is higher for noncitizens who arrived before 1970 and decreases for more recent arrivals. Noncitizens who arrived after 2001 have a higher rate of lacking health insurance compared to those who arrived in the 1980s and prior to 1970. Naturalized citizens also show differences in uninsurance rates based on arrival periods, with the lowest rate for those who arrived before 1970. There is a disparity in health insurance coverage between naturalized citizens and noncitizens across all arrival periods except before 1970. Variance in coverage exists among noncitizens from different regions, while naturalized citizens generally have higher rates of coverage. Noncitizens from various regions have different rates of private health insurance coverage, with North Americans having the highest and Mexicans the lowest. Naturalized citizens from North America also have high coverage rates. Noncitizens and naturalized citizens from the former Soviet Union and the Caribbean have the highest rates of Medicaid coverage. Noncitizens and naturalized citizens from Europe and North America have lower rates of Medicaid coverage compared to those from the Caribbean and the former Soviet Union. Noncitizens and naturalized citizens from Europe and North America also have higher rates of Medicare coverage. Noncitizens are more likely to be employed by private employers and slightly more likely to be self-employed than native-born citizens. Noncitizens and naturalized citizens have different employment patterns and access to health insurance. Noncitizens are more likely to be self-employed and work for smaller firms, leading to higher rates of uninsurance. In contrast, naturalized citizens are more likely to have private health insurance, especially when employed by government entities. Firm size also plays a role, with larger firms having higher rates of private insurance for all groups. Noncitizens are less likely to have private insurance compared to native-born and naturalized citizens, especially in firms with less than 10 employees. In contrast, larger firms with over 1,000 employees show higher rates of private insurance across all groups. Noncitizens in firms with less than 10 employees are more likely to lack health insurance compared to native-born citizens and naturalized citizens. In larger firms with over 1,000 employees, noncitizens are over twice as likely to be uninsured. Noncitizens and naturalized citizens generally have lower rates of private insurance than native-born citizens, with noncitizens having the highest uninsurance rates. Noncitizens and naturalized citizens have higher uninsurance rates than native-born citizens across all occupations. Noncitizens in service occupations are almost half as likely to have private insurance and twice as likely to be uninsured compared to citizens. In construction and extraction occupations, noncitizens are less than half as likely to have insurance compared to native-born and naturalized citizens. Noncitizens have lower rates of private insurance compared to native-born and naturalized citizens across various occupations. In construction and extraction occupations, noncitizens are more than twice as likely to be uninsured. In management, business, and financial occupations, as well as in professional and related occupations, noncitizens have high rates of private insurance but still lower than native-born and naturalized citizens. Noncitizens in management, business, and financial occupations have lower rates of health insurance compared to native-born and naturalized citizens. In the construction industry, noncitizens are overrepresented and more likely to lack health insurance. Noncitizens in the construction industry have lower rates of private health insurance compared to native-born and naturalized citizens. They are also more likely to be uninsured, with noncitizens being less than half as likely to have private insurance and more than twice as likely to be uninsured than their native-born counterparts. The largest differences in uninsured and private insurance rates between noncitizens and native-born citizens occur in the agricultural, forestry, fishing, and hunting industry. Noncitizens in the agriculture industry have a high rate of being uninsured (71.2%), while only 23.9% of native-born noncitizens lack health insurance in the same industry. In the leisure and hospitality industry, 35.7% of noncitizens have private insurance compared to 62.9% of native-born citizens. Noncitizens in financial activities and education/health services industries have high rates of private insurance but are more likely to lack health insurance compared to native-born and naturalized citizens. Noncitizens tend to be poorer overall, with 49% having lower family incomes. Noncitizens have lower family incomes compared to native-born and naturalized citizens, resulting in lower rates of private health insurance. However, noncitizens with higher family incomes are more likely to have private insurance, with 82.5% of those at least 500% of poverty having coverage. Noncitizens have lower family incomes compared to native-born and naturalized citizens, resulting in lower rates of private health insurance. However, noncitizens are much less likely to have Medicaid coverage, especially for those below 200% of poverty. For all poverty levels, noncitizens are more likely to be uninsured than native-born and naturalized citizens. Poverty has a stronger impact on reducing uninsured rates for U.S. citizens compared to noncitizens. Noncitizen children with family incomes below 100% of poverty are less likely to have private insurance than citizen children. Noncitizen children at all income levels are more likely to be uninsured than citizen children. Citizen children with family incomes under 200% of poverty have higher rates of Medicaid coverage, while noncitizen children with family incomes of at least 200% of poverty have higher rates of Medicaid coverage. Noncitizen parents may not obtain Medicaid coverage for their U.S. citizen children due to fear or barriers. Native-born children with foreign-born parents have lower Medicaid coverage rates compared to those with native-born parents. Children with two foreign-born parents have different rates of insurance coverage compared to children with two native-born parents. Noncitizens are more likely to be uninsured and have lower rates of private insurance, Medicare coverage, and military/veterans coverage. Native-born and naturalized U.S. citizens have similar rates of private health insurance, while naturalized citizens have the highest rate of Medicare coverage. Noncitizens have higher uninsured rates and lower private insurance, Medicare, and military/veterans coverage compared to native-born and naturalized citizens. Various factors like occupation, industry, education, and region of birth influence health insurance coverage. Studies using different data sources provide insights into noncitizen health insurance coverage, including distinctions between aliens with different immigration statuses. Some studies show that unauthorized aliens are more likely to be uninsured compared to other noncitizens. In Los Angeles County, only 20% of unauthorized aliens had job-based coverage in 2005, with 68% lacking health insurance. Uninsurance is a persistent issue for unauthorized workers, with only 62% continuously insured in the previous two years. Insurance disparities exist between foreign-born and native-born individuals, with unauthorized aliens having lower rates of coverage. Studies show that Mexican and other Latino unauthorized aliens are more likely to lack health insurance compared to immigrants and citizens. Factors associated with having health insurance among unauthorized Mexicans in New York include being a woman, living in a residence with fewer adults, higher levels of acculturation and income, not working as a day laborer, and having social support. Personal resources like financial and social support play a significant role in determining insurance coverage. Studies have shown that personal resources, such as financial and social support, are key determinants of health insurance coverage, especially for unauthorized Latino women who are more likely to be uninsured. Disparities in insurance coverage between citizens and noncitizens are influenced by differences in job offerings of health insurance. Noncitizens, particularly those in low-wage jobs, are less likely to have access to health coverage compared to citizens. Noncitizens are affected by lower health insurance offers from immigrant employers, especially in low-wage jobs. Studies show they are less likely to have employer-sponsored coverage, with only a slight difference in uptake compared to citizens. The gap in coverage is mainly due to noncitizens working for firms that don't offer health benefits. Noncitizens are less likely than citizens to work for firms offering health benefits. Education and age differences explain 60% of the gap in employer-sponsored health insurance. Firm size and unionization also impact insurance availability, with larger firms and unionized workplaces more likely to offer coverage. Noncitizens are less likely to be in larger firms or unionized workplaces. There is disagreement on the impact of noncitizens on the U.S. uninsured population over time. Several studies and analyses have examined the impact of noncitizens on the uninsured population in the U.S. over time. One study found that immigrants who arrived between 1994 and 1998 contributed to the growth in the uninsured population, while another study during the same period suggested that recent immigrants were not a significant factor. The time period analyzed has a significant effect on the estimated impact of noncitizens on the uninsured population. Additionally, a CRS analysis from 2000 to 2007 showed a steady increase in the number of uninsured individuals, peaking at 46.5 million in 2006 before decreasing to 45 million in 2007. The percentage of the population without health insurance also rose from 14% in 2000 to 17.9% in 2005. The percentage of the population lacking health insurance increased from 14% in 2000 to 17.9% in 2005, then slightly decreased to 17.1% in 2007. The percentage of noncitizens in the uninsured population increased from 19.6% in 2000 to 21.5% in 2006, then decreased to 21.1% in 2007. Native-born citizens comprised the largest percentage of the uninsured population, decreasing from 75.5% in 2000 to 73.1% in 2007. The percentage of naturalized citizens in the uninsured population increased from 4.6% in 2000 to 5.8% in 2007. Between 2000 and 2005, the uninsured population increased, with native-born citizens making up the majority of the increase. Noncitizens and naturalized citizens also contributed to the increase, but the difference was not statistically significant. When examining the time period in two groups (2000-2003 and 2003-2005), native-born citizens accounted for 63% of the increase in the uninsured population, compared to 30% for noncitizens. Between 2003 and 2005, the increase in the uninsured population was mainly driven by native-born citizens, while the number of uninsured noncitizens remained constant. However, between 2005 and 2006, the entire increase in the uninsured population was due to noncitizens. The number of uninsured naturalized and native-born citizens decreased during this time. Additionally, between 2006 and 2007, the number of uninsured noncitizens and native-born citizens decreased as well. The number of uninsured noncitizens and native-born citizens decreased between 2006 and 2007. The uninsured naturalized citizens saw a slight increase. Studies show noncitizens contributed significantly to the increase in the uninsured population from 1994 to 2006. The Kaiser Commission study found that unauthorized aliens accounted for one-third of the increase in uninsured adults in the US between 1980 and 2000. The impact of noncitizens on the uninsured population varied depending on the years analyzed. When data from 1998 through 2003 was combined, almost two-thirds of the increase in the uninsured population was due to noncitizens. The Kaiser Commission study found that between 1994 and 1998, 74% of the growth in the uninsured population was due to native-born U.S. citizens, while 10% was due to noncitizens. Similarly, between 2000 and 2003, 24% of the growth in the uninsured population was attributed to noncitizens, with 71% attributed to native-born U.S. citizens. The study concluded that immigration trends are not primarily responsible for the increase in the uninsured population. Noncitizens would have to fare significantly worse than citizens to account for the majority of the change in the uninsured population. Noncitizens are less likely than citizens to have health insurance coverage. The discussion focuses on emergency departments (EDs) and health centers as sources of care for the uninsured. Limited research is available on noncitizen visits to EDs, while information on noncitizen usage of health centers is lacking. Analysis of 2006 data on emergency Medicaid expenditures and findings from two studies on emergency Medicaid are presented. Few studies have examined emergency Medicaid expenditures, with limited information on patient characteristics and services funded by emergency Medicaid. The Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) is an administrative data source compiled by the Department of Health. The Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) is an administrative data source compiled by the Department of Health and Human Services' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) from eligibility and claims files submitted by the 50 states and the District of Columbia since 1999. States submit five MSIS files every quarter containing eligibility and claims information, which undergo editing and validation testing. CMS processes the files to create summary person-level data files for each fiscal year, including variables like Medicaid enrollment indicators and basis of eligibility. The Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) compiles data on Medicaid enrollment, eligibility, benefits, and expenditures by state. Data includes demographic variables and total dollar amounts paid by Medicaid for various services. Variations in reporting standards among states may affect expenditure comparisons. Maine was the only state not providing Medicaid data in FY2006, with 10 states not reporting emergency Medicaid usage. Reported expenditures include federal and state funding. In FY2006, $2.6 billion was spent on emergency Medicaid, accounting for 1.1% of total Medicaid spending. California had the highest number of recipients and spending on emergency Medicaid, with $1.2 billion spent, which was 4.2% of its Medicaid budget. Arizona reported spending 8% of its Medicaid budget. Arizona reported spending 8% of its Medicaid budget on emergency Medicaid, totaling $252.6 million, the highest percentage among all states. Texas spent more than Arizona, with $272.8 million, followed by Florida ($127.8 million) and New York ($188.6 million). A study in North Carolina found that 48,391 people received emergency Medicaid services from 2001 to 2004, with 99% being unauthorized aliens. The majority of spending was on childbirth and pregnancy complications. Emergency Medicaid spending in North Carolina grew from $41.3 million to $52.9 million over four years, with the majority of the increase attributed to nonpregnant patients, particularly elderly and disabled individuals. Despite a 28% increase in emergency Medicaid spending, it represented less than 1% of the state's total Medicaid spending. The study noted a steady rise in emergency Medicaid use, with 16,106 patients served in 2004. In 2004, emergency Medicaid served 16,106 patients, representing only 5% of the unauthorized alien population in the state. A study in Tennessee found that emergency care for 62 unauthorized aliens cost $1.7 million, with 90% of services for labor and delivery. The GAO study reviewed Medicaid spending for unauthorized aliens in 10 states. The GAO study reviewed emergency Medicaid expenditures for unauthorized aliens in 10 states, with most spending on labor and delivery services. Despite remaining a small proportion of total Medicaid expenditures, emergency Medicaid spending increased faster than total Medicaid spending in nine of the states between FY2000 and FY2002. Some argue that hospital emergency departments are a common route for unauthorized aliens to receive medical care. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals to provide emergency medical services for all patients regardless of their ability to pay. It mandates hospitals to conduct medical screenings, treat and stabilize emergency conditions, and restricts transfers unless certain criteria are met. EMTALA requires hospitals to provide free care for some patients seeking care in EDs. 17% of ED visits in the US are by uninsured patients. Studies show conflicting views on whether uninsured patients cause ED overcrowding or seek care for non-urgent conditions. Noncitizens are more likely to be uninsured. Unauthorized aliens obtained healthcare primarily through hospital emergency services in the past. Unauthorized aliens in the United States used hospital emergency departments for healthcare in the past, but it is unclear if this is still the case. Studies have looked at noncitizen ED usage, with one study in Los Angeles showing that a small percentage of Mexican unauthorized aliens and immigrants had multiple ED visits compared to naturalized and native-born citizens of Mexican descent. Unauthorized aliens in the United States did not have higher emergency department (ED) usage compared to their citizen counterparts, despite lower rates of usual source of care and insurance coverage. Studies show that noncitizen Latino women and children in foreign-born families use ED services less than native-born citizens. Additionally, unauthorized Mexicans in New York with higher education levels, earlier entry to the US, health insurance coverage, and social support were more likely to use ED services. Unauthorized aliens in New York with more health care needs were more likely to report ED usage, but not access to a regular provider. A study from 1996 found that the majority of unauthorized aliens sought care at an ED due to lack of resources and knowledge of other sources of care in the United States. The study found that communities with more noncitizen residents generally have lower rates of emergency department (ED) usage. In 2003, ED use averaged about 32 visits per 100 people, with variations across different communities. Communities with higher ED usage tended to have fewer noncitizen residents compared to those with lower ED usage. The study found that communities with more noncitizen residents generally have lower rates of emergency department (ED) usage. The difference in noncitizen percentages between the highest- and lowest-use communities is statistically significant. ED usage does not vary much across communities based on population characteristics. Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) are discussed, but information on noncitizen usage of health centers is lacking. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) does not classify FQHCs as public benefits, allowing health centers to provide services to noncitizens regardless of immigration status. Health centers do not typically ask for clients' immigration status, making it difficult to obtain specific information about aliens. The term \"health center\" encompasses various public and nonprofit organizations that receive federal funding under the Consolidated Health Centers Program. The Consolidated Health Center Program includes community health centers, migrant health centers, health centers for the homeless, and health centers for residents of public housing. These centers provide primary health care services to medically underserved populations, serving over 16.1 million clients in CY2007. The majority of patients are low-income, uninsured, or underinsured individuals, including those with chronic diseases, pregnant teens, substance abusers, and individuals living with HIV/AIDS. 92% of patients are at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, with 40% having no health insurance and 64% being racial or ethnic minorities. Community health centers serve a population with 40% lacking health insurance, 64% being racial or ethnic minorities, and 35% relying on Medicaid. They offer primary health services, including medical, diagnostic, preventive, emergency, dental, pharmaceutical, and transportation services. The average cost per medical patient visit was $123 in 2007. Centers are mandated to serve all residents in their area, regardless of ability to pay. The Consolidated Health Centers program includes special categories like Migrant Health Centers. Migrant Health Centers, Health Centers for the Homeless, and Health Centers for Residents of Public Housing are special categories under community health centers. Noncitizens may face restrictions in accessing certain health centers based on their status. Migrant Health Centers served 827,000 migrant and seasonal farm workers and their families in CY2007. The cost of unauthorized aliens to the health care system poses complex fiscal questions. The cost of unauthorized aliens to the health care system poses complex fiscal questions due to difficulties in enumerating this population and obtaining accurate data. Key sources of socioeconomic information in the United States do not collect immigration status, making it challenging to calculate their health care costs. Studies often rely on assumptions about unauthorized aliens' numbers, service usage, and revenue contributions, leading to uncertainty in estimating the amounts spent. Many studies focus on limited geographic regions to estimate these costs. Studies on the health care costs of unauthorized aliens in the United States focus on limited regions and use various methods to estimate these costs, but none provide a reliable estimate agreed upon by researchers. Notably, studies on the unauthorized Latino population have used small samples and limited health care measures. Obtaining specific information about unauthorized aliens from safety-net providers is difficult as they do not attempt to distinguish patients by immigration status. The analysis focuses on recent studies estimating health care costs for unauthorized aliens in the US, excluding news reports without specified methodologies. Most studies are limited to specific geographic areas and use different methodologies and years, making it challenging to compare cost estimates accurately. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a study in May 2004 on the impact of unauthorized aliens on hospitals' uncompensated care costs. The study concluded that due to hospitals not collecting information on patients' immigration status, an accurate assessment of the impact remains elusive. In FY2006, 1.5% of total Medicaid recipients received emergency care based on alien status, costing approximately $2.6 billion. A study estimated that households headed by unauthorized aliens cost the federal treasury for Medicaid and medical expenses. In FY2002, unauthorized aliens cost the federal treasury $658 for Medicaid and $591 for medical care for the uninsured. Non-unauthorized alien households cost $1,232 for Medicaid and $123 for medical care. A study estimated that 1.3% of public funds spent on medical costs in 2000 was for nonelderly, unauthorized aliens, totaling $6.5 billion in medical costs. Approximately 36% of these costs were paid out of pocket by the aliens. The study estimated that public and private spending on care for unauthorized, nonelderly aliens was $4.1 billion, with $1.1 billion from public sources. Public spending on health care was $1.8 billion for immigrants, $376 million for nonimmigrants, $2.6 billion for naturalized citizens, and $82 billion for native-born citizens. Per household cost of care was $56 for foreign-born and $11 for unauthorized population. Colorado spends approximately $31.3 million annually on emergency Medicaid for unauthorized aliens. Colorado spends approximately $31.3 million annually on emergency Medicaid for unauthorized aliens, representing 50% of total emergency Medicaid costs. A study of 700 unauthorized aliens from 39 hospitals found that $40.2 million was spent on their care, with a small percentage (4.6%) accounting for over 50% of the expenditures. The study estimated public spending on unauthorized alien adults in Iowa to range between $14.2 million and $21.9 million, with costs for male adults between $4 million and $6.2 million, and for female adults between $10.2 million and $15.8 million. In Minnesota, unauthorized aliens cost health assistance programs approximately $35.5 million in FY2005, with $17.3 million paid by the state. This included $16.3 million for Emergency Medical Assistance. In Minnesota, $16.3 million was allocated for Emergency Medical Assistance, with costs split equally between the state and federal governments. Additionally, $15.5 million was designated for the State Children's Health Insurance Program, with the state covering 35% of the costs and the federal government covering 65%. $3.7 million was also allocated for the Medical Assistance program's state noncitizen pregnant women fund, fully funded by the state. The Mississippi Office of the State Auditor estimated that $35 million of $504.6 million spent on uninsured health care services in 2004 may be due to unauthorized aliens, but noted the difficulty in accurately determining this due to lack of data on immigration status. In 2002, a study found that hospitals in Southwest border communities spent $189.6 million on uncompensated care for unauthorized aliens. A pilot study in Texas County in 2008 identified $190 million in uncompensated care costs for emergency room treatment of unauthorized aliens. Another study estimated that Texas spent $353 million on uncompensated care costs for unauthorized aliens in FY2005. The Texas government spent $58 million in health care services for unauthorized aliens in FY2005, including emergency Medicaid costs, services for children with special health needs, substance abuse, mental health, immunizations, women's and children's health services, public health agencies, and emergency medical services. Local governments and private businesses bear the largest share of health-related costs for unauthorized aliens in Texas. Additionally, Texas hospitals provided $1.3 billion in uncompensated care for unauthorized aliens in FY2005. Noncitizens have a higher uninsured rate and lower private insurance coverage compared to native-born and naturalized U.S. citizens. The percentage of uninsured noncitizens increased from 2000 to 2007, while the percentage of uninsured native-born citizens decreased. Emergency Medicaid expenditures in FY2006 accounted for approximately 1.5% of total healthcare spending. During 2000-2007, emergency Medicaid accounted for 1.5% of total healthcare spending. Approximately $2.6 billion was spent on emergency Medicaid during this period, constituting 1.1% of total Medicaid spending. Limited research suggests noncitizens do not use emergency departments more than citizens, possibly due to overall better health. Studies show unauthorized aliens are less likely to report poor health compared to other Latinos. Several studies have shown that noncitizens, including unauthorized aliens, have lower rates of health insurance coverage, leading to lower utilization of health care services. Despite this, noncitizens, regardless of legal status, are more likely to have hospitalizations for childbirth compared to citizens. Noncitizens, including unauthorized aliens, face barriers in accessing healthcare such as language, cultural differences, lack of knowledge about the U.S. healthcare system, and financial constraints. Fear of jeopardizing citizenship eligibility and government discovery also hinders their utilization of health services. The 1994 study on unauthorized aliens and tuberculosis was based on data from the 2008 Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual Demographic Survey, March Supplement. The CPS is a household survey conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the U.S. Department of Labor, collecting demographic, social, and labor market information from approximately 57,000 households each month. The CPS collects data on employment and health insurance annually from households. The labor force includes employed and unemployed individuals. Employed persons work for an employer, are self-employed, or work at least 15 hours a week unpaid. Unemployed individuals are available and looking for work. The CPS categorizes citizenship into five groups. The CPS categorizes citizenship into five groups: native-born citizens, naturalized citizens, and noncitizens. Information on place of birth is collected for every household member, with individuals born in the US or its outlying areas considered native-born citizens. Those born outside the US are asked about their citizenship status. During the editing process, individuals without a birthplace provided are given a citizenship status. The CPS does not verify responses on citizenship and cannot differentiate between different categories of noncitizens or legal status in the US. A study on uncompensated care costs in Texas was conducted using data from hospitals. The total uncompensated care costs were calculated using various studies and models based on hospital characteristics. This included data from the United States/Mexico Border Counties Coalition study, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services report, and the 2004 Texas Hospital Association survey. The study also considered demographic estimates and annual per capita public share of medical spending on unauthorized aliens. The study on unauthorized aliens in Los Angeles County provided a conservative estimate of public spending on medical care. The study in Texas calculated the financial impact of unauthorized aliens based on various sources. The study in Colorado estimated the cost of providing federally mandated services to undocumented immigrants. Mississippi estimated the impact of illegal immigration based on RAND Corporation data. Minnesota used state program data to estimate the impact of illegal immigration. The study used state program data to estimate the costs to Medicaid and CHIP of unauthorized alien recipients. It relied on methodology from previous studies and estimated unauthorized aliens by assigning probabilities based on socioeconomic characteristics. The study used households as the unit of analysis to assess fiscal effects of immigration. The household is the primary unit for taxes and services, even if the head is an unauthorized alien. The cost of unauthorized alien households poses fiscal challenges. Studies in Florida and Southwest Border Counties analyzed the expenses for care of unauthorized aliens. The survey analyzed costs of uncompensated care in Southwest Border Counties by using statistical modeling to compare border communities with non-border communities. Researchers noted the unique characteristics of border counties and performed a linear regression to attribute differences to unauthorized aliens. Appendix C provides definitions of states and regions. The analysis included states in the Midwest, South, and West regions, with New Jersey, New York, Florida, Texas, and California analyzed separately. Birth regions in Africa and Asia were also examined, including specific countries within each region.
