    "content": "Human trafficking, also known as trafficking in persons (TIP) or modern slavery, is a major criminal enterprise affecting countries worldwide. The International Labor Organization estimated in 2012 that there were 20.9 million victims of forced labor, with 1.8 million in Latin America. In 2014, the ILO estimated that forced labor generates $12 billion in illegal profits annually in Latin America. Trafficking generally flows from rural to urban areas within countries and towards more developed nations across international borders. Countries are categorized as source, transit, or destination countries for human trafficking victims. Vulnerability to trafficking increases in countries experiencing political upheaval, armed conflict, economic crisis, or natural disasters. Hosting major international events can worsen trafficking issues. The report focuses on trafficking in Latin America and the Caribbean, U.S. efforts in the region, and recent anti-trafficking initiatives. The report discusses recent country and regional anti-trafficking efforts, defining trafficking in persons as the subjection of individuals to compelled service for exploitation, including sex trafficking, forced labor, and the use of child soldiers. Severe forms of trafficking are defined in U.S. law, raising issues for Congress to consider in addressing human trafficking. The international community defines trafficking in persons as the use of force, fraud, or coercion for involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery. The Palermo Protocols were drafted by the United Nations in 2000 to address trafficking in persons and human smuggling, which are often confused. Human smuggling involves providing transport for individuals who consent to gain illegal entry into a foreign country. The Smuggling Protocol considers smuggled migrants as willing participants in a criminal activity who should be given humane treatment and protection of their rights. Observers differentiate smuggling as a crime against the state, leading to deportation, while trafficking is seen as a crime against a person, warranting government assistance and protection. The State Department distinguishes trafficking from smuggling based on the presence of force, fraud, or coercion. In U.S. immigration law, trafficked migrants are victims, while those who consent to be smuggled are complicit in a criminal activity and may face prosecution and deportation. Since June 2014, the State Department Trafficking in Persons Report has identified Central American migrants as vulnerable to human trafficking in Mexico. A 2016 report by Polaris found that 34% of Latin American women trafficked into the US since 2007 were recruited through smuggling methods. Victims were either abducted and sold to traffickers or forced to work to pay off smuggling debts. Human trafficking is often linked to illegal and unregulated migration flows, influenced by various factors in Latin America. Factors driving emigration from Latin America and the Caribbean to the United States, Europe, and Canada include family ties, poverty, unemployment, political and economic instability, natural disasters, proximity, and crime. These countries have relied on Latin American immigrants to fill low-paying jobs in various industries. Developed countries have tightened immigration policies due to concerns about security and job competition. The tightening of immigration policies in developed countries due to concerns about security and job competition has led to a global rise in illegal immigration. In the Western Hemisphere, illegal migration flows are most evident in Mexico, along its northern border with the United States and southern borders with Guatemala and Belize. While unauthorized migration from Mexico to the U.S. has decreased, flows from Central America have increased, with apprehensions of Central American migrants surpassing those of Mexicans in recent years. Human trafficking is a growing problem in Latin America and the Caribbean, with illegal immigrants increasingly turning to smugglers to cross the U.S.-Mexican border. Smuggling routes have become more dangerous and costly, with some migrants being sold into forced labor or prostitution. Many fail to report abuses due to deportation fears, and there is a lack of support for trafficking victims in Mexico. Human trafficking is a significant issue in the Caribbean region, with major forms including sexual exploitation, labor trafficking, and trafficking of illegal immigrants. The UNODC reports that forced labor victims in Latin America make up 44% of the total, higher than in Europe and Central Asia. Haiti and the Dominican Republic have the highest percentages of their populations subjected to \"modern slavery.\" Individual and external factors contribute to human trafficking in the region. Individual risk factors for human trafficking in Latin America and the Caribbean include poverty, unemployment, indigenous group membership, illiteracy, history of abuse, homelessness, drug use, and gang membership. Vulnerability of LGBTQ individuals is also highlighted. Factors pushing individuals towards risky job propositions abroad are compounded by pull factors like economic opportunities fueled by media images. Outside factors contributing to human trafficking include high global demand for various labor types and political/social/economic crises in specific countries. Factors contributing to human trafficking in Latin America include economic crises, natural disasters, machismo leading to discrimination against women, established trafficking networks, public corruption, restrictive immigration policies, government disinterest, and limited economic opportunities for women. Despite women achieving equal or higher education levels, their employment remains concentrated in low-wage, informal-sector jobs. Most research on human trafficking in Latin America and the Caribbean focuses on trafficking children for sexual exploitation, especially in popular tourist destinations. Factors like poverty, abuse, and involvement in criminal gangs increase children's vulnerability to trafficking. Children are trafficked internally and across borders, with some engaging in commercial sex to support their families. State Department officials estimate that around 1 million children work as domestic servants in Latin America, facing risks of abuse. Human trafficking of Haitian restaveks is a major concern, along with trafficking for illegal adoptions, soldier recruitment, and forced labor in criminal groups. Central American gangs also forcibly recruit children, while instances of child labor in dangerous industries like agriculture and mining have been documented across the region. The production of various goods in Latin America involves child labor, with an estimated 12.5 million children working in the region, 9.6 million in hazardous conditions. Trafficking for forced labor and sexual exploitation is a significant issue, with victims often trafficked for prostitution, pornography, or stripping. Children are trafficked within their own countries, while young women may be trafficked internally or internationally. Trafficking of women in Latin America is a significant issue, with thousands being trafficked for sexual exploitation annually. Various countries in the region, such as Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and Guatemala, are involved in sex trafficking rings. Additionally, Argentina, Brazil, and Panama are destination countries for trafficked women from other Latin American regions. Trafficking of women in Latin America is prevalent, with women from Colombia and Central America being trafficked for the sex industry. Border crossings in Central America and Mexico, particularly the Mexican-Guatemalan border, are hotspots for trafficking. The ILO reported 1.8 million people engaged in forced labor in Latin America in 2012, representing 3.1% of the region's population. Forced labor victims are also found in Europe and the United States. Brazil has a high incidence of forced labor, especially in rural areas. Forced labor is prevalent in Latin America, with Brazil being a hotspot in rural areas on cattle ranches, logging and mining camps, and plantations. Indigenous peoples in Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay are at risk of being trafficked for forced labor, particularly in the mahogany, brick-making, and gold-mining industries in the Amazonian regions. Illegal gold mines in Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, and other countries are hotspots for human trafficking. Migrants from Haiti in the Dominican Republic are vulnerable to trafficking. The Department of Justice has prosecuted an increasing number of cases related to forced labor in Mexico and Central America, involving products like coffee, sugarcane, fireworks, melons, tomatoes, and shellfish. The Department of Justice has prosecuted a growing number of cases of foreigners trafficked into forced labor in the United States, with a significant portion involving the agricultural sector. Criminal gangs or mafia groups are often involved in trafficking people for profit, with Guatemala being a hub for transporting women from other Central American countries. Mexican drug trafficking organizations, including Los Zetas, are increasingly involved in smuggling women from Central America for sexual exploitation. Criminal gangs from various countries have been caught attempting to traffic victims across the U.S.-Mexican border. Concerns have been raised about terrorist groups potentially using the same networks as human traffickers to enter the United States. Human traffickers may collaborate with terrorist groups to enter the United States. Victims of trafficking are at high risk of contracting HIV/AIDS and other diseases, especially in situations of forced labor. Factors contributing to this risk include poverty, discrimination, exploitation, and limited access to health services. Anti-trafficking efforts have intensified globally. Efforts to combat human trafficking in the United States have increased since the enactment of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA, P.L. 106-386). The TVPA established minimum standards to combat human trafficking and directed the Secretary of State to rank countries based on their efforts to combat trafficking, with Tier 1 being the best countries and Tier 3 being those not fully complying with the standards. The act also called for the withholding of non-humanitarian assistance from countries not meeting the standards. The United States has laws in place to combat human trafficking, including the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA). Congress has reauthorized the TVPA multiple times, with the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 and the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Reauthorization Act of 2008 adding new requirements and refining standards for countries. The TVPA established minimum standards and directed the Secretary of State to rank countries based on their efforts to combat trafficking. The Victims Reauthorization Act of 2008 added a new requirement for Tier 2 Watch List countries to be downgraded to Tier 3 after two years, unless waived by the President. The TVPA has been reauthorized multiple times, most recently through the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013. The 114th Congress has considered bills related to human trafficking, including the International Megan's Law requiring registered sex offenders to carry passports with unique identifiers. Nonprofit organizations have challenged the law's constitutionality. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 eliminated an exception to the Tariff Act of 1930, allowing goods produced by forced labor to be imported. Identifying such goods and manufacturers remains a challenge for U.S. customs officials. The Obama Administration introduced a new U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America in 2015, linking the region's security and prosperity to the U.S. The Administration requested over $1 billion for foreign assistance in FY2016 to promote economic prosperity in Central America. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 allocated up to $748 million for the Central America strategy, including funds for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. It also included up to $349 million for the Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), with conditions on aid distribution. The FY2017 foreign aid appropriations bills include withholding requirements for funds allocated to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras until the Secretary of State certifies that these governments are addressing concerns such as combating human trafficking. In September 2016, President Obama signed a continuing resolution that funded most foreign aid programs at the FY2016 level with a 0.496% reduction until December 9, 2016. The U.S. government released the Trafficking in Persons Report in June 2016, categorizing 188 countries into tiers based on their efforts to address human trafficking. Tier 1 countries are fully compliant with U.S. standards to eliminate human trafficking. In 2016, the Trafficking in Persons Report categorized 27 countries as Tier 3, leading to foreign assistance restrictions. Most Latin American countries fall in the middle tiers, with only the Bahamas, Chile, and Colombia on Tier 1. Colombia upgraded to Tier 1 by convicting traffickers and appointing new officials. Colombia in Latin America upgraded to Tier 1 by convicting traffickers and appointing new prosecutors. Countries on the Tier 2 Watch List include Antigua and Barbuda, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Cuba, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. Belize, Venezuela, and Haiti are the only Latin American countries identified as Tier 3. Venezuela's ranking was mostly due to unclear data on its efforts against trafficking. Colombia, Guyana, and Jamaica upgraded their tier rankings, while Haiti, St. Lucia, and Suriname fell in the rankings. Guyana earned a Tier 2 ranking by convicting a trafficker and providing funding for NGOs. Jamaica upgraded to Tier 2 by increasing TIP convictions and funding for victims' services. St. Lucia was downgraded for lack of effort, and Suriname was automatically downgraded to Tier 3 due to a decrease in convictions. In FY2016, the U.S. government provided over $11 million for anti-trafficking projects in Latin America, administered by various U.S. agencies. The State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (J/TIP) plays a significant role in awarding grant funding to NGOs globally. Haiti was downgraded to Tier 3 on the Watch List due to enforcement and victim protection issues. In FY2015, J/TIP awarded $2.7 million in grant funding to Haiti, Mexico, Uruguay, and the Caribbean. DHS and Mexican officials are collaborating to combat human trafficking and smuggling along the U.S.-Mexican border, including training Mexican border officials to identify trafficking victims. DOJ's Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development is also involved in anti-trafficking efforts. The DOJ's Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance, and Training (OPDAT) provides training and technical assistance to foreign officials in the United States and overseas, including mentoring Mexican investigators on TIP investigative capacity and training Bahamian officials on victim identification and evidence preservation. The General Secretariat of the Organization of American States (OAS) organizes training programs, promotes anti-trafficking policies, and facilitates information exchange among member states to combat human trafficking. The OAS is actively combating human trafficking through meetings of national authorities. The most recent meeting in Brasilia approved two important documents: the Second Work Plan Against Trafficking in Persons in the Western Hemisphere 2015-2018 and the Declaration of Brasilia. The OAS will monitor the implementation of the work plan by helping member states develop common indicators in prevention, prosecution, punishment, and victim assistance. The findings will be presented at the Fifth Meeting of National Authorities on Trafficking in Persons in 2017. The International Organization for Migration has been combating TIP since 1994. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has been combating human trafficking since 1994. Their programs focus on increasing public awareness, training government officials to identify and assist victims, and supporting the rehabilitation of trafficking victims. IOM has a Global Human Trafficking Database and provides virtual training to counter-trafficking specialists in Latin America. Many Latin American governments have signed international protocols to address human trafficking. Several Latin American countries have signed international agreements to combat human trafficking, including the U.N. Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons and ILO Conventions on Forced Labor and Child Labor. Barbados's signature made every country in the region a party to the U.N. TIP convention. In 2015, six countries passed new anti-trafficking legislation, while others established national TIP coordinators and task forces. However, many countries in the region lack the resources and political will to effectively implement these initiatives. Many countries in Latin America lack resources and political will to fund and implement anti-trafficking programs. Governments face challenges like drug trafficking and gang violence, prioritizing them over human trafficking. Political instability hinders efforts in countries like Haiti and Venezuela. Lack of shelters and follow-up plans for victims, along with public corruption, pose obstacles to effective anti-trafficking measures. Low conviction rates for offenders are also a concern. Conviction and prosecution rates for TIP offenders in Latin America are low, especially for forced labor and domestic servitude. U.S. interests in the region include democracy, economic growth, narcotics control, and border security, which may conflict with human rights goals like combating human trafficking. Ethical concerns about human trafficking must be balanced against broader U.S. geopolitical goals. U.S. foreign policy goals can influence the TIP report and sanctions process, with some allies potentially avoiding sanctions for political reasons. Observers argue that some U.S. allies in Latin America may escape sanctions for political reasons, while others criticize the U.S. government for selectively including Cuba on the Tier 3 list until 2014. U.S. officials in the region face challenges in providing an unbiased account of anti-trafficking efforts due to foreign policy concerns. Enforcement of TIP sanctions could potentially undermine broader U.S. goals in the region, especially in politically unstable countries. Since 2003, only Cuba and Venezuela have faced restrictions on U.S. aid for trafficking issues in Latin America. Latin America, excluding Cuba and Venezuela, has faced restrictions on U.S. assistance for not meeting TVPA standards. While some argue that aid cuts may deter cooperation, most Latin American countries value their relationship with the U.S. and fear negative consequences of a Tier 3 designation. Success in combating human trafficking in the region is challenging to measure, with many countries reporting increased training and conferences. In Latin America, countries have increased training courses, conferences, and workshops to combat human trafficking. The State Department emphasizes the importance of concrete actions such as enacting new laws, expanding victim assistance programs, and securing prosecutions for traffickers. Despite passing TIP laws, the region has seen low numbers of arrests and convictions. Some question the adequacy of the State Department's indicators for measuring anti-trafficking efforts. In Latin America, efforts to combat human trafficking have increased through training courses and workshops. Prosecutions of suspected traffickers rose to 1,744 in 2015, with 663 convictions. However, these numbers are lower compared to Europe and South/Central Asia. Observers urge for more focus on addressing underlying factors like gender discrimination and economic inequality. In Latin America, efforts to combat human trafficking have increased through training courses and workshops. Countries are advised to develop trafficking laws tailored to their specific issues and law enforcement capabilities. The State Department notes that some current laws in Latin America are inadequate, such as Mexico's broad definition of human trafficking and Costa Rica's limited definition. Attention is also needed to address broader weaknesses in criminal justice systems that hinder trafficking investigations and prosecutions, including corruption among officials. Stiffening penalties for officials aiding traffickers and improving victim handling through training and mentoring by external entities like UNODC and U.S. law enforcement are key strategies. DOJ's OPDAT mentors Mexican prosecutors in securing victim testimony for trafficking convictions. The U.N. definition of TIP distinguishes between voluntary and coerced prostitution, with only the latter considered TIP. Sex trafficking is only considered a \"severe form of TIP\" if it involves commercial sex acts induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or if the person involved is a minor. There is debate over whether prostitution should be included in the definition of TIP, with some arguing it is violence against women. European and Latin American countries with legal prostitution reject this broader definition, fearing it would hinder international efforts to combat trafficking. Some policymakers and researchers believe legalizing prostitution can reduce human trafficking by improving working conditions for sex workers. The State Department emphasizes not punishing TIP victims forced into prostitution, even where it is illegal. The European Union and Council of Europe also support this approach in combating human trafficking. The prevalence of TIP for forced labor exploitation is significant globally, with calls for increased research, international efforts, and awareness to combat this form of trafficking. The State Department and other international groups are actively working to evaluate and combat trafficking for forced labor, with Brazil being recognized in the 2016 Global Slavery Index. Brazil has been recognized for its efforts to address forced labor despite limited resources. It investigates businesses using slave labor, holds them accountable, and has seen an increase in labor trafficking prosecutions and convictions. Some Latin American countries still focus mainly on commercial sexual exploitation. Perpetrators in Brazil have avoided jail by paying fines."
