    "content": "In June 2009, the House passed H.R. 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, and in November 2009, Chairwoman Boxer of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works completed markup of S. 1733, the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act. Both bills aim to establish a cap-and-trade system to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and address energy efficiency and renewable energy. Covered sectors include electricity production, natural gas distribution, petroleum refining, and industrial sectors, with major reductions in GHG emissions required. These bills are currently being debated in Congress. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills on climate change do not require GHG emission reductions in agriculture and forestry sectors. However, they could potentially increase farm input costs for fossil fuels and other production inputs. Farmers could offset these costs by participating in carbon offset and renewable energy provisions. This report provides background on the energy and climate debate in relation to U.S. agriculture and forestry sectors. The proposed cap-and-trade programs in climate bills could affect various sectors by addressing GHG emissions sources, carbon allowances, and carbon offset activities. The report also discusses energy and biomass provisions for agricultural and forestry sectors, along with related initiatives by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. During the 110th Congress, GHG bills were debated regarding the use of carbon offsets. In the 110th Congress, GHG bills debated the use of carbon offsets, including agricultural activities and land-based practices under a cap-and-trade framework. Some proposed bills set aside allowances for purposes like biological sequestration, allowing participating farmers to sell them for emission reduction activities. For example, S. 3036 (Boxer) contained provisions for this. S. 3036 in the 110th Congress included agriculture- and forestry-based provisions under a cap-and-trade framework. It established a tradeable allowance system with incentives for land-based activities like carbon offsets, set-aside allowances, and auction proceeds. The bill allocated emissions allowances to agriculture and forestry entities and supported various offset projects. The bill in the 110th Congress included provisions for agriculture and forestry under a cap-and-trade system. It allocated emissions allowances to support activities in these sectors, including a cellulosic biomass ethanol technology deployment program. Farmers and landowners could participate in the carbon market by selling allowances and credits for emission reduction activities. The agriculture and forestry provisions in S. 3036 aimed to support emission reduction activities in these sectors. Senator Stabenow introduced an amendment to expand the offset program, but it was not adopted. The farm community continues to advocate for these provisions in establishing an offset program under a cap-and-trade system. The 111th Congress is considering legislation for a cap-and-trade program that includes agriculture and forestry activities. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills do not cover agricultural operations under mandatory emissions caps, limiting tradeable allowances and opportunities for these sectors compared to previous legislation. For more information, refer to CRS Report R40896. Comparison of the Cap-and-Trade Provisions in H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 showed differences in the eligibility of agricultural and forestry sectors for offset and allowance programs. H.R. 2454 initially did not specify if agriculture and forestry activities would be eligible as offsets, causing concern among stakeholders. The House version of the bill was different from the one reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, with the EPA tasked to determine eligible offset types instead of the USDA. The Peterson Amendment to H.R. 2454 allowed for certain agricultural and forestry activities to participate in a carbon offset program administered by the USDA, addressing concerns in the agricultural community about offset practices. The agricultural community, including various industry groups and former Senators Bob Dole and Tom Daschle, supports the inclusion of agricultural and forestry offsets in a cap-and-trade scheme. This is in line with the Peterson Amendment to H.R. 2454, which allows for carbon offset programs administered by the USDA to address emissions concerns. Several farm groups are now opposing climate legislation due to concerns about increased production and input costs. The House Agriculture Committee issued a climate change questionnaire in March 2009 to gather input on reducing GHG emissions, with survey responses highlighting concerns and market opportunities for farmers. These issues were discussed during House Agriculture Committee hearings in June and December 2009 after the House passed H.R. 2454. After the House passed H.R. 2454, the Senate and agriculture community saw it as a good starting point for climate legislation. Senator Kerry introduced S. 1733 in September 2009, allowing for agriculture and forestry offsets in a cap-and-trade scheme. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works held hearings on the bill and approved Senator Boxer's \"Manager's Amendment\" in November. While S. 1733 included agricultural operations in its emissions cap, key concerns of the U.S. agriculture community were not addressed. The bill delegated program authority to the President and EPA, with differences in project types, offset quantities, and program administration. Many in the agricultural community view S. 1733 as a placeholder bill, expecting more detailed provisions to be included later. Senator Stabenow's ongoing efforts, such as the \"Stabenow Amendment,\" are supported for potential inclusion in the bill. Senator Stabenow worked on the \"Stabenow Amendment\" to expand carbon offset provisions for agriculture and forestry in climate bills. Her bill, the Clean Energy Partnerships Act of 2009 (S. 2729), did not address all concerns in the agricultural community. Some support expanding provisions outlined in S. 2729, including the National Farmers Union and National Corn Growers Association. The agricultural community, including Chairwoman Lincoln of the Senate Agriculture Committee and the American Farm Bureau Federation, have concerns about climate legislation and its impact on farming communities and economic competitiveness. Climate-related legislative initiatives historically have not required emissions reductions in agriculture due to the impracticality of regulating small individual emissions sources. Current legislative proposals do not cover the agricultural sector, so farmers are not required to reduce emissions. Some legislative proposals do not include agricultural operations in mandatory emissions reduction requirements for climate change. Interest groups debate whether certain agricultural operations should be included in future proposals. Bills in the 110th Congress considered criteria for determining covered entities and potentially including animal agriculture facilities in emission reduction efforts. The EPA and USDA have conducted studies on the potential economic costs of energy and climate legislation on the agriculture and forestry sectors. Concerns have been raised about increased farm input costs if the legislation is enacted, but analyses suggest that the overall impact on the agricultural community will be \"modest.\" Studies by USDA and EPA suggest that carbon offsets could bring economic gains to the agricultural sector. Various groups and universities have published studies on the economic effects of legislation on agriculture and forestry. The economic impacts of cap-and-trade legislation on the U.S. agricultural sector have been studied by various organizations, including the American Farm Bureau Federation, the Fertilizer Institute, Brookings Institution, and CRA International. Studies show conflicting conclusions on the effects, with predictions of rising energy costs and varying estimates of economic impacts. Most studies focus on energy cost effects and do not fully analyze potential offsetting cost effects or consider impacts on farm input usage, crop production, food prices, and biofuel revenue. Several studies analyze the economic impacts of cap-and-trade legislation on the U.S. agricultural sector, considering factors like management changes, food prices, farm revenue from biofuel and biomass production, carbon credits, and carbon offset activities. Some studies suggest that policies reducing costs and increasing farm revenue through carbon offset and renewable energy provisions could offset potential production and input cost increases. However, the exact quantitative estimates of these effects remain uncertain. Additionally, studies warn of potential negative effects on the agriculture sector from climate change without mitigation policies. The curr_chunk discusses the incorporation of agricultural and forestry sectors in climate change legislation, specifically focusing on carbon offset credits and set-aside allowances. These legislative proposals aim to measure and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, with a set percentage of allowances allocated to non-regulated entities. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of allowances or auction revenue to support various purposes under the emissions cap, including entities like petroleum refineries and states. Non-covered entities must use the value generated from the sale of allowances for specific purposes, such as mitigating energy costs or investing in energy efficiency. The curr_chunk explains how states can use funds from allowances for energy efficiency, renewable energy, or other projects. Allowances are permits to emit CO2 and can be sold in the emissions trading market. H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 provide three categories of allowances applicable to the agricultural sectors, including allowances for small electricity local distribution companies and energy-intensive industries. The curr_chunk discusses allowances for agriculture-related industries, supplemental activities like renewable energy and forestry, and a provision for early action offset credits in H.R. 2454. These allowances aim to provide financial assistance for projects that reduce GHGs and store carbon, rewarding early adopters such as farmers practicing conservation tillage. The curr_chunk highlights the desire to expand allowances for farming sectors in H.R. 2454 and S. 1733, specifically increasing early action offset credits. Three agriculture-related industries are identified as eligible for the EITE subsidy: nitrogenous fertilizer manufacturers, wet corn millers, and beet sugar producers. This assessment is based on energy and trade data, with established thresholds for eligibility. H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 propose a carbon offset program for agricultural and forestry activities with differences in project types, eligibility criteria, domestic versus international offsets, and program administration. A comparison table between the House-passed bill and Senator Stabenow's bill highlights key differences. S. 1733 delegates offset program implementation to the President with limited agency duties. Both H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 propose a carbon offset program for agricultural and forestry activities, with differences in project types, eligibility criteria, domestic versus international offsets, and program administration. The comparison table highlights key differences in roles and responsibilities of EPA and USDA regarding offsets within the programs. Both bills allow covered entities to submit 2 billion tons of offsets annually, with restrictions on the percentage of emission reductions that can be met through carbon offsets. The House and Senate programs have different formulas for determining the annual percentage of offsets each covered entity can use, as well as varying proportions of domestic and international offsets allowed. The House bill (H.R. 2454) and the Senate bill (S. 1733) propose different ratios for domestic and international projects, with the Senate bill delegating domestic program authority to the President. H.R. 2454 allows for up to 1.5 billion tons of international offsets annually, while S. 1733 caps it at 1.25 billion tons. The House bill creates two offset programs, with USDA overseeing domestic agriculture and forestry projects and EPA managing other domestic and international projects. Both bills have similar provisions in Title III and Title V. The provisions in Title III and Title V are similar in implementing agencies. Revised definitions of \"domestic offset credit\" and \"offset credit\" create separate offset jurisdictions between EPA and USDA. Changes allow domestic offset credits from Title V to be used for compliance under Title III, Part C. Questions arise about using Title V offsets for compliance under Title III, Part C. Initially, H.R. 2454 did not include certain agricultural and forestry offset projects, but Title V in the House-passed bill does include them. The House-passed bill includes an explicit list of offset practices for eligible agricultural and forestry projects that USDA will consider. The question remains whether USDA is required to specifically include the types of projects listed in the bill. The process under either Title III or Title V programs of H.R. 2454 would involve the implementing agency establishing a list of eligible project types. The implementing agency would establish a list of eligible project types and methodologies through a rulemaking process; offset project developers would submit a petition for approval; third-party verifiers would validate emission reductions and submit a report; relevant agencies would distribute offset credits based on verification. S. 1733 includes specific agricultural and forestry offset projects, but delegates domestic program authority to the President. The agriculture community supports replacing provisions in S. 1733 with those in S. 2729. The bill S. 2729 includes a different \"initial list\" and gives primary authority for the agricultural and forestry offsets program to USDA. It identifies specific projects for emission reductions, including non-agricultural projects under EPA's lead. The comparison in Appendix B shows eligible offset projects for consideration in the carbon offset program. The comparison of offset projects in H.R. 2454, S. 2729, and S. 1733 for the proposed carbon offset program includes conservation and farmland management practices that reduce GHG emissions. These practices are part of existing agricultural and forestry programs at federal and state levels, including programs in the 2008 \"farm bill\" (P.L. 110-246). These programs, such as the Conservation Reserve Program and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, offer technical assistance for implementing carbon offset projects. The 2008 farm bill programs, including the Conservation Stewardship Program, provide assistance for land retirement and agricultural practices that reduce GHG emissions. Other programs in the Energy and Rural Development titles offer support for energy efficiency and renewable energy systems. This differs from some climate change initiatives in the US. The United States has various climate change initiatives like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the Western Climate Initiative, and California's climate change statute, which focus on specific agricultural and forestry activities. These programs include provisions for early offset supply to reward early actors in the agricultural and forestry sectors participating in voluntary carbon market programs. The three bills (H.R. 2454, S. 1733, and S. 2729) address offsetting GHG emissions from projects starting after January 1, 2001. S. 2729 gives EPA and USDA authority to approve existing offset programs, providing more flexibility compared to the other bills. It specifically addresses \"stackability\" in biologicial sequestration projects, allowing practices to reduce GHGs and enhance ecosystem services. Proponents of \"stackability\" argue that offset project developers should be able to market ecosystem services separately to earn distinct financial benefits. USDA has recognized the potential credits generated by conservation programs and has removed any claim on the credits through recent changes to program rules. However, allowing stackable benefits may raise concerns of additionality. Incentive programs or ecosystem service markets can provide financial support for offset projects, but questions may arise about additionality. Additionality assessment can be complex, as some projects may not be economically viable without multiple funding sources. Determining additionality may involve subjectivity, especially when combining offset market payments with grants from government programs. GHG emissions from covered sources remain in the atmosphere on a relatively permanent basis. Recent cap-and-trade proposals have required offsets to be permanent, presenting challenges in monitoring permanence, especially in international projects. Concerns arise about reversals in emission offsets due to human activity or natural occurrences, particularly in forestry projects. Recent cap-and-trade proposals have introduced measures to address permanence concerns in offset projects. One approach is to establish an offsets reserve to cover losses from reversals, with credits set aside based on project risk. Another method is to allow temporary offset credits that expire and need to be replaced. These strategies aim to ensure the integrity of offset projects in the face of potential reversals. Senator Stabenow's bill, S. 2729, includes provisions for the Carbon Conservation Program for farmers to reduce GHG emissions and funding for climate-related research in agriculture. The program, jointly administered by USDA and the Department of the Interior, incentivizes projects that reduce emissions or sequester carbon. The bill includes provisions for a Carbon Conservation Program to incentivize projects that reduce GHG emissions or sequester carbon. Funding would be provided through a Carbon Conservation Fund for research and demonstration projects related to carbon sequestration and emission reduction in agriculture and forestry practices. The House-passed bill (H.R. 2454) and the Senate-reported bill (S. 1733) aim to address deforestation, which contributes to about 17% of all GHG emissions. Both bills include provisions for international forest protection through allowances and REDD offsets to reduce tropical deforestation and achieve emissions reduction targets. Allowances can be used to build capacity in developing nations and supplement U.S. emissions reductions, while REDD offsets can be purchased by covered U.S. entities. Both H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 aim to address deforestation and achieve emissions reduction targets. Concerns persist about the capacity of developing countries to measure and enforce forest carbon sequestration. Both bills allow for capacity building but lack specifics on allocation of allowances. Concerns about REDD offsets include verification, additionality, permanence, and leakage issues. Some worry that REDD offsets may hinder technology development for reducing domestic carbon emissions and impede developing countries from committing to GHG reductions and growing low-carbon economies. For more details, refer to CRS Report R40990, International Forestry Issues in Climate Change Bills: Comparison of Provisions of S. 1733 and H.R. 2454. Both bills provide for renewable biomass and biofuels feedstock provisions related to agriculture and forestry activities, but differ in eligibility criteria. The provisions in the bills differ in eligibility criteria based on biomass definitions. EPA is revising the Renewable Fuel Standard program as required by EISA. New volume standards for biofuels are established, along with criteria for feedstocks and GHG thresholds. Concerns have been raised about certain areas of the proposed EPA rulemaking. The U.S. agricultural sector has concerns about the EPA rulemaking, specifically regarding the EISA biomass definition and the consideration of \"indirect land use\" effects for calculating GHG emissions from advanced biofuels. Legislation has been introduced to address these issues, and discussions have taken place in the House Agriculture Committee. H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 also contain language to address these concerns. H.R. 2409 proposes to change the EISA biomass definition to the 2008 farm bill definition, with alternate definitions of renewable biomass included in H.R. 2454 and S. 1733. The Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee has expressed concerns about the reliability of predicting how biofuel production will affect land use, which could limit the availability of new feedstocks. The House Agriculture Committee expressed concerns about the impact of biofuel production on land use, potentially limiting new feedstock availability. Legislation such as H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 includes provisions for studying international indirect land use change from biofuels. Senator Stabenow's bill, S. 2729, also addresses biofuel production and expands existing bioenergy programs. S. 2729 expands existing bioenergy programs and creates the \"Rural Clean Energy Resources Fund\" to fund carbon mitigation programs. EPA rulemakings on GHG emissions reporting and Clean Air Act response could impact U.S. agriculture. House and Senate energy and climate bills address related issues. EPA announced a final rule for mandatory GHG emissions reporting from large sources in the U.S. The EPA announced a final rule for mandatory GHG emissions reporting from large sources in the U.S., covering about 85% of the nation's emissions and applying to roughly 10,000 facilities. The rule only includes livestock facilities with a manure management system meeting or exceeding the reporting threshold of 25,000. The impact on the U.S. agriculture sector is not specifically identified in the bills. The EPA's final rule requires reporting of methane and nitrous oxide emissions from livestock facilities meeting specific animal population thresholds. Approximately 107 facilities will need to report under the rule, including operations using anaerobic digesters. Other agricultural categories like livestock digestion and rice cultivation are excluded from the rule. The EPA's final rule requires reporting of methane and nitrous oxide emissions from livestock facilities meeting specific animal population thresholds. Approximately 107 facilities will need to report under the rule, including operations using anaerobic digesters. The rule does not address emissions from certain food processing sectors. Facilities subject to reporting would report annually, starting in 2011. EPA has decided not to finalize the portion of the rule covering landfills and wastewater treatment. The EPA's final rule requires reporting of methane and nitrous oxide emissions from livestock facilities meeting specific animal population thresholds. Concerns in the agricultural sector arise from EPA's determination that GHG emissions from new motor vehicles contribute to climate change endangerment, potentially leading to regulations on GHG emissions in other sectors, including agriculture. EPA's 2008 ANPR has caused confusion about the impact on U.S. agriculture. The EPA's 2008 ANPR caused confusion in the agricultural sector regarding the potential impact of proposed regulations on GHG emissions. The ANPR did not recommend specific actions or propose a formal regulation for GHGs, including a \"cow tax\" on livestock operations. The discussion in the ANPR mentioned agricultural sources as background information on GHGs, similar to other sectors like electric utilities. The Title V permit program was discussed as a potential option to regulate GHG emissions, but agricultural sources were not singled out in this context. Some concerns exist about potential permit fees if EPA uses the permitting program in the CAA to regulate GHGs. EPA mentioned flexibility in setting fee schedules and suggested lower fees for GHGs compared to other pollutants. Uncertainty remains about the impact on the U.S. agricultural sectors, with proposed bills aiming to prevent EPA from imposing Title V operating permits. The House appropriations bill includes a provision to prevent EPA from requiring permits for GHGs from livestock production. This provision is similar to one in the FY2010 interim appropriations conference agreement."
