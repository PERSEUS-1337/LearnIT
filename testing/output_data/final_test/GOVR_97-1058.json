    "content": "Kazakhstan's path to democracy has been slow, with a constitution giving strong presidential powers. The legislature has limited control over the budget and cannot initiate constitutional changes. Most bills are proposed by the president, who can issue decrees if they are not passed within 30 days. The bicameral legislature includes the Majilis and the Senate, with a People's Assembly serving as a presidential forum. A law in 2000 granted the president post-retirement powers and immunity from prosecution. President Nazarbayev was reelected in 2005 with 91.1% of the votes in a five-man race. Economic growth, pension increases, and state wage hikes boosted his popularity. He promised democratic reforms and poverty relief, campaigning widely. Observers noted progress in the election but still fell short of being free and fair. The legislature approved constitutional changes in May 2007, including increasing the number of deputies, decreasing the president's term, and requiring a court order for detention. Nonreformist changes included a two-thirds vote to override presidential alterations and appointing deputies by the People's Assembly. Former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Boucher commented on the amendments in June 2007. In June 2007, Secretary of State Richard Boucher praised constitutional amendments in Kazakhstan, leading to an early Majilis election in August 2007. The ruling party, Nur-Otan, won all 98 seats with 88.05% of the votes, while other parties failed to meet the 7% threshold. Observers from the OSCE noted some positive aspects but criticized the election as not being free and fair. In 2009, the Azat (Freedom) Party and the National Social Democratic Party merged to increase electoral prospects, but the new party was not registered by the government. Legislation in May 2010 declared Nazarbayev as the \"Leader of the Nation\" with lifetime powers, including immunity from prosecution. Despite Nazarbayev's refusal to sign the bills into law, he did not formally veto them. In mid-June 2010, bills went into effect despite Nazarbayev's refusal to veto them. Supporters petitioned for a referendum to extend his term, which was criticized internationally. The legislature approved the referendum, but Nazarbayev vetoed it. The veto was overridden, but the Constitutional Council deemed the referendum illegitimate in January 2011. The Constitutional Council ruled against proposed constitutional changes for a referendum in January 2011. President Nazarbayev moved up the presidential election to April 3, 2011, causing opposition politicians to criticize the sudden election. Three candidates, besides the president, were able to register for the election, while others were unable to meet requirements or denied registration. The Kazakh Central Electoral Commission reported that 89.99% of 9.3 million voters turned out for the presidential election, with Nazarbayev reelected with 95.55% of the vote. OSCE monitors noted serious irregularities during voting, including ballot box stuffing and identical signatures on voter lists. The U.S. Embassy congratulated Nazarbayev on his reelection. Kazakhstan's President Nazarbayev issued a decree to dismiss the legislature and set early elections due to a perceived political crisis. The decision was influenced by concerns of a global economic downturn, terrorism, and rising popular discontent. The lower legislative chamber, Majilis, would have 107 seats, with 98 allocated through party list voting. Critics alleged that the government's preparation for an early election included hindering the political opposition, such as suspending the activities of the Communist Party and selecting a supporter of Nazarbayev as the head of the Ak Zhal Party. The January 15, 2012 election to the Majilis saw seven parties registered to run, with one party de-registered before the election. Over two dozen candidates were removed from party lists due to documentation issues, criticized by the OSCE. The campaign season opened amidst violent protests in Zhanaozen, resulting in martial law being declared. Rukhaniyat claimed it was blocked from participating in the election due to criticism of the security crackdown in Zhanaozen. The ruling Nur Otun Party won 80.99% of the votes and 83 seats, while Ak Zhol received 7.47% of the vote and 8 seats. The Communist People's Party received 7.19% of the vote and 7 seats. Other parties failed to win any seats. OSCE monitors judged the election did not meet fundamental principles. OSCE election monitors found significant irregularities in the election, including inadequate legal framework, restricted campaign exchange of views, and ballot box stuffing. President Nazarbayev criticized unnamed countries in the OSCE for using election monitoring to pressure others. In early 2012, OSCE election monitors reported irregularities in Kazakhstan's election. Following the election, government arrests and harassment of journalists and opposition politicians increased. The European Parliament condemned the incarceration of opposition figures and urged reforms to ensure free elections and press freedom. The resolution condemned the violent crackdown on demonstrators in Zhanaozen and called for an independent investigation. Journalist Lukpan Akhmedyarov was attacked in western Kazakhstan, allegedly by attackers linked to local officials. In October 2012, an appeal was made for the U.S. government to deny visas to Kazakh officials involved in the violence. In November 2012, an appeals court upheld the 7.5 year prison sentence of Vladimir Kozlov, head of the Alga opposition party, for organizing the Zhanaozen riots. The U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE raised concerns about the trial's irregularities, casting doubts on Kazakhstan's respect for human rights and the rule of law. In December 2012, the Alga Party was banned as an extremist organization by the Almaty district court, along with the closure of most opposition media for allegedly undermining national security. A new holiday called \"Day of the First President\" was established to celebrate President Nazarbayev's rule, sparking speculation about further consolidation of power. In mid-December 2012, President Nazarbayev announced plans for the election of district and village executive heads in 2013, with the possibility of later electing regional governors. He praised Russia's political succession as a \"democratic\" example for Kazakhstan to follow. Kazakhstan's stance on terrorism shifted in late 2003 with the establishment of an Anti-Terrorist Center. In late 2004, Kazakh authorities apprehended members of the Islamic Jihad Group/Union of Uzbekistan with alleged ties to Al Qaeda. In subsequent years, arrests were made for involvement with banned groups like Hizb ut-Tahrir and Salafi Jihadi Jamaat, with some individuals sentenced for planning attacks. The government reported preventing multiple terrorist attacks in 2008 and 2009. In 2011, Kazakhstan experienced several terrorist attacks, including suicide bombings and car bombings in different cities. President Nazarbayev made changes to the law on religion in response to the attacks. Two explosions occurred in Atyrau, followed by the killing of two police officers in Almaty. In response to a series of terrorist attacks in 2011, Kazakhstan experienced bombings in Atyrau and police officer killings in Almaty. The Jund al-Khilafah claimed responsibility for the attacks and was later banned as a terrorist organization by Kazakhstan. In April 2012, 47 alleged members of Jund al-Khilafah were sentenced for attacks on U.S. forces in Afghanistan. In December 2011, violent clashes in Zhanaozen, Kazakhstan resulted in 16 deaths. President Nursultan Nazarbayev declared a state of emergency and sent military forces to the region. In response to violent clashes in Zhanaozen, Kazakhstan in December 2011, President Nursultan Nazarbayev declared a state of emergency, sent military forces to the region, and took actions against those involved in the unrest. In late March 2012, a trial began for 37 individuals linked to the Zhanaozen riot, mostly workers and youths accused of starting the violence. Human Rights Watch called for the trial to be halted due to allegations of torture. By June 2012, half of the defendants received 3-7 years in prison, while others got suspended sentences or were acquitted. Another trial of 12 suspects resulted in 4 convictions and the rest being acquitted or pardoned. The Kazakh government claimed to have punished some police officers and officials for their actions during the riot. President Nazarbayev criticized police for not preventing terrorism and acknowledged the pressure from radical groups. Over 300 individuals have been convicted of terrorism in Kazakhstan since 2005. In July 2012, a policeman was killed in Almaty, leading to a gun battle with alleged terrorists. In mid-August 2012, a gun battle in Almaty resulted in the deaths of alleged terrorists linked to previous explosions and killings. In September, a bomb-maker blew himself up in Atyrau Region, leading to a gun battle that killed five more suspects. In October, three individuals were arrested for funding the Islamic Jihad Union. Observers warned of a revival of terrorist actions in Kazakhstan. In November 2012, Nazarbayev called for tightening legislation to combat terrorism in Kazakhstan, citing increasing radicalization and terrorist incidents. The bill, passed in January 2013, expanded the definition of terrorism to include acts aimed at influencing the government through violence. In February 2013, the National Security Committee reported preventing 35 extremist actions and neutralizing 42 groups in 2011-2012, but failing to avert 18 actions, including 7 explosions. Six alleged terrorists were put on trial in May 2013. In May 2013, six alleged terrorists were put on trial for conspiring to commit robberies, bomb civic sites, and assassinate senior officials in Kazakhstan. The prosecutor claimed they aimed to establish an Islamic caliphate. Kazakh authorities are drafting a program to counter religious extremism and terrorism, which may increase monitoring of religious groups and restrict dissemination of religious literature. Assistant Secretary Blake stated in February 2013 that there is no imminent Islamist militant threat to Central Asian states, but the US provides security assistance. According to Human Rights Watch, Kazakhstan's human rights record deteriorated in 2012 with allegations of torture, restrictions on religious freedoms, tight control over media, and limitations on workers' rights. The U.S. State Department did not report any improvement in Kazakhstan's human rights record in 2012. The Kazakh government's human rights record showed some improvement, but ongoing problems persisted. Key issues included restrictions on freedom of speech, assembly, religion, and legal due process. Police were accused of torturing detainees for confessions, while opponents and critics were frequently arrested. Judges and prosecutors were alleged to solicit bribes for favorable rulings in criminal cases, particularly in politically motivated trials. Vladimir Kozlov, leader of the opposition party Alga, was convicted without evidence linking him to the charges. The government in the country where the individual was convicted controlled the media, limited freedom of expression, and influenced privately owned media outlets through various means. Judicial actions against journalists and media outlets, including libel suits, led to self-censorship and the suspension of media outlets. NGOs reported an increase in libel suits in 2012. In 2012, Almaty courts banned opposition media outlets for inciting social discord and calling for the overthrow of the constitutional order. The law criminalizes releasing information about the president's health, finances, or private life, as well as strategic economic information. Minister of Culture and Information stated that unofficial reports or negative interpretations of official information would be banned during emergencies. Despite restrictions, some media criticism of government policies continued. There were significant restrictions on freedom of association and assembly. The law in Kazakhstan restricts freedom of association and assembly, defining national security threats to include unsanctioned public gatherings. Authorities rarely approve demonstration requests and use force to disrupt peaceful protests. The government faces issues of violence against women, discrimination against non-ethnic Kazakhs, persons with disabilities, and the LGBT community. While the government generally respects religious freedom, it refuses to register some minority religious groups and harasses them through fines and raids. The Kazakh government implemented a 2011 religion law that denied legal status to some religious groups like Scientologists, the Unification Church, and Ahmadi Muslims. Kazakhstan was reported as a destination for sex trafficking and forced labor. The government made efforts to combat trafficking but officials were involved in it. In late January 2013, the prosecutor-general complained to President Nazarbayev about judges acquitting individuals despite prosecutors proving their guilt. President Nazarbayev ordered an investigation into possible corruption in the acquittals. In March 2013, Kazakh NGOs reported that the government had largely failed to fulfill a National Human Rights Action Plan for 2009-2012. The U.S. raised concerns about Kazakhstan's religious legislation restricting rights of non-traditional religious communities. President Nazarbayev claimed religious freedom was ensured, while the European Parliament criticized human rights deterioration since the Zhanaozen incident. The resolution strongly criticized court decisions banning the Alga Party and independent media, urged the release of political prisoners, and called for easing restrictions on religion. President Nazarbayev mentioned the progress of democracy in Kazakhstan and stated that no one has the right to dictate how the country should be run. British Prime Minister David Cameron discussed human rights issues with Nazarbayev during a visit. Kazakhstan's President highlighted the presence of three political parties in parliament, a working opposition, and 3,300 mass media outlets. He emphasized the long-term process of building democracy and human rights, citing the UK's historical timeline. Amnesty International criticized high levels of torture and lack of prosecutions for detainees. Kazakhstan was set to hold the OSCE chairmanship in 2010, with pledges to enact human rights reforms. President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan pledged human rights reforms before assuming the OSCE chairmanship, ensuring NGO participation and preserving ODIHR's mandate. He outlined plans for integration into Europe in various sectors. Progress on these pledges was deemed mixed, with approved changes to media, election, and political party laws in early 2009. In early 2009, Kazakhstan made changes to media, election, and political party laws. Political parties with less than 7% of votes could still participate in legislative affairs. The number of signatures needed to register a party was reduced to 40,000. A positive move was the constitutional court striking down a law restricting religious freedom in 2009. However, a restrictive religion law was passed in 2011. In April 2009, a national human rights action plan was created and presented to the OSCE. In July 2009, media laws were tightened, limiting Internet access and banning media that interfered with election campaigns. Kazakhstan assumed the chairmanship of the OSCE in 2010, focusing on military/security, democratic/human rights, and economic/environmental issues. They emphasized nuclear disarmament, European security dialogue, protracted conflicts in the former Soviet Union, and initiatives regarding Afghanistan. At an informal OSCE foreign ministerial meeting in Almaty in July 2010, an agreement was reached to hold an OSCE summit on December 1-2, 2010, in Astana. Kazakhstan strongly urged the summit to \"modernize\" OSCE activities. The United States had concerns but received assurances that the summit would address substantive issues of interest, including enhancing efforts in Afghanistan. The United States emphasized the need to reestablish an OSCE Mission in Georgia, empower ODIHR to monitor elections better, and strengthen the powers of the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media during preparations for the OSCE summit in Astana. They also opposed the idea of new treaties or institutions for European security proposed by Russia. The United States criticized Kazakhstan for excluding civil society representatives from a conference in Poland. The OSCE Summit in Astana fell short of goals, with no agreement on an action plan but a declaration towards a Security Community. Progress was seen in Afghanistan's security and democracy, but there were clashes between the US and Russia over Georgia's territorial integrity and Russia's troop withdrawal from Moldova. The Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict remained unresolved. The United States criticized Kazakhstan for excluding civil society representatives from a conference in Poland. The OSCE Summit in Astana did not reach an agreement on an action plan but called for a settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. Kazakhstan, a major regional exporter of oil, gas, and wheat, aims to become one of the top 50 developed countries by 2030. President Nazarbayev launched a plan in 1997 for economic development and security. President Nazarbayev aims to bring Kazakhstan into the top 50 developed countries within 10 years. He launched a plan for industrial diversification in 2010 and emphasized developing key sectors like transport, pharmaceuticals, and telecommunications. By 2012, Kazakhstan was on track to achieve its goals, with plans to become one of the world's 30 most developed countries by 2050, focusing on security, education, and natural resources. In 2008, Kazakhstan faced economic challenges due to tightening credit and collapsing real estate market. President Nazarbayev implemented an anti-crisis plan involving tax cuts and utilizing the National Oil Fund to stabilize the economy. The devaluation of the tenge in 2009 and declining oil revenues led to slow GDP growth of 1.2%. In 2009, Kazakhstan's GDP grew by only 1.2%, the slowest since 1998. Growth rebounded in 2010-2011 but slowed to 4.9% in 2012 due to declines in oil and agricultural output. Inflation decreased to 5.1% in 2012. The government increased social spending and employment programs following labor-related violence in Zhanaozen. Kazakhstan's GDP in 2012 was 56.9% from services, 37.9% from energy and industrial production, and 5.2% from agriculture. The country is a major exporter of oil, gas, and uranium. The US exported $882.5 million to Kazakhstan and imported $1.57 billion in 2012. In 2012, U.S. exports to Kazakhstan were mainly machinery and transport equipment, while imports included oil, metals, and chemicals. The largest contributor of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Kazakhstan was the Netherlands, followed by the United Kingdom, China, and the United States. U.S. FDI has historically been in the oil, gas, and mining sectors. American companies like Boeing, GE, and FedEx have operations in Kazakhstan. The IMF recommended strengthening bank supervision and extending tax exemptions for banks in Kazakhstan. The IMF mission recommended Kazakhstan to enhance bank supervision, extend tax exemptions, and diversify the economy by reducing the state's role and improving human capital and institutions. It advised against further budget cuts in 2013 and estimated GDP growth to be around 5% due to weaknesses in the mining sector. In 2013, Kazakhstan's growth is expected to be around 5%, with weaknesses in the mining sector affecting the economy. The country aims to improve its business climate, reduce corruption, and join the World Trade Organization in 2014. Kazakhstan has significant oil and gas reserves, with plans for bilateral agreements with trading partners. Kazakhstan has significant oil reserves, accounting for about 2% of world reserves, and 45.7 trillion cubic feet of proven gas reserves, less than 1% of global reserves. Major onshore oil fields include Tengiz, Karachaganak, Aktobe, Mangistau, and Uzen, while offshore fields in the Caspian Sea like Kashagan and Kurmangazy hold at least 14 billion barrels of recoverable reserves. The country's development goals heavily rely on increasing oil and gas production for government revenues and GDP growth, with a focus on expanding production at key oil fields like Tengiz and Karachaganak. Kashagan, discovered in 2000, has faced challenges in production. Development of the Kashagan oil field began in 2000 but has faced delays and cost overruns due to the harsh environment, high pressure, and sulfur content of the oil. Kazakhstan directed the transfer of ConocoPhillips' stake to CNPC in 2013. Other members of the consortium include Eni, Shell, ExxonMobil, Total, KazMunaiGaz, and Inpex. Phase one production is at 180,000 bpd, with plans to increase to 370,000. Phase one experimental/industrial production at the Kashagan oil field, led by Japan's Inpex, is expected to start at 180,000 bpd, with plans to increase to 370,000 bpd by the end of 2013 or early 2014. The developmental cost for Phase one has reached $46 billion, raising concerns about the feasibility of further development for potential production of up to 1.5 million bpd. President Nazarbayev's reshuffling of energy officials in mid-2013 reflects dissatisfaction over production delays at Kashagan. Some foreign investors have been discouraged by harsh government terms and alleged corruption within the ruling elite. In 2009, the Kazakh government pressured the Karachaganak Petroleum Operating consortium to give up 10% of its shares, imposing hefty fines and export duties when faced with resistance. After international arbitration, KPO agreed to transfer the shares to the government in exchange for lifting most fines. The Kazakh government pressured the Karachaganak Petroleum Operating consortium to give up 10% of its shares in 2009, leading to fines and duties. Kazakhstan's main oil export route is a 930-mile pipeline owned by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, carrying oil to Russia's Black Sea port. President Nazarbayev signed a treaty in 2006 to barge Kazakh oil across the Caspian Sea to the BTC pipeline in Baku. In June 2006, Kazakhstan signed a treaty to transport oil across the Caspian Sea to the BTC pipeline in Baku. President Nazarbayev visited Azerbaijan in September 2009 to discuss shipping up to 500,000 bpd of oil from the Kashagan field through the BTC or Baku-Supsa pipeline. Plans for a trans-Caspian pipeline were considered if volumes exceeded 500,000 bpd. Kazakhstan also upgraded its Caspian Sea port facilities to facilitate oil exports. Kazakhstan acquired full ownership of the Batumi oil terminal in 2008 and started transporting oil to Romania for processing. Plans were in place to increase the capacity of the CPC oil pipeline to accommodate production from various oil fields. Kazakhstan also explored oil export routes to Europe, including through China. In 2009, Kazakhstan and China completed an oil pipeline from Atyrau to Xinjiang, initially carrying 200,000 bpd to China. Some Russian oil has been transported through this pipeline, marking the first Russian oil to be transported to China. Kazakhstan exports gas to Russia through the Central Asia-Center gas pipeline network. Kazakhstan also completed its sections of the Central Asia-China gas pipeline in 2009-2010. Plans were made for a gas pipeline from Beyneu to Shymkent, connecting to the Central Asia-China gas pipeline, initially supplying gas to southern Kazakhstan and China. The pipeline construction began in September 2011 to supply gas to southern Kazakhstan and China. Kazakh officials have made contradictory statements about providing gas for European customers via a possible trans-Caspian pipeline. President Nazarbayev supported the transit of Kazakh gas through Turkey in 2009. Minister of Oil and Gas Sauat Mynabyev stated in 2011 that they do not have available resources for the gas pipeline yet. President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan has pursued close ties with Turkey, Iran, and China, while also maintaining relations with Russia and other CIS members for economic and security reasons. Complicated relations exist between Kazakhstan and China due to the presence of ethnic Kazakhs and Uighurs in both countries. Kazakhstan and Russia have signed various agreements, including a friendship treaty, settling Caspian seabed claims, and border delineation. In late 2005, the Central Asian Cooperation Organization merged with the Eurasian Economic Community (Eurasec; Russia and Kazakhstan belonged to both). Eurasec members Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan launched a Customs Union in July 2010. President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan has close relations with Russia, China, the EU, and the United States, and supports deeper regional economic integration through the Customs Union. Some in Kazakhstan have concerns about potential harm to the country's sovereignty from these integration efforts. Kazakhstan's concerns about sovereignty in relation to integration efforts with Russia include President Nazarbayev's push for the use of the Latin script and English, as well as a threat to withdraw from any union that threatens sovereignty. There is also tension over the lease of the Baikonur Cosmodrome to Russia, with Kazakhstan seeking to renegotiate the agreement. Kazakhstan has concerns about sovereignty in integration with Russia, including language issues and the Baikonur Cosmodrome lease. Kazakhstan reaffirmed military treaties with CIS and CSTO, and is a member of the SCO. Kazakhstan relies on Russia for military support but has expanded defense cooperation with other states. The country has various military branches and special forces. Kazakhstan is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and joined NATO's Partnership for Peace (PFP) in 1994. Their military doctrine focuses on internal and intra-regional threats, emphasizing modernization of armed forces and creating volunteer armed forces. The doctrine aims to combat terrorism and separatism, while also addressing external threats from Afghanistan. The military reforms in Kazakhstan aim to create a powerful armed forces with a brigade-based structure, improved social support for troops, and modernization of defense industries. The Defense Minister completed restructuring high commands to establish a small, mobile, combat-capable army. The new military procurement concept includes modernizing industries, purchasing foreign weaponry, and focusing on command, control, and communications technologies. The Spassk Combat Training and Combat Use Center was also opened. The Spassk Combat Training and Combat Use Center in Kazakhstan was opened in 2010 to train junior officers and male civilians of draft age in military skills. Following the Zhanaozen violence, there was a reported increase in military procurement for airlift capabilities and redeployment of troops to southwestern Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan also launched a program to strengthen its Caspian Sea naval presence by acquiring anti-ship missiles and a domestically built patrol boat. Additionally, the country purchased C-295 aircraft from France and established a helicopter assembly facility in a joint venture with a Dutch-registered company. Kazakhstan has engaged in various military modernization initiatives, including partnerships with defense firms in different countries to build helicopters, armored personnel carriers, repair aircraft, manufacture sensors, and build radars. Following the removal of nuclear weapons to Russia, Kazakhstan announced its nuclear weapons-free status in 1995 with the assistance of the U.S. Comprehensive Threat Reduction program. The U.S. Nuclear Risk Reduction Center continues to work with Kazakhstan on control and elimination of nuclear materials and former chemical and biological warfare facilities. The U.S. Nuclear Risk Reduction Center collaborates with Kazakhstan to ensure compliance with arms control agreements and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Recent cooperation includes the construction of a Central Laboratory to secure dangerous pathogens. U.S. assistance to Kazakhstan, totaling over $1.0 billion from FY1992 to FY2010, focuses on combating WMDs. President Obama and Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev pledged to enhance bilateral cooperation in nuclear safety, nonproliferation, regional stability, economic prosperity, and universal values. President Obama praised Kazakhstan for its efforts in securing nuclear materials inherited from the former Soviet Union. U.S. relations with Kazakhstan intensified after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, with a focus on ties with Uzbekistan initially. Kazakhstan agreed to facilitate U.S. military air flights to Afghanistan, and President Obama encouraged the country to fully implement its National Human Rights Action Plan. After Uzbekistan closed the U.S. airbase in mid-2005, U.S. policy attention shifted to Kazakhstan as a significant partner in the region. Kazakhstan's economic development and closer ties with China have led to somewhat less priority on U.S. relations. Despite this shift, Kazakhstan remains important to U.S. interests as a prominent economic and political power in the region. The Obama Administration's strategic aim in Kazakhstan is to ensure the country's development as a stable partner. The Obama Administration's strategic aim in Kazakhstan is to ensure the country's development as a stable, secure, democratic, and prosperous partner that respects international standards and agreements. U.S. government aid for FY2014 will focus on programs supporting Kazakhstan's evolution into a stronger partner promoting regional stability and economic integration. President Nazarbayev's commitments to the rule of law, human rights, and economic reform were recognized in a Charter on Democratic Partnership signed during his visits to the U.S. in 1994, 2001, and 2006. During visits in 2001 and 2006, Nazarbayev pledged cooperation on energy resources with the US. Annual meetings in 2012 outlined an action plan for the next two years. The Obama Administration initiated bilateral consultations on economic and political issues with Kazakhstan. The US agreed to support Kazakhstan in attracting American companies and universities to the Innovative Technologies Park. The State Department elevated relations with Kazakhstan to a strategic partnership dialogue by transforming the ABC into a Strategic Partnership Commission (SPC) in 2012. The SPC established working groups on non-proliferation, economic cooperation, and science and technology. A \"human dimension dialogue\" on civil and human rights was also held. Separate bilateral groups on nuclear material safeguards, science and technology cooperation, and trade and investment were established by separate accords. No agreements were signed at the second SPC meeting in July 2013. In 2013, no agreements were signed at the second SPC meeting between the U.S. and Kazakhstan. Pledges were made to assist Kazakhstan in obtaining WTO membership and to increase trade and investment. President Obama met with President Nazarbayev at nuclear security summits in 2010 and 2012. A Consulate General was opened in Almaty in 2010, signaling the Obama Administration's interest in Kazakhstan. Assistant Secretary Blake emphasized the deep and broad relations with Kazakhstan during a visit in 2012. Kazakhstan is actively involved in regional integration and important issues like non-proliferation. The U.S. has a strong partnership with Kazakhstan, highlighted by growing trade relations and Kazakhstan's assistance in Afghanistan. However, concerns remain about human rights violations and the government's use of force in quelling unrest. U.S. aid continues to support democratization efforts in Kazakhstan. The U.S. has provided significant aid to Kazakhstan, totaling $2.05 billion from 1992 to 2010, with a focus on Comprehensive Threat Reduction programs. Aid for FY2011 was $17.6 million, FY2012 was $19.3 million, and the requested amount for FY2014 is $12.2 million. The U.S. government plans to scale down funding levels in FY2014 due to Kazakhstan's progress as a stable, secure, democratic, and prosperous partner. The U.S. government plans to reduce funding levels in FY2014 for security programs, economic support, and democracy support in Kazakhstan. This includes programs such as Foreign Military Financing, International Military Education and Training, and democracy support to strengthen judicial independence and human rights. U.S. defense cooperation has included participation in military exercises in Kazakhstan. In July 2012, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus met with Kazakhstan's Defense Minister Dzhaksybekev to discuss defense cooperation achievements from 2008-2012 and draft a new 2013-2017 plan. Congressional actions in FY2003 prohibited assistance to Kazakhstan unless human rights improved, but waivers were possible for national security reasons. Since FY2005, the Secretary of State has reported to Congress that Kazakhstan has failed to improve its human rights record, but aid restrictions have been waived on national security grounds. Kazakhstan supported the coalition in disarming Iraq due to concerns about weapons of mass destruction. Kazakh troops trained Iraqis in de-mining and water purification before withdrawing in 2008. President Nazarbayev warned about the Taliban in Afghanistan in June 2001. In late 2008, Kazakhstan signed a military cooperation agreement with the U.S. to combat terrorism, develop peacekeeping forces, and enhance security in the Caspian Sea. Kazakhstan also allowed NATO countries to begin rail shipments of nonlethal supplies in early 2009 to support international security operations. In April 2010, a U.S.-Kazakh accord was brokered for military over-flight rights. U.S. military purchases of local goods and transit fees to regional states amount to hundreds of millions annually. In October 2010, Kazakhstan and NATO agreed to detail four Kazakh officers to ISAF headquarters. In May 2011, the Majlis approved the deployment despite recent bombings in Aktobe and Astana. In April 2010, a U.S.-Kazakh accord was brokered for military over-flight rights and U.S. military purchases of local goods. In October 2010, Kazakhstan and NATO agreed to detail four Kazakh officers to ISAF headquarters. In May 2011, the Majlis approved the deployment despite recent bombings in Aktobe and Astana. The Taliban warned against the deployment, leading to a policy change by the Kazakh government. The Kazakh Foreign Ministry later announced the agreement became irrelevant due to ISAF's withdrawal from Afghanistan. NATO Secretary-General announced Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan agreed to allow reverse transit of cargoes out of Afghanistan. At the \"Istanbul Process\" conference in Kabul, Kazakhstan pledged support for post-2014 Afghanistan in disaster management, counter-narcotics, business, and education. They aim to increase Afghan students receiving education in Kazakhstan and advocate for the increased use of their Caspian seaport at Aktau for transporting containers to and from Afghanistan."
