    "content": "The \"Federal Land Assistance, Management and Enhancement Act\" or \"FLAME Act\" includes provisions for a Flame Fund for catastrophic emergency wildland fire suppression activities, a cohesive wildland fire management strategy, a review of certain wildfires for cost containment evaluation, and reducing the risk of wildfires in fire-ready communities. The Flame Fund, established by the FLAME Act, is defined as a fund for catastrophic emergency wildland fire suppression activities on Federal land, including public lands, National Park System units, National Wildlife Refuge System refuges, lands held in trust for Indian tribes, and lands in the National Forest System. The Flame Fund, established by the FLAME Act, is a fund for catastrophic emergency wildland fire suppression activities on Federal land. The Land Assistance, Management, and Enhancement Fund is established by this section, with the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture acting jointly. The Flame Fund consists of appropriated and transferred amounts for catastrophic emergency wildland fire suppression activities. The fund is available to pay for separate fire suppression costs beyond the annual workload predictions based on historical and anticipated workloads. Authorization of Appropriations for the Flame Fund is provided, with the intent that funding for wildland fire suppression activities should equal the average amount spent over the previous five fiscal years. Congress also acknowledges that additional appropriations above the ten-year average for fire suppression should be considered emergency requirements. The Department of the Interior should receive adjusted amounts to meet emergency needs, not counted for certain budget purposes. Secretaries must notify committees when Flame Fund funding is low. Excess wildland fire suppression funds are transferred to the Flame Fund annually. The Flame Fund is used for wildland fire suppression activities.

In the case of a firefighting season, funds are transferred to the Secretary concerned for necessary wildland fire suppression activities associated with the declared emergency on state, private, and tribal land. The Flame Fund is used for wildland fire suppression activities on State, private, and tribal land, following existing agreements. The fund supplements agency budgets for anticipated and predicted activities, with a prohibition on other transfers.

The Secretaries must establish an accounting and reporting system for the fund and submit an annual report on its use to specific committees, including any recommendations for improving administrative control and oversight. The annual report must be made available to the public. SEC. 3. COHESIVE WILDLAND FIRE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture must submit a report to Congress within one year of the enactment of this Act, outlining a cohesive wildland fire management strategy. This strategy should address cost-effective resource allocation, reinvestment in non-fire programs, and appropriate management response. The Secretary of Agriculture must ensure that owners of adjacent private land are notified before any prescribed fire is used on National Forest System land. This is part of the cohesive wildland fire management strategy required by the Act, which includes cost-effective resource allocation and prioritizing fuels reduction projects. SEC. 4 requires a review of wildfires incurring expenses over $10,000,000, with reports submitted to specific committees. SEC. 5 focuses on reducing wildfire risk in fire-ready communities. A \"fire-ready community\" is defined as a community located in a priority area with a cooperative fire agreement, local codes for fire-resistant home design, a community wildfire protection plan, and engaged in a collaborative process. The resource advisory committee established under the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 will develop regional maps of communities at risk of wildfire for hazardous fuel treatment. Priority areas include at-risk communities in fire-prone areas, watersheds, municipal drinking water sources, and emergency evacuation corridors. Local Wildland Firefighting Capability Grants are available for fire-ready communities to assist with education programs, training for firefighters, and equipment acquisition for wildland fire preparedness. Grants can be used for activities such as raising awareness about fire protection practices, training local firefighters, and acquiring equipment. Implementation of a community wildfire protection plan and encouraging fire-ready communities through cost-share agreements with State Foresters. Authorization of appropriations for Secretaries to carry out necessary actions. Passed the House of Representatives on July 9, 2008, attested by LORRAINE C. MILLER, Clerk."
