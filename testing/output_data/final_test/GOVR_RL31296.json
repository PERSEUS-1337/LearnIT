    "content": "U.S. industries, including agricultural producers, can seek relief through trade remedies to counter the economic effects of imports sold at unfairly low prices or benefiting from foreign subsidies. Trade relief helps mitigate negative impacts of trade liberalization on import-sensitive products, building political support for trade agreements. U.S. trade remedy laws align with international trade rules, particularly those of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The curr_chunk discusses how U.S. producers can utilize WTO and NAFTA rules to challenge or validate actions taken under trade remedy laws. They can resolve trade issues through consultative means before escalating into formal disputes. The curr_chunk explains how U.S. agriculture sectors have sought import relief in recent years through complex trade remedy procedures. Federal law provides four primary trade remedies, including safeguards, antidumping duties, countervailing duties, and Section 301 to challenge unfair foreign trade practices affecting U.S. commerce. The Trade Act of 1974 allows for temporary duties, quotas, or restrictions on imports causing injury to domestic industries. The U.S. International Trade Commission determines injury and safeguard cases can be initiated by various parties. Unlike antidumping and countervailing duty cases, safeguard cases cover imports from worldwide sources. The Trade Act of 1974 allows for temporary duties, quotas, or restrictions on imports causing injury to domestic industries. The U.S. International Trade Commission considers economic factors and industry conditions to recommend remedial measures, such as increased tariffs or quotas, to the President for a decision on import restrictions. The President can impose safeguards on imports causing injury to domestic industries for up to 8 years, following recommendations from the ITC. Congress can intervene if the President deviates from ITC recommendations. Safeguards must comply with the WTO Agreement on Safeguards. Rules for the application of Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT, 1947) provide transparency and limitations on relief measures. A WTO member country cannot retaliate during the first 3 years of a safeguard, if it resulted from increased imports and complies with the Agreement. NAFTA obligations also impact safeguards with Canada and Mexico, limiting relief measures to three years. The NAFTA Implementation Act states relief actions do not apply to imports from Canada or Mexico unless they make up a significant portion of total imports. The CVD law allows for countervailing duties on imports if a subsidy is provided by a foreign government and is causing harm to a U.S. industry. This law aims to offset any unfair advantage foreign manufacturers may have. Antidumping duties can also be imposed if an imported product is sold below fair value. Dumping is a form of price discrimination where goods are sold at lower prices in one export market compared to the home market or other export markets. CVD and AD laws target unfair trade practices and can be initiated by the DOC or interested parties such as manufacturers, unions, or trade associations. Petitions are filed with both the DOC and the ITC for investigation. The DOC and ITC receive petitions for investigations on imports of specific products from certain countries. The ITC determines if imports are causing harm to the industry, allowing the investigation to proceed. The DOC then assesses dumping or subsidies, making preliminary and final determinations on duty margins. If the DOC's final determination is negative, the investigation is terminated. The DOC and ITC make final determinations on duty margins. If both determinations are affirmative, extra duties are imposed on imports. Determinations can be challenged in judicial review or the WTO dispute settlement mechanism. DOC considers direct or upstream subsidies in CVD cases, while in AD cases, it determines the \"normal.\" In anti-dumping cases, the DOC determines the \"normal value\" of imports and compares it to the actual price to calculate the dumping margin. The ITC assesses if the domestic industry is being harmed and if imports are causing the harm. Time frames are set for agencies to make determinations in line with trade agreements. During the Tokyo Round of trade negotiations, the United States signed agreements on subsidies and countervailing measures, which included improved procedures for dispute settlement and application of remedial measures. Countries could impose countervailing duties to offset subsidies if domestic industries were materially injured by subsidized imports. The Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures from the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations expands on the Tokyo Round Subsidies Code, providing definitions for terms like subsidies and serious prejudice. It prohibits export subsidies using domestic instead of imported goods, requires developing countries to phase out certain subsidies, and utilizes the WTO dispute settlement mechanism in countervailing and antidumping cases. NAFTA's Chapter 19 allows for final determinations in cases involving another member's goods. Chapter 19 of NAFTA allows for final determinations in cases involving another member's goods to be reviewed by binational panels. Article 13 of the URAA, known as the peace clause, prohibits challenging certain agricultural subsidy programs in domestic countervailing duty proceedings from 1995 to 2003. This clause also applies to other WTO dispute settlement proceedings related to adverse effects or non-violation nullification and impairment of benefits actions. Article 13 of the URAA addresses challenges to domestic support measures outside the \"green box\" and export subsidies. Title III of the Trade Act of 1974, also known as \"Section 301,\" enforces U.S. rights under international trade agreements and responds to unfair foreign trade practices. The USTR has the authority to take action if a foreign act, policy, or practice violates a trade agreement or restricts U.S. commerce. This can include imposing duties or import restrictions, withdrawing trade benefits, or entering into agreements to eliminate unfair practices. Under Section 301, the USTR can take action to eliminate foreign acts, policies, or practices that harm U.S. commerce. Interested parties can file petitions for investigations, which may lead to consultations with the foreign country involved. The USTR can resort to dispute settlement procedures if consultations with a foreign country do not resolve issues related to trade agreements. Sections 301-309 in U.S. law allow for retaliatory action, including import restrictions, to enforce U.S. rights against violations of trade agreements and unfair foreign trade practices. The U.S. has various mechanisms to address trade issues, including import relief measures like Section 22 and the Meat Import Act. NAFTA and WTO agreements exempt member countries from Section 22 restrictions, converting them into tariff-rate quotas. The USTR can resort to dispute settlement procedures and retaliatory actions under Sections 301-309 of U.S. law to enforce trade agreements and combat unfair trade practices. The URAA replaced previous meat import restrictions with a TRQ system, giving agricultural industries flexibility in choosing import relief remedies based on causation and injury standards. Section 201 requires imports to be a \"substantial\" cause of or threat of \"serious injury.\" The URAA replaced previous meat import restrictions with a TRQ system, giving agricultural industries flexibility in choosing import relief remedies based on causation and injury standards. Section 201 requires imports to be a \"substantial\" cause of or threat of \"serious injury.\" \"Serious injury\" is injury that is a significant impairment to the position of the domestic industry. CVD and AD statutes have stricter causation and injury standards compared to safeguard relief procedures, which involve decisions made at a higher policy level by the President and possibly Congress. The President has discretion in deciding on safeguard relief, and Congress may have a role if the President does not follow the ITC's recommendation. The President has discretion in deciding on safeguard relief, with Congress possibly having a role if the President does not follow the ITC's recommendation. CVD and AD cases do not have such discretion, as relief determined by the DOC is implemented without presidential or congressional involvement. The stricter standards and procedures for safeguard relief reflect the involvement of fairly traded imports from all sources, with the President considering factors related to national economic and security interests. Foreign countries affected by safeguard actions may seek to influence the President to refrain from imposing or to moderate the safeguards. U.S. industries have sought and received relief more often from AD and CVD procedures than from safeguard relief. Recent experience with WTO dispute settlement involving U.S. imposition of safeguard actions, particularly in regard to food and agriculture imports, may discourage parties from using Section 201 for import-related injury claims. The WTO questioned the methodology used by U.S. ITC in determining injury caused by imports and overturned the remedy invoked by the President. U.S. agricultural CVD and AD decisions have faced less scrutiny in WTO dispute settlement. Out of 73 ITC safeguard investigations conducted since 1974, 20 covered food and agriculture product imports, with seven receiving relief. The recent high-profile agricultural investigations involving wheat gluten and lamb meat imports resulted in import restrictions imposed by the President. Despite WTO rulings removing the restrictions, adjustment assistance to affected U.S. producers continues. The domestic industry claims that EU wheat gluten benefits unfairly from subsidies and trade barriers, causing economic harm to U.S. producers. An initial Section 301 action in 1997 by the Wheat Gluten Industry Council did not provide relief. The Wheat Gluten Industry Council petitioned the ITC in 1998 for safeguard measures against EU imports, leading to an annual import quota for wheat gluten from 1998 to 2001. The EU challenged the safeguards in 1999, resulting in a WTO dispute panel ruling against the U.S. safeguard. This led to the EU imposing a special duty on U.S. corn gluten feed in retaliation. The Bush Administration decided not to extend the wheat gluten quota, leading to the EU lifting tariffs on corn gluten feed. Instead, the U.S. industry received $40 million in subsidies over 2 years to enhance competitiveness. Midwest Grains and Manildra were expected to benefit. In a separate case, the ITC found that increased lamb meat imports threatened the U.S. industry, leading to an import relief package announced by President Clinton in 1999. On July 7, 1999, the U.S. implemented an import relief package for the industry, including a $100 million initiative to boost productivity and tariff-rate quotas on lamb meat imports from Australia and New Zealand. After complaints from the countries, a WTO panel ruled on December 6, 2000, that the U.S. violated safeguard provisions. The U.S. lost an appeal on May 1, 2001, and ended the tariff-rate quota safeguard on November 15, 2001. An agreement with Australia and New Zealand led to $42.7 million in assistance for the U.S. lamb industry through FY2003. Since 1994, over 300 AD and CVD cases have been initiated, with 30 related to food and agricultural products. Approximately 260 AD and nearly 50 CVD orders were in effect as of December 2001, with 35 related to food and agricultural cases. These orders entail higher duties on imports from targeted countries when investigations find in favor of the domestic industry seeking relief. The U.S. has imposed anti-dumping duties on imports of apple juice from China after a successful petition by industry groups. Similar actions were taken against honey imports from Argentina and China. The U.S. imposed provisional duties on honey imports from Argentina and China, ranging up to 184% ad valorem. Importers had to post bonds or make cash deposits to cover the duties until final rulings were issued by the DOC and ITC, determining dumping and countervailable subsidies. Final AD orders were issued on December 10, 2001, imposing import duties on Argentine and Chinese honey ranging from 26% to 184% ad valorem. An unsuccessful petition challenged live cattle imports from Mexico and Canada under AD and CVD laws. R-CALF filed a complaint in November 1998, alleging that Canadian cattle imports were sold below fair value. The ITC terminated the case against Mexico but found a threat to U.S. cattlemen from low-cost Canadian cattle imports. Despite findings of dumping by Canadian cattle feeders, the ITC ruled in November 1999 that U.S. producers were not materially injured, leading to no anti-dumping order being issued. Section 301 cases primarily address complaints about U.S. exports being affected by unreasonable foreign policies. Several cases involving food and agricultural products were initiated between 1994 and 2001, including disputes with the EU over bananas, dairy products, meat, and wheat gluten, Korea over meat products, Australia over leather, Japan over certain agricultural products, Canada over dairy products and wheat, and Mexico over high fructose corn syrup. In 1993, the EU established a banana import regime that favored imports from its former colonies, limiting access to bananas from Latin America. In response to complaints from U.S. banana interests, the EU's discriminatory banana import regime was challenged through WTO dispute settlement. The WTO ruled against the EU in 1997, leading to U.S. retaliation with 100% tariffs on EU exports. A resolution was reached in 2001, with the EU agreeing to increase market access for U.S. banana distributors, resulting in the lifting of retaliatory duties by the United States. The United States lifted retaliatory duties on July 1, 2001, transitioning to a tariff-only system by 2006. The EU established quotas and a licensing system to increase Latin American banana imports, benefiting U.S. firms like Chiquita Brands International. ACP countries will continue to enjoy preferential entry for banana imports. WTO granted EU waivers to give preferential tariff concessions to ACP countries and increase quotas for Latin American bananas. The United States challenged an EU ban on meat treated with growth hormones, citing lack of scientific justification. WTO panels agreed with the U.S. and gave the EU until May 13, 1999, to comply. The EU did not meet the deadline, leading to the U.S. imposing 100% retaliatory tariffs on EU imports. The U.S. imposed 100% retaliatory tariffs on $116 million worth of EU imports approved by the WTO. The tariffs aim to punish the EU for not reopening its market to most U.S. meat products. Despite both sides wanting an amicable settlement, none was reached by early 2002. A Section 301 investigation was launched in 1998 after allegations of unfair marketing practices by Mexico towards U.S. high fructose corn syrup. NAFTA and WTO dispute proceedings were ongoing regarding Mexico's anti-dumping duties on U.S. HFCS imports. WTO panels sided with the United States, agreeing that Mexico failed to prove harm to its domestic industry. This could result in 100% tariffs on Mexican imports. The HFCS dispute is linked to negotiations on Mexican sugar access to the U.S. market. An agreement was made in December 2001 to find a settlement, but tensions rose when Mexico imposed a new tax in January 2002. The sweetener issue escalated when Mexico imposed a new tax on soft drinks containing HFCS in 2002. USTR initiated a Section 301 investigation following allegations of anti-competitive practices by the Canadian government and the Canadian Wheat Board. The ITC's analysis did not support claims of underpricing by the Canadian Wheat Board, but USTR released an \"affirmative finding\" against the Government of Canada. In 2002, USTR found that the Canadian Wheat Board had a monopoly harming U.S. producers. USTR planned to address this by considering WTO dispute settlement, filing CVD and AD petitions, identifying trade impediments, and pursuing reform in WTO agriculture negotiations. They decided against imposing a tariff-rate quota at that time. The U.S. has considered various measures to address market distortions caused by the Canadian Wheat Board monopoly, with concerns about violating NAFTA and WTO commitments and potential Canadian retaliation. These measures aim to improve relief for U.S. producers facing unfair import pricing and export barriers, with some arguing for special treatment for agriculture in trade policy and remedy legislation. Special agricultural treatment is often supported due to the perishable nature of agricultural products and the need for a financially healthy farm sector. However, some argue that modern U.S. agriculture is integrated into the economy and already receives extensive government support. Legislative and trade policy developments, including Senator Byrd's amendment to the FY2001 agricultural appropriation, have implications for agricultural producers. An amendment to the FY2001 agricultural appropriation (P.L. 106-387; section 1003) requires that anti-dumping and countervailing duties be redistributed to domestic industries injured by imports. The Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000 applies to all industries, not just agriculture, and mandates the U.S. Customs Service to deposit duties into a special account for distribution to eligible firms affected by dumped or subsidized imports. The \"Byrd Amendment\" redistributed approximately $200 million in FY2001 duty collections, with a significant portion going to U.S. manufacturers of steel products. About $22 million was allocated for agricultural cases, primarily for petitioners in Italian pasta cases. An additional $2 billion was held in clearing accounts for final liquidation, with $121 million designated for agriculture-related cases. The Byrd Amendment has faced controversy due to initial criticism. The Byrd amendment, controversial for being inserted into legislation without committee consideration, faces criticism for violating WTO obligations. Section 407 of the Trade and Development Act of 2000 directs the USTR to periodically revise the list of products subject to trade retaliation. The provision was driven by difficulties in changing EU import regimes despite WTO rulings. The USTR implemented the carousel provision in 2000 to rotate products subject to retaliation against the EU. The EC challenged this in the WTO, and the US hesitates to use it due to other trade disputes. Several bills introduced in the 107th Congress aim to ease requirements for determining injury to U.S. industries from imports, potentially leading to retaliatory tariffs of up to $4 billion. Provisions in bills like H.R. 518, S. 979, and H.R. 1988 include allowing imports to be one of the causes of injury, not necessarily the primary cause, for import relief. Other bills like S. 1869 and H.R. 3571 propose expedited antidumping investigations when imports increase significantly from new suppliers after an antidumping order. The bills S. 979 and H.R. 1988 aim to ease requirements for determining injury to U.S. industries from imports. They include provisions related to agriculture and require the ITC to measure economic effects during a product's production period. The Administration seeks to renew trade promotion authority for the President to negotiate trade agreements with expedited procedures. The House passed a TPA bill (H.R. 3005) authorizing the President to negotiate trade agreements by June 30, 2005. The Senate Finance Committee also cleared its version of H.R. 3005. Proponents included provisions addressing agricultural concerns to gain support from agricultural groups. H.R. 3005 includes agricultural negotiating objectives such as eliminating trade practices affecting perishable products and ensuring import relief mechanisms are accessible to U.S. growers. The bill also expands consultation requirements for tariff reduction negotiations on import-sensitive agricultural products. The Senate version of H.R. 3005 includes various agricultural products and requires consultation with Congress before negotiating tariff cuts. Analysts believe these requirements may hinder the President's ability to achieve agricultural negotiating objectives. The Administration, however, views the fast track bills as posing additional hurdles for lowering tariffs. The fast track bills pose hurdles for lowering tariffs on import-sensitive products, but provide a better basis for negotiations in the long run. Various proposals have been made to extend trade adjustment assistance (TAA) to farmers, which directs assistance to those most affected by imports without distorting prices. However, current TAA programs have been criticized as ineffective in responding to workers' needs in a globalizing economy and may have limited value for agriculture. The 107th Congress has been considering legislation to extend Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) for workers and firms, with proposals to include farmers. Senator Conrad introduced the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers Act (S. 1100) to create a program for FY2002-FY2006. This bill's language was incorporated into a broader bill, the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers, Farmers, Communities, and Firms Act of 2001 (S. 1209), which was approved by the Senate Finance Committee on December 4, 2001. Under S. 1209, agricultural producers could petition the Secretary of Agriculture for assistance. Under S. 1209, agricultural producers could petition the Secretary of Agriculture to be certified as eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA). The Secretary would determine if the national average price for the affected commodity was below 80% of the average price for the prior 5 years, with imports contributing to the price decline. Eligible members could apply for a cash payment based on production, limited to $10,000 per year, with total program costs capped at $90 million annually. Under S. 1209, agricultural producers could petition the Secretary of Agriculture for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) based on price effects of imported commodities. The program would provide cash payments tied to production, capped at $10,000 per year, with total costs limited to $90 million annually. Several bills in the House have similar language, such as H.R. 3359 and H.R. 3670. The Labor report on TAA for agricultural producers emphasizes retraining for job loss, not financial assistance to stay in current occupations. The TAA program for firms offers limited technical assistance to agriculture commodity producers affected by increased imports, but cannot provide direct financial aid. USDA officials stated that low commodity prices are not solely due to imports, so TAA-type programs may not address this issue. The Labor report suggests focusing on retraining for job loss rather than financial assistance for affected agricultural producers. To support agricultural commodity producers affected by imports and wanting to remain in their current occupations, a separate trade adjustment assistance program is recommended. As agricultural trade expands, U.S. producers face increased competition from food and farm imports, leading some groups to seek government relief. Trade remedy legislation, supported by industries sensitive to foreign competition, is a common response to perceived threats to livelihoods. Trade remedy legislation is often opposed by U.S. businesses and consumers due to potential higher prices from import restrictions. These laws can sustain inefficient U.S. producers, increase trade tensions, and face challenges from trading partners and the WTO. The Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act has been criticized for its impact on trade. The WTO criticized the Offset Act for providing subsidies to select U.S. industries while forcing consumers to pay higher prices. It noted that many countries, including the U.S., use import protections for agriculture. The European Union and Japan have called for a review of antidumping practices in WTO countries during new trade negotiations. The United States initially opposed the review but later agreed to language in the Doha declaration for simplification and clarification of antidumping laws. USTR Zoellick aims to bring developing countries' trade relief measures up to U.S. standards. Several committee members criticized the USTR for potentially weakening U.S. trade relief laws in multilateral negotiations. The U.S. continues to push for reducing agricultural trade barriers, despite possible criticism for opposing anti-dumping practices. U.S. producers may resist changes in laws and seek stronger protections against unfair subsidization by foreign competitors. The WTO Uruguay Round Agreements include a Dispute Settlement Understanding that outlines rules for resolving disputes arising from trade policy measures. Disputes in the WTO arise when a country violates an agreement, and the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) is responsible for resolving them. Consultation between governments is the first step, lasting up to 60 days. If consultations fail, a panel can be appointed within 45 days. The panel reports within 6 months and to all WTO members within 3 weeks. The DSB adopts the report within 60 days, and if there is no appeal, the decision is final. The Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) in the WTO resolves disputes between countries. If there is no appeal, the process takes about 1 year. Appeals are heard by a 7-member Appellate Body and should not last more than 60 days. The losing country must follow the recommendations within 30 days or face trade sanctions. The DSB in the WTO resolves disputes between countries, with appeals heard by a 7-member Appellate Body. The losing country must follow recommendations within 30 days or face trade sanctions. Under NAFTA Chapter 20, disputes can be settled through consultation and referral to the NAFTA Commission for resolution. The NAFTA Commission must convene within 10 days to resolve disputes, with an arbitral panel formed if no resolution is reached within 30 days. Panel members are experts in law, international trade, or NAFTA matters, selected through a \"reverse selection\" process. Panels may include experts or scientific review boards for technical disputes. Disputing parties must follow a specific timeline for resolving disputes under NAFTA. Panels must issue their initial report within 90 days, with parties given 14 days to provide comments. The final report is due within 30 days, after which parties must attempt to resolve the dispute based on panel recommendations. If no agreement is reached, trade compensation or suspension of NAFTA benefits may be implemented. NAFTA countries can amend their national antidumping and countervailing duty laws, with notification and consultation required with affected parties. Independent panels of experts review AD/CVD determinations concerning NAFTA countries' products, applying national law and standards of judicial review. Interested persons with standing can challenge agency determinations through this process. The NAFTA countries can amend their national antidumping and countervailing duty laws, with notification and consultation required with affected parties. Panels of experts review AD/CVD determinations concerning NAFTA countries' products, applying national law and standards of judicial review. Governments may appeal panel decisions to an extraordinary challenge committee if serious ethical violations or legal errors are found."
