    "content": "The Act titled \"Cutting Red Tape, Green-Lighting Small Businesses Act of 2013\" introduces a credit for certain individuals hired by small employers under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Act \"Cutting Red Tape, Green-Lighting Small Businesses Act of 2013\" introduces a small employer hiring credit for eligible small employers based on wages paid to covered employees. The Act \"Cutting Red Tape, Green-Lighting Small Businesses Act of 2013\" introduces a small employer hiring credit for eligible small employers based on the number of employees they have, with specific rules for new businesses and predecessor/successor entities. The term 'employer' under the Act does not include governmental entities. If an employer claims the credit for a calendar year, they cannot claim it for subsequent years. A 'covered employee' is defined as an employee who first starts working for the employer. The qualified small employer must have employees working at least 30 hours per week in a trade or business related to the employer's tax-exempt purpose. The employer can only have up to 5 covered employees, and regulations will determine hours of service. The rules and guidance determine employee hours of service, including for non-hourly employees. Tax-exempt eligible small employers are credited under subpart C, not this subpart, if they meet specific criteria. No double benefit deductions or credits are allowed. The small employer hiring credit under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code prohibits double benefits and requires taxpayer election for application in a taxable year, terminating for wages paid after December 31, 2015. This credit is part of the general business credit under section 38(b) of the Code. The small employer hiring credit under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is determined under section 45S. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments made by section 45S apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2013. The Small Business Act is amended to reduce paperwork for new small businesses. The Administrator of the Small Business Administration will determine non-essential paperwork for new businesses and waive the need for such paperwork within the first year of operation."
