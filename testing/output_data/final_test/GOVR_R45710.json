    "content": "The 116th Congress may address various housing-related issues, including assisted housing programs, housing finance, reforming the housing finance system, prioritizing appropriations for federal housing programs, oversight of program implementation, and extending temporary housing-related tax provisions. This report offers a high-level overview of these key issues for the 116th Congress. The national housing market conditions provide context for housing policy issues in the 116th Congress. Rising home prices, low interest rates, and increasing rental costs are prominent features, impacting income growth. Local housing markets can vary significantly from national trends. Rising house prices and rental costs outpacing income growth raise concerns about housing affordability for homebuyers and renters. Most homebuyers rely on mortgages, impacting housing demand. National house prices have been steadily increasing since 2012, with year-over-year increases exceeding 5% for most quarters since mid-2016. House prices have been steadily increasing since 2012, with a nearly 6% increase in the fourth quarter of 2018. Prices vary across local markets, with some areas experiencing rapid growth while others stagnate. Rising prices impact affordability for homebuyers but benefit current homeowners through increased equity. Mortgage interest rates have been consistently low, below 5% since May 2010, and below 4% for stretches. Rates declined at the end of 2018 into early 2019, with an average rate of 4.37% in February 2019. Rising house prices impact affordability for homebuyers but benefit current homeowners through increased equity. House prices have been rising nationally, along with mortgage interest rates, although still historically low. Despite rising incomes, affordability concerns have increased as house price increases outpace income growth. However, metrics suggest that owner-occupied housing remains relatively affordable, thanks to rising incomes and low interest rates. Some factors affecting housing affordability may not be captured by metrics like monthly mortgage payments. Assumptions like a 20% down payment may not apply to many households, making homeownership less attainable for some. Other factors such as qualifying for a mortgage, market availability, and regional price differences also impact affordability, especially for specific demographic groups. The affordability of owner-occupied homes may hold steady or improve due to slowing house price increases and low interest rates. Annual home sales have been increasing since 2014, but in 2018, the overall number of home sales declined. The supply of homes on the market has not kept pace with demand, limiting home sales activity and contributing to house price increases. The annual number of existing and new home sales fluctuated between 1995 and 2018. In 2018, existing home sales were at 5.3 million, a decrease from 5.5 million in 2017. New home sales in 2018 were at 622,000, up from 614,000 in 2017. However, new home sales remain lower than in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The supply of homes on the market impacts sales and prices, with new construction not meeting demand. The national housing market has seen low inventory levels, leading to higher home prices. However, local conditions vary, with some areas facing surplus housing inventory and vacant homes due to population declines. While new home inventory has started to increase, existing homeowners' decisions to sell are influenced by expectations of inventory and affordability. The decision of homeowners to sell their homes can be influenced by expectations of housing inventory and affordability. Factors such as finding new homes that meet their needs and interest rates on new mortgages play a role. New construction activity, measured by housing starts, is influenced by labor, materials, costs, and expected demand for new homes. Housing starts are reported monthly as a \"seasonally adjusted annual rate.\" Housing starts for single-family homes have been low in recent years due to various factors like labor shortages and high construction costs. Despite an increase since 2012, they remain below levels seen in the late 1990s to mid-2000s. In 2018, the annual rate averaged about 868,000, compared to over 1 million in the late 1990s to mid-2000s. High housing construction costs have led to a greater share of new housing being built at the more expensive end of the market, exacerbating supply and price pressures for lower-priced homes. Lenders can choose to hold mortgages in their portfolio, sell to private companies, or government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Mortgages can also be insured by federal agencies like the FHA or VA, with most included in mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Ginnie Mae. During the first three quarters of 2018, about two-thirds of the total dollar volume of mortgages originated was backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (45%) or guaranteed by a federal agency like FHA or VA (22%). One-third of mortgages were held in bank portfolios, and 2% were in private-label securities without government backing. The shares of mortgage originations backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and held in bank portfolios have remained similar to the early 2000s, while private-label securitization remains minimal. The share of private-label securitization remains very small since the housing market turmoil of the late 2000s, while the FHA/VA share is higher than in the early and mid-2000s. Affordability has been a prominent concern in rental markets, with an increase in renter households leading to lower vacancy rates and higher rents. The housing market turmoil led to a decrease in homeownership rates and an increase in households renting their homes. The share of renters increased from about 31% in 2005 to a high of 36.6% in 2016, then decreased slightly to 35.6% in 2018. Homeownership rate fell from 69% in the mid-2000s to 63.4% in 2016, but rose to 64.4% in 2018. The number of renter-occupied units increased from 34 million in 2006 to 43 million in 2018, while owner-occupied units fell from 75 million in 2006 to 74 million in 2014, then increased to 78 million in 2018. The increase in renter households has led to higher competition for rental housing, driving up rents due to insufficient new rental housing supply. Rental vacancy rates have decreased, impacting rental housing affordability influenced by factors like unit availability, characteristics, and demand. Despite new housing units being added, the supply of rental housing has not kept pace with demand. The supply of rental housing has not kept pace with demand, especially for lower-cost units, leading to low vacancy rates. Increased demand and new construction in higher-cost units have raised rents. Median renter incomes have been increasing but not enough to keep up with rising rents, reducing rental affordability. Rising rental costs and stagnant renter incomes can worsen housing affordability issues, particularly for lower-income households. In 2017, the number of cost-burdened renter households increased to 20.5 million, with the majority being low-income households. 83% of renter households earning below $15,000 experienced housing cost burdens, and 72% faced severe cost burdens. There is a shortage of affordable rental units for extremely low-income households. Low-income renter households, particularly those earning no more than 30% of the area median income, contribute to housing cost burdens. The 116th Congress may focus on housing finance, assistance programs, and tax provisions. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises, play a significant role in the U.S. housing finance system by providing liquidity to the mortgage market through purchasing mortgages that meet specific requirements and packaging them into mortgage-backed securities. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises, faced financial trouble in 2008 and entered voluntary conservatorship overseen by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The Department of the Treasury purchased senior preferred stock from each GSE to support them, with dividends paid back to Treasury. These issues could be of interest to the 116th Congress. The 116th Congress may consider legislative housing finance reform, new leadership at FHFA, administrative changes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and issues affecting their finances and mortgage standards. Policymakers agree on the need for comprehensive housing finance reform legislation to address the conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This legislation could eliminate or transform the role of these GSEs in the housing finance system. For more information, refer to CRS Report R44525. Housing finance reform legislation may involve changes to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other federal programs supporting the mortgage market. There is disagreement on how to increase the private sector's role, reduce government risk, and maintain access to affordable mortgages. Various proposals have been suggested since 2008 by Congress, think tanks, and industry groups. Proposals for housing finance reform have been considered by Congress, think tanks, and industry groups. Previous Congresses have debated various versions of reform legislation, with differing opinions on structural and implementation issues. The 114th Congress focused on targeted reforms for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while the 115th Congress held a hearing on a draft reform bill. In the 116th Congress, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Chairman Mike Crapo released an outline for potential housing finance reform legislation. FHFA, the regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, saw a change in leadership with Mark Calabria being confirmed as the new director in April 2019. FHFA has the authority to make changes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's operations without congressional approval. Recent directives include risk-sharing transactions and developing a common securitization platform. Speculation surrounds possible administrative changes under new leadership at FHFA, which could lead to congressional oversight. Changes could involve pricing of mortgages, underwriting standards, product offerings, pilot programs, and laying the groundwork for a post-conservatorship housing finance system. The new FHFA director's potential changes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's roles in the mortgage market have raised concerns among industry groups. President Trump has directed a plan to end the GSEs' conservatorship. Other issues related to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may be of interest. The 116th Congress may address issues related to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including a new accounting standard (CECL) that could increase loan loss reserves. The Dodd-Frank Act requires mortgage lenders to verify a borrower's ability to repay, with certain protections for qualified mortgages. The QM Patch exemption for debt-to-income ratio ATR rule expires in early 2021. The QM Patch exemption from the debt-to-income ratio ATR rule expires in early 2021, with implications for HUD's budget due to discretionary spending limits set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. HUD's funding for housing programs, including rental assistance, is set to decrease in FY2020. The nondefense discretionary cap will decline by over 9%, affecting programs like the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher and public housing. Despite recent increases in funding for rental assistance, public housing has been underfunded for years. The funding levels for rental assistance programs are insufficient to serve all eligible families, leading to long waiting lists for assistance. The pressure to increase funding for existing programs must be balanced against the need to support other popular programs like HUD's Community Development Block Grant and grants for homelessness assistance. The Trump Administration's budget request for FY2020 proposes an 18% decrease in funding for HUD's programs, including the elimination of grant programs like CDBG and the HOME Investment Partnerships Program. The Administration suggests that state and local governments take on more responsibility for housing and community development activities. Additionally, policy changes aim to reduce the cost of federal rental assistance programs. The Affordable Housing Work Act of 2018 (MAHWA) proposal by HUD aims to change how tenant rents are calculated in rental assistance programs, potentially increasing rent for recipients and decreasing federal subsidies. It also allows for work requirements. While HUD sees it as promoting fiscal sustainability and self-sufficiency, critics are concerned about the impact on low-income families. Additionally, the Administration's FY2020 budget request includes cuts to rural housing programs, except for certain loan guarantee programs. The FY2020 budget proposal includes cuts to rural housing programs, except for loan guarantee programs. It also introduces a new minimum rent policy for tenants to reduce federal subsidy costs. Several assisted housing legislation pieces from prior Congresses are expected to be implemented during the 116th Congress. PHAs are set to receive exceptions from HUD for most rules governing public housing and voucher programs under MTW. The program has been controversial, with PHAs supporting its flexibility and low-income housing advocates criticizing policies like work requirements. GAO raised concerns about HUD's oversight of MTW, including the lack of monitoring policy effects on tenants. HUD is phasing in the FY2016 expansion and evaluating new policies adopted by participating PHAs. Selections for the first two expansion cohorts have not been made yet. The Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) was an Obama Administration initiative to convert public housing properties to Section 8 vouchers or project-based rental assistance, removing deed restrictions to allow PHAs to raise private capital. RAD conversions must be cost-neutral to maintain subsidy levels. The Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) allows public housing properties to convert to Section 8 vouchers or project-based rental assistance, raising private capital. However, there are concerns about HUD's oversight and the amount of private funding raised. Congress has expanded RAD to allow up to 455,000 units of public housing to convert to Section 8. The Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program allows public housing properties to convert to Section 8 vouchers or project-based rental assistance, raising private capital. Congress has expanded RAD to include Section 202 Housing for the Elderly units. The President's FY2020 budget requests the elimination of the cap on public housing RAD conversions. Congressional activity related to disaster response and recovery programs has increased due to recent major disasters in the United States. The President may authorize emergency or major disaster declarations under the Stafford Act, making FEMA-provided housing assistance available to disaster survivors. FEMA-provided housing assistance includes short-term sheltering accommodations like the Transitional Sheltering Assistance program. Interim housing needs are met through the Individuals and Households Program, offering financial and direct assistance to eligible individuals and households affected by emergencies or disasters. Assistance is temporary and generally limited to 18 months. The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (DRRA) amends many sections of the Stafford Act to focus on improving pre-disaster planning, mitigation, response, and recovery, as well as increasing FEMA accountability. It includes new authorities and requires reports to Congress, rulemaking, and oversight by the 116th Congress. DRRA Section 1211 amends Stafford Act Section 408(f) to allow state, territorial, or tribal governments to administer Direct Temporary Housing Assistance and Permanent Housing Construction. It also allows for reimbursement of locally implemented housing solutions, potentially expediting disaster recovery. FEMA may need to provide guidance on the application and approval process for these governments. DRRA Section 1212 amends Stafford Act Section 408(h) to separate the cap on maximum financial assistance for housing and ONA. It removes the cap for alternate housing accommodations and creates an exception for accessibility-related costs, improving FEMA's ability to meet recovery needs for individuals and households after disasters. DRRA Section 1213 expands eligible areas for multifamily lease and repair assistance, increasing housing options for disaster survivors. The Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security must assess FEMA's direct assistance authority and submit a report to Congress. Native Americans in tribal areas face housing challenges due to poor conditions and legal complications. Federal housing programs specifically target tribal areas, such as the Tribal HUD-VASH program for homeless Native American veterans. The Tribal HUD-VASH program provides rental assistance and supportive services to Native American veterans who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. It was created through the FY2015 HUD appropriations act and efforts are being made to codify the program through legislation in Congress. For more information on HUD-VASH and Tribal HUD-VASH, refer to CRS Report RL34024, Veterans and Homelessness. The main federal program for housing assistance to Native American tribes and Alaska Native villages is the Native American Housing Block Grant (NAHBG) authorized by the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA, P.L. 104-330). NAHASDA reorganized the federal housing assistance system for tribes, providing formula funding for affordable housing activities benefiting low-income Native Americans or Alaska Natives in tribal areas. Another program, the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant (NHHBG), supports affordable housing for eligible Native Hawaiians on Hawaiian Home Lands under NAHASDA. The Native American Housing Block Grant (NAHBG) under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 provides housing assistance to Native American tribes and Alaska Native villages. The NAHASDA reauthorization legislation has been considered in multiple Congresses, with some disagreements over specific provisions. The NHHBG has not been reauthorized since FY2005 but continues to receive funding. The 116th Congress may consider legislation to reauthorize NAHASDA. Some disagreements in Congress involve debates over specific program changes and broader issues like federal funding for programs for Native Hawaiians. Congress has extended temporary tax provisions related to housing, known as \"tax extenders,\" including provisions for canceled mortgage debt and mortgage insurance deduction. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended tax provisions for canceled mortgage debt and mortgage insurance premiums through 2017. Legislation in the 116th Congress aims to extend these provisions through 2019. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 excluded canceled mortgage debt income from taxation to help distressed borrowers during the housing market turmoil of the late 2000s. The provision was extended multiple times to assist in the recovery of the housing market and overall economy. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 excluded canceled mortgage debt income from taxation to aid distressed borrowers during the housing market crisis. Arguments against the exclusion included concerns about debt forgiveness incentivizing irresponsible behavior and fairness issues. With improvements in the economy and housing market, the exclusion may no longer be necessary. Homeowners traditionally deduct mortgage interest and property taxes, with the option to deduct mortgage insurance premiums since 2007. For more information on canceled mortgage debt exclusion, refer to CRS Report RL34212. In 2007, homeowners could deduct qualifying mortgage insurance premiums as mortgage interest if their adjusted gross incomes were below a specified threshold. The deduction was extended multiple times but may not have a significant impact on homeownership rates. The deduction for mortgage insurance premiums was extended multiple times, but may not have a significant impact on homeownership rates. Congress has regularly extended temporary tax provisions, including housing-related ones like the exclusion for canceled mortgage debt and the deduction for mortgage insurance premiums. The most recent tax extenders legislation extended these provisions through the end of 2017. The Tax Extender and Disaster Relief Act of 2019 would extend provisions for deducting mortgage insurance premiums and excluding canceled mortgage debt income through 2019. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 temporarily excluded qualified canceled mortgage debt from gross income for tax purposes. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-142) temporarily excluded qualified canceled mortgage debt income from taxation to assist distressed households and aid in the housing market and economy recovery. Arguments against the exclusion included concerns about encouraging homeowners to be less responsible with debt obligations. The exclusion for canceled mortgage debt may no longer be warranted due to improvements in the economy, housing market, and foreclosure rates. Homeowners traditionally deduct interest paid on mortgages and property taxes if they itemize deductions. Starting in 2007, homeowners could also deduct qualifying mortgage insurance premiums. The deduction of mortgage insurance premiums was initially available for those with gross incomes below specified thresholds. It was extended multiple times, with rationales including aiding the housing market recovery and promoting homeownership. However, the housing market has largely recovered, and the deduction's impact on homeownership is unclear. Extending the deduction could lead to a misallocation of resources towards the housing industry."
