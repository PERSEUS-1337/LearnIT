    "content": "ALLOCATION TO SOURCES WITHIN THE UNITED STATES OF INTEREST EXPENSE ON INDEBTEDNESS FINANCING RATE-REGULATED ELECTRIC ENERGY OR NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. The amendment to section 864 of the Internal Revenue Code allocates interest on qualified infrastructure indebtedness solely to sources within the United States, excluding it from the allocation of other interest expenses. The term 'qualified infrastructure indebtedness' refers to debt incurred for the trade or business of providing electric energy or natural gas in the US, or for acquiring property used mainly for this purpose. If only part of the business is subject to rate regulation, nonqualified indebtedness is excluded from the definition. The term 'nonqualified indebtedness' refers to debt that exceeds a certain ratio of the taxpayer's total assets, specifically related to rate-regulated furnishing or sale. The sale is rate-regulated if the rates have been established or approved by a State, agency, or commission. Asset values are based on adjusted bases unless fair market value is elected. The taxpayer can elect to use fair market value for all assets, which is an irrevocable decision. The determination of qualified infrastructure indebtedness or nonqualified indebtedness is made at the time the indebtedness is incurred. This applies separately to electric energy and natural gas. The amendment applies to indebtedness incurred in taxable years beginning after the date of enactment of this Act. The determination of whether outstanding debt constitutes qualified infrastructure indebtedness is made by applying specific rules at the time the indebtedness was incurred, as per the Internal Revenue Code."
