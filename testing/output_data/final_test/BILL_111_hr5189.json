    "content": "The \"Municipal Finance Improvements Act of 2010\" is the short title of this Act. It includes a section on the certification of the cost of financing municipal obligations. The \"Municipal Finance Improvements Act of 2010\" includes a new subsection in Section 149 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, requiring optimal bond financing certification for State or local bond issuances. The \"optimal bond financing certification\" is a written statement by an independent financial adviser certifying that fees and interest costs for bonds are reasonable compared to the financial marketplace, without increasing risks to the issuer or bond obligors. The certification in subparagraph (A) includes the impact of the chosen legal structure on the total interest cost. A qualified independent financial advisor is defined as an individual with the necessary qualifications to advise on the financial cost and legal structures for bond optimization. A qualified independent financial advisor must have a legal fiduciary duty to the issuer and cannot have any ties to the underwriter of the bond. An independent financial advisor must not have any financial ties to the underwriter of the bond or receive contingent remuneration based on the issuance of the bond. An individual can still be considered a qualified independent financial advisor even if they are an employee of the State or local government issuing the bond. The issuer of any State or local bond must publicly share the optimal bond financing certification. Callable State or local bond issues must meet certain requirements to continue being treated as such. The term 'callable State or local bond issue' refers to bonds that can be retired early by the issuer or private activity user if the remaining term to maturity is more than 23 months. This option must result in substantial economic savings to the issuer or user in the marketplace. The amendments made by this section apply to obligations issued after the enactment of this Act, except for callable obligations issued or refunded before that date, which can be called early. The Act allows for obligations to be called before, on, or after the enactment date. SEC. 6433 introduces the Small Issuer Credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Small Issuer Credit allows a small issuer to receive a credit of 0.05 percent of the principle amount of a bond issued, payable by the Secretary. A small issuer is defined as an issuer whose tax-exempt bonds do not exceed $50,000,000 in aggregate face amount for the calendar year. The Secretary will pay the credit to the issuer once they are determined to be a small issuer for the year. The Small Issuer Credit allows a small issuer to receive a credit of 0.05 percent of the principle amount of a bond issued, payable by the Secretary. A small issuer is defined as an issuer whose tax-exempt bonds do not exceed $50,000,000 in aggregate face amount for the calendar year. Refunding bonds issued to refund any bond are not taken into account in determining small issuer status if the refunding bond amount does not exceed the outstanding amount of the refunded bond. The Small Issuer Credit allows a small issuer to receive a credit of 0.05 percent of the principle amount of a bond issued, applicable to obligations issued after the enactment of this Act."
