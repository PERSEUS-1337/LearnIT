    "content": "Under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, states, territories, and tribes can claim federal reimbursement for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship. The program provides monthly payments, case management, training, and other administrative costs. In FY2013, states spent $12.3 billion and expected $6.7 billion in federal reimbursement. To be eligible, a state must have an approved Title IV-E plan by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Title IV-E program under the Social Security Act allows states, territories, and tribes to receive federal reimbursement for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 5 tribal entities have an approved Title IV-E plan that focuses on child welfare goals of safety, permanence, and well-being. Safety ensures protection from abuse or neglect, while permanence aims to minimize time spent in foster care by reuniting children with their parents quickly and safely. The Title IV-E plan is a crucial document that guides efforts to reunite children with their parents or find them a safe permanent home. It focuses on promoting positive outcomes for children in foster care, adoption, and kinship guardianship, ensuring their safety and well-being. States must meet all plan requirements to receive funding under Title IV-E components. The Title IV-E plan requirements are crucial for children in foster care, adoption, and kinship guardianship. States must develop protocols to identify and provide necessary services for child welfare-involved children at risk of sex trafficking. These protocols apply to children with open case files, including those not in foster care. The Title IV-E plan requirements are essential for children in foster care, adoption, and kinship guardianship. States must implement protocols to identify and support child welfare-involved children at risk of sex trafficking, including those in foster care, runaways, and youth in the CFCIP program. States must submit a Title IV-E plan using a \"pre-print\" form to demonstrate compliance with the law by September 29, 2016. Funding under the Title IV-E program must be used for eligible activities. In FY2013, state child welfare agencies spent $12.3 billion in federal and state Title IV-E dollars, with a significant portion used for administrative activities related to case planning, pre-placement activities, and support for children in new permanent families. In FY2013, state child welfare agencies spent $12.3 billion in federal and state Title IV-E dollars, with a significant portion used for administrative activities related to case planning, pre-placement activities, and support for children in new permanent families. Spending for foster care maintenance payments on behalf of eligible children in foster care represented the third-largest Title IV-E program spending category. 29 states, the District of Columbia, and 1 tribe had approval for, or were already implementing, a Title IV-E waiver project as of October 2014. Under a waiver, states may spend Title IV-E funds for activities other than those described in the plan, as long as it meets child welfare goals and is cost neutral to the federal government. The statute prohibits HHS from waiving requirements that would impair entitlement to benefits under Title IV-E for children and families. It also prohibits waiving child protections in case planning and review. Compliance with Title IV-E plan requirements is subject to federal reviews, including the Child and Family Services Review. The Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) assesses state outcomes for children through onsite record reviews and stakeholder interviews to ensure compliance with federal child welfare laws. States not in substantial conformity must implement a Program Improvement Plan to avoid penalties. Reviews are conducted in all 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico, with a third round scheduled from FY2015 to FY2018. No jurisdiction was found in full compliance in previous rounds. In previous rounds of the Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) from 2001-2004 and 2007-2010, no jurisdiction was found in full compliance with federal child welfare policies. States must have an approved Title IV-E plan to enable children to be reunited with their families, prevent entry into foster care, promote placement with relatives, and maintain sibling connections. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of identifying adult relatives of children in care, placing sibling groups together, ensuring safe living arrangements, allowing for \"normalcy\" in foster care settings, conducting background checks for caregivers, and providing regular oversight of children in foster care. Ensure regular oversight and review of each child's status in foster care, timely development and implementation of a permanency plan, efforts to find permanent homes for children, addressing health care and education needs. The legislation aims to address the health care and education needs of children in foster care, ensure a successful transition to adulthood, and provide support services such as housing, health insurance, education, employment, and mentoring. The legislation aims to address the health care and education needs of children in foster care, ensure a successful transition to adulthood, and provide support services such as housing, health insurance, education, employment, and mentoring. It also focuses on responding to child and youth victims of sex trafficking, those at risk of sex trafficking, and runaway foster care children by implementing protocols and ensuring program coordination under the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services Program. The establishment of a case review system is crucial to meeting Title IV-E plan requirements, including specific procedures for case planning and regular review of the child's status and permanency goal. These requirements apply to all states, territories, and tribes, with details outlined in the report. The Title IV-E program requires states to prioritize a child's safety and health in decisions regarding family preservation or reunification. The government can intervene to protect children when their safety is at risk, but parents have a fundamental right to raise their children as they choose. States must make \"reasonable efforts\" to prevent a child's removal from home and prioritize keeping children safe with their parents. The Title IV-E program prioritizes a child's safety and health in decisions regarding family preservation or reunification. Children in foster care should be placed in living arrangements close to their parents' home. A written case plan must be developed to improve conditions in the parents' home, facilitate the child's return home, and address the child's needs while in foster care. Youth in care at age 14 must also be involved in the case plan development. The Title IV-E agency must safeguard parental rights regarding the child's removal from home, placement changes, and visitation privileges. The child welfare agency must ensure a child's safety in foster care by describing the placement setting in the written case plan. The foster care placement must be the least restrictive and most appropriate setting for the child, balancing safety with access to age-appropriate activities. States must establish licensing requirements for foster homes to ensure quality services and protect children's health and safety. States must establish licensing requirements for foster family homes and facilities, conduct background checks of prospective foster and adoptive parents, and provide training on understanding children's developmental stages and using a \"reasonable and prudent parent standard\" for age-appropriate activities. States may determine specific licensing standards for different foster care settings. The state's foster care licensing standards must align with national recommendations and cover safety, sanitation, admissions, and civil rights. They must also incorporate the reasonable and prudent parent standard for decision-making by caregivers. Foster care facilities under state contract must have at least one authorized caregiver on-site to apply this standard. Foster care licensing standards must align with national recommendations and cover safety, sanitation, admissions, and civil rights. They must also incorporate the reasonable and prudent parent standard for decision-making by caregivers. Foster parents must receive training on the standard. Licensing standards must be periodically reviewed for appropriateness and apply to all foster family home settings. Title IV-E agencies may grant waivers for non-safety-related standards on a case-by-case basis for placement with relatives. Some states do not permit licensing waivers for relatives to become foster parents, while others do. In FY2009, states issued varying numbers of waivers for relative licensing standards, with some granting exemptions for sleeping arrangements, space requirements, and caregiver training. Waivers also allowed for more children in the home, different ages, and extensions for completing training and health evaluations. Some states granted waivers for income requirements, caregiver age, and water testing. The Title IV-E requirement mandates fingerprint-based background checks for prospective foster or adoptive parents and relative guardians before placement of a child. This is separate from state licensing processes and cannot be waived. State child welfare agencies must conduct background checks on prospective foster or adoptive parents and relative guardians before placing a child, regardless of whether the child will receive Title IV-E assistance. If federal support is sought under Title IV-E, placement cannot be approved if the criminal background check shows certain crimes committed by the prospective caregiver. Information on child abuse and neglect cases may not be found in criminal records but could be in state abuse and neglect registries, which must also be checked by Title IV-E agencies. State child welfare agencies must conduct background checks on prospective foster or adoptive parents and relative guardians before placing a child, regardless of Title IV-E eligibility. Information from child abuse and neglect registries of other states where the caregiver lived in the past five years must also be requested. Placing children with kin is a way to preserve family connections, and keeping siblings together is also important. Title IV-E agencies are responsible for ensuring these practices are followed. Title IV-E agencies must prioritize placing children in foster care with adult relatives who meet state child protection standards. Within 30 days of a child's removal from parental custody, states must identify and notify adult relatives of the child's situation and options for participation in the child's care. The method of notification is not specified by law, but states are encouraged to use multiple approaches. HHS encourages states to use multiple methods to notify adult relatives about foster care placement. States must describe licensing requirements for foster homes and available services. Some states still have differences in licensing practices for relatives. The child welfare system allows adult relatives to provide care for children without needing to provide autobiographical information or become licensed foster parents. Relatives may receive financial support from parents, Social Security, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Federal law requires states to help children maintain connections with siblings, and Congress amended Title IV-E plan requirements to include notifying all parents of a sibling of a child's removal from the home. Since October 2009, states must place siblings removed from their home in the same foster care, adoption, or guardianship living arrangement, or facilitate frequent visitation. Exceptions can be made if it's contrary to safety. Sibling contact should occur at least once a month, with federal reimbursement available for transportation costs under the Title IV-E program. A written case plan for a child in foster care must be developed within a \"reasonable\" time period after removal, addressing safety, placement, services, and permanency. It must include health and education records, ensure educational stability, and undergo administrative or court review every six months. The case plan for a child in foster care must be reviewed every six months to assess safety, placement, compliance with the plan, and progress towards reunification or adoption. Updates to the plan are necessary after each review, with additional checks for children under the APPLA permanency plan. \"Courts must regularly review the permanency plan for children in foster care, with an initial hearing within 12 months of entry to foster care. Subsequent hearings occur every 12 months to determine the child's plan for return to parents, adoption, legal guardianship, or another permanent living arrangement.\" A court may determine a child's permanency plan as \"another planned permanent living arrangement\" only with a compelling reason. Starting September 29, 2015, this plan cannot be chosen for children under 16 years old. For more details on APPLA and related provisions, refer to \"Requirements for Youth in Care with the Permanency Plan 'APPLA'.\" The law allows Title IV-E agencies to pursue concurrent planning for children in foster care, aiming to find adoptive or guardianship placements while also working on reunification efforts with the family. If reunification is not possible, the agency must make efforts to secure a new permanent home through adoption, legal guardianship, or placement with a relative. HHS considers children reunited if they return home or live with a relative without legal guardianship. In FY2013, 59% of children leaving care were reunited with their families. In FY2013, 59% of children leaving care were reunited with their families, with 51% reuniting with parents and 8% living with another relative. Adoption is considered for children who cannot be reunited, with Title IV-E agencies required to initiate termination of parental rights proceedings for timely adoption placement. When filing for TPR, the Title IV-E agency must identify, prepare, and approve an adoptive family for the child. TPR is governed by state laws, with standards for involuntary parental rights termination. Title IV-E agencies must ensure availability of adoptive homes regardless of race or geography and notify prospective parents of tax benefits. Adoption or foster care placement cannot be delayed or denied based on race, color, or national origin of prospective parents. The agency must have procedures for timely placement of children across state lines and inform potential adoptive parents of the federal adoption tax credit. States may also enter into kinship guardianship assistance agreements for children who cannot return home or be adopted. The establishment of legal guardianship for a child by a foster parent does not require termination of parental rights. States offering Title IV-E kinship guardianship must amend their plan accordingly. Additionally, certain findings must be included in the child's case plan if kinship guardianship is determined to be the permanency plan. The Title IV-E agency discusses guardianship with the child's parent, reasons for sibling separation, and eligibility for kinship guardianship assistance. Title IV-E funds cannot be used for education or medical needs but must maintain health and education records, ensure school enrollment, and plan for educational stability. Under Title IV-B, a health oversight plan must be developed for each child in foster care. To receive HHS approval for a Title IV-E plan, state child welfare agencies must also have an approved Child Welfare Services plan under Title IV-B, Subpart 1. States must regularly update health and education records of children in foster care and provide them to foster parents. Some states do not always compile these records completely or provide them to foster parents, requiring better planning and communication to ensure compliance with federal privacy laws. The Uninterrupted Scholars Act (P.L. 112-278), enacted in January 2013, allows educational agencies to share education records of children in foster care with child welfare agencies without parental consent. This law also permits the release of education records during child abuse or neglect hearings without notifying the parents. The education information received by child welfare agencies must only be used to address the educational needs of children in foster care. States must ensure that school-age children receiving Title IV-E assistance without a high school diploma are enrolled in school and take steps to ensure educational stability for children entering or moving within foster care. Coordination between child welfare agencies and local educational agencies is required by federal law, but not vice versa. The Department of Education (ED) has collaborated with state child welfare agencies to address the educational needs of children in foster care through various initiatives, including hosting a summit in November 2011 and issuing joint letters in August 2011 and May 2014. Compliance with the educational stability requirements of the Fostering Connections Act requires routine coordination between state child welfare agencies and local educational agencies (LEAs). States can claim federal reimbursement for transportation costs under the Title IV-E program to support Title IV-E eligible children in foster care. States can seek reimbursement for transportation costs to enable Title IV-E eligible children in foster care to remain in their school of origin. This can be done as part of the Title IV-E program administrative costs submitted to HHS or as part of the child's foster care maintenance payment. Most state child welfare agencies pay for these transportation costs and seek federal Title IV-E funding for reimbursement. However, states cannot claim Title IV-E reimbursement for school transportation costs on behalf of children in foster care. State child welfare agencies must consider the proximity of a child's education setting when placing them in foster care. The law was amended in 2008 to include additional requirements for setting appropriateness and coordination with LEAs. The outcome of \"Children receive appropriate services to meet their educational needs\" was achieved in 87% of child welfare cases reviewed. Challenges to achieving this education outcome were reported. Common challenges to achieving education outcomes for children in foster care include failure to assess or address their educational needs, difficulties in maintaining or coordinating educational services, and communication issues among schools and child welfare agencies. Youth who age out of foster care have lower educational attainment and employment outcomes. Title IV-E plan requirements apply to all children in foster care, with some specific to age. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act expands Title IV-E plan requirements for older children in foster care, lowering the age to 14 and adding new transition services for youth aging out of care. Effective date for changes is generally September 29, 2015. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act, effective September 29, 2015, added youth-specific requirements focusing on engagement and empowerment. These include informing youth of their rights regarding education, health, visitation, court participation, access to key documents, and the right to stay safe. The Act also emphasizes youth participation in case and permanency planning, allowing them to select individuals to be part of the planning process. The new requirements under the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act focus on equipping youth in foster care for success, starting at age 14. States must provide credit reports to youth in care at age 14 or older to prevent identity fraud. Additionally, states must work with youth aging out of foster care to develop transition plans covering housing, education, mentoring, employment, and healthcare decision making. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act requires states to provide youth in foster care with credit reports at age 14 to prevent identity fraud. Additionally, states must assist youth aging out of care with transition plans covering housing, education, mentoring, employment, and healthcare decision making. P.L. 113-183 mandates states to provide key documents to youth aging out, including a U.S. birth certificate, Social Security card, and driver's license, if eligible and in care for at least six months. The federal child welfare policy was amended to prevent assigning a permanency plan of \"another planned permanent living arrangement\" (APPLA) to children in foster care under 16 years old. The APPLA provisions aim to ensure thoughtful planning before long-term stays in foster care. Children in foster care may be assigned APPLA as a permanency plan, which does not provide a specific pathway for them to leave foster care and live with a permanent family. Around 9% of children in foster care did not have a specific plan for leaving care as of FY2013. APPLA is not allowed as a permanency plan for youth aged 16 or older, and additional requirements were established to ensure proper planning by state child welfare agencies. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) mandates state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for finding permanent families for children with an APPLA designation, consulting children on their desired permanency outcome, applying the reasonable and prudent parent standard, and providing age-appropriate activities. It also requires protocols for addressing sex trafficking and runaway cases in foster care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) requires state child welfare agencies to develop procedures to identify and provide services for children at risk of sex trafficking. This includes victims of sex trafficking as defined by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) mandates state child welfare agencies to create procedures for identifying and assisting children vulnerable to sex trafficking. These procedures must include training for caseworkers and collaboration with various agencies and organizations. State agencies must report child or youth victims of sex trafficking to law enforcement within 24 hours of receiving information, effective two years after the law's enactment. Additionally, agencies must provide annual reports on these cases within three years of the law's enactment. State child welfare agencies must report annually to HHS the total number of children and youth who are sex trafficking victims. Procedures to identify and provide services for victims of sex trafficking apply to all children in the care of the state agency, including those in foster care, under age 18, with open case files, receiving CFCIP services, and those who run away from foster care. States report thousands of children in foster care as runaways, with 4,450 children running away on the last day of FY2013. Over 1,000 of these children were formally discharged from state responsibility. Youth who run away from care are at increased risk for sexual exploitation. The P.L. 113-183 requires state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating missing foster care children, addressing factors contributing to running away, investigating possible sex trafficking, and reporting information as of September 29, 2015. The P.L. 113-183 mandates state child welfare agencies to report information on missing and abducted children to NCMEC and law enforcement within 24 hours. Reporting must include children in foster care, receiving services from the agency, or under the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program, starting no later than September 29, 2016. The federal law mandates state Title IV-E agencies to operate a program under Title IV-B, subpart 1 of the Social Security Act, ensuring child protections for all children in foster care, regardless of eligibility criteria. This requirement has been in place since the establishment of the Title IV-E program in 1980. HHS guidance states that a Title IV-E agency must also operate a Title IV-B, Subpart 1 program to receive approval for their Title IV-E plan. This plan includes case review protections for all children in foster care and ensures appropriate services are available. Administrative procedures under the Title IV-E plan include operating the program statewide and setting goals for children in care for 25 months or more. The curr_chunk discusses reporting instances of child abuse or neglect, protecting confidentiality of child welfare records, reviewing foster care payment rates, negotiating with Indian tribes for Title IV-E program administration, and allowing fair hearings for individuals. The Title IV-E agency must ensure fair hearings for individuals, claim child support payments for children in foster care, verify citizenship or immigration status, coordinate with related programs, establish personnel standards, evaluate program activities, conduct independent audits, and provide reports to HHS as needed."
