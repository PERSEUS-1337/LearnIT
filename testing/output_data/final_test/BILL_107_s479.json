Any remaining funds can be transferred to the State for other uses. The \"Make Every Vote Count Act\" allows for the replacement of voting systems with advanced systems to reduce errors and eventually transition to a single advanced system in the State. The chief election official must determine the advanced system within 60 days of receiving a grant under this section. The \"Make Every Vote Count Act\" requires States receiving grants to match 20% of the grant amount with State or local funds.

The State election official must notify local officials of grant availability and disburse funds to eligible voting areas based on a formula that matches the total amount received by the State under the grant program. The State election official distributes grant funds to eligible voting areas based on a formula that considers the number of applicable voting systems in use. The determination of the number of voting systems is made by the Commission in a reasonable manner, with paper ballot systems based on the number of registered voters. The eligible State can opt out of receiving grant funds under this section by notifying the Commission within 30 days of the Act's enactment.
