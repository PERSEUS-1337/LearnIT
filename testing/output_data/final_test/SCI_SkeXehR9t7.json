A new graph-to-sequence neural encoder-decoder architecture is introduced, utilizing LSTM with attention to convert graphs to sequences. Node and graph embeddings are generated using a graph-based neural network with edge direction information. An attention mechanism aligns node embeddings with the decoding sequence for better performance on large graphs. Our model introduces a bi-directional node embedding aggregation strategy to improve performance on large graphs. It outperforms existing graph neural networks, Seq2Seq, and Tree2Seq models, achieving state-of-the-art results on tasks like bAbI, Shortest Path, and Natural Language Generation. The Seq2Seq technique excels in tasks like Neural Machine Translation and Speech Recognition but struggles with graph inputs. Our model converges rapidly to optimal performance by utilizing encoder-decoder architecture and continuous vector representations. Many enhancements like Bi-RNN or Bi-LSTM as encoder and attention mechanism have been proposed to improve Seq2Seq models. However, Seq2Seq models are limited to sequence inputs, while many problems require more complex structures like graphs. For example, in NLG applications, translating graph-structured semantic representations to text is a challenge. Representation such as Abstract Meaning Representation can be converted to text expressing its meaning. Path planning for mobile robots and path finding for question answering can also be seen as graph-to-sequence problems. Adding additional information to raw inputs, such as dependency parsing trees, can improve performance in tasks like semantic parsing. A more powerful encoder is needed to handle graph-to-sequence tasks effectively. To address graph-to-sequence problems, researchers have explored various approaches to incorporate additional information, such as extracting syntactic information and utilizing attention mechanisms. These methods aim to improve the performance of sequence models when dealing with complex structured data represented as graphs. Graph2Seq is a novel attention-based neural network architecture for graph-to-sequence learning. It consists of a graph encoder and a sequence decoder, aiming to learn expressive node embeddings and reassemble them into corresponding graph embeddings. Inspired by recent graph representation learning methods, it utilizes an inductive graph-based neural network to learn node embeddings from node attributes through aggregation of neighborhood information for directed and undirected graphs. The curr_chunk discusses the design of an attention-based RNN sequence decoder for graph-to-sequence learning, with a focus on aligning and translating based on context vectors. The code and data for this model are available online. The main contributions include proposing a new neural network paradigm for this task. The curr_chunk introduces a new attention-based neural networks paradigm for graph-to-sequence learning, utilizing a novel graph encoder and attention mechanism to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. Graph representation learning is essential for graph-based analysis and prediction tasks. It aims to embed nodes into a low-dimensional vector space using matrix factorization-based algorithms and random walk-based methods. These approaches train embeddings for individual nodes jointly for transductive learning. The family of work focuses on using random walk-based methods to learn low-dimensional embeddings of nodes in large-scale graphs. GraphSAGE is a technique that learns node embeddings through aggregation from local neighborhoods, with the capability to generate embeddings for unseen data. The graph encoder extends GraphSAGE by handling both directed and undirected graphs and using different aggregation functions for forward and backward nodes. It also utilizes pooling-based and supernode-based schemes for reassembling the graph. The text discusses the advantages of a graph encoder over GraphSAGE in generating graph embeddings using pooling-based and supernode-based schemes. It also mentions the recent surge in approaches using Graph Neural Networks to learn representations of graph nodes. Graph convolutional networks (GCN) based on spectral graph theory have gained increasing interest recently. These approaches, including a fast localized convolution extension, have limitations with large graphs, which are addressed by a first-order approximation of spectral graph convolution and important sampling for a fast GCN. Comparisons are made with GCN designed for semi-supervised learning in a transductive setting. The text also mentions a mathematical relationship between an extension of GCN and a variant of the graph encoder on undirected graphs. Our approach, Graph2Seq, is a generative model that learns a mapping between graph inputs and sequence outputs. It differs from GGS-NNs, which is a prediction model for sequences embedded in graphs. The Seq2Seq model has been successful in various applications, including translating images to sentences. The Graph2Seq model learns a mapping from graph inputs to sequence outputs, addressing limitations of Seq2Seq with specialized neural models like Tree2Seq and Set2Seq. Recent research efforts focus on leveraging external information for more complex data, often represented in graphs rather than sequences. The Graph2Seq model introduces a novel general-purpose encoder-decoder architecture for graph-to-sequence learning, utilizing graph embedding techniques and a node attention mechanism. This model differs from previous research by not requiring domain-specific information and designing its own graph decoder. The Graph2Seq model utilizes a graph encoder to generate node embeddings and graph embeddings, followed by a sequence decoder with attention over node embeddings for sequence generation. It introduces a node-embedding generation algorithm for deriving bi-directional node embeddings and proposes methods for generating graph embeddings capturing whole-graph information. The model also includes a new inductive node embedding algorithm that aggregates information from local forward and backward neighborhoods within K hops for directed and undirected graphs. The node embedding generation algorithm categorizes neighbors into forward and backward neighbors based on edge direction. Aggregating forward representations of neighbors heavily affects performance. The node embedding generation algorithm categorizes neighbors into forward and backward neighbors based on edge direction. The choice of aggregator AGGREGATE k significantly impacts performance. At iteration k, the aggregator uses representations from k-1. The forward representation of each node is its feature vector calculated in step (1); DISPLAYFORM1, concatenated with the neighborhood vector h k N (v). This concatenated vector is passed through a fully connected layer with a nonlinear activation function \u03c3 to update the forward representation of v, h k v. The backward representation h k v is updated similarly, and this process is repeated K times to obtain the final bi-directional representation of v. The algorithm categorizes neighbors into forward and backward based on edge direction. Aggregator architectures are used to learn distinct aggregators at each iteration. Three aggregator functions are examined: Mean aggregator, LSTM aggregator, and Pooling. LSTMs are used to operate on unordered sets by applying them to a random permutation of node neighbors. In this work, two approaches are introduced to generate graph embeddings from node embeddings: Pooling-based and Node-based. The Pooling-based approach explores max-pooling, min-pooling, and other techniques to capture different information across the neighborhood set. Graph embeddings are crucial for conveying entire graph information to downstream decoders. In the Node-based Graph Embedding approach, a super node is added to the input graph, with all other nodes directing to it. The graph embedding is generated by aggregating the neighbor nodes' embeddings, using a sequence decoder like a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict the next token. The RNN hidden state si for time i and context vector ci depend on node representations z1,...,zV from the input graph. The context vector ci is a weighted sum of these node representations, with weights \u03b1ij computed by an alignment model a. The alignment model scores the match between input and output positions based on the RNN hidden state si\u22121 and the j-th node representation. The model is jointly trained with other components to maximize the log-probability of the correct description from a source graph. In the inference phase, beam search with a size of 5 is used to generate a sequence. Experiments show the effectiveness of the method compared to LSTM, GGS-NN, and GCN on selected tasks. The model is trained using Adam optimizer with a mini-batch size of 30 and a learning rate of 0.001. In the setup, the model is trained using Adam optimizer with a mini-batch size of 30 and a learning rate of 0.001. Dropout strategy is applied at the decoder layer with a ratio of 0.5 to prevent overfitting. Gradients are clipped when their norm exceeds 20. The graph encoder parameters are set with default values, while the decoder has 1 layer with a hidden state size of 80. The model utilizes mean aggregator and pooling-based graph embeddings for better performance. Task 19 (Path Finding) in bAbI AI tasks is considered the most challenging. Task 19 (Path Finding) is the most challenging task in bAbI AI tasks, with an accuracy of less than 20% for methods without strong supervision. The description is transformed into a graph, where the goal is to find the geographical path between two objects. The question is treated as finding the shortest path between two nodes representing the objects in the graph. The model annotates the nodes with text attributes and utilizes Graph2Seq to tackle the problem. In GGS-NN, node features like START and END are initialized as one-hot vectors for shortest path tasks. Edge information is aggregated into node embeddings by adding edge nodes with text attributes. Our model uses an end-to-end approach for node feature generation, outperforming GGS-NN in considering information flows in a graph. Our graph encoder demonstrates expressive power by considering information flows in both directions. Comparing our Graph2Seq model to GCN with our decoder shows potential information loss in GCN when converting directed graphs to undirected ones. We evaluate our model on the Shortest Path Task, creating datasets with random graphs and pairs of nodes connected by a unique shortest directed path. The performance of each model is tested by increasing the size of generated graphs. The Graph2Seq model outperforms the LSTM model on datasets with small and large graphs. It achieves comparable performance with GGS-NN on small graphs and better performance on larger graphs. The graph encoder's dual-direction aggregators help maintain good performance as the graph size increases. The Graph2Seq model outperforms GGS-NN and GCN in handling long-range dependencies in large graphs. It excels in translating structured SQL queries to natural language, leveraging graph-to-sequence models for this task. The Graph2Seq model outperforms Seq2Seq and Tree2Seq baselines in translating SQL queries to natural language, showing superior performance in handling the graph structure of SQL queries. The Graph2Seq model outperforms Seq2Seq and Tree2Seq in translating SQL queries to natural language by capturing more information directly in a graph structure. Two variants of Graph2Seq models show significant improvement over Tree2Seq, indicating the usefulness of a general graph to sequence model. Graph2Seq-PGE performs better than Graph2Seq-NGE, possibly due to the latter introducing unnecessary noise with a super node in the graph topology. Investigating the impact of aggregator and hop size on the Graph2Seq model is essential. Following the investigation of the impact of aggregators and hop size on the Graph2Seq model, three synthetic datasets were created with different graph structures. Each dataset consisted of 10000 graphs split into training, development, and test sets. Six variants of the Graph2Seq model were created with different aggregation strategies for node embedding generation. The Graph2Seq model utilizes different aggregators to aggregate node neighbor information, with Graph2Seq-MA and Graph2Seq-PA showing the best performance on the SDP SEQ dataset. Graph2Seq-MA also outperforms other variants on more complex structured data like SDP DAG and SDP DCG, as it captures information from both directions for better node embeddings. Graph2Seq-MA-F and Graph2Seq-MA-B achieve comparable performance to Graph2Seq-MA on SDP DCG, with 90% of nodes able to reach each other within a given hop size. Increasing the hop size improves performance for all Graph2Seq variants, with Graph2Seq-MA showing better results with smaller hop sizes. Graph2Seq-MA can achieve the same performance as Graph2Seq-MA-F or Graph2Seq-MA-B with a smaller hop size, which is beneficial for large graphs. Even with the same hop size, Graph2Seq-MA-F or Graph2Seq-MA-B outperforms GCN, highlighting the importance of considering both directed and undirected graphs. Experimental results on the impact of hop size for different graph sizes can be found in TAB9 in Appendix C. The impact of the attention mechanism on the Graph2Seq model is also evaluated on various datasets. The Graph2Seq model performance significantly improves with the attention strategy, enhancing handling of large graphs. The proposed Graph2Seq model utilizes a bi-directional node embedding aggregation strategy to successfully learn representations for directed acyclic, directed cyclic, and sequence-styled graphs. The Graph2Seq model outperforms existing graph neural networks, Seq2Seq, and Tree2Seq baselines on various tasks using directed graphs. Introducing an attention mechanism improves the model's ability to generate correct target sequences from large graphs. The algorithm for Graph2Seq involves inputting a graph, node initial feature vectors, weight matrices, non-linearity functions, aggregator functions, and neighborhood functions to output vector representations. Algorithm 1 describes the process of generating embeddings for a graph using neighborhood functions and initial feature vectors for nodes. The forward and backward representations of nodes are updated through fully connected layers with nonlinear activation functions. The representations of each node are concatenated to be used in natural language generation tasks with Graph2Seq, Seq2Seq, and Tree2Seq models. In this section, we describe representations of an SQL query as a sequence, tree, and graph. A simple template is applied to construct the SQL query sequence. The SQL Parser tool is used to convert the query to a tree, with SELECT LIST and WHERE CLAUSE as child nodes. The SQL query is also transformed into a graph using the SELECT Clause. In constructing an SQL query, nodes are created for SELECT clause, column names, aggregation functions, and WHERE clause conditions. Logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT are represented as nodes connecting column nodes, with aggregation nodes connecting to column nodes for functions like count or max. Constraints with the same attributes are integrated, forming a structured representation of the query. The node embedding generation in Algorithm 1 involves aggregator choice, hop size, and neighborhood function. Two datasets, SDP 100 and SDP 1000, were created to study the impact of hop size. Three models, Graph2Seq-MA-F, Graph2Seq-MA-B, and Graph2Seq-MA, were evaluated on these datasets with results in TAB9. The performance of Graph2Seq-MA-F and Graph2Seq-MA-B improves with increasing hop size on datasets SDP 100 and SDP 1000. The ideal hop size for best performance aligns with the graph diameter, ensuring nodes aggregate information from all reachable nodes. Graph2Seq-MA benefits from increasing hop size, reaching peak performance at a smaller hop size compared to Graph2Seq-MA-F. For instance, on the SDP 100 dataset, Graph2Seq-MA achieves 99.2% accuracy with a hop size greater than 4, while Graph2Seq-MA-F needs a hop size greater than 7 for comparable accuracy. The minimum hop size for Graph2Seq-MA to achieve optimal performance aligns with the average radii of the graphs. The main difference between Graph2Seq-MA and Graph2Seq-MA-F lies in how they aggregate information from backward nodes. The performance difference in Graph2Seq models lies in aggregating information from forward and backward nodes, showing the utility of attention strategy for handling large graphs efficiently. The neighborhood function in node embedding generation returns directly connected neighbor nodes of a given node. To prevent high training times on large graphs, a sampling method is proposed to randomly select a fixed number of neighbor nodes for information aggregation at each hop."
