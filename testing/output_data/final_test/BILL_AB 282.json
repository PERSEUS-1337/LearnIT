    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California enacts legislation due to the significant risk of injury, particularly strangulation, to young children from accessible window covering cords. The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission has identified window coverings as a top hidden home hazard, with numerous injuries and fatal strangulations recorded among children eight years and younger. The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission found that voluntary standards for window coverings were not effective in preventing 57% of incidents from 1996 to 2012. Manufacturers have been producing safer window coverings to eliminate hazardous cords. California aims to enact legislation to protect children from cord strangulation hazards. The Business and Professions Code defines terms related to corded window coverings, including accessible cord and corded window covering. This legislation aims to address safety concerns regarding hazardous cords in window coverings. It is illegal to sell window coverings in California that do not meet safety standards set by the 2012 American National Standard. Starting January 1, 2018, facilities serving children under six years old are prohibited from installing corded window coverings. By January 1, 2019, facilities serving children under six years old in California must remove or retrofit corded window coverings with approved repair kits. Non-compliance may result in replacement with cordless window coverings meeting safety standards. Section 1596.848 of the Health and Safety Code prohibits child day care facilities serving children under six years old from installing corded window coverings. By January 1, 2019, these facilities must remove or retrofit corded window coverings with approved repair kits to ensure safety standards are met. If non-compliance occurs, the department may mandate replacing corded window coverings with cordless ones meeting safety standards. The act does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution as any costs incurred by local agencies or school districts would be due to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
