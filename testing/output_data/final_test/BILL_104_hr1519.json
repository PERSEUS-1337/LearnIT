The Secretary prescribes percentages for new and existing buildings to yield credit amounts over a 10-year period. Distressed areas receive increased credits with adjusted percentages. The section defines a \"qualified distressed area building\" as a non-residential building located in a distressed area where 70% or more of households have an income 80% or less of the area median gross income. Eligible basis of a building is determined according to specific rules. Rehabilitation expenditures for a building are treated as a separate new building, defined as amounts incurred for property in connection with the building's rehabilitation, excluding the cost of acquiring the building. Rehabilitation expenditures must be at least 10 percent of the building's adjusted basis over a 24-month period to qualify for tax credits. Special rules similar to section 42(e) apply.

The State distressed area building credit ceiling for each calendar year is allocated to the housing credit agency of the State, treating multiple agencies as a single entity. The ceiling is determined by multiplying $1.25 by the State population and adding any unused credits from previous years.
