    "content": "A new section is added to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, providing a credit for employer costs of providing mammography screening. A new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 offers a credit for employer costs of providing mammography screening. The credit allows 50% of qualified mammography screening costs to be deducted from the tax imposed for the taxable year. Qualified costs include payments for screening mammography conducted according to required frequency and quality standards. Screening mammography is a radiologic procedure for early detection of breast cancer. The paragraph includes details about the required frequency for screening mammography, which is annually unless specified otherwise. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Director of the National Cancer Institute, periodically reviews the appropriate frequency based on age and other relevant factors. The Secretary may revise the frequency of screening mammography as needed, with quality standards established to ensure safety and accuracy of the procedure. The equipment used must meet specific radiologic standards set by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The mammography must be performed and interpreted by licensed or certified individuals as specified by the Secretary in regulations. The first screening mammography must be interpreted by a certified individual recognized by the Secretary, and results must be stored in the woman's medical records. A partnership is considered the employer of each partner who is an employee. The term 'employee' includes self-employed individuals. The tax credit for any taxable year cannot exceed the regular tax reduced by certain credits. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. The amendments made by this section provide a tax credit for employer costs for mammography screening, effective for taxable years after the enactment of this Act."
