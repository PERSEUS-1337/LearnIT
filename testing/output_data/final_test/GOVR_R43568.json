    "content": "The U.S. corporate income tax is based on worldwide economic activity, creating complications for tax compliance. Corporations may strategically organize to reduce tax liabilities through methods like expatriation, inversions, and mergers. This report discusses how inversions were structured, legislative efforts to reduce their benefits, and remaining methods for inverting to achieve tax savings. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 made it harder to achieve tax savings through inversions by restricting tax benefits and requiring substantial business operations in the new headquarters location. Despite this legislation, some companies have still successfully inverted by merging or using the business operations mechanism. In 2014, several high-profile companies expressed interest in merging with non-U.S. firms. In 2014, several high-profile companies, including Pfizer, Chiquita, and Omnicom, expressed interest in merging with non-U.S. firms. Walgreens investors also urged a merger, but it did not materialize. Other firms in the medical device and pharmaceutical fields, such as Medtronics, Salix, AbbVie, Mylan, and Hospira, announced mergers with headquarters shifts. Burger King's talks to merge with Tim Hortons, a Canadian firm, with headquarters in Canada, drew attention. In September 2014, the Treasury Department released regulatory changes to restrict inversions, leading to cancellations of merger plans by firms like AbbVie and Chiquita. Despite new merger proposals, the Treasury announced additional restrictions in November 2015. Pfizer's merger with Allergan was terminated due to new regulations in April 2016. Concerns about erosion of the U.S. tax base were raised as some inversions continued with ownership structured below 60%. The Treasury regulations have limited the substantial business avenue for U.S. firms, but the option to merge with smaller foreign companies still exists. Acquisitions by foreigners decreased in 2016 and 2017, with significant declines in countries like Ireland. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made major changes to corporate and international tax rules in December 2017. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made revisions to discourage inversions, with some companies like Assurant, Inc. deciding to retain their headquarters in the United States. Dana, Inc. announced plans to merge and move its headquarters to the U.K., avoiding anti-inversion penalties due to U.S. shareholders owning less than 60% of the merged entity. The U.S. taxes both worldwide income of U.S. corporations and income of foreign firms earned within its borders at a reduced statutory tax rate of 21%. Under pre-Act law, U.S. corporate income earned outside the U.S. was also subject to U.S. taxation. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act replaced the previous system of deferring U.S. tax on active income earned abroad with a new system called Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). This new system taxes foreign source income of U.S. subsidiaries currently, with exemptions and deductions to reduce tax rates on foreign earnings. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act introduced the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) system to tax foreign income of U.S. subsidiaries. The Act also implemented the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse tax (BEAT) to prevent profit shifting between foreign parents and U.S. subsidiaries. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act introduced stricter thin capitalization rules to prevent profit shifting through interest deductions. The new law lowers the cap to 30% of profits and eliminates the exemption based on debt-to-asset ratio. Additionally, the Act included provisions to discourage corporate inversions, where a U.S. corporation changes its country of residence. After a U.S. corporation undergoes a corporate inversion, it becomes a subsidiary of a foreign parent company to benefit from lower tax rates. This can be achieved through various methods such as merging with a larger or smaller foreign firm. The new foreign parent company can then enjoy reduced taxes on foreign-source income. By structuring foreign operations as subsidiaries of the foreign parent in a territorial tax country, future foreign income can be tax-exempt. Additionally, accumulated and future foreign income from the U.S. company's foreign subsidiaries can be repatriated tax-free through various financial strategies. The foreign parent company can repatriate income tax-free through financial strategies like lending to the related foreign firm or engaging in earnings stripping to reduce U.S. taxes paid. Intercompany debt, royalty payments, and transfer pricing are common methods for earnings stripping. In a naked inversion, a U.S. corporation creates a foreign subsidiary through a stock exchange, resulting in a foreign corporation with a U.S. subsidiary. This allows the U.S. corporation to bolster its foreign operations and potentially lower its U.S. tax burden by merging with a larger foreign corporation, with U.S. shareholders owning a minority share of the new merged company. This shifts effective control outside the U.S. The merger between a U.S. corporation and a U.K. corporation resulted in the new company being controlled outside U.S. borders, driven by business and tax considerations. The decision was influenced by the favorable tax regime and tax treaties in the U.K., allowing for a global effective tax rate comparable to competitors. This form of inversion aims to strengthen foreign operations and reduce U.S. taxes by merging with a smaller foreign corporation. The U.S. corporation merges with a smaller foreign corporation, with U.S. shareholders owning a majority share of the new merged company, resulting in effective control staying with the U.S. shareholders. Tax considerations may drive this inversion, as seen in the Eaton Cooper merger where a new company is incorporated in Ireland with a lower tax rate. At the close of the merger, shareholders of the U.S. company would control 73% of the combined company, with Irish shareholders holding the remaining 27%. The merger aimed to achieve tax benefits of $165 million in 2016 out of $535 million in total cost savings. This strategy, known as a corporate inversion, involves reorganizing a company's structure to establish a foreign corporation as the parent entity, rather than a U.S.-chartered corporation. The corporate inversions involved high-profile companies like Ingersoll-Rand, Tyco, and Foster Wheeler, with little economic activity shifting abroad. The newly created parent corporations were often located in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, known for their lack of corporate income tax and strong legal infrastructure. A 2002 study by the U.S. Treasury Department noted that while inversions were not new, the statutory framework enabling them has long existed. The statutory framework enabling corporate inversions has long existed, with a marked increase in frequency, size, and visibility. Tax savings were a key goal, along with operational flexibility and access to international markets. Concerns include erosion of the U.S. tax base, cost advantages for foreign-controlled firms, and fairness of the tax system, leading to the enactment of anti-inversion provisions. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) introduced anti-inversion provisions, treating inverted foreign parent companies as domestic if owned by at least 80% of former parent's stockholders. The AJCA denied tax benefits for such cases, taxing them on worldwide income. For ownership continuity between 60% and 80%, U.S. toll taxes were imposed without offsetting foreign tax credits or net operating losses. AJCA also exempted corporations with substantial economic activity in foreign countries. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) introduced anti-inversion provisions, denying tax benefits for inverted foreign parent companies. It exempted corporations with substantial economic activity in foreign countries, but did not define what that meant. Post-2004, inversions no longer involved countries like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, focusing on larger countries like the U.K., Canada, and Ireland. The U.K. has become a more attractive headquarters due to freedom of movement rules. The U.K. has become an attractive headquarters due to freedom of movement rules in the EU, leading to a territorial tax system and lower corporate tax rates. A 2012 report in the Wall Street Journal noted 10 companies had inverted since 2009, with 6 in the past year. The report named Aon, ENSCO, Rowan, Eaton, and DE Master Blenders 1763 as recent movers. Eaton merged with Coopers, a firm that had inverted prior to the 2004 law change. Aon, ENSCO, and Rowan inverted to the UK for tax savings. The UK's territorial tax system and lower corporate rates made it attractive. Tim Hortons also used a naked inversion. In 2009, Tim Hortons used a naked inversion to relocate to Canada, returning to its Canadian origins after being acquired by Wendy's in 1995. DE Master Blenders 1763, a Netherlands firm, also returned to its origins after being spun off from Sara Lee. Treasury Regulations increased the safe harbor for substantial business activities from 10% to 25%, closing off this avenue for future inversions. Several mergers have been effectuated or proposed, including Chiquita. Several mergers have been effectuated or proposed, with companies like Chiquita, Actavis, Perrigo, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Endo Health Services, Liberty Global, Forest Labs, and Omnicom making moves to Ireland, Canada, and the U.K. Pfizer's attempt to acquire AstraZeneca and Walgreens' stockholders urging for inversion to Switzerland also garnered attention. Pfizer faced potential loss of future tax revenue, up to $1.4 billion per year, due to earnings abroad not being repatriated and taxed in the United States. Inverting to Switzerland could result in current shareholders paying capital gains taxes on stock appreciation. In 2014, policymakers and the public remained interested in inversions. Despite some mergers being canceled, others proceeded, such as Burger King's merger with Tim Hortons. Treasury continued to regulate inversions, closing loopholes where possible. In 2014, the Treasury Department took action to close a loophole that allowed Liberty Global shareholders to avoid capital gains taxes. Following this, several firms canceled merger plans and Medtronic changed financing plans. Some firms still announced inversion plans despite regulatory actions. The Treasury Department implemented regulations in 2014 to address loopholes in inversion transactions. These regulations limit access to foreign subsidiaries' earnings and restrict techniques allowing firms to qualify with less than 80% ownership. Future actions may target earnings stripping. Inversions involve foreign subsidiaries remaining under the U.S. parent, subjecting dividends to taxation. Other direct investments in U.S. property are treated as dividends. The regulation implemented in 2014 addresses methods of accessing earnings of overseas subsidiaries by transactions between a new foreign parent and a U.S. firm's foreign subsidiaries. It prevents access to funds through methods like \"hopscotching\" and \"decontrolling,\" where foreign acquiring corporations issue notes or transfer property for stock in U.S. firm's foreign subsidiaries. Acquiring any obligation or stock of a foreign related person is treated as U.S. property subject to tax under the regulation. The regulation implemented in 2014 prevents access to earnings of overseas subsidiaries through transactions between a new foreign parent and a U.S. firm's foreign subsidiaries. It addresses methods like \"hopscotching\" and \"decontrolling\" to avoid taxation on income. Acquisition of foreign subsidiary stock is treated as acquisition of stock in the U.S. parent to prevent tax benefits of an inversion. The regulation implemented in 2014 prevents tax benefits of an inversion by limiting techniques such as inflating the foreign firm and shrinking the U.S. firm to ensure shareholders retain less than 80% ownership in the new company. It disregards passive assets in the foreign firm and extraordinary dividends in the U.S. firm to achieve this goal. After the 2014 Treasury regulations were issued, some firms revised their plans to avoid inversion by spinning off part of a U.S. company to a newly formed foreign corporation. Some mergers were structured to bypass anti-inversion rules, with ownership shares below 60%. Examples of potential inversions include telecom firm Arris merging with Pace, CF Industries merging with OCI NB, Terex merging with Konecranes, and a consolidation of European Coca-Cola bottling firms. Waste Connections Inc. also merged with Progressive Waste Solutions Ltd, with 70% ownership and a headquarters in Canada. The proposed merger between Pfizer and Allergan, which would create the largest pharmaceutical company in the world, was not considered an inversion under tax law. Pfizer will own 56% of the new firm, and Allergan was formed through a merger involving stock and cash acquisition by Actavis. Actavis had previously inverted by merging with Warner Chillcott in 2013. In 2013, Actavis inverted by merging with Warner Chillcott, an Irish firm, with former U.S. firm shareholders acquiring 77% of the stock. Pfizer terminated its merger with Allergen after April 4, 2016 regulations. Other notable mergers included Salix acquired by Valeant, Auxilium by Endo, Cyberonics with Italy's Sorin, and Broadcom with Avago. HIS announced a merger with Markit Ltd, and Johnson Controls merged with Tyco. The 2015 Treasury regulations seem to have more limited impact. The 2015 Treasury regulations have limited consequences for inversions compared to the 2014 regulations. Three regulatory changes were made: disregarding stock issued by a third-country tax resident foreign parent, clarifying anti-stuffing rules, and requiring 25% of business activity in the foreign country where the new parent is created. The Treasury Department issued regulations in 2016 to limit corporate tax inversions, including rules targeting groups with a history of inversion transactions. The proposed merger between Pfizer and Allergen PLC was terminated in response to these regulations. The temporary regulations target inversion transactions involving a new foreign parent that previously acquired one or more U.S. entities in inversions or acquisitions, disregarding stock of the new foreign parent attributable to prior U.S. entity acquisitions. Americans for Tax Fairness analysis showed Pfizer's share of a merged company would have increased to roughly 70% from 56% prior to the rule. The multiple-step acquisition rule targets certain inversions structured as back-to-back foreign acquisitions. It applies to transactions where a foreign corporation acquires assets of a U.S. entity, followed by another foreign corporation acquiring the first foreign corporation. This rule can be applied to all acquisitions in the same plan without a time limit. Another rule restricts inverted companies from avoiding tax on unrealized gains through transfers to controlled foreign corporations. The rule on tax on unrealized gains (under Section 965) addresses situations where a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) of an inverted U.S. company engages in a postinversion exchange that could dilute a U.S. shareholder's indirect interest in the exchanged asset, allowing the shareholder to avoid U.S. tax on any realized gain not recognized at the time of transfer. The earnings-stripping regulations aim to restrict foreign-parent groups from shifting earnings out of the United States through certain related-party debt being characterized as equity for tax purposes, disallowing interest deductions. The regulations on equity classification disallow interest deductions and may result in a 30% withholding obligation. They require documentation for debt instruments within an expanded group and allow the IRS to classify instruments as part debt and part equity. Final regulations issued in 2016 removed the general bifurcation rule and exemption for foreign issuers. The Treasury issued final regulations in 2018 for debt-equity rules, with exemptions for certain entities. Pfizer withdrew from a merger due to the regulations, while other mergers proceeded. Several mergers were affected by regulations in 2018. CF Industries merger with OCI NV was called off, while Johnson Controls and Tyco proceeded. Konecranes scaled down its merger with Terex to an acquisition, Cardtronics announced a move to the U.K., and an oil and gas firm merged to form a U.K. company. Praxaire merged with Linde AG in 2017. The 2017 legislation made significant changes to corporate income treatment, especially for inverted corporations. Pfizer's CEO mentioned a hold on deals due to tax reform considerations. Untaxed earnings held abroad are now taxed under a deemed repatriation rule at lower rates. The tax reform legislation in 2017 introduced a recapture rule for newly inverted firms, increasing the tax rate to 35% for deemed repatriation. The Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) excludes certain payments but includes payments for cost of goods sold for firms inverting after November 9, 2017. Constructive ownership rules determine 10% U.S. shareholders and CFC status. The 2017 tax revision expanded rules on CFC status and relatedness tests, introducing downward attribution for stock ownership by foreign persons. This rule applies to U.S. entities, partnerships, and certain trusts where foreign ownership is present. Originally aimed at inversions, downward attribution prevents loss of CFC status when majority ownership shifts to a new foreign parent company. The 2017 tax revision introduced downward attribution for stock ownership by foreign persons, preventing loss of CFC status when ownership shifts to a new foreign parent. Dividends are subject to lower tax rates based on income brackets, with certain foreign dividends not eligible for these rates. An excise tax of 15% was imposed on stock compensation received by insiders in an expatriated firm. The 2017 tax revision introduced downward attribution for stock ownership by foreign persons, preventing loss of CFC status when ownership shifts to a new foreign parent. An excise tax of 15% on stock compensation for insiders in an expatriated corporation was increased to 20% upon enactment for corporations expatriating after that date. Some planned inversions, like Assurant, Inc. and Dana, Inc., were revised or called off, indicating a potential reversal of headquarters decisions. The AJCA initially limited \"naked inversions\" and the use of the substantial business activity test safe harbor. However, recent mergers have still been used for corporate inversions, resulting in U.K. parent companies due to policy decisions by the U.K. government. The U.K. lowered its corporate tax rate, adopted a territorial tax system, and weakened anti-abuse provisions for foreign source income. The U.K. has proposed taxing certain intangible income at a 10% rate, known as a patent box, and has weakened anti-abuse provisions for foreign source income. In 2017, important changes were made to the U.S. corporate tax system to address tax-motivated inversions. Interest in reforming the corporate income tax system has been long-standing, with a focus on the corporate tax rate and taxation of foreign-source earnings. The proposed merger of Forest Laboratories Inc. and Actavis in 2014 aimed to reduce taxes paid. In 2014, Forest Laboratories Inc. and Actavis aimed to reduce taxes through a merger, saving roughly $100 million per year. The U.S. corporate tax rate was lowered from 35% to 21% in 2017 to align with OECD rates and reduce incentives for tax inversions. However, further reductions may be impractical to completely stop inversions. A lower U.S. corporate tax rate reduces incentives for tax inversions by lowering taxes on repatriated earnings, benefiting companies like Pfizer with large foreign earnings. However, further reductions face challenges due to the need for revenue neutrality and potential consequences for investment. Reducing the corporate tax rate without base broadening could lead to lower tax revenue and budget deficits. The U.S. previously had a worldwide tax system, but changing to a territorial system was considered to prevent inversion decisions. Concerns about a territorial system include strain on transfer pricing and potential profit shifting. The U.S. shifted from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system to prevent inversion decisions. Concerns include profit shifting and strain on transfer pricing. The 2017 revisions maintained a worldwide system with changes, such as taxing U.S. subsidiaries at a lower rate and providing incentives for locating intangible assets in the U.S. The new tax regime in the United States may impact firms considering inversion, especially those with significant intangible assets. Moving towards a territorial tax system could reduce corporate tax revenue unless offset by other tax increases. GILTI is projected to raise $21 billion in 2027, and there are discussions about retaining it with a lower rate or making the temporary rate permanent. Adopting a territorial tax without anti-abuse provisions could lead to increased profit shifting by U.S. firms. Administrative remedies have been effective in slowing inversions. The history of proposals to discourage inversions includes extending rate recapture, restricting U.S. firms' ability to invert, and modifying ownership percentage tests. Administrative remedies have been successful in slowing inversions. The proposal aims to prevent corporate inversions by requiring the new foreign company to be managed outside the US and prohibiting substantial business activities in the US. Various bills in Congress, such as the Corporate EXIT Fairness Act and the Stop Corporate Inversions Act, have been introduced to treat mergers as US firms under certain conditions. Several bills introduced in Congress aim to address tax havens, deferral, and corporate inversions. These bills include provisions to prevent earnings stripping, disallow federal contracts for inverted firms, and make changes to the tax treatment of foreign source income. Additionally, the \"No Tax Break for Outsourcing Act\" would treat foreign corporations managed in the US as domestic corporations and limit interest deductions for inverted firms. The proposed bills in Congress aim to address tax havens, deferral, and corporate inversions by limiting interest deductions and earnings stripping. Former President Obama had also considered administrative changes to limit inversions. Steve Shay suggested regulatory actions to reclassify debt as equity to prevent excessive related party debt. The proposed bills aim to limit earnings stripping by reclassifying debt as equity in inversions. Other administrative proposals are no longer relevant or have been adopted in regulatory changes. The scope of Section 7874 could be expanded by treating certain stock as disqualified. Recognizing accumulated deferred earnings as currently taxable is also being considered. The proposed changes include tightening interest deduction restrictions, including foreign earnings immediately under Section 367, modernizing income rules for foreign firms, and monitoring trade activities in the US. The proposed changes aim to regulate business activities of foreign firms in the United States, particularly focusing on inversion transactions. Legislative proposals were introduced in 2014 to prevent inversions through mergers, with criteria such as U.S. stockholders owning 50% of shares or 25% of business activity being in the U.S. In 2014, legislative proposals were introduced to prevent inversions through mergers, with criteria such as U.S. stockholders owning 50% of shares or 25% of business activity in the U.S. Various bills in the 114th Congress included anti-inversion provisions to address tax haven abuses and restrict deferral benefits. In 2014, legislative proposals were introduced to prevent inversions through mergers, with criteria such as U.S. stockholders owning 50% of shares or 25% of business activity in the U.S. Various bills in the 114th Congress included anti-inversion provisions to address tax haven abuses and restrict deferral benefits. Additionally, proposals were made to treat corporations managed and controlled from the United States as domestic corporations regardless of their legal tax home or status as an inverted company, and to eliminate deferral for foreign source income. Legislative proposals in 2014 aimed to address earnings stripping by tightening rules on interest deductions, reducing the limit from 50% to 25%, and eliminating interest carryforwards. The proposals by Representative Levin and Senator Schumer targeted inverted firms and related party transactions to prevent untaxed investment of funds in the United States. In 2014, legislative proposals aimed to address earnings stripping by tightening rules on interest deductions for inverted firms. Senator Schumer introduced S. 2786, limiting interest deductions for firms where U.S. shareholders own more than 50%. Other bills, such as S. 922 and H.R. 1790, also included provisions on earnings stripping for firms with a foreign parent. Additionally, H.R. 5278 and S. 2704 sought to disallow federal contracts for inverted firms.

Additionally, S. 2704 sought to disallow federal contracts for inverted firms. Senator Wyden proposed draft legislation in September 2014, with retroactive changes to May 8, 2014."
