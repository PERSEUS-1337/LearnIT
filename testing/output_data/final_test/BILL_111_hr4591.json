    "content": "The \"Older Worker Opportunity Act of 2010\" may provide a tax credit for employing older workers in flexible work programs under the new section 45R of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The flexible work credit under section 38 for eligible employers is 25% of qualified wages. An eligible employer must maintain a qualified trust and provide health insurance coverage, paying at least 60% of the cost for full-time employees. Qualified wages are the wages paid to eligible individuals during the taxable year. The term 'eligible individual' refers to someone aged 62 or older participating in a formal flexible work program. However, individuals who start participating in such a program when over 20% of the employer's workforce already does so are not considered eligible. 'Wages' are defined as per section 3306(b). The term 'wages' excludes payments made after December 31, 2012. Only the first $6,000 of wages per year can be considered. Rules similar to section 51(c) apply. A 'formal flexible work program' is defined as a program of an eligible employer. A 'formal flexible work program' of an eligible employer consists of core time and flex time. Core time should not exceed 20 hours per week, 3 days per week, or 1,000 hours per year. Core time is when an employee must perform work related services as determined by the employer. Flex time is the time outside of core time when work related services are also required. A formal flexible work program must allow for at least 1 year of participation and maintain the same health insurance benefits for participants working at least 20% of a full-time schedule. The participant is entitled to health insurance coverage and retiree benefits similar to full-time employees, with service credited based on work schedule ratio. Pension benefits cannot be reduced for participants in defined benefit plans. The participant in a defined benefit plan is treated like a full-time employee, with service credited based on work schedule ratio. Final average earnings for benefits cannot be reduced when participating in the plan. A participant in a defined contribution plan is entitled to employer matching contributions at the same rate as a full-time employee. Pension benefits cannot be forfeited for the participant under specific rules. The Security Act of 1974 prohibits discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees in retirement plans. Regulations may be prescribed to ensure compliance with the law. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new flexible work credit under section 38. Additionally, to prevent double benefits, section 280C is amended to include the new credit. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The amendments made by this section introduce a flexible work credit under section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code, applicable to wages paid after December 31, 2009. Additionally, a Federal Task Force on Older Workers is established. The Secretary of Labor establishes a Federal Task Force on Older Workers within 90 days of the Act. The Task Force includes representatives from relevant Federal agencies. After one year, the Task Force will identify laws limiting opportunities for older workers. The Federal Task Force on Older Workers, established by the Secretary of Labor within 90 days of the Act, aims to address limitations for older workers, identify best practices in the private sector, and assess the effectiveness of programs for hiring and retaining older workers. After three years, the Task Force will evaluate the effectiveness of the Act. The Task Force established under this Act will organize a Conference on the Aging Workforce with the participation of various organizations. They will submit a report to Congress and consult with relevant organizations. The Task Force is not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act and will terminate 30 days after completing its duties. The Task Force will terminate after completing all duties under this Act."
