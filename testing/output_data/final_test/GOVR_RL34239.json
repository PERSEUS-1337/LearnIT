    "content": "Recent high energy prices, concerns over energy security, and the desire to promote rural business and reduce air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions have led to congressional interest in promoting alternatives to petroleum fuels. Biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, receive federal support through tax incentives, loan programs, and regulatory initiatives. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established a renewable fuel standard, which was expanded in 2007 with the Energy Independence and Security Act. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) increased the required renewable fuel amount to 9.0 billion gallons in 2008 and set a goal of 36 billion gallons by 2022. The 2008 farm bill promoted cellulosic ethanol production and made changes to tax credits for corn-derived ethanol. The 2008 farm bill expanded research on agricultural renewable energy, encouraged infrastructure development for cellulosic ethanol production, and continued the tariff on imported ethanol. Concerns arose about reaching the limit of ethanol production from corn due to rapid expansion of U.S. corn ethanol capacity. Critics argue that the corn-based ethanol industry does not need government support and is straining corn and other grain markets, leading to price increases in commodities like livestock feed. Proponents of corn-based ethanol production argue that increased acreage and higher yields will meet the demand for feed, fuel, and exports. Advanced biofuels from non-food sources are gaining interest to address environmental concerns. However, biofuels from other biomass sources are still years away from commercial production. Proposals to support biofuels from non-corn feedstocks include research, development funding, and tax incentives. Eligible corn-based ethanol production is capped at 15 billion gallons under EISA. The RFS mandates an increasing amount of advanced biofuels from sources like cellulosic material. Commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol production is not yet widespread, with only one refinery under construction as of July 2008. Commercial production of cellulosic ethanol is expected to start in 2010 or 2011, with one refinery under construction as of July 2008. The RFS mandates 100 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol production in 2010. Funding was announced for a plant with projected output of 20 million gallons annually starting in 2010. EISA and the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 cover various energy and agricultural topics. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) and the 2008 farm bill include key provisions related to biofuels such as expanding the renewable fuel standard, tax credits for ethanol, grants for biofuels research, studies on ethanol transportation and biofuel impacts, and biofuel feedstock availability. The U.S. Department of Energy, Department of Agriculture, and Environmental Protection Agency are involved in biofuels research and development. Changes include reducing the blender tax credit for corn-based ethanol, introducing a production tax credit for cellulosic ethanol, and maintaining the import duty on ethanol."
