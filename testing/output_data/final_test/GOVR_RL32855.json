Presidential review of rules, starting from the Reagan era, has become a widely-used mechanism to advance the President's regulatory agenda. President Nixon initiated the first formal regulatory review program in 1971, marking the beginning of centralized regulatory review efforts. The evolution of presidential involvement in agency rulemaking since the 1970s has led to a significant accumulation of power in regulatory matters. President Nixon initiated the first formal regulatory review program in 1971, marking the beginning of centralized regulatory review efforts. Subsequent presidents, such as Ford and Carter, expanded regulatory review through executive orders, requiring agencies to submit significant proposed regulations for review and prepare economic impact assessments. President Carter also established the Regulatory Council to coordinate agency actions. The Regulatory Council was formed to coordinate agency rulemaking activities to avoid conflicting regulations. Programs under Nixon, Ford, and Carter increased centralization of regulatory review. Reagan's Executive Order 12,291 aimed to reduce regulatory burdens, increase agency accountability, and minimize duplication of regulations. Executive Order 12,291 required agencies to submit major rules to OIRA for review, centralizing control within OMB. Executive Order 12,498 expanded this by requiring agencies to submit annual regulatory plans to OMB for review, allowing OMB to influence agency actions early in the process. Additionally, a \"Task Force for Regulatory Relief\" was created to further streamline the regulatory process. The Reagan administration's executive orders centralized control over regulatory activities, with OIRA reviewing thousands of regulations annually and sending rules back for agency reconsideration. This process aligned agency regulations with the administration's goals, sparking criticism for being anti-regulatory and secretive. The Reagan administration's executive orders centralized control over regulatory activities, with OIRA reviewing thousands of regulations annually and sending rules back for agency reconsideration. Critics argued that the review process lacked transparency and could be influenced by private interests. E.O. 12,291 was also criticized for allowing indefinite delays in rulemaking unless mandated by a statutory deadline or court order. The Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel supported the constitutionality of the order, stating that it did not displace agencies' delegated responsibilities. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) supported the constitutionality of E.O. 12,291, stating that it was valid as an exercise of the President's power to ensure laws are faithfully executed. The OLC also noted that presidential supervision of rulemaking by executive agencies is usually legal, as long as it conforms to legislation enacted by Congress. Despite this, allegations were made that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) used the executive order to control agency rulemaking during the Reagan Administration. Courts did not address the constitutionality of OMB involvement in agency rulemaking under E.O. 12,291 during the Reagan Administration. In Public Citizen Health Research Group v. Tyson, the court acknowledged the constitutional questions raised by OMB's participation but did not address them, ruling that a challenged deletion in a rule was unsupported. During the Reagan and first Bush Administrations, OMB's involvement in agency rulemaking was controversial. The creation of the Council on Competitiveness in 1989 further complicated matters, with disputes arising between OIRA and regulatory agencies. The Council asserted its authority in resolving conflicts, leading to the deletion of certain provisions from an EPA rule. Despite challenges in court, the Court of Appeals did not address the Council's influence, focusing instead on the deletion's legality. The court upheld EPA's deletion of provisions in a rule, stating that it was based on the rulemaking record and not due to the Council's advice. The court emphasized that EPA had exercised its own expertise in making the final rules, and the Council did not have the authority to compel changes. The decision highlights the difficulty for the judiciary to intervene when agencies accept external influence. The Clinton Administration replaced the Reagan Administration's review scheme with Executive Order 12,866, aiming to enhance planning and coordination in agency rulemaking, reaffirm agency primacy, restore regulatory integrity, and increase public accessibility. This made it challenging for the judiciary to oversee agency displacement acceptance. The regulatory process under Executive Order 12,866 aims to make regulations more accessible to the public while meeting statutory requirements and giving discretion to Federal agencies. Despite appearing to limit executive authority, the order still grants expansive power to control agency rulemaking. It requires agencies to only promulgate necessary regulations based on law or compelling public need. The Executive Order 12,866 aims to make regulations more accessible to the public while granting agencies the power to control rulemaking based on law or compelling public need. Agencies must provide a \"Regulatory Plan\" to OIRA for centralized review of significant regulatory actions likely to have a major economic or societal impact. The Executive Order 12,866 requires agencies to submit a \"Regulatory Plan\" to OIRA for centralized review of significant regulatory actions that may have a major economic or societal impact. OIRA has ten days to determine if a planned regulatory action not identified as significant is covered under specific criteria, and those deemed significant must undergo a cost-benefit analysis and further review and clearance provisions. The OIRA is required to review preliminary regulatory actions within ten working days and all other regulatory actions within 90 calendar days. The Administrator of OIRA may remand a regulatory action to the agency for further consideration if needed. The Clinton Administration aimed to streamline the OIRA review process, resulting in a significant decrease in the number of regulations reviewed annually. The President or Vice-President can intervene in case of unresolved conflicts between agency heads and OIRA. During the Clinton Administration, an average of 600 significant rulemaking actions were approved per year, with only 25 rules returned to agencies for further consideration. Executive Order 12,866 imposed disclosure requirements on OIRA to ensure transparency in the regulatory review process, controlling all substantive communications between OIRA personnel and individuals outside the executive branch. Executive Order 12,866 imposes significant information sharing and disclosure requirements on OIRA, including inviting agency representatives to meetings with outsiders, forwarding all substantive oral communications to the issuing agency, maintaining a publicly available log of contacts, and making all documents exchanged during the review process available to the public. The disclosure requirements of Executive Order 12,866 between OIRA and issuing agencies involve sharing substantive communications with individuals outside the executive branch. However, there is a distinction in disclosure requirements for inter-agency communications, where OIRA may not be required to disclose communications with other agencies to the issuing agency or the public. The effects of OIRA review during the Reagan and Bush Administrations sparked debate on constitutional issues regarding agency decision-making authority. The transparency of E.O. 12,866 and the pro-regulatory stance of the Clinton era OMB led to a decrease in debate on presidential review of agency rulemaking. Despite the drop in OIRA review rates, it does not indicate a concession on presidential control over the agency rulemaking process. During the Clinton Administration, there was a significant increase in the use of formal presidential directives to compel executive agencies to take specific regulatory actions. President Clinton issued 107 directives, compared to Reagan's nine and Bush's four. Despite the transparency of OIRA review during this time, E.O. 12,866 showed a broad view of presidential authority. During the Clinton Administration, E.O. 12,866 expanded presidential authority over regulatory actions, including independent agencies. Conflicts between agencies are to be resolved by the President or Vice President, indicating ultimate decision-making authority. During the Clinton Administration, E.O. 12,866 expanded presidential authority over regulatory actions, including independent agencies. The President or Vice President has the ultimate decision-making authority, as stated in the order. The provision allowing the President to displace agency authority is to be exercised \"only to the extent permitted by law,\" potentially giving the President determinative authority. President Clinton's assertion of authority over the regulatory process went beyond the traditional OMB process. During the Clinton Administration, E.O. 12,866 expanded presidential authority over regulatory actions, including independent agencies. President Clinton used presidential directives to direct agency heads, asserting direct presidential authority over discretionary actions assigned by Congress. This went beyond the traditional OMB process and aimed to improve transparency and selectiveness of OIRA review. The Clinton Administration expanded presidential authority over regulatory actions, aligning with Reagan and George H.W. Bush. The George W. Bush Administration has a more stringent regulatory review policy, with OIRA acting as a \"gatekeeper for new rulemakings.\" They are taking a nuanced approach compared to E.O. 12,291, impacting agency regulations significantly. OIRA under E.O. 12,866 has increased the use of \"return\" letters to require agencies to reconsider rules based on inadequate analyses, unjustified regulatory standards, inconsistency with regulatory principles, or other executive orders. Over 20 rules have been returned for agency reconsideration under Administrator Graham's tenure. The reinvigoration of using \"return\" letters by OIRA emphasizes the importance of quality in new rulemakings and encourages agencies to seek input earlier in the regulatory development process to prevent late returns. This collaboration benefits both OIRA and agencies by ensuring compliance with E.O. 12,866 and avoiding wasted resources. However, it also raises concerns about executive control over agency rulemaking efforts. The current Administration's OIRA has taken a proactive stance in identifying regulatory issues and issuing \"prompt letters\" to agencies to encourage rulemaking. Prompt letters serve as a request for agencies to prioritize certain matters, although they do not carry the mandatory implication of a Presidential directive. OIRA has made prompt letters public to generate interest from agencies, the public, and Congress in potential regulations. OIRA has used prompt letters to identify regulatory issues and increase transparency in the review process, aiming to stimulate interest from agencies, the public, and Congress. This approach allows OIRA to influence regulatory efforts and address criticisms of past administrations. Under Administrator Graham, OIRA has expanded disclosure standards, making information on meetings and decisions available on their website. This increased access to OIRA information has reduced attacks on their review process, although concerns about their influence and disclosure remain. The 2003 study by the General Accounting Office raised concerns about transparency in OMB and OIRA contacts with outside parties during informal reviews. OIRA's disclosure policy requires revealing substantive meetings even during informal reviews, but the GAO found exceptions where rules were not considered under review. During the \"preinformal review\" period, OIRA may communicate with outside parties without triggering disclosure requirements. The GAO report found that disclosure requirements are only applicable during formal review periods. This allows for unreported contacts between OIRA, outside parties, and executive agencies. Preformal review proceedings enable agencies to submit proposals for informal review and make changes based on OIRA's input without public disclosure. OIRA has also increased review of existing rules. OIRA has reinvigorated the review of existing rules and involved the public in the process by soliciting nominations for rule recision or modification. They received 71 nominations in 2001 and 189 nominations in 2004, determining that some nominations merit high priority review and further action. This demonstrates the level of public involvement in the review process. OIRA's review process involves mechanisms like return and prompt letters to encourage agency collaboration early in rule formulation. This early stage interaction allows OIRA to influence rulemaking before formal review, potentially surpassing its influence during formal proceedings. In light of recent developments, it appears that changes to disclosure requirements for the OIRA review process have shielded the current Administration from criticism. However, concerns remain about OIRA's potential role in shaping agency rules during pre-review proceedings. The evolution of presidential review of agency rulemaking from the Nixon Administration to the current Administration of George W. Bush has been evident. The evolution of presidential review of agency rulemaking from the Nixon Administration to the current Administration of George W. Bush has raised concerns about the allocation of authority between the President and Congress. Despite these concerns, no court has directly addressed the issue, and recent administrations have implemented review processes that align with previous orders, reducing constitutional challenges. Presidential review of agency rulemaking has become widely accepted. Presidential review of agency rulemaking is a widely accepted mechanism for a President to exert significant authority over the process."
