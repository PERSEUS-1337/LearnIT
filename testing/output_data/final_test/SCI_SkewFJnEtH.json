    "content": "In classic papers, Zellner (1988, 2002) showed that Bayesian inference can be derived from an information theoretic functional. A generalized form of this functional is derived as a variational lower bound of a predictive information bottleneck objective. This functional encompasses modern inference procedures and suggests new ones. The predictive information measures the complexity of a data generating process, and the goal of learning is to capture this complexity by forming a global representation of the dataset. The text discusses using a learning algorithm to produce a summary statistic of a dataset for predicting future draws. The algorithm can be deterministic or stochastic, like training a neural network with stochastic gradient descent. The utility of the learned global representation is judged by the mutual information I(\u03b8; x F ), which quantifies the information captured about future draws. The goal is to maximize this quantity for optimal learning. The text discusses maximizing mutual information I(\u03b8; x F ) to capture information about future draws using a learning algorithm. The predictive information bottleneck objective is introduced as a way to optimize the representation's complexity. The use of a Lagrange multiplier \u03b2 helps in turning this into an unconstrained optimization problem. The Markov chain relationship between random variables x F, x P, and \u03b8 is discussed, with a focus on their conditional independence. Variational bounds are derived for the objective of measuring the inefficiency of the proposed representation. The text also mentions a variational upper bound on the amount of information about the data generating process. The local variational information bottleneck in Fischer (2019) is used to bound residual information in a global representation. A variational approximation is used to lower bound the mutual information between \u03b8 and x P. The objective is derived as a variational lower bound on the predictive. The objective derived as a variational lower bound on the predictive information bottleneck satisfies Zellner's postulate for optimal information processing. This encompasses various modern inference procedures, including Generalized Bayesian Inference and Gibbs VI. Optimizing this objective gives the generalized Boltzmann distribution, a form of Bayesian Inference known as power likelihood. Bayesian Inference involves the power likelihood, where the inverse temperature \u03b2 controls the balance between retaining observed data information and capturing predictive information. Different values of \u03b2 lead to maximum likelihood, ordinary Bayesian inference, or prior predictive inference. Generalized VI can be incorporated by replacing KL-based mutual informations. Power Bayes is a variational lower bound on the predictive information bottleneck objective. The text discusses the flexibility in specifying variational approximations for Bayesian inference, including the concept of Gibbs Variational Inference and the optimization of parametric distributions for q(x|\u03b8) and q(\u03b8). The text discusses optimizing parametric distributions for q(\u03b8) in Bayesian inference, including the use of data augmentation with a stochastic process and concave likelihood functions to maintain a bound. The text discusses how various inference techniques are variational lower bounds on a predictive information bottleneck objective, highlighting the limitations of traditional inference methods. It suggests tighter priors and variational approximations to improve the bounds. The text proposes a variational approximation for alternative datasets to improve inference methods and enhance learning processes."
