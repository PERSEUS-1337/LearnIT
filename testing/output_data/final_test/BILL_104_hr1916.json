    "content": "The \"Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act\" amends Section 2680(c) of title 28, United States Code, to limit customs and tax exemptions under the Tort Claims Procedures. It allows for longer periods for filing claims in certain in rem proceedings. SEC. 3. LONGER PERIOD FOR FILING CLAIMS IN CERTAIN IN REM PROCEEDINGS. Rule C of the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims is amended to extend the filing period from 10 days to 30 days. SEC. 4. BURDEN OF PROOF IN FORFEITURE PROCEEDINGS. Section 615 of the Tariff Act of 1930 is amended to address the burden of proof in forfeiture proceedings. SEC. 615 of the Tariff Act of 1930 shifts the burden of proof to the United States Government in forfeiture proceedings for seized property. Any person claiming a seized vessel, vehicle, aircraft, merchandise, or baggage must file a claim within 30 days of the notice of seizure. The customs officer will then transmit the claim to the United States attorney for condemnation proceedings. If the claimant is unable to afford legal representation, the court may appoint counsel. The court may appoint counsel to represent a person who is financially unable to obtain representation for a claim. The compensation for this representation will be equivalent to court-appointed representation under section 3006A of title 18, United States Code, and will be paid from the Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund. Section 614 of the Tariff Act of 1930 is amended to allow for the immediate release of seized property if it would cause substantial hardship to the claimant, such as preventing business operations, work, or causing homelessness. The claimant must request possession of the property from the customs officer within 10 days. The Tariff Act of 1930 allows for the immediate release of seized property if it would cause substantial hardship to the claimant. If the property is not released within 10 days of the request, the claimant can file a complaint in district court outlining the nature of the claim, reasons for hardship, and steps taken to secure release. The district court will then order the return of the property. The district court shall order the return of seized property to the claimant if it is likely that the claimant has a possessory interest and continued possession by the government would cause substantial hardship. The court may impose conditions for release to preserve the property for forfeiture. The court must make a decision on a complaint within 30 days of filing. After filing, the court may extend the 30-day limit for good cause shown or by consent of the parties. SEC. 7 amends Section 524(c) of title 28, United States Code, to include new purposes for the Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund, such as court-awarded compensation for representation of claimants. SEC. 8 provides clarification regarding forfeitures under the Controlled Substances Act. Section 511(a) of the Controlled Substances Act is amended to clarify that property can be seized without the knowledge or consent of the owner. Additionally, a special rule is added to ensure that property is not considered used for illegal purposes without the owner's knowledge or consent. Section 511(a) of the Controlled Substances Act is amended to allow property seizure without owner consent if the owner was aware of illegal use or failed to prevent it. A technical amendment redesignates subsection (l) as subsection (k). The amendments made by this Act apply to claims, suits, and actions filed after the enactment date."
