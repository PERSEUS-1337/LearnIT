    "content": "H.R. 3547 introduced in the House aims to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to ensure the safety and effectiveness of human tissue intended for transplantation. The \"Human Tissue for Transplantation Act of 1993\" is enacted to ensure the safety and effectiveness of human tissue for transplantation through regulatory oversight. The Act includes definitions and findings to protect public health against infectious diseases and ensure the suitability of human tissue for medical therapy. Section 201 (21 U.S.C. 321) is amended to include definitions related to human tissue, specifying the term \"tissue\" and \"banked human tissue\" for medical use. The term \"banked human tissue\" is defined as tissue that is procured, processed, stored, or distributed in a way to prevent disease transmission and maintain clinical usefulness, and does not alter tissue structure or function. This definition excludes whole organs, blood products, reproductive tissue, and autograft human tissue not stored or processed during a single surgical procedure. A \"human tissue bank\" is a person or entity that deals with banked human tissue. Regulation of human tissue banks is added to Chapter V under Subchapter D. The Secretary may require screening, testing, and recordkeeping by human tissue banks to prevent disease transmission. Good tissue banking practices, including donor suitability ascertainment and tissue screening, will be established by regulation. The Secretary may require screening, testing, and recordkeeping by human tissue banks to prevent disease transmission. Regulations will establish good tissue banking practices, including validation of manufacturing equipment, finished tissue inspection, quality control, investigation of failures, recordkeeping, personnel requirements, and special practices for specific tissues. Labeling, advertising, and promotion of banked human tissue will also be regulated. The Secretary may require human tissue banks to obtain operating permits by demonstrating compliance with specific requirements for the promotion and use of banked human tissue. The Secretary may approve an exemption for human tissue banks from certain requirements if supported by scientific data or consultation with a Tissue Advisory Committee. The Secretary may approve an exemption for human tissue banks from certain requirements if supported by scientific data or consultation with a Tissue Advisory Committee. The human tissue bank can apply for an exemption to investigate new standards with a proposed scientific protocol, ensuring patient safety with informed consent. The Secretary will issue an operating permit if the bank meets the requirements. The Secretary may approve an exemption for human tissue banks from certain requirements based on scientific data or consultation with a Tissue Advisory Committee. A permit issued to a tissue bank shall specify the tissues banked and the safe methods of procurement, processing, storage, and distribution. The permit is valid for up to 3 years and can be amended if the bank remains compliant. The Secretary can revoke a permit if the bank operates in a manner inconsistent with its permit. The Human Tissue for Transplantation Act of 1993 requires human tissue banks to register and comply with regulations within 5 years of enactment. The Secretary will issue regulations based on scientific evidence to ensure compliance. The Human Tissue for Transplantation Act of 1993 mandates tissue banks to register and comply with regulations within 5 years. Tissue advisory committees will be established to ensure compliance based on scientific evidence. The Tissue Advisory Committee, established under the Human Tissue for Transplantation Act of 1993, consists of 13-19 non-government individuals with expertise in tissue transplantation. Its function is to advise the Secretary on quality standards. The Tissue Advisory Committee advises the Secretary on quality standards, regulations, and prevention of infectious disease transmission for human tissue banks. They also report on new developments in tissue transplantation and make recommendations for good tissue banking practices. Additionally, they assist in developing regulations for the use of banked human tissues and investigate consumer complaints as needed. The Tissue Advisory Committee advises the Secretary on quality standards, regulations, and prevention of infectious disease transmission for human tissue banks. They meet quarterly during the first 3 years and the Secretary appoints the chairperson from committee members. SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT. Adulteration of banked human tissue is addressed in the amendment to Section 501 (21 U.S.C. 351), ensuring compliance with procurement, processing, distribution, and storage requirements. The amendment to Section 502 (21 U.S.C. 352) addresses misbranding of banked human tissue by requiring proper labeling and prohibiting false or misleading promotion or advertising. The amendment to Section 301 (21 U.S.C. 331) includes inserting \"or banked human tissue\" after \"drug\" in various paragraphs, updating penalties in Section 303(f) (21 U.S.C. 333(f)), and adding \"or banked human tissues\" after \"devices\" in seizures under Section 304 (21 U.S.C. 334). In subsections (a)(1) and (d)(1), \"banked human tissue\" is added after \"drug\". Subsection (a)(1) is amended to include \"(D) Any adulterated or misbranded banked human tissue, and (E)\". In subsection (g)(1), \"or banked human tissue\" is added after \"device\". Section 702 (21 U.S.C. 372) is updated to include \"banked human tissue\" in subsections (b) and (d). Section 703 (21 U.S.C. 373) is amended to include \"or banked human tissues\". In amendments to various sections, \"banked human tissues\" are added after references to drugs or devices. This includes inspections, publicity, interstate commerce presumption, and imports and exports. In amendments to Section 801 (21 U.S.C 381), \"banked human tissues\" are added after references to drugs. This includes imports and exports. SEC. 6. FUNDING. The human tissue bank must pay fees for permits and registration to cover the Secretary's costs in implementing related sections. The fee amount is based on the bank's revenue from human tissue activities. Collected fees are credited to the Secretary's appropriation account for expenses and remain available until expended. The fees imposed under subsection (a) shall be collected annually to cover the costs of implementing sections 545 and 546. The fee authorized by subsection (a)(1) takes effect 4 years after the enactment of the Human Tissue for Transplantation Act of 1993, while the fee authorized by subsection (a)(2) takes effect one year after enactment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is not allowed to enforce a regulation regarding human heart valves. A previous determination that human heart valves require premarket approval has been revoked."
