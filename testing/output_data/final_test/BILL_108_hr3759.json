    "content": "The Act titled \"Transform America Transaction Fee of 2004\" is referred to as such. It includes findings related to the Act. The Congress finds that an effective stimulus plan must meet criteria such as job creation, fiscal responsibility, fairness, targeting unmet needs, tax reform, and revenue sharing. Economic viability is closely tied to economic growth rate. The current tax structure creates distortions limiting growth and job creation, with taxpayers spending five billion hours and $200 billion on compliance. The tax code's inefficiency in revenue raising leads to struggles in public education, healthcare, infrastructure, and national debt. Restructuring the tax code is seen as a way to promote economic prosperity. Implementing a transaction fee in place of existing Federal taxes can eliminate systemic inefficiencies in the tax code, allowing businesses to pursue previously unprofitable projects and incentivizing workers to supply labor. Responsible tax reform is crucial for financial security, economic prosperity, educational opportunities, and affordable healthcare. The Department of the Treasury should conduct a feasibility study on transaction fees to achieve these goals. The Department of the Treasury should conduct a feasibility study on implementing a transaction fee to improve tax efficiency and incentivize economic growth. The Secretary of the Treasury will conduct a study on implementing a transaction tax in the US, replacing current Federal taxes with a per transaction fee. The fee would apply to all transactions except cash transactions under $500 and employee salaries. The proposal suggests a fee for cash withdrawals from financial institutions, set at double or higher than the standard transaction fee. The fee rate is designed to generate revenues equal to those under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and could be used for a national debt reduction plan or a Federal revenue sharing program. A Federal revenue sharing program is proposed to support education costs, health care insurance coverage for the uninsured, and community and economic development investments in high poverty areas. The proposed Federal revenue sharing program aims to support education costs, health care insurance for the uninsured, and community and economic development investments in high poverty areas. Federal tax revenues would be collected through a base standard transaction fee not exceeding 1% for noncash transactions under $500. Additional revenues may be generated through a progressive fee structure for transactions above $500, with liability for the fee incurred when control over property or services is exercised. The proposed Federal revenue sharing program aims to collect fees through a transaction fee system for property or services, with collection done by the seller or financial institution. The results of the study on fee calculation methodology and revenue generation will be reported to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury. The study will calculate fees needed for current revenue generation, revenue neutrality with additional support for debt reduction and all programs, and consider pegging changes to inflation. It will also include a comparative analysis. The study will include a comparative analysis of the existing revenue-raising system versus the proposed fee-based system on economic behavior, analyzing their impact on job creation, economic growth, consumption, investments, and savings levels. It will also examine all types and categories of transactions, including frequency and value, as well as the impact of the transaction fee exemption for cash transactions under $500. Additionally, the study will provide information on program operations. The study will assess the transaction fee as a tool of Federal fiscal policy, including its impact on existing tax expenditures, incentives, penalties, and credits. It will also explore options for rebating citizens not subject to Federal income taxes and other aspects of the tax code. The study will provide instructions on program operations related to transaction fee collection, implementation, compliance, enforcement, and administrative costs. The study will assess the impact of a transaction fee on existing tax policies, including tax expenditures and credits. It will also provide an implementation plan for the transaction tax in the United States, including potential regulatory issues and congressional action needed. Additionally, the study will examine the feasibility of shifting the focus of the Internal Revenue Service to uncovering and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal Government. The study will assess the impact of a transaction fee on tax policies and provide an implementation plan for the transaction tax in the United States. It will also focus on uncovering and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal Government, with a report due to Congress within 1 year of the Act's enactment."
