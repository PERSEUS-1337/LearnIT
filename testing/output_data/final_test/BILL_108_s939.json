    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"IDEA Full-Funding Act of 2003\" and includes amendments to IDEA. The \"IDEA Full-Funding Act of 2003\" amends the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2004-2006, with specific amounts allocated for each year. Appropriations for fiscal years 2006-2009 include $6 billion for 2006, $16.874 billion for 2007, $18.874 billion for 2008, and $20.874 billion for 2009, with additional amounts appropriated for each year. Appropriations for fiscal years 2010-2011 include $22.874 billion for 2010 and $24.635 billion for 2011, with funds becoming available on July 1 of each year and remaining available through September 30 of the following year. The amount appropriated for fiscal year 2012 is $16,455,000,000, available from July 1, 2012, to September 30, 2013. If the total state allocations are less than $25,329,000,000, the appropriation will be reduced accordingly. For fiscal year 2013, $17,131,000,000 is appropriated, available from July 1, 2013, to September 30, 2014. If state allocations are less than $26,005,000,000, the appropriation will be adjusted accordingly. Additionally, necessary sums for fiscal year 2014 will be provided. For fiscal year 2014 and beyond, necessary sums will be provided. A local educational agency may reduce expenditures for one fiscal year if in compliance with requirements. For fiscal year 2014 and beyond, a local educational agency may reduce expenditures for one fiscal year under certain conditions, such as voluntary departure of special education personnel, decrease in enrollment of children with disabilities, or termination of providing special education to a costly child with a disability. The program is considered exceptionally costly by the State educational agency if the child has left the agency's jurisdiction, reached the age where the agency's obligation to provide education has ended, or no longer requires special education. This results in the termination of expensive expenditures. The termination of costly expenditures for long-term purchases, such as equipment acquisition or school facility construction, is equivalent to the excess Federal funding received by a local educational agency under this part for a fiscal year. These reduced funds must be used for activities eligible for funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is amended to repeal certain sections and make adjustments to subparagraphs."
