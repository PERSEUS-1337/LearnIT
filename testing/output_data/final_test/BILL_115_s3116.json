The \"Protecting the Right to Independent and Democratic Elections Act\" establishes an Election Security grant program. This program awards grants to States for activities such as implementing auditable paper ballots, conducting post-election risk limiting audits, and implementing cybersecurity standards. The \"Protecting the Right to Independent and Democratic Elections Act\" requires States to implement cybersecurity standards consistent with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act. It also mandates the use of voter-verified paper ballots in voting systems. The \"Protecting the Right to Independent and Democratic Elections Act\" mandates the use of voter-verified paper ballots in voting systems, which must be marked by the voter and available for inspection before casting. The paper ballots can be counted by hand or using a scanning device. The voting system must preserve voter-verified paper ballots without any possibility of associating a voter with their vote. The paper ballot used will be the official ballot for recounts or audits. Manual counting requirements for recounts and audits state that each paper ballot used must be suitable for a manual audit and counted by hand in any recount for Federal elections. Inconsistencies between electronic and hand-counted vote tallies must be resolved using durable, voter-verified paper ballots. The use of voter-verified paper ballots is required for Federal elections, and grant funds cannot be used for remote electronic ballot casting. In case of disputes over compromised paper ballots, special rules apply. In the event of any inconsistency between electronic and hand-counted paper ballot tallies for a Federal election, clear and convincing evidence must be provided in any recount, audit, or contest of the election result. In the event of potential compromise of paper ballots in an election, the appropriate remedy will be determined according to State law, with electronic tallies not being the sole basis for the official result. The program allows states to use grant funds to hire outside experts in IT or cybersecurity for 5 years, with a possible extension for another 5 years.
