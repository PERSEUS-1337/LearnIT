    "content": "The Act titled \"Water Resource Study Act of 2000\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that water resources in the United States are plentiful and have been the focus of Federal policies. Recent growth and competing water uses have led to conflicts, especially in the southeastern region. Federal support is needed to assess current policies in resolving water supply needs at the state and local levels. The Act defines the terms \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Army and \"State\" as Tennessee. It also calls for studies on emerging water supply needs. The Secretary will offer assistance to the State for conducting studies on emerging water supply needs. The State must select a geographic area and conduct a study within one year, identifying resources and funding for water supply development. The State will conduct a water resource inventory in a selected geographic area to determine projected demand, existing supplies, and barriers to water development. The State will conduct a water resource inventory in a selected geographic area to determine projected demand, existing supplies, and barriers to water development. This includes assessing water resources with few technical or regulatory barriers, areas needing further research for water supply potential, and understanding social, political, and economic dynamics that may impact water supply resolution. Incentives for cooperation between water districts, local governments, and State governments will also be explored. The Corps of Engineers is the lead agency for water supply development studies, consulting with states for guidance. States select entities to participate in the study, with additional participation from the US Geological Survey and the Tennessee Valley Authority in Tennessee. The University of Tennessee may participate in the study in the State. The Federal government will fund 100% of each study. A report on the study's findings must be submitted to specific committees within 180 days. $1,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2001 to carry out this section."
