    "content": "The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is comprehensive legislation that provides nondiscrimination protection in various areas for individuals with disabilities. Enacted in 1990, it aims to eliminate discrimination against individuals with disabilities. The ADA Amendments Act was passed in 2008 to address narrow interpretations of disability. The Supreme Court has ruled on 20 ADA cases, with the most recent decision in United States v. Georgia affirming the ADA's provisions. In United States v. Georgia, the Supreme Court held that Title II of the ADA allows for private cause of action for damages against states for conduct violating the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court also addressed the issue of whether prisoners can secure money damages from states for ADA violations. Additionally, the Court decided Arbaugh v. Y. & H Corp., a case under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act with implications for ADA discrimination provisions. The Court granted certiorari in Huber v. Wal-Mart Stores to determine reassignment of disabled individuals to vacant positions but dismissed the petition as the case was settled. The Court dismissed a petition on accommodation issues due to a settlement before oral argument, leading to continued divergent views in different circuits. The ADA's historical antecedents include Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination based on disability in programs receiving federal financial assistance. The ADA builds on Section 504 but differs in its scope of discrimination prohibition. The ADA prohibits discrimination based on disability, even for entities not receiving federal funds. Federal executive agencies and the U.S. Postal Service are covered under Section 504, not the ADA. The ADA sets a standard equal to or higher than that of the Rehabilitation Act. It does not provide grant funds but offers technical assistance for compliance. Tax code provisions may also assist in compliance. The ADA defines \"disability\" as a physical or mental impairment that limits major life activities, including a record of such impairment or being regarded as having one. The definition has been subject to narrow interpretations by the Supreme Court, leading to the ADA Amendments Act with new rules for construction. The ADA Amendments Act introduced new rules of construction for defining disability, emphasizing broad coverage and interpreting \"substantially limits\" in line with the ADA's purposes. It clarifies that an impairment need not limit multiple major life activities to be considered a disability, and even episodic impairments can qualify. The determination of disability should not consider the effects of mitigating measures, except for ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses. EEOC regulations further clarify the statutory definition. The EEOC regulations provide clarifying interpretations of the statutory definition of disability, including major bodily functions as major life activities. Certain impairments are almost always considered disabilities, such as deafness, blindness, and various medical conditions. The ADA Amendments Act broadened the definition of disability, emphasizing broad coverage and disregarding the effects of mitigating measures. The ADA Amendments Act narrowed and limited the ADA from its original intent by deleting key findings and changing the definition of \"substantially limits.\" This was done to address inconsistencies with congressional intent and to provide clear and enforceable standards for addressing discrimination. The ADA Amendments Act reinstated broad protection under the ADA by rejecting Supreme Court rulings on mitigating measures and defining \"substantially limits.\" It lists examples of major life activities and includes the operation of a major bodily function. The ADA Amendments Act clarified that major life activities include the operation of major bodily functions to ensure that impairments affecting bodily functions are not overlooked. Judicial decisions had previously excluded certain bodily functions from the definition of disability, such as in the case of Furnish v. SVI Sys., Inc. The Act also covers individuals who are regarded as having an impairment. Paragraph 3 of the ADA Amendments Act clarifies that an individual is considered as having an impairment if they have been discriminated against due to an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment. Transitory and minor impairments, lasting six months or less, are excluded from this provision. The Act also states that covered entities do not have to provide accommodations to individuals who are only regarded as having a disability. The Supreme Court in Sutton questioned regulatory agencies' authority to define disability under the ADA. The ADA Amendments Act grants regulatory authority to issue regulations implementing the definitions. The ADA grants regulatory authority to define disability under the Act, including regulations implementing definitions in sections 3 and 4. The term \"individual with a disability\" in the ADA excludes those currently engaging in illegal drug use, but individuals who have been rehabilitated are covered. The limitation on coverage does not only apply to those using drugs on the day of the action in question. Section 508 and 511 of the Rehabilitation Act clarify that being a transvestite, homosexual, or bisexual does not constitute a disability. The term disability also excludes various conditions such as transvestism, pedophilia, and substance use disorders resulting from illegal drug use. The Supreme Court has addressed the definition of disability in cases like Bragdon v. Abbott involving discrimination against an HIV-infected individual. In Bragdon v. Abbott, the Supreme Court ruled that asymptomatic HIV infection qualifies as a disability under the ADA, impacting major life activities. Other cases like Sutton v. United Airlines and Toyota Motor Manufacturing v. Williams, addressed issues later amended by the ADA Amendments Act. These decisions are of historical interest but may no longer be considered valid precedent. In Bragdon v. Abbott, the Supreme Court ruled that asymptomatic HIV infection qualifies as a disability under the ADA. Ms. Abbott, who was HIV positive but asymptomatic, was denied dental treatment by Dr. Bragdon in his office. The case was remanded for further consideration on the issue of direct threat. Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority, first examined whether Ms. Abbott's HIV infection was a physical impairment. The Supreme Court found that asymptomatic HIV infection was a physical impairment affecting major life activities like reproduction, with risks to partners and children. In 1999, the Supreme Court decision in Sutton v. United Air Lines discussed the definition of disability and mitigating measures. The Court ruled that a disability exists only if an impairment substantially limits a major life activity, even with mitigating measures. This interpretation clarified the scope of protection under the ADA. In a series of 1999 cases, the Supreme Court clarified that not all individuals with uncorrected conditions are protected under the ADA. The Court ruled that an individual must be regarded as having a disability if the covered entity mistakenly believes that the individual's impairment substantially limits major life activities. Additionally, the Court held that a trucker with monocular vision who could compensate for the impairment was not considered a person with a disability. In the 2002 case of Toyota Motor Manufacturing v. Williams, Justice O'Connor determined that to be \"substantially limited\" in performing manual tasks, an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts activities central to daily life. The Eleventh Amendment limits the Judicial power of the United States in suits against a State by citizens of another State. The Eleventh Amendment limits suits against a State by citizens of another State or foreign citizens. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Eleventh Amendment cannot be abrogated by Article I powers, but Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment can be used for abrogation in certain circumstances. This was discussed in cases like College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Board and Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents. The ADA attempts to abrogate state immunity under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Commerce Clause. It requires \"appropriate\" legislation that is remedial and proportional to the injury to be prevented. The Supreme Court found successful abrogation in Tennessee v. Lane for Title II but not in Garrett v. University of Alabama for Title I. The Supreme Court upheld Title II of the ADA in Tennessee v. Lane for access to courts. In United States v. Georgia, it was ruled that Title II allows for damages against states for conduct violating the Fourteenth Amendment. Title I prohibits discrimination in employment based on disability for entities with 15 or more employees. The ADA's employment section applies to employers with 15 or more employees, similar to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The 15-employee limitation is not jurisdictional but relates to the substantive adequacy of a claim. Failure to raise the defense of having fewer than 15 employees in a timely manner does not obligate a court to dismiss the case. The term \"employee\" in a foreign country includes a citizen. The ADA's employment section applies to employers with 15 or more employees, including those in foreign countries. It is not unlawful for a covered entity to discriminate in a foreign workplace if compliance would violate foreign laws. To determine ADA compliance, the individual must meet the definition of a qualified individual with a disability who can perform essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodation. The ADA requires employers with 15 or more employees to provide reasonable accommodation for qualified individuals with disabilities. Reasonable accommodation includes making facilities accessible, job restructuring, modified work schedules, reassignment, equipment modification, and provision of interpreters. Undue hardship is defined as significant difficulty or expense in providing accommodation. Factors to consider in determining undue hardship under the ADA include the nature and cost of accommodation, financial resources of the facility and covered entity, and type of operations. Reasonable accommodation and undue hardship are key concepts under the ADA, distinguished from Title VII jurisprudence. EEOC guidance provides further details on these concepts, reflecting judicial decisions and amendments. The EEOC guidance reiterates interpretations on reasonable accommodations and limitations on questioning employee documentation of disabilities. Issues on the cost of accommodations have also been raised. The Seventh Circuit in Vande Zande v. State of Wisconsin Department of Administration found that the cost of accommodation cannot be disproportionate to the benefit, even for large employers. The Supreme Court examined the definition of \"employee\" under the ADA in Clackamas Gastroenterology Associates P.C. v. Wells. The Supreme Court in Clackamas Gastroenterology Associates P.C. v. Wells addressed whether shareholder-directors are considered employees under the ADA. The case involved Ms. Wells, a former bookkeeper at the medical clinic in Oregon, who alleged discrimination after her termination. The clinic argued it was not covered by the ADA due to having less than 15 employees, raising the question of whether physician-shareholders should be counted as employees. The Court remanded the case for further proceedings as the evidence was inconclusive. The EEOC guidelines list six factors to determine if an individual is an employee, including control by the organization, supervision of work, reporting structure, influence on the organization, and intent expressed in written agreements. The majority opinion found that some findings favored the conclusion that the physicians were not employees of the clinic, but remanded the case for further proceedings. Justice Ginsburg dissented, arguing that the Court's opinion only considered one aspect of the master-servant relationship. The Supreme Court has addressed employment issues related to federal antidiscrimination statutes, ERISA, and reasonable accommodations. The Court's decisions have not fully addressed all employment issues, such as the application of the Eleventh Amendment in University of Alabama v. Garrett. The relationship between SSDI benefits and pursuing an ADA employment claim was a key issue in Cleveland v. Policy Management. The Supreme Court in Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corp held that receiving SSDI benefits does not automatically prevent pursuing an ADA employment claim. The Court emphasized that the ADA and Social Security Act serve individuals with disabilities in different ways, and there is no inherent conflict between the two statutes. The key distinction lies in the ADA's definition of a qualified individual as someone who can perform essential job functions with or without accommodation. The Seventh Circuit in Johnson v. ExxonmobilCorp. distinguished the factual situations between ADA and SSDI benefits. The court concluded that defendants cannot explain false statements on SSDI applications. In Albertsons, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, the Supreme Court ruled that an employer is not required to adopt an experimental vision waiver program under Title I of the ADA. The Supreme Court ruled in Albertsons, Inc. v. Kirkingburg that employers are not obligated to implement an experimental vision waiver program under Title I of the ADA. The Court found that employers should not have to justify job qualifications that may exclude disabled individuals when they choose to follow existing regulatory standards, even if the government offers waivers without deeming them inappropriate. In Chevron U.S.A. Inc., v. Echazabal, the Supreme Court unanimously held that the ADA does not require employers to hire individuals with disabilities if the job would endanger their health. The ADA allows for a defense that a qualification standard is \"job related and consistent with business necessity.\" It also permits employers to impose a standard that the individual must not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others in the workplace. The Supreme Court in Echazabal ruled that employers are not required to hire individuals with disabilities if the job would endanger their health. The ADA allows for a defense that a qualification standard must be \"job related and consistent with business necessity\" and that the individual must not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others in the workplace. The Court upheld an EEOC regulation allowing employers to assert a direct threat defense to allegations of discrimination if the threat is only to the health or safety of the individual making the allegation. Justice Souter emphasized that the regulation was not workplace paternalism prohibited by the ADA. The Supreme Court distinguished the Echazabal case from Johnson Controls, emphasizing that judgments under the direct threat provision must be based on individualized risk assessments, not broad gender categories. The interplay between ADA rights and collective bargaining was highlighted. The Supreme Court's decision in Wright v. Universal Maritime Service Corp. clarified that a general arbitration clause in a collective bargaining agreement does not require arbitration for ADA violations. However, the issue of union-negotiated waivers was not addressed. In U.S. Airways v. Barnett, the Court ruled that an employer can deny an accommodation if it conflicts with seniority system rules. The Supreme Court ruled in U.S. Airways v. Barnett that an employer can deny an accommodation if it conflicts with a seniority system, as it provides important benefits to employees. The existence of a seniority system typically entitles an employer to summary judgment in ADA cases, with exceptions for special circumstances outlined by Justice Breyer. In U.S. Airways v. Barnett, the Supreme Court ruled that an employer can deny an accommodation if it conflicts with a seniority system, which usually entitles the employer to summary judgment in ADA cases. Justice Breyer outlined exceptions for \"special circumstances\" where changes to the seniority system diminish employee expectations or contain numerous exceptions. The Court's decision in Barnett had strong dissents and concurring opinions, with Justice O'Connor stating that the effect of a seniority system on the ADA depends on its legal enforceability. In Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, the Supreme Court addressed whether the ADA allows preferential rehiring rights for employees terminated for misconduct. Justice Scalia dissented, arguing against overriding seniority systems, while Justice Souter argued that seniority rules should be a factor in reasonable accommodations. The Court did not reach the preferential rehiring issue, finding a procedural error and remanding the case. The Supreme Court addressed disparate treatment and disparate impact in discrimination cases, highlighting the distinction between intentional discrimination and practices that disproportionately affect protected groups. Disparate treatment involves intentional discrimination based on protected characteristics, while disparate impact involves neutral practices that have a harsher impact on protected groups. Disparate impact cases do not require evidence of intent. Employers are prohibited from asking disability-related questions or conducting medical examinations before making a job offer. The EEOC guidance states that employers cannot ask disability-related questions or conduct medical examinations before making a job offer. Once an offer is made, all individuals in the same category must be asked the same questions and given the same examinations. In Karraker v. Rent-a-Center, Inc., the court examined the use of the MMPI for promotions, finding that it was a medical test. The court found that the MMPI was a medical test designed to reveal mental illness. The EEOC allows employers to ask employees about needing assistance during evacuations due to disability or medical conditions. Guidance was issued during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic regarding inquiries related to disabilities. The ADA provides defenses against discrimination charges based on qualification standards or tests. An employer can defend qualification standards, tests, or criteria that may disqualify a disabled individual if they are job-related and necessary. The ADA prohibits disqualifying based on uncorrected vision unless job-related. Discrimination is allowed if a disabled individual poses a direct threat to others' health or safety at work. Factors for determining a direct threat include risk duration, potential harm severity, likelihood, and imminence. The ADA allows for exceptions for religious organizations in employment practices, including giving preference to individuals of a particular religion and requiring conformity to religious tenets. The Supreme Court has also recognized additional constitutional protections for religious employers, such as the ministerial exception to employment discrimination laws. In Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC, the Court upheld the school's right to terminate a teacher based on religious grounds, affirming the importance of religious institutions selecting employees who align with their beliefs. The ministerial exception allows religious employers to select employees who align with their beliefs without governmental interference. Employers can avoid ADA liability for discriminating against individuals with infectious diseases related to food handling if the disease is listed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation. The ADA does not consider current illegal drug users as qualified individuals with disabilities for employment. Former drug users and alcoholics are covered if they can perform the job's essential functions. The definition of \"current\" drug use is debated, with the EEOC stating it must be recent enough to indicate an ongoing issue. Courts require individuals to be drug-free for a significant period to be protected by the ADA. The EEOC allows employers to set qualification standards excluding individuals with a history of illegal drug use if job-related. The ADA permits prohibiting illegal drug and alcohol use at work. Employers can enforce the same standards for all employees but must show job-relatedness if misconduct is due to a disability. Civil Rights Act provisions for enforcement and individual suits are applicable. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 expanded remedies for intentional discrimination, allowing for compensatory and punitive damages. Punitive damages require showing discriminatory practices with malice or reckless indifference. Damages are capped based on business size, with a \"good faith\" exception for reasonable accommodation. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 amends Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Fair Pay Act of 2009, P.L. 111-2, amends various anti-discrimination laws to address discriminatory compensation practices. It allows individuals to seek back pay for up to two years prior to filing charges and applies to Title I and Section 503 of the ADA. The ADA prohibits retaliation and coercion under 42 U.S.C. \u00a712203. The Supreme Court's decision in Kolstad v. American Dental Association addressed punitive damages in Title VII cases, which may also apply to ADA employment cases. In EEOC v. Wal-mart Stores, Inc., the Tenth Circuit affirmed an award of punitive damages under the ADA for a hearing impaired employee of Wal-mart. The employee, who was hearing impaired, was transferred to janitorial duties after refusing to attend a training session without an interpreter. He was denied an interpreter and threatened to file a complaint with the EEOC. He was suspended and later terminated, leading to a lawsuit where he won compensatory and punitive damages. The Tenth Circuit found sufficient evidence to support the intent and agency issues in the case. The store manager at Wal-mart approved the employee's suspension, familiar with ADA provisions. A reasonable jury could conclude intentional discrimination. Wal-mart argued against punitive damages, but Tenth Circuit noted employees had authority over hiring and firing, indicating managerial capacity under ADA Title II. The ADA Title II ensures that individuals with disabilities are not denied access to public entity services or discriminated against. The Department of Justice has regulations for Title II, including program accessibility requirements for public entities. The ADA Title II ensures that individuals with disabilities have access to public entity services without discrimination. Program accessibility requirements for public entities are outlined in the Department of Justice regulations. Public entities are not required to make all existing facilities accessible, especially in cases involving historic preservation. Compliance with program accessibility does not mandate actions leading to fundamental alterations or undue financial burdens. The amended Title II regulations align with new accessibility standards from the Access Board, providing clarity and certainty for public entities. A \"safe harbor\" provision exempts elements in covered facilities built or altered according to 1991 standards from compliance with new regulations. The ADA Title II ensures access to public entity services for individuals with disabilities without discrimination. The amended regulations include detailed standards for service animals, mobility devices, ticketing, and communication. Compliance with the 2010 accessible design standards is required by March 15, 2012. Title II also applies to state and local government emergency preparedness programs. The Department of Justice emphasizes the importance of making these programs accessible to people with disabilities. Title II of the ADA has been involved in significant Supreme Court cases, such as Tennessee v. Lane and United States v. Georgia. These cases established that Title II allows for private cause of action against states for violations of the Fourteenth Amendment. In Pennsylvania Department of Corrections v. Yeskey, the Court unanimously ruled that state prisons are covered under Title II. In a unanimous decision, the Court ruled that state prisons are considered 'public entities' under Title II of the ADA. The case involved a prisoner denied entry to a boot camp program due to medical reasons, leading to a lawsuit under the ADA. The state's argument that state prisoners were not covered under the ADA was rejected by the Supreme Court, emphasizing that the ADA applies to state institutions without exception. The Supreme Court ruled that state prisons are considered 'public entities' under the ADA, requiring them to provide services to prisoners. In Olmstead v. Georgia, the Court held that individuals with mental disabilities should be placed in community settings rather than institutions when appropriate. This decision was seen as discrimination based on disability. The Olmstead case was closely watched by disability groups and state governments. The Supreme Court ruled that undue institutionalization qualifies as discrimination based on disability, but placed limitations on this right. The Court discussed the issue of reasonable modifications and the allocation of resources for individuals with mental disabilities. This examination may have implications for similar concepts in the future. Title II of the ADA has implications for similar concepts in employment and public accommodations. Court cases have addressed issues such as quarantine regulations for guide dogs, curb ramp requirements, and the application of ADA to city ordinances and zoning. Specific requirements for public transportation include accessibility for new vehicles purchased by public entities operating fixed route systems. Good faith efforts must be demonstrated in purchasing or leasing accessible vehicles. Public entities must demonstrate good faith efforts in purchasing or leasing accessible vehicles for public transportation. Retrofitting existing buses is not required. Paratransit services must be provided by public entities operating fixed route services. Rail systems must have at least one accessible car per train. Draft guidelines have been published by the Access Board regarding the accessibility of public rights-of-way, with a future notice of proposed rulemaking to solicit comments before issuing a final rule. The final rule incorporates enforcement remedies from the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, similar to those of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Punitive damages are not awarded under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, as ruled in Barnes v. Gorman. Jeffrey Gorman, a wheelchair user, sued the Kansas City police after suffering injuries during transport following an arrest in 1992. In Barnes v. Gorman, Jeffrey Gorman sued Kansas City police for injuries during transport, awarded $1 million in compensatory damages and $1.2 million in punitive damages. The Supreme Court reversed the punitive damages ruling, citing that ADA and Rehabilitation Act remedies align with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act is based on congressional power under the Spending Clause to place conditions on grants. Justice Scalia emphasized that recipients must voluntarily accept these conditions. Punitive damages are not available under Title VI, Section 504, or the ADA, as they are not typically awarded for breach of contract. Title III prohibits discrimination based on disability in accessing goods, services, and accommodations. Entities covered by the term \"public accommodation\" include hotels, restaurants, theaters, museums, and gyms. Religious institutions are not included. Nondiscrimination requirements have limitations, and failure to remove architectural barriers is not a violation unless it is \"readily achievable.\" \"Readily achievable\" means easily accomplishable without much difficulty or expense. Reasonable modifications in practices are required unless they pose an undue burden. Reasonable modifications in practices, policies, or procedures are required unless they would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods, services, facilities, or privileges or result in an undue burden. An undue burden is defined as an action involving \"significant difficulty or expense.\" Title III contains a specific exemption for religious entities, such as a preschool run by a religious entity. Private clubs or establishments exempted from coverage under Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are also not covered by Title III. Private clubs may be granted exemption status if members have control over operations, selection process is selective, fees are charged, operated on a nonprofit basis, and not founded to avoid civil rights law compliance. However, facilities lose exemption if made available to nonmembers. Title III also addresses discrimination in public transportation services. Regulations for bus purchases are issued by the Secretary of Transportation. DOJ amended Title III regulations in 2010. The amended Title III regulations, effective March 15, 2011, adopt new accessibility standards from the Access Board. They include detailed standards for service animals, mobility devices, ticketing, and effective communication. Compliance with the 2010 design standards is required by March 15, 2012. Title III does not mandate accommodation for individuals posing a direct threat to others' health or safety. In Bragdon v. Abbott, the Supreme Court emphasized that the assessment of a significant risk must be based on objective evidence. Dr. Bragdon's belief in a risk of infection was deemed too speculative by the First Circuit Court of Appeals, leading to a summary judgment in his favor. The Supreme Court declined to review a similar decision by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court declined to review a Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals decision on the direct threat exception to Title III. In Montalvo v. Radcliffe, the Fourth Circuit ruled that excluding a child with HIV from karate classes did not violate the ADA due to the significant risk posed to others. In Martin v. PGA Tour, the Supreme Court held in a 7-2 decision that a golfer with a mobility impairment had the right to use a golf cart in professional competitions under the ADA's equal access requirements. The Ninth Circuit had allowed the cart's use as it did not fundamentally alter the competition. The Court discussed whether golf tournaments and their qualifying rounds fall under the coverage of Title III of the ADA, focusing on the violation of the substantive nondiscrimination provision. The ADA requires reasonable modifications to be made for individuals with disabilities unless it fundamentally alters the nature of the event, such as changing an essential aspect of the game. Justice Stevens found that waiving the walking rule for Casey Martin did not fundamentally alter the essence of tournament golf, as shot-making is the key aspect of the game. He noted that fatigue from walking was not significant, and allowing golf carts in certain events showed flexibility in the rules. An individualized inquiry was necessary to determine if using a cart would give Martin an advantage. The majority found that an individualized inquiry must be made to determine if a specific modification for a person's disability would be reasonable and not a fundamental alteration. Casey Martin experienced greater fatigue even with a cart, leading to a dissent from Justices Scalia and Thomas who argued that the ADA does not apply to golf tournaments. The Supreme Court decision in Norwegian Cruise Line, Ltd. v. Justice Kennedy ruled that the ADA applies to foreign cruise ships in U.S. waters. The decision clarified the split in circuits regarding the ADA's applicability to foreign ships, stating that modifications must be \"readily achievable\" and not conflict with international legal obligations. The 5-4 decision highlighted the need for individualized inquiries for reasonable accommodations. The Supreme Court decision in Norwegian Cruise Line, Ltd. v. Justice Kennedy ruled that the ADA applies to foreign cruise ships in U.S. waters. The decision highlighted the need for individualized inquiries for reasonable accommodations, with Justice Scalia dissenting on the interpretation of the ADA without a clear statement from Congress. The ADA, enacted in 1990, does not specifically cover the Internet, but the Department of Justice has not provided specific regulations for online accessibility. The Department of Justice believes the ADA requires Internet accessibility and is considering revising regulations to make websites accessible to individuals with disabilities. DOJ testified that access to the Internet is a civil rights issue and websites covered by Titles II and III must be fully accessible. Guidance may be issued for private businesses' websites. The Department of Justice is seeking public comment on the issues surrounding internet accessibility for private businesses covered by Title III of the ADA. Despite uncertainty in court decisions, there is a likelihood that the ADA will apply to online retailers. The Department of Justice is seeking public comment on the application of the ADA to online retailers. Despite uncertainty in court decisions, it is likely that the ADA's broad nondiscrimination mandate will prevail. The issue of ADA coverage for internet sites will continue to be closely watched. It is important to note that federal government websites are already required to be accessible under a separate statute, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. Additionally, there have been bills introduced in Congress regarding individuals with disabilities filing multiple lawsuits for minor violations, with a notable case finding the plaintiff to be a vexatious litigant. The Ninth Circuit upheld rulings against a vexatious litigant who filed numerous ADA lawsuits to harass businesses. The court required the plaintiff to seek permission before filing more claims. The ADA's goal of equal access may require serial litigation, but abuse of the system is not tolerated. The Ninth Circuit upheld rulings against a vexatious litigant who filed numerous ADA lawsuits to harass businesses, imposing a prefiling order due to false factual allegations. In Ford v. Schering-Plough Corporation, the Third Circuit found no ADA violation in a disparity in benefits for physical and mental illnesses. The court ruled that franchisers with limited control over franchisee-run stores are not covered under Title III of the ADA. Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 remedies and procedures are incorporated in Title III of the ADA, which generally includes injunctive relief, not damages. State and local governments can seek certification from the Attorney General for meeting ADA accessibility requirements. The ADA sets accessibility requirements for buildings, with the Attorney General able to enforce penalties for violations. Good faith efforts and consideration for unique needs are taken into account. Regulations for public accommodations and transportation provisions have been established. Title IV of the ADA amends the Communications Act of 1934. Title IV of the ADA amends the Communications Act of 1934 to ensure telecommunications relay services are available to hearing and speech impaired individuals. Television public service announcements funded by the federal government must include closed captioning. Title V contains controversial provisions and the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 made additions to it. Section 501 addresses the ADA's relationship to other laws. Section 501 of the ADA clarifies that the act does not lower standards set by the Rehabilitation Act and does not limit existing rights or remedies under other laws. It also states that individuals with disabilities cannot be forced to accept accommodations they do not want. The section also addresses limitations on insurance coverage but prohibits using these limitations to avoid the ADA's purposes. The ADA prohibits using insurance coverage limitations to evade its purposes. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an injunction for an employer to pay for chemotherapy for an employee with breast cancer. The court ruled that denying bone marrow treatment for breast cancer violated the ADA if the treatment is non-experimental and comparable to treatments for other conditions covered by the health plan. The ADA Amendments Act clarified that it does not change eligibility standards for benefits under workers' compensation or disability programs. The ADA Amendments Act clarifies that modifications in policies, practices, or procedures may be required unless it fundamentally alters the nature of the goods or services provided. This provision was added at the request of the higher education community to ensure that academic institutions' obligations under the ADA are not altered. The Act also prohibits reverse discrimination claims. The ADA Amendments Act clarifies that covered entities do not need to provide reasonable accommodations to individuals solely regarded as having a disability. Section 502 removes state immunity from lawsuits, while Section 503 prohibits retaliation for opposing discriminatory acts and allows for increased compensation under the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. The Fair Pay Act, P.L. 111-2, allows for increased compensation in cases of discrimination under the ADA. Section 504 requires guidelines for accessibility, Section 505 provides for attorneys' fees, and Section 506 grants authority to issue regulations. Section 507 offers technical assistance, and Section 508 mandates a study on wilderness designations. The ADA allows the use of wheelchairs in wilderness areas and encourages alternative dispute resolution. Congress expanded coverage in the Congressional Accountability Act, incorporating remedies similar to those in the ADA for the private sector. Section 505 of the ADA provides for attorneys' fees in any legal action or administrative proceeding. Section 505 of the ADA allows for attorneys' fees in legal actions or administrative proceedings. The Supreme Court decision in Buckhannon rejected the \"catalyst theory\" for attorneys' fees, stating that fees are only available with a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties. The question in Buckhannon was whether a \"prevailing party\" includes a party who did not secure a judgment but still achieved the desired result through the lawsuit. The Supreme Court decision in Buckhannon rejected the \"catalyst theory\" for attorneys' fees, stating that fees are only available with a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties. The Court held that the term \"prevailing party\" cannot be interpreted broadly, thus denying fees to parties who did not secure a judgment but achieved the desired result through the lawsuit. The Supreme Court rejected the \"catalyst theory\" for attorneys' fees in Buckhannon, stating fees require a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship. Changes in ADA's language to address vexatious lawsuits have been proposed since the 106th Congress. Proponents argue that notification requirements in ADA lawsuits could prevent money-driven suits, while opponents believe it would hinder ADA enforcement. H.R. 881, the ADA Notification Act of 2011, introduced by Representative Hunter, would mandate plaintiffs to notify defendants of alleged violations before pursuing legal action. Failure to provide notice would result in the loss of court jurisdiction."
