    "content": "The Rail Transportation Security Act may be cited as the Rail Transportation Security Risk Assessment. The Rail Transportation Security Act, also known as the Rail Transportation Security Risk Assessment, requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to assess security risks in freight and passenger rail transportation. Recommendations include improving rail infrastructure security and deploying chemical and biological weapon detection equipment. The Rail Transportation Security Act mandates the Secretary of Homeland Security to assess security risks in rail transportation, including deploying detection equipment, training employees in terrorism response, and evaluating economic impacts. The assessment will review existing efforts by public and private sectors, consult with rail management, labor, facility owners, and public safety officials, and produce a report within 180 days. Within 180 days of enactment, the Secretary must submit a report to Congress containing assessment and recommendations. The report may be submitted in classified or redacted formats if deemed necessary. $515,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2005 to implement the recommendations and award grants. The Secretary must prioritize recommendations and award grants for purposes identified in the assessment, with funds remaining available until expended. SEC. 3 amends Section 28101 to include any rail carrier. Within 180 days, the Secretary of Transportation will review rail regulations to enhance safety and security. SEC. 4 calls for a study on foreign rail transport security programs. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on foreign rail transportation security programs in Japan, the European Union, and other countries to identify effective security measures. A report will be submitted to Congress, assessing the feasibility of implementing similar measures in the United States. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to study the feasibility of implementing security screening for passengers, baggage, and cargo on Amtrak trains. A pilot program for random security screening at 5 of the busiest rail stations will be conducted as part of the study. Results and recommendations will be reported to Congress one year after the enactment of this Act. The Secretary will select up to five additional rail stations served by Amtrak to achieve a distribution based on geographic location and size. SEC. 6. CERTAIN PERSONNEL LIMITATIONS NOT TO APPLY. Any limit on Transportation Security Administration employees does not apply if they are implementing this title. SEC. 7. LIFE SAFETY AND INFRASTRUCTURE. In fiscal year 2005, funds are authorized for Amtrak to upgrade various tunnels, including $677 million for New York tunnels, $57 million for the Baltimore & Potomac tunnel, and $40 million for the Washington, D.C. Union Station tunnels. These upgrades include ventilation, communication, lighting, and passenger safety improvements. In fiscal year 2005, $3,000,000 is allocated for the preliminary design of a new tunnel in Baltimore to increase capacity, separate from funds for tunnel upgrades in New York and Washington, D.C."
