    "content": "The Act titled \"Cooperator Program Act of 1995\" is established for specific purposes and policies. Congress finds that the future prosperity of US agriculture relies on access to foreign markets, with producers increasingly dependent on exports. Despite progress in trade negotiations, world agricultural trade remains unfair. Major competitors invest $500 million annually in foreign market development for their producers. The Foreign Agricultural Service's foreign market development cooperator program has been successful in expanding US agricultural exports and advancing the country's economic interests. It is recommended that the program and activities of cooperator organizations be supported and expanded in collaboration between the Secretary of Agriculture and the private sector. The policy of the United States is to preserve and strengthen the foreign market development cooperator program of the Department of Agriculture, where trade organizations funded by agricultural producers work with the Department to maintain and develop foreign markets for US agricultural commodities. The Act aims to authorize and govern the foreign market development cooperator program of the Department of Agriculture to ensure its effective operation. The Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is amended to include the Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program, which defines eligible trade organizations as those promoting US agricultural exports without a business interest in specific sales. The Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program, established under SEC. 702, aims to maintain and develop foreign markets for US agricultural commodities. Cost sharing assistance is provided to eligible trade organizations for foreign market development activities. Eligibility for the program is outlined in SEC. 703. Eligible trade organizations must be primarily funded by US industry members, submit an annual marketing plan, and meet Secretary's requirements to participate in foreign market development activities. The Secretary can only approve contracts if activities meet specified criteria. The Secretary approves contracts under specific criteria, including the likelihood of success in increasing foreign consumption of US agricultural products, long-term contributions to exports, focus on important commodities, provision of US-based staff, and a commitment by private entities. The Secretary approves contracts based on criteria such as increasing foreign consumption of US agricultural products, long-term export contributions, focus on key commodities, US-based staff provision, private organizations' commitment to aggressive selling in desired markets where the US competes with other exporting countries. \"Cooperator responsibilities are outlined in Section 704.\" An eligible trade organization in the foreign market development cooperator program must provide market development and customer support services outside the US for foreign purchasers of agricultural commodities. This includes trade servicing, technical assistance, and consumer education to increase foreign demand for US products. The curr_chunk focuses on developing foreign demand for commodities or products, establishing a presence in foreign markets, enhancing competitiveness, utilizing new technologies, and increasing technical contact with US production industries. The curr_chunk discusses the coordination, assistance, and consultation aspects of the foreign market development cooperator program, including identifying third parties for contributions and achieving specified goals set by the Secretary. The development cooperator program coordinates activities with the Foreign Agricultural Service to assist trade organizations in promoting US agricultural products internationally. Eligible organizations consult with the Service to ensure their marketing plans align with foreign market goals. The curr_chunk complements the foreign market development activities of the Service. An eligible trade organization participating in the foreign market development cooperator program must develop and submit an annual marketing plan to the Secretary, detailing how assistance will be used. The plan can be amended with the Secretary's approval. The Secretary monitors funds expenditure by trade organizations, requiring financial reporting and record-keeping. Organizations must undergo audits for activities under the foreign market development cooperator program. The Secretary evaluates the foreign market development activities of eligible trade organizations to assess compliance with annual marketing plans and the effectiveness in maintaining and developing markets for US agricultural commodities. The Secretary evaluates foreign market development activities for high-volume agricultural commodities and products, considering long-term benefits to the US economy and competition from other exporting countries. The Secretary may provide agricultural commodities to cooperator organizations for market expansion projects. These commodities are in addition to funds for market development activities. The Secretary will prevent conflicts of interest among participating organizations. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations totaling $40,000,000 for fiscal years 1996 through 2002 is authorized for carrying out the title. Additionally, a section on the collection of information on foreign markets is amended in the Agricultural Act of 1954. The Agricultural Act of 1954 is amended to include the collection of information on foreign markets. The Secretary of Agriculture will coordinate these activities with the foreign market development cooperator program. Additionally, a section on cooperator organizations is repealed. Implementation and transitional provisions are also outlined. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish the foreign market development cooperator program within 90 days of the Act's enactment. Ongoing projects will be incorporated into the program, with funds transferred accordingly. Adjustments will be made to reflect the transferred funds for fiscal year 1996."
