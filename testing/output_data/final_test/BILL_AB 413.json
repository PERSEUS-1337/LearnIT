    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature intends for the certification created by this act to align with the California Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise Program's goal of supporting disabled veterans in rehabilitation and training through entrepreneurship. The California Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise Program aims to support disabled veterans in rehabilitation and training through entrepreneurship. The program prohibits non-disabled veterans from taking on the role of a disabled veteran within the program to prevent competition for benefits. Spouses or children of disabled veterans can participate in the program under certain conditions, such as fulfilling existing contracts or managing the business after the owner's death or disability. The legislation allows for a three-year transition period for the orderly transfer of a certified disabled veteran business enterprise after the death or permanent disability of the majority owner. The intent is to provide the spouse or child of the owner the opportunity to temporarily control and operate the business. The California Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise Program, established to support disabled veterans in entrepreneurship, aims for a minimum of 3% participation in state contracts. Definitions for the program are provided in the legislation. In the California Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise Program, the administering agency is the Treasurer for professional bond services, and the Department of General Services\u2019 Office of Small Business and Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise Services for contracts under Section 999.2. The awarding department refers to any state agency or entity authorized to issue bonds or enter contracts on behalf of the state. Bonds include various forms of indebtedness issued by or for the state. A \"contract\" encompasses agreements to provide professional bond services, labor, materials, or equipment for the State of California. It also includes joint development agreements for contracts, franchises, concessions, or leases granted by state agencies. \"A 'contractor' is a person or entity that submits a bid and enters into a contract with a state agency. A 'disabled veteran business enterprise contractor, subcontractor, or supplier' is certified by the administering agency and performs a commercially useful function in providing services or goods for contract requirements.\" A person or entity performing a \"commercially useful function\" in a contract must execute a distinct element of the work, manage or supervise the work, handle products and supplies, and not subcontract more than normal industry practices. A disabled veteran business enterprise must perform a distinct role in a contract to be considered commercially useful. A disabled veteran is defined as a veteran with at least a 10-percent service-connected disability domiciled in the state. A disabled veteran business enterprise must be at least 51% owned by disabled veterans or have at least 51% of its stock unconditionally owned by disabled veterans. Management and control of daily operations must also be by disabled veterans. A business can qualify as a disabled veteran business enterprise if it is a sole proprietorship, corporation, or partnership with its home office in the United States and not a branch or subsidiary of a foreign-based business. Additionally, if a disabled veteran who is a majority owner passes away or is certified as permanently disabled, the business can still be considered a disabled veteran business enterprise for up to three years if inherited or controlled by the spouse or child of the majority owner. After the death or permanent medical disability of the majority owner, a disabled veteran business enterprise can continue existing for up to three years to facilitate the orderly transfer of the business. Additionally, a foreign corporation is defined as a business entity incorporated or headquartered outside the United States. The term \"goal\" refers to a specific objective that awarding departments and contractors must strive to achieve. (10) \u201cManagement and control\u201d refers to effective management of the business entity.\n(11) \u201cProfessional bond services\u201d include various services related to the issuance and sale of bonds."
