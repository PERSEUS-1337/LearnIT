    "content": "The FY2002 DOD Appropriations Act (H.R. 3338) was signed into law by the President on January 10, 2002. It allocated $20 billion in Emergency Terrorism Response funding to combat terrorism and provide aid to victims. The debate centered on shifting $4.3 billion from DOD to non-defense agencies for terrorism efforts and aid to New York City. Efforts to increase antiterrorism funding beyond the $20 billion enacted in the emergency supplemental failed. The final version of the bill provides $317.2 billion to the Department of Defense in regular appropriations, with the DOD Authorization Act (S. 1438) passing on December 13. The chief item of contention, base closures, was resolved by delaying the date to 2005. The total amount of regular appropriations for DOD, along with funds for military construction and defense-related programs, is about the same as requested by the Administration at $343.3 billion. Funding government expenditures in FY2002 will require using the social security surplus and returning to deficit spending due to lower tax revenues from the tax act. Congress provides funding for national defense programs through annual appropriations measures, with the defense appropriations bill being the largest. Congressional debate on major defense policy and funding issues mainly occurs during action on the defense authorization bill, which authorizes programs funded in regular appropriations measures. This report tracks congressional action on both the defense authorization and appropriations bills. The annual defense appropriations bill provides funds for military activities of the Department of Defense, including pay, benefits, operation, maintenance, procurement, and research. It also includes funding for other purposes such as the Central Intelligence Agency retirement fund and intelligence community management. Additionally, other appropriations bills provide funds for national defense activities of DOD and other agencies. The military construction appropriations bill finances military facilities and family housing, administered by DOD. The energy and water development appropriations bill funds atomic energy defense activities. Other appropriations bills fund civil defense, national security activities, and defense-related activities of the Coast Guard. On January 10, 2002, the President signed the FY2002 DOD Appropriations Act. The FY2002 DOD Appropriations Act, signed into law as P.L. 107-117 (H.R. 3338), allocated $20 billion for emergency terrorism response. Congress provided $343.3 billion for National Defense, slightly less than requested for the Department of Defense but more for military construction and energy defense programs. DOD received $3.5 billion from the emergency supplemental funding. The FY2002 DOD Appropriations Act, signed into law as P.L. 107-117 (H.R. 3338), allocated $3.5 billion to DOD, preserving the Administration's priorities for defense funding, including increases in military pay and missile defense spending. Congress reduced operations and maintenance spending to accommodate increases in procurement and RDT&E accounts. Congress also passed S. 1438, authorizing another round of base closures in 2005. During the FY2002 Defense Appropriations Act, Congress allocated $3.5 billion to DOD, maintaining the Administration's defense funding priorities. A debate ensued over the $20 billion emergency supplemental funding for terrorism, with $4.3 billion shifted to New York recovery and homeland defense. Suggestions were made for additional defense funding in a FY2002 supplemental, despite previous attempts being vetoed. The FY2002 Defense Appropriations Act allocated $3.5 billion to DOD, with $17.5 billion provided by the emergency supplemental. Non-defense agencies received $22.5 billion, with major emphasis on New York recovery, bioterrorism, and investigatory activities. Total funding for national defense in FY2002 included $3.5 billion from the emergency supplemental. The national defense funding in FY2002, including $3.5 billion from the Emergency Terrorism Response supplemental, totaled $346.8 billion. DOD also received $14.0 billion from the supplemental distributed by the President. Overall, resources available to DOD have increased by $56 billion since the new Administration, with additional funding provided through various sources. President Bush allocated $17.5 billion in emergency funding for counterterrorism, increasing defense resources by $56 billion or 18% in real growth. This increase is comparable to President Reagan's $61.6 billion or 19% real growth in defense resources in his first year. The additional funding required Congress to set aside budgetary guidelines to protect the surplus generated by Social Security and Medicare trust funds and return to deficit spending. The Emergency Terrorism Response supplemental allocated $40 billion in emergency funding, with $20 billion available for distribution in FY2001 and the remaining $20 billion in FY2002. In the enacted version of H.R. 3338, P.L. 107-117, the FY2002 DOD appropriations bill, Congress endorses most of the Administration request, including funding for the Ballistic Missile Defense program and major weapons systems. The FY2002 DOD appropriations bill endorses most of the Administration's request, including funding for major weapons systems. Congress reduces funding for troubled programs like the V-22 tilt rotor aircraft and the Navy's new surface combatant. The overall RDT&E funding level is higher than requested, with the greatest divergence in funding priorities for Operation and Maintenance. Congress reduces O&M funding by $3.1 billion in FY2002 to reflect anticipated savings from management reforms and various pricing adjustments. The Contingency Operations Transfer Fund funds ongoing contingency operations like Bosnia and unanticipated operations. Congress transfers funds designated for Bosnia to the services and cuts $650 million from the request due to accounting issues. This issue may resurface in the FY2003 budget request. For more details on congressional changes, refer to individual sections on \"Major Issues\" and \"Other Important Issues\" below. The Senate passed the FY2002 DOD appropriations bill with major changes, including $20 billion in emergency supplemental funding for terrorism. Debate focused on the allocation of the emergency funds. The Senate passed the FY2002 DOD appropriations bill with major changes, including $20 billion in emergency supplemental funding for terrorism. During Senate floor debate, an additional $15 billion in homeland security funding was removed from the bill. The President threatened to veto any additional funding. The Senate bill shifted $5.3 billion from the Department of Defense to homeland security and aid to New York. The House passed the FY2002 DOD appropriations bill with a compromise agreement. In a compromise agreement, an additional $1.5 billion was allocated to New York in the House version of H.R. 3338 for homeland security needs. Action on defense funding bills was delayed due to various events, including disputes over funding for terrorism and anthrax testing. The President had requested $21.1 billion in emergency supplemental funds for the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense requested $21.1 billion in emergency supplemental funds, with $14 billion already distributed by the President. The FY2001 Emergency Appropriations Act provided $40 billion for relief and response to the terrorist attack, with $17.5 billion allocated to DOD. Only $57 million of the emergency funds remain unallocated. The FY2001 Emergency Appropriations Act provided $40 billion for relief and response to the terrorist attack, with $17.5 billion allocated to DOD. Funds designated as emergency spending are not subject to budget limitations. The President consulted with appropriations committees for fund transfers. $10 billion was immediately available, with an additional $10 billion available after a 15-day notification period. The FY2001 Emergency Appropriations Act allocated $40 billion for relief and response to the terrorist attack, with $17.5 billion going to DOD. An additional $20 billion could be accessed later. The law specified that at least $20 billion should be used for disaster recovery related to the attacks on September 11, 2001. The President could request more funding if needed, with reporting requirements outlined in subsequent legislation. The DOD appropriations act included quarterly reports after enactment. Congress authorized military force against those responsible for the terrorist attack. The U.S. began bombing Afghanistan to destroy terrorist training camps and dislodge the Taliban government. OMB sent Congress notifications of intended allocations from the $40 billion emergency supplemental. Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees included their allocations in a separate section. Policy differences emerged over the $40 billion emergency supplemental spending for recovery and response efforts. The White House argued that the amount was sufficient for the moment, while lawmakers called for immediate resources above the $40 billion figure, with a focus on funds for New York City to meet the $20 billion allocation directive. President Bush threatened to veto legislation that would spend more than the $40 billion already enacted. These issues were debated during floor discussions. During the debate on the $40 billion emergency supplemental spending, Congress altered the President's plan by allocating $22.5 billion (56%) to non-defense activities and $17.5 billion (44%) to defense programs. The Department of Defense received $21.1 billion (53%) while non-defense agencies received $18.6 billion (47%). The recipients of funds based on notified and proposed allocations are FEMA ($6.6 billion), Health and Human Services ($2.9 billion), Housing and Urban Affairs ($2.7 billion), Justice ($2.2 billion), and Transportation ($2 billion). There are debates on whether the $40 billion package is sufficient, if allocations match critical priorities like homeland security, and if New York and other affected areas are receiving adequate funds. Many expected New York to receive around $20 billion of the total emergency supplemental. The $40 billion emergency supplemental allocation includes about half, or $20 billion, for non-defense agencies. Congress reduced defense activities to $17.5 billion or 44% of the total. For more information on the allocation distribution, refer to various CRS reports and appropriations reports available online. Congress reduced defense activities to $17.5 billion or 44% of the total in the $40 billion emergency supplemental allocation. Despite a $3.5 billion cut by Congress, the President's priorities for defense spending to combat terrorism remained largely intact. About 30% of the allocation for Defense is for funding the Afghan war and related operations, with another 30% for intelligence and surveillance. Congress reduced defense activities to $17.5 billion or 44% of the total in the $40 billion emergency supplemental allocation. Despite a $3.5 billion cut, the President's priorities for defense spending to combat terrorism remained intact. Funds are allocated for the Afghan war, intelligence, self-defense weapons, security upgrades, command and control, munitions, Pentagon repair, and crisis response. Congress accommodated the cut by providing funding within the regular defense bill and allowing DOD to transfer funds for RDT&E and procurement if needed. In the emergency supplemental, $300 million remains to be distributed by the President. Congress plays a central role in deciding how half of the $40 billion anti-terrorism funds will be spent. The President's plan allocates over one-third to DOD and over one-quarter to recovery activities, totaling $12.5 billion. Assistance to victims of terrorist attacks receives about 11%, or $2.3 billion. The $20 billion emergency supplemental spending for homeland security and terrorism combat was approved by Congress, with allocations for infrastructure security, bioterrorism, and investigative activities. The final legislation differed significantly from the initial proposal, doubling funds for certain areas while reducing defense spending by more than half. The final compromise on the $20 billion emergency supplemental spending for homeland security and terrorism combat included increasing homeland security and New York aid while decreasing defense resources by more than half. This involved halving funding for various defense activities such as intelligence, surveillance, force protection, command and control, and worldwide posture. The emergency supplemental spending bill reduced funding for the Afghan war and DOD's homeland defense activities by half, from $2.9 billion to $1.45 billion. This included cuts to offensive counter-terrorism, initial crisis response, and repair and upgrade of the Pentagon. Congress requires DOD to provide quarterly reports on the expenditure of these funds. The emergency supplemental spending bill reduced funding for the Afghan war and DOD's homeland defense activities by half, from $2.9 billion to $1.45 billion. Congress requires DOD to provide detailed quarterly reports on the expenditure of these funds, including spending by project and categories for military personnel and operation and maintenance. The first report is due 45 days after enactment, with subsequent reports quarterly. The emergency supplemental spending bill reduced funding for the Afghan war and DOD's homeland defense activities by half, from $2.9 billion to $1.45 billion. Congress requires DOD to provide detailed quarterly reports on the expenditure of these funds. $20 billion is available to agencies after being enacted in a subsequent appropriations act. H.R. 3338 transfers $300 million for reconstruction and hardening of command centers in the Pentagon. The Senate-passed version does not specify how individual categories would be affected. The category 'other' includes potential increases in fuel costs. Funding added by Congress for military construction. H.R. 3338 transfers $30 million of DOD funds to the Former Soviet Union Threat Reduction appropriation in the Department of State. Up to $100 million for military and logistical support to Pakistan and Jordan for their support in the Afghan war. Section 306 of the conference version. The emergency supplemental spending bill reduced funding for the Afghan war and DOD's homeland defense activities by half, from $2.9 billion to $1.45 billion. Congress requires DOD to provide detailed quarterly reports on the expenditure of these funds. $20 billion is available to agencies after being enacted in a subsequent appropriations act. H.R. 3338 transfers $300 million for reconstruction and hardening of command centers in the Pentagon. Up to $100 million for military and logistical support to Pakistan and Jordan for their support in the Afghan war. Section 306 of the conference version allows for transfer of funds to support Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Noble Anvil. The Appropriation Bill, 2002, and supplemental appropriations, including the Conference report to accompany H.R. 3338, Department of Defense Appropriations Bill, focused on transferring defense resources to fund homeland security and recovery needs. Major non-defense elements of the agreement included $2.84 billion for bioterrorism and $8.2 billion for recovery efforts in New York and other affected areas. The total allocated funds for recovery efforts in New York and other jurisdictions, combined with previously allocated funds, will amount to $11.2 billion out of the entire $40 billion supplemental. The allocated funds for various security measures include $759 million for border security, $540 million for aviation security, and $2.1 billion for counterterrorism aid. Additionally, $500 million is allocated for Postal Service assistance. The Senate debated the allocation of funds from the first $20 billion portion of the supplemental, including $226 million for securing nuclear materials, with $135 million designated for sites in Russia and former Soviet states. There was controversy over an additional $15 billion for homeland security and New York, which was removed from emergency designation, leading to a point of order due to exceeding the allowable allocation under Section 302 (a) of the concurrent budget resolution. The Senate adopted a compromise amendment reducing emergency anti-terrorism spending to $20 billion while reallocating funds for bioterrorism, New York recovery, and security measures. The Senate version of the bill reduced Department of Defense funding and added funds for various non-defense needs. This compromise was reached in the conference. In a compromise reached during the conference, the Senate reduced Department of Defense funding by $5.3 billion and allocated $2 billion, with $475 million designated for military construction at the Pentagon. The remaining $1.53 billion was not specified for specific categories of DOD spending. The Defense Department would have received $21.1 billion under the President's proposed allocations, the largest share of the total funding available. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld urged Congress to provide the full $7.3 billion requested to maintain priorities for the war in Afghanistan. Senator Stevens suggested that DOD should receive the entire amount to avoid curtailing training and operations. Senator Stevens suggested that the Department of Defense had already received a large increase of over $42 billion compared to the previous year. The Department of Defense has authority to obligate monies in advance of appropriations for emergency expenses. DOD had already been allotted $3.6 billion for expenses associated with the conflict in Afghanistan. Table 6 describes the purposes for the Administration's defense requests and compares the amounts provided by the House and Senate with the Administration's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $20 billion in funding as requested by the President, along with an additional $15 billion proposed by Senator Byrd. The funding for the Department of Defense is appropriated to a central fund, the Defense Emergency Response Fund, for flexibility and separate tracking of emergency funds. DOD can transfer funds between categories if necessary, such as for the conflict in Afghanistan or additional training. The Senate proposed an additional $15 billion in funding, split evenly between homeland security, recovery activities, and aid to New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. The Senate bill allocated $7.5 billion to FEMA for New York's recovery activities and emphasized areas such as bioterrorism prevention, federal anti-terrorism law enforcement, border security, and security for nuclear power plants. For more details on non-defense funding increases, refer to CRS Report RL31187(pdf). House Passage of Funding to Combat Terrorism. Representative Walsh reached an agreement with the Administration to provide an additional $2.1 billion for New York, totaling $11.5 billion. The House endorsed funding priorities recommended by the President, including defense and law enforcement programs. Various changes were made to allocations in both defense and non-defense programs during House consideration. During House consideration, amendments to add funding were rejected, including Representative Obey's $6.5 billion for non-defense agencies, Representative Walsh's $9.7 billion for those affected by the attacks, Representative Lowey's $10.4 billion for NY, VA, and PA, and Representative Murtha's $6.5 billion for the Department of Defense. Some Members questioned if $20 billion was enough. Some Members questioned if $20 billion was sufficient to meet all the pressing needs related to the terrorist attacks, with concerns about funding for law enforcement, bioterrorism preparedness, border protection, and other homeland security priorities. Members from New York argued that the President's plan fell short of the anticipated $20 billion allocation for specific needs in New York City, Virginia, and rural Pennsylvania. There were also calls for additional defense resources beyond the $7.3 billion recommended by the Administration. President Bush threatened to veto the appropriation measure if it exceeded a certain amount. The House Appropriations Committee added funds for various defense priorities, including precision guided munitions, special operations forces equipment, and chemical-biological protection projects. An additional $1.5 billion was allocated to New York in a Rules Committee amendment, reflecting an agreement between Representative Walsh and the White House. The House Appropriations Committee recommended significant increases in bioterrorism and counterterrorism aid, as well as funds for passenger and baggage screening activities. The House also proposed reductions to the President's non-defense request, transferring funds for dislocated workers assistance and FEMA grants to New York. H.R. 3338 supports many of the President's funding priorities, including $4.9 billion for FEMA to remove debris in New York City. The President proposed $4.9 billion for FEMA to address various needs in New York City, including debris removal, building reconstruction, and transportation repairs. Other priorities endorsed by both the committee and the President include dislocated worker grants, pharmaceutical stockpile supplies, and operation expenses for law enforcement agencies. The Defense Department was allocated $20.7 billion, the largest share of the total funding available. The Defense Department received $17.5 billion in funding under the Emergency Terrorism Response supplemental, with $14.0 billion immediately available. The funding is being appropriated to a central fund for various purposes, from supporting the conflict in Afghanistan to Pentagon repair and renovation. The Defense Department's funding from the Emergency Terrorism Response supplemental is being appropriated to a central fund, the Defense Emergency Response Fund, for flexibility and separate tracking of emergency funds. The largest category in the Administration's request is $6.5 billion for increased worldwide posture to support ongoing operations in Afghanistan or elsewhere. The $6.5 billion funding request covers higher operating costs for deployed forces, airlifting supplies, activating reservists, and hazardous duty pay. It is an estimate for additional funding needed for operations in Afghanistan until mid-March 2002, reflecting a 15% increase in normal operating tempo costs for all DOD forces. Initial cost estimates are uncertain and likely to be revised due to rapid changes in the situation. The Department of Defense has not released any estimates of costs incurred in the conflict thus far. Funding of $5.8 billion is allocated for improving intelligence and surveillance, including upgrades to reconnaissance platforms. An additional $2.4 billion has been requested for enhancing physical security. An additional $2.4 billion has been requested by DOD for \"Enhanced Force Protection,\" to purchase self-defense weapons and sensors for ships, aircraft, upgrades to physical security systems at bases, and increase in active-duty military personnel for security duty. Another $2 billion is requested for \"Offensive Counter-terrorism\" to purchase precision-guided missiles and munitions used in bombing attacks in Afghanistan. The supplemental funding requested by DOD includes money for accurate targeting, improving command and communication systems, repairing the Pentagon, aiding New York, patrolling the coasts, and protecting airports. The funding level was set to buy the maximum number of missiles that could be produced in FY2002. The DOD received additional funding in the supplemental for various expenses related to the conflict in Afghanistan, repair of the Pentagon, and program accelerations. Congress may need to evaluate if these changes are permanent and require ongoing investments. The DOD allocations under the $40 billion Emergency Terrorism Response Supplemental were outlined in Table 6. The $40 billion Emergency Terrorism Response Supplemental allocated funds for various expenses related to the conflict in Afghanistan, repair of the Pentagon, and program accelerations. H.R. 3338 allocated $300 million for reconstruction and hardening of command centers in the Pentagon, transferred funds to the Former Soviet Union Threat Reduction appropriation, and provided support to Pakistan and Jordan for military and logistic activities in the Afghan war. Section 306 of H.R. 3338 allowed for the transfer of funds to support Operation Enduring Freedom and DOD's homeland defense activities. The Administration received $300 million in cash resources from Congress for Pentagon reconstruction in H.R. 3338. Various sources were consulted for allocations, including OMB submissions and reports from Appropriations committees and Congress. In H.R. 3338, Department of Defense Appropriation Bill and supplemental appropriations were discussed. There is a lack of consensus on defining activities to combat terrorism and categorizing spending for those activities. Some refer to programs as 'homeland defense'. OMB and Department of Defense use different categories for spending on terrorism-related activities. The OMB estimated that national security community funding to combat terrorism in FY2001 was $5.5 billion, with an additional $1.8 billion spent by the Department of Defense on protecting critical infrastructure. The Administration's estimated request for FY2002 was $6.4 billion, $930 million more than the previous year. The OMB estimated national security community funding to combat terrorism in FY2001 at $5.5 billion, with an additional $1.8 billion spent by the Department of Defense on critical infrastructure protection. The Administration's FY2002 request was $6.4 billion, $930 million higher than the previous year. The revised estimates from OMB reflect the amended budget request sent to Congress by the President in June 27, rather than the initial \"current services\" estimate included in OMB's annual report in August 2001. The funding is divided into five categories: Law enforcement, physical security, preparing for terrorist attacks, and research and development. The role of federal agencies and funding amounts are under review post-9/11. In FY2000 - FY2002, national security funding for combating terrorism totaled $5.5 billion in FY2001 and $6.4 billion in FY2002. Prior to the terrorist attacks, 93% of the FY2002 funding was allocated to law enforcement and physical security. Funding for law enforcement included money for DOD's investigative services and military police, while physical security covered protection of federal facilities. The funding for physical security includes protection of federal facilities, including those overseas where DOD has a substantial presence along with the State Department. The remaining funding includes $249 million for preparing for and responding to terrorist attacks and $199 million for R&D. This total includes funding to protect DOD facilities against attacks that rely on weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and DOD's role as a coordinator of actions by federal, state, and local agencies in response to terrorist incidents. R&D efforts include funding for developing responses to biological warfare and contributing to interagency efforts for counterterrorism technologies and equipment. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, the budgetary context for federal spending has changed dramatically. The possibility of keeping the social security surplus \"off-limits\" has disappeared, leading to deficit spending in 2002 and 2003. Leaders were debating higher spending for discretionary programs, including additional funding for the Department of Defense, after the tax cut in the spring. The Congressional Budget Office predicts deficit spending in 2002 and 2003, with lower estimates due to tax cuts and economic downturn. After September 11, focus shifted to funding defense and homeland security, leading to increased spending and worsening recession. The bipartisan estimate released on October 4, 2001, suggested that additional emergency spending to combat terrorism and discretionary spending for defense, education, and disasters could reduce the total surplus to $52 billion in FY2002 and $65 billion in FY2003, absorbing much of the social security surplus reserved for debt reduction. The bipartisan estimate released on October 4, 2001, highlighted the effects of various factors on the budget outlook, including discretionary spending, emergency anti-terrorist funding, the Airline Assistance Act, and higher interest costs due to a larger public debt. The bipartisan estimate on October 4, 2001, detailed the surplus breakdown, including on-budget surplus with Medicare Hospital Insurance, off-budget surplus with social security trust fund and Postal Service cash flow. Congressional actions up to that date were also reflected. The Emergency Anti-Terrorism supplemental agreement between Congress and the Administration aims to limit total discretionary spending to $686 billion in 2002. Estimates suggest a potential reduction in the surplus due to a recession, with a higher estimate than the Congressional Budget Office's projections. Additionally, there was an agreement in September to cap total discretionary spending at $686 billion for FY2002, including allocations for defense, emergencies, and education. Adjusted estimates assume this level will be maintained after 2002. The estimates assume a level of $686 billion adjusted for inflation after 2002, including outlays from a $40 billion emergency supplemental enacted on September 14, 2001. It also assumes $20 billion for terrorism combat in subsequent years. Higher interest costs are expected due to a larger public debt. The estimates do not include other possible claims on the surplus. The difference between the initial surplus and the effect of congressional actions as of October 4, 2001 is uncertain, especially in estimating the effect of a recession. The budget committee staff's estimates were larger than CBO's predictions for the effects of a recession, but turned out to be too low. New predictions from CBO in January 2002 forecast a reduction in the surplus by $242 billion, much higher than the $80 billion predicted by the budget committees. Congress adhered to the agreement between the President and Congress, allowing for $24.6 billion more in new discretionary budget authority. President and Congress agreed to increase new discretionary budget authority by $24.6 billion, with $18.4 billion for defense, $4 billion for education, and $2.2 billion for disasters. Estimates for future anti-terrorism spending are uncertain, with potential policy changes in entitlement programs and tax policies that could impact the budget. Policy changes, including additions for the farm bill and prescription drug coverage for seniors, could further reduce the surplus. The budget committees did not include potential demands such as an economic stimulus package and additional funding for the Department of Defense. Deficits are expected to reappear in 2002 and 2003 due to various demands and the ongoing recession. Representative Jim Nussle and Representative John M. Spratt, Jr. from the House Budget Committee presented the \"Revised Budgetary Outlook and Principles for Economic Stimulus\" on October 4, 2001. The budget includes increases for specific programs in reserve funds, assumes annual outlays based on historical spending, and includes provisions from the \"Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001.\" More details can be found at http://www.house.gov/budget. The House and Senate passed the conference version of H.R. 3338, the FY2002 DOD appropriations bill, with $317.2 billion allocated for DOD, $1.7 billion below the Administration's request. This reduction was made to provide higher funding for defense-related activities in the Department of Energy, Military Construction, and other defense-related activities. The FY2002 DOD appropriations bill allocated $343.3 billion for national defense, with adjustments made to shift funds from DOD to homeland security and recovery activities. Funding for bioterrorism, law enforcement, and infrastructure security activities doubled, while funding for intelligence-related activities was halved in the enacted version. The Senate passed H.R. 3338 with $317.6 billion for regular Department of Defense spending, the same amount as in the House-passed bill. The bill reflected the markup by the Senate Appropriations Committee on December 5. The Senate Appropriations Committee endorsed the Administration's proposals for increases in military pay and benefits, fully-funding the Defense Health program, and providing $60.9 billion for procurement. They also allocated $8.3 billion for missile defense. The Senate appropriators provide $8.3 billion for missile defense, with the President able to re-allocate $1.3 billion for terrorism. They do not transfer missile defense programs to a separate title as in the House bill. Additionally, the Senate includes $1.9 billion in O&M adjustments, less than the House bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee also includes a potentially controversial proposal on tanker aircraft. The Senate Appropriations Committee included a provision to lease commercial transport aircraft for up to ten years and convert them to military tanker aircraft. The bill categorized this as an operating lease, allowing annual funding instead of a $20 billion upfront payment. The aircraft would need modifications for military use, which the legislation allows at a later date. The House bill does not have a similar provision. Both the Senate and House versions fully-funded the Air Force's F-22Captor program and criticized the Navy's shipbuilding program management. The House and Senate criticized the Navy for poor shipbuilding program management, including large cost growth and poor definition of the new cruiser program. Both houses cut the V-22 Osprey helicopter and added funds for converting retiring ballistic missile submarines. The House passed a version of H.R. 3338 with $317.5 billion for the Department of Defense, $2 billion below the Administration's request. The House Appropriations Committee approved most of the funding for ballistic missile defense programs, providing $7.9 billion out of the $8.1 billion request. The Committee also endorsed the Administration's request for Military Pay and Benefits, including a 4.6% pay increase and full funding for the Defense Health Program. The House Appropriations Committee approved most of the funding for ballistic missile defense programs, providing $7.9 billion out of the $8.1 billion request. They transferred the programs to a separate title covering all counter-terrorism funding, creating a new appropriations title with $11.8 billion including funding for chemical and biological weapons, Patriot PAC-3 procurement, and Defense Threat Reduction Agency. Additionally, $1.7 billion was allocated for enhancements to intelligence and military capabilities for Operation Enduring Freedom and other terrorism combat actions. The House appropriations bill decreased funding by $5.3 billion, with $4.4 billion in Operation and Maintenance accounts and $.8 billion in military personnel. This reduction reflects pricing adjustments, efficiencies, and fact-of-life changes. The bill also included funding for an additional DDG-51 ship, offsetting decreases in other programs and funding the conversion of four Trident submarines. The Military Construction appropriations bill for FY2002 was passed by the House and Senate, signed by the President on November 6, 2001, providing $10.5 billion in funding, $500 million above the Administration's request. The House and Senate added funds for National Guard and Reserve equipment, with changes made to major weapon programs. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees passed their versions of the bill in September, with a conference version approved in July. The conference agreement on bill H.R. 2216 providing supplemental appropriations for FY2001 was approved by both houses. It includes $5.5 billion for the Department of Defense and $5.8 billion for national defense. Unlike previous supplementals, this bill also covers day-to-day operating expenses and unanticipated cost growth. The FY2002 DOD Authorization Act was passed by the House and Senate, providing $343.3 billion as requested by the Administration. The FY2002 DOD Authorization Act provides $343.3 billion as requested by the Administration, with an 11% increase over FY2001. The Act reallocates funds from the Department of Defense to military construction and defense-related activities of the Department of Energy. The passage of the Act was delayed due to the issue of authorizing another round of base closures in 2003, which was eventually agreed upon for 2005. The FY2002 DOD Authorization Act provides $343.3 billion as requested by the Administration, with an 11% increase over FY2001. The Act reallocates funds from the Department of Defense to military construction and defense-related activities of the Department of Energy. The conference version also requires a 'super-majority' of at least seven of the nine commissioners to approve any decision to add bases suggested by the Secretary of Defense. Concerns were raised about the base closure provision during House floor debate, while the Senate debated the de-stabilizing effects of President Bush's withdrawal from the ABM Treaty. Passage of the conference report was delayed by issues such as the Navy's access to the training base at Vieques and the allocation of emergency supplemental spending. The FY2002 defense authorization and appropriations bills were delayed due to the Administration's late submission of an amended request. The conference report resolved major issues, including approving another round of base closures in 2005, authorizing the closure of training facilities at Vieques, and providing $7.0 billion for ballistic missile defense with the option to transfer $1.3 billion to counterterrorism efforts. The conference version of the bill authorizes the President to transfer $1.3 billion to combat terrorism and reduces non-readiness spending for Operation and Maintenance. It also includes increases in pay, housing allowances, and funding for military construction and family housing. Congress authorizes $21.2 billion in emergency funding to combat terrorism. The bill authorizes $21.2 billion in emergency funding for combating terrorism, with an upward spending limit. The Department of Defense received a total of $17.5 billion from the funding allocated by the Administration and appropriators. The bill endorses military retirees receiving VA disability compensation without a reduction in retirement benefits, but implementation is pending legislation submission by the President and cost offsets by Congress. DOD objects to the additional benefit due to high costs and conflicting beneficiary groups. The House passed the DOD Authorization bill, matching the Administration's request of $343.5 billion for national defense. The Rules Committee limited floor amendments due to bipartisan support post-terrorist attacks. Major amendments included funding for F-22 testing, combating terrorism, and allowing active-duty military personnel to assist with border patrol. The House Armed Services Committee markup of H.R. 2586 provided $343.5 billion for national defense, supporting the Administration's requests for military pay improvements and readiness-related funding. Amendments passed included using military installations as polling places, allowing private donations for Pentagon repairs, and establishing a new medal for civilians killed or wounded in hostile action. The House Armed Services Committee supported the Administration's request for additional funding for readiness-related funding but cut non-readiness related O&M by about $1 billion. They also redistributed some funds to enhance training of reserve forces. The Committee provided $47.4 billion for RDT&E, $300 million more than the Administration's request, and supported most of the President's request for missile defense funding. Additionally, the Committee added $525 million to the Administration's request for procurement funds, citing it as a priority due to modernization decisions awaiting completion of the Quadrennial Defense Review. The Senate initially included controversial changes in the DOD Authorization Act but reached a bipartisan compromise to remove provisions requiring congressional approval of anti-ballistic missile testing. The new version of the bill passed unanimously, no longer requiring the President to certify and Congress to approve funding that could violate the ABM Treaty. The removed provisions were included in a separate bill, S. 1439. The Senate passed bill S. 1438, authorizing $1.3 billion in funding for ballistic missile programs, allowing the President to allocate funds to combat terrorism or the BMD program. This increased the total authorized amount to $344.8 billion, above the Administration's request. Amendments included restoring $1.3 billion for BMD programs and rejecting the removal of provisions for a new round of funding. The Senate removed provisions for a new round of base closures in 2003 and adopted the Reid amendment allowing \"concurrent receipt\" of benefits for military retirees with service-connected disabilities, increasing entitlement spending by $2.9 billion in FY2002. This would have a significant long-term effect on the government's budgetary requirements. The Senate's Reid amendment allows for \"concurrent receipt\" of benefits for military retirees with service-connected disabilities, increasing entitlement spending by $2.9 billion in FY2002 and $40.6 billion over the next ten years. The Defense Department would need to allocate about $1 billion annually for this benefit for current service members. The Senate Armed Services Committee markup of S. 1416 provided $343.3 billion for national defense, aligning with the Administration's request. The Senate Armed Services Committee adjusted the Administration's request for additional funds for Defense, adding funds for family housing, military construction, military compensation, procurement of equipment, and conversion of submarines to carry Tomahawk cruise missiles. The Senate Armed Services Committee allocated additional funds for Defense, including converting submarines to carry Tomahawk cruise missiles and investing in missile defense systems. They also reduced funding for certain aircraft and defense programs to achieve savings through management efficiencies. Additionally, the Committee authorized another round of base closures in 2003 to improve defense operations and management. The Senate Armed Services Committee authorized base closures in 2003 to improve defense operations and management, aiming to save $1.6 billion through better practices. Congress approved a budget resolution for FY2002 before the Administration finalized defense spending plans, setting a provisional target of $324.8 billion for national defense. Reserve funds were used to allow for potential increases in defense spending. The mechanism of reserve funds was used to accommodate increased spending in FY2002 and over the FY2002-FY2011 period. Lower mid-session estimates of the surplus, the downturn in the economy, and additional spending in response to terrorist attacks made it impossible to accommodate defense increases without tapping into social security revenues. Both CBO and the Administration predict deficit spending in FY2002 through FY2004, fully using the Medicare and Social Security surplus. Section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act established procedures for implementing budget resolution ceilings on spending in the appropriations process. The congressional budget resolution allocates funds to appropriations committees, with Section 302 (b) requiring the subdivisions among appropriations subcommittees to determine funding for regular appropriations bills, including defense. These allocations can be adjusted and often change during the appropriations process. In the FY2002 DOD appropriations act, Congress increased initial ceilings for Defense to amounts appropriated. The House Appropriations Committee released initial 302(b) allocations for FY2002, with the Subcommittee on Defense receiving $300.3 billion in budget authority. The Subcommittee on Defense received $300.3 billion in budget authority, slightly below the anticipated amount. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved initial allocations, with a revised budget request allowing for an increase in defense allocation. The Bush Administration released budget plans in February and submitted a detailed budget request in April. The budget request submitted on April 9 included $310.5 billion in discretionary budget authority for the Department of Defense. This amount was similar to what the Clinton Administration had planned. The budget did not include defense-related activities of other agencies, but when added, the projected national defense budget for FY2002 was $325.1 billion. The defense totals in the budget request were considered as \"placeholder\" numbers, with a revised budget request planned for the summer after a review of defense strategy. Defense budget estimates beyond FY2002 were based on projected growth at the rate of inflation. The Administration submitted an amended FY2002 defense budget request totaling $328.9 billion in discretionary funding, $18.4 billion more than the April 9 budget. The revised total for the national defense budget function is $343.5 billion. Increased spending was deemed necessary to address defense needs. The amended FY2002 defense budget request of $328.9 billion was 11% higher than the previous year's level, with real growth of 7% to address readiness, healthcare, operations, maintenance, and infrastructure needs. The Administration also adjusted funding projections beyond 2002 in a Mid-Session Review, with final projections pending the FY2003 budget submission after a national strategy review in September 2001. In April 2001, the Bush administration submitted its FY2002 budget to Congress with placeholder numbers for the Department of Defense. Congress passed the FY2001 supplemental on July 20, 2001, and the President signed the bill on July 24, 2001. Discretionary budget authority is appropriated annually to the Department of Defense, while mandatory funding is governed by standing law. The OMB issued revised estimates for defense spending in later years, adding $98 billion to projected spending between FY2001 and FY2006. This increase was to align later years with the amended budget request for FY2002, which added $18.4 billion to the defense budget. The Quadrennial Defense Review outlined four key goals for U.S. military strategy: assuring allies, dissuading competitors, deterring aggression, and defeating adversaries decisively if deterrence fails. The Quadrennial Defense Review emphasized a \"capabilities-based\" strategy over a regional approach, focusing on how an adversary might fight rather than specific regions. It called for restoring emphasis on defending the United States and being prepared to defeat attacks in two theaters of operation simultaneously. The Quadrennial Defense Review shifts focus to emphasizing information operations, ensuring access to distant theaters, and defending the United States. It calls for redeploying forces to give more emphasis to the Middle East and South Asia, with plans to base more forces in the Arabian Gulf. The new approach emphasizes transforming U.S. forces, operational capabilities, and management practices. The new Quadrennial Defense Review emphasizes improving U.S. capabilities in information warfare, intelligence, and space, strengthening joint operations, command and control, and training, selectively replacing current equipment, and reforming DOD management and acquisition practices to achieve efficiencies. It also cites new requirements post-September terrorist attacks and abandons previous plans for gradual increases in defense spending. Three-quarters of the $32.6 billion increase in requested FY2002 DOD discretionary funds compared to FY2001 is allocated to Operation and Maintenance and Military Personnel accounts. The FY2002 budget increase was allocated to fund readiness-related activities, military compensation, and RDT&E, with a significant portion going towards ballistic missile defense. The FY2002 request included minimal changes in weapons procurement due to an ongoing strategic review, with the conclusions to be reflected in the FY2003 budget instead. The FY2002 budget increase was allocated to fund readiness-related activities, military compensation, and RDT&E, with a focus on improving military compensation to meet recruitment and retention goals. This included a 5% increase in basic pay. The FY2002 budget increase included a 5% increase in basic pay, a 15% increase in housing allowance for military personnel, $1 billion for targeted pay improvements, and $2.9 billion for bonuses and incentives. The FY2002 budget increase included a 5% increase in basic pay, a 15% increase in housing allowance for military personnel, $1 billion for targeted pay improvements, and $2.9 billion for bonuses and incentives. Funding for O&M in the Administration's FY2002 request grew dramatically - from $108 billion in FY2001 to $126 billion, a 16% increase of almost $18 billion. This increase pushed O&M's share of the DOD budget to 38%. The chief areas that grew in the amended request included Defense Health with an additional $3.7 billion. The amended budget included an additional $3.7 billion for Defense Health, $2.6 billion for expanded benefits for dependents of active-duty personnel, and $2 billion for optempo-related activities and depot maintenance. The increase in funding for Defense Health was for expanded health care coverage for military retirees over 65 and higher costs for dependents. The additional funding for optempo-related activities did not necessarily mean a higher pace of training but rather more funding for spare parts, depot repair, and improving firing ranges. The FY2002 budget included additional funding for depot maintenance, base support, and other areas within Operations and Maintenance (O&M) to address concerns about readiness. Procurement funding for new weapon systems was slightly lower than the previous year, and RDT&E funding was $6.4 billion. The FY2002 budget included a $6.4 billion increase in R&D funding, with $3 billion allocated for missile defense and over $1 billion for transformational programs like unmanned systems. Funding for basic research was set at $8.8 billion. Military construction and family housing programs saw 11% and 14% increases respectively, justified as part of a long-term initiative to improve defense infrastructure. The Administration proposed an \"Efficient Facilities Initiative\" including base closures in FY2003 and sharing land and facilities on military bases. Congress approved base closures and expanded the pilot program at Brooks Air Force Base. Key issues in the FY2002 defense budget debate included funding for combating terrorism. During the defense budget debate, key issues included the appropriateness of the requested $343.5 billion, funding for ballistic missile defense, procurement levels, defense health costs, operation and maintenance funding, and other important issues like military compensation and Navy training alternatives on Vieques. The defense budget increase in FY2002 was seen as a down payment to address funding shortfalls for day-to-day requirements. Critics argued it was insufficient, with military services listing $32 billion in \"unfunded\" requirements. Supporters called for higher funding to address long-term funding gaps for weapon systems modernization. Members of defense committees debated these issues. Members of defense committees expressed dissatisfaction with proposed procurement levels in the amended request, citing concerns about funding for education, Medicare, and other domestic programs. Critics argued that the Administration's tax cut limited room for defense increases, sparking the perennial \"guns versus butter\" debate. However, these concerns were temporarily overshadowed by the terrorist attacks. During the congressional session following the terrorist attacks, attention shifted to the Administration's proposals for allocating the $40 billion emergency supplemental fund. Congress was less concerned about reconciling defense spending increases with other demands, but future concerns about deficits and reliance on the social security surplus could resurface. The Congressional Budget Resolution approved in May established \"reserve funds\" for defense and other high-priority areas, with constraints to prevent tapping into the Medicare HI Fund surplus. The Congressional Budget Resolution established reserve funds for defense and other priorities, with limits on tapping into the Medicare HI Fund surplus. The defense reserve fund in the Senate had no specified funding limits, allowing the Budget Committee Chairman to adjust allocations. Congress set aside guidelines during debate on the DOD appropriations bill due to lack of point of order raised, showing strong support for increased defense spending. Support for higher defense spending was high due to the September 11th attacks, overcoming concerns about protecting Social Security and Medicare surpluses. The debate over deploying defenses against long-range ballistic missiles has been ongoing for nearly 20 years, with the Bush Administration indicating a shift towards a mix of offensive capabilities and missile defenses. The Clinton Administration previously focused on land-based interceptor missiles and radars for missile defense. The Bush Administration proposed developing and deploying a system of land- and sea-based interceptors, along with space-based sensors, for missile defense. The FY2002 budget included a significant 60% increase in missile defense funding, with no major changes in priorities for terminal, midcourse, and boost-phase defenses. The Bush Administration proposed a missile defense program with land- and sea-based interceptors and space-based sensors. The FY2002 budget included a 60% increase in funding for missile defense. Congressional debate focused on foreign policy implications, cost, design, and blurring of missile threat distinctions. The Bush Administration proposed a missile defense program with increased funding for missile defense in FY2002. A successful test in July 2001 led to calls for accelerating the program, while critics raised concerns about the test's realism. Funding for missile defense increased from $5.1 billion in FY2001 to $8.3 billion in FY2002 to deploy missile defenses quickly. President Bush announced the U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty to pursue missile defense system development. The Bush Administration proposed increased funding for missile defense in FY2002, leading to the U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty to pursue missile defense system development. The withdrawal was partly prompted by plans to construct a missile defense test site in Alaska and pressure to eliminate a \"relic of the Cold War.\" The program included R&D on systems to intercept missiles at each stage of flight. The Bush Administration proposed increased funding for missile defense in FY2002, leading to the U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty to pursue missile defense system development. Secretary of Rumsfeld's plan to deploy a rudimentary missile defense system quickly has raised concerns about its impact on arms control and defense resources. The new approach blurs the distinction between strategic and tactical threats, causing unease among many in Congress. Cost estimates for the new missile defense plan have not been developed, leading to questions about funding availability amidst budget constraints. The conference version of the authorization bill, S. 1438, provided $1.3 billion in funding for RDT&E for BMD programs or activities to combat terrorism. Senator Levin agreed to remove controversial sections that would have reduced BMD funding by $1.3 billion and required congressional approval of activities violating the ABM Treaty. The President threatened to veto the defense authorization bill if those provisions were included. The authorizers transferred three terminal defense programs - PAC-3, MEADs, and Navy Area Defense - to BMDO due to concerns about funding. Congress approved $7.7 billion in their conference report, cutting over $500 million from the President's request. Cuts included $289 million for Navy Area Defense and $120 million for Sea-based Midcourse/Navy Theater Wide. Congressional action resulted in a $135 million cut in funding for the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Low program due to a 2-year delay. Despite the reduction, priorities of the Administration were preserved, and a substantial increase requested by the Administration was approved. The Department of Defense amended budget for Fiscal Year 2002 includes funding for RDT&E, procurement, and military construction. The procurement budget in the amended FY2002 budget was $61.6 billion, $0.5 billion below last year's level. The new Administration decided to delay major changes in funding for new weapon systems pending completion of its national defense review. Funding was emphasized for systems that will continue to be necessary even with significant shifts in defense strategy. The Administration's procurement request included only modest changes in current plans, leading to concerns among some defense supporters in Congress about limited funding for weapons modernization. There is a consensus among Members of the defense committees that an increase in the procurement budget is needed in the near term. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld acknowledged the current budget's inadequacy. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld acknowledged the current budget's inadequacy in addressing the replacement issue. Decisions on this matter are pending the completion of the Quadrennial Defense Review and National Defense Review. Changes in strategy and military goals may require a different mix of forces, leading to potential contentious decisions in the FY2003 budget. Congressional authorizers added $500 million to the President's request, making changes to selected programs like UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. The Defense Health Program saw a substantial increase in the new budget to provide additional benefits for military retirees, a 15% increase in drug costs, and a 12% increase in managed care contracts for military personnel's dependents. This increase aimed to eliminate past underfunding issues. The FY2001 Defense Authorization act provided new benefits for Medicare-eligible military retirees, known as \"TRICARE for Life.\" The Defense Department will cover the full cost for current beneficiaries in FY2002 and established a trust fund for future costs. Future costs will be considered mandatory spending outside of the defense budget in later years, with uncertainty about the estimated size of those costs. The Defense Department faces uncertainty regarding the future costs of providing retirement benefits for Medicare-eligible military retirees. If costs exceed the budgeted $3.9 billion, it could lead to additional pressure on DOD's resources. Historically, DOD has struggled to accurately project its required expenditures for healthcare, often requiring reprogramming of funds or supplemental appropriations. The Defense Department is considering transferring defense health costs to the mandatory side of the federal budget to ease financial pressure. The lack of copayments in DOD's health care system contributes to rising costs, as traditional cost-containment measures are not in place. Congressional committees have supported the Administration's request for funding. The appropriating committees endorsed the Administration's request and added $235 million for research into breast and prostate cancer. The amended FY2002 defense budget included an increase of $17.7 billion in spending on operation and maintenance, with a focus on military readiness. Additional funding was allocated for flying hours, steaming hours, and training. Depot maintenance was also increased to ensure weapon systems are available for training. However, a significant portion of the budget increase was allocated to objectives not directly related to military readiness, including $6.3 billion for the Defense Health Program. The O&M budget saw a major increase for upgrading facilities on military installations, justified as a readiness-related expense to improve morale. Congress cut O&M funding by $3 billion, citing potential savings from management reforms and pricing adjustments. The authorizers implemented management reform initiatives and pricing adjustments to save costs, including cuts to administrative areas like headquarters. The Administration disagreed with the quick savings target set by Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, leading to potential funding cuts in readiness-related accounts. Additionally, funding for the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer fund was reduced by $650 million due to poor oversight of spending. Military Recruiting, Retention, and Compensation were also addressed. The Bush Administration focused on increasing pay and benefits for military personnel to address recruiting and retention issues. President Bush initially proposed a 4.6% pay raise, which was later increased to 5% by Congress. Additional targeted raises were approved for specific skills and grades. Despite proposals for higher raises, Congress upheld the 5% raise and rejected repealing a statute related to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. In response to recruiting and retention issues, Congress refused to repeal a statute requiring offset of VA disability compensation with DOD retired pay. They also approved increased GI Bill benefits and limited transferability to dependents. Reasons for military personnel shortages included competition from the economy, rising living standards, increased operations away from home, decreased interest in military service among young people. Recruiting and retention issues in the military are influenced by various factors such as competition from the economy, rising living standards, decreased interest in military service among young people, and the availability of federal educational assistance. The ongoing war against terrorism since September 11, 2001 may impact military personnel issues, with potential effects on recruiting and retention. Military successes, national support, and compensation increases could aid in recruitment, but the need to replace reservists and the possibility of combat could pose challenges. In the short term, war-related personnel deployments and military administrative action, known as \"stop-loss,\" aim to prevent skilled personnel from leaving active duty. Congressional action endorsed the Administration's proposal to expand compensation increases for military personnel, including a 5% to 10% basic pay raise effective January 1, 2002. Increasing housing cost reimbursements, officer accession bonuses, age limit for ROTC scholarship recipients, re-enlistment bonuses, transfer of GI Bill benefits, and other incentives were proposed to enhance military personnel retention and recruitment efforts. The FY2002 defense authorization act did not repeal the prohibition against 'concurrent receipt' of benefits for military retirees receiving VA disability compensation. DOD argues that military retirement and VA disability payments serve different groups. Current law allows disabled veterans to choose the larger payment between military retirement and VA disability, ensuring fairness. The FY2002 defense authorization act did not repeal the prohibition against 'concurrent receipt' of benefits for military retirees receiving VA disability compensation. The Senate and House differed in their approach to funding the program, with the Senate proposing an amendment for concurrent receipt to be considered an entitlement program, triggering additional mandatory spending, while the House required offsetting budget proposals for the change in law. Congress guaranteed that concurrent receipt would not take place unless the Administration reversed its opposition. Additionally, there were debates on social issues such as revisiting policies on basic training for males and females and assigning only males to duty on submarines. The House rejected an amendment allowing DOD facilities overseas to perform privately-funded abortions for military personnel and their dependents. The Administration's FY2002 budget does not reflect decisions on major weapons programs, leaving unresolved key budget issues. The curr_chunk discusses the need for funding for weapons procurement and the debate surrounding the Air Force's transformation approach, focusing on long-range precision strike and stealth technology. Key points include the ability of air forces to operate independently and the balance between shorter-range and longer-range combat aircraft in light of various threats. The central issue for policymakers is whether DOD can afford to pursue three theater-range combat aircraft modernization programs simultaneously - the Air Force F-22, the Navy F/A-18E/F, and the multi-service Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). Some argue that there is too much emphasis on short-range combat aircraft like the JSF, while others recommend proceeding with the JSF and other planned theater aircraft. The administration's request for JSF funds was matched by authorization and appropriation conferees, keeping the R&D program on track. Concerns were expressed about industrial base issues. Both conference committees also matched F-22 funding requests and removed the cost cap on F-22 Engineering Manufacturing development. The Administration proposed reducing the number of B-1s in service and consolidating operations, which would have eliminated the B-1 mission of the National Guard. The Administration's proposal to consolidate basing of B-1s was overturned by legislators in states where B-1 operations would have been reduced. Both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees expressed concern and restored funds to the Air National Guard for B-1 capabilities. Additionally, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) are considered cost-effective for missions too dangerous for manned aircraft. The high altitude, long endurance Global Hawk surveillance UAV and UCAVs may replace combat aircraft. The capabilities of these unmanned systems are still unclear, but many predict an acceleration of UAV programs due to successful performance in Afghanistan. Air Force study found a shortfall in long-range airlift fleet's ability to meet military strategy, with ongoing operations in Afghanistan raising concerns. Resolving the shortfall may involve procurement of additional C-17s, refurbishing C-5s, or increased use of commercial variants. The Air Force is considering options to address a shortfall in its long-range airlift fleet, including procurement of additional C-17s, refurbishing C-5s, and exploring increased use of commercial variants. Congressional committees have endorsed the Administration's request for 15 additional C-17 aircraft and authorized the Secretary of the Air Force to enter into a multi-year contract. There is also controversy surrounding the authority given to lease commercial Boeing 767 aircraft to replace aging KC-135 tanker aircraft. The V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft program has faced controversy due to crashes and falsified maintenance records. Critics suggest cancelling or reducing the program. In December 2001, Undersecretary of Defense Aldridge approved the resumption of V-22 testing while expressing concerns about the program. Congressional action reflected concerns about the program's technical maturity, resulting in cuts to aircraft procurement requests and funding. Naval transformation plans focus on network-centric warfare. The Navy is implementing network-centric warfare using computers, data links, and networking software to integrate personnel, ships, aircraft, and installations. Congressional committees are closely monitoring programs like Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) and Navy-Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI). Some interest has been shown in the \"Streetfighter\" concept for smaller ships. Congressional action allows the Navy to proceed with the NMCI program. The conference report on the defense authorization bill allows the Navy to continue with the NMCI project after meeting testing requirements. Congress requires a report on NMCI testing scope and status, and the GAO to study its impact on naval shipyards. Concerns were raised about delays in program implementation and lack of data on NMCI performance. The 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review maintained the Navy's size at about 310 ships, including aircraft carriers and submarines. The report highlighted the need for potential restructuring and reorganization of the Armed Forces as DOD's transformation progresses. Analysts have debated increasing the Navy's planned size to around 360 ships, including aircraft carriers, surface combatants, attack submarines, and amphibious ready groups. There are concerns about the pace of Navy operations and the necessity of maintaining forward deployments in certain regions, which could impact the planned size of the Navy. The Bush Administration and defense committees have expressed worries about the rate of Navy ship procurement. The rate of Navy ship procurement has been about 6 ships per year since the early 1990s, below the needed average of 9 ships per year to maintain a 310-ship fleet. A higher procurement rate of 10 to 12 ships per year may be necessary to catch up on deferred ship procurement. Some Members of defense oversight committees are exploring alternative financing methods for ship procurement. The Navy's ship procurement faces challenges such as cost overruns and schedule delays, with previous ships experiencing over $2.4 billion in overruns. In FY2002, $800 million was requested to cover these overruns, with Congress approving $725 million for prior year cost overruns. Additionally, alternative funding methods like incremental funding and advance appropriations are being considered. The Navy replaced the DD-21 destroyer program with the DD(X) Future Surface Combatant Program in 2001. Two industry teams competed for the DD(X) program, with a winning team to be selected in April 2002. This decision raised potential issues for Congress regarding the shipbuilding industrial base, acquisition strategy, and future Navy capabilities. The replacement also raised immediate concerns about the treatment of the $643 million FY2002 funding request for research. The Navy replaced the DD-21 program with the DD(X) Future Surface Combatant Program in 2001. Congress recommended a $50 million reduction in the $643 million funding request for the DD-21 program due to a delay in down-selecting a future destroyer design. The authorization conferees plan to review the Navy's decision to restructure the program. The authorization conferees reduced the DD-21/DD(X) research and development funding request by $125 million in the fiscal year 2003 budget. The Bush Administration requested funding to convert Trident ballistic missile submarines into cruise-missile submarines (SSGNs) and retire two other Trident SSBNs. Congressional supporters aimed to increase funding for a 4-boat SSGN conversion program, with authorization conferees increasing funding by $66 million. The authorization conferees increased funding by $66 million for a 4-boat conversion program, falling short of the Navy's desired $163 million increase. The appropriation conferees provided a $324 million increase, more than needed for a faster conversion of four boats. The Army is focusing on building a new \"Objective Force\" centered on a Future Combat System to be fully fielded by 2020, while also modernizing and recapitalizing its current mix of light and heavy forces. The Army is creating an \"Interim Force\" of 6 to 8 Interim Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) deployable in C130 aircraft to address the need for mobile and lethal forces in high-intensity conflicts. Congressional concerns include questioning the priority of transforming ground forces given the current military superiority and the need for balance with readiness and recapitalization. The Objective Force may rely more on sealift to reduce stress on airlift assets. Radical reorganization of units could create a more agile ground component for joint strike forces. Critics question the affordability of the transformation plan, suggesting it pays for three separate armies simultaneously. The Army argues that the force structure size remains constant, but additional funding is needed for R&D and procurement. Congress supported the Army's transformation efforts in FY2002. The Army's transformation efforts in FY2002 were supported by Congress, with full funding for key aviation components like the Comanche helicopter and the controversial 40-ton Crusader. Additionally, funding was allocated for the rebuilding and upgrading of M1 Abrams tanks and M2 Bradley fighting vehicles, including digitizing the battlefield for improved operations in computer nets. The Army's new Light Armored Vehicle III, a 20-ton wheeled platform, is a key improvement for equipping the new IBCTs. The Bush Administration requested $47.4 billion in research and development for the Department of Defense in FY2002, with a focus on missile defense. The proposed increase in DOD's research and development over the next 5 years was $20 billion, with $8.8 billion allocated for science and technology, slightly below the previous year's funding. The Bush Administration requested $47.4 billion for research and development for the Department of Defense in FY2002, with a focus on missile defense. Congress authorized $46.5 billion for research and development, with just under $9.0 billion going toward science and technology. This included a proposal to reduce BMDO's funding by $1.3 billion to combat terrorism. The Congress appropriated $49.0 billion for RDT&E in FY2002, with $10 billion for S&T. $113 million was allocated for RDT&E in a Counter-terrorism Transfer Fund, supporting various research areas. The FY2002 RDT&E budget allocated funds to various military branches and agencies, including a $1.3 billion reduction in BMDO funding. The bill also included additional funds for Developmental and Operational Test and Evaluation, as well as rescissions and reductions in different accounts. The curr_chunk discusses various reductions and additions in funding for different programs, including the $1.3 billion reduction in BMDO funding and the $53 million reduction for the Arrow program. It also mentions additional RDT&E funding for the Counter-terrorism Transfer Fund and general reductions associated with management reform initiatives. The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, established in 1991, aims to help Russia and former Soviet republics secure or eliminate their nuclear weapons. The Bush Administration requested $403 million for the program, which was approved by both the defense authorization and appropriations acts. This includes funding for a chemical weapons destruction facility in Russia. The emergency supplemental appropriations bill transferred $30 million from existing CTR accounts to the State Department to fund programs reducing the threat of biological weapons proliferation from Russia. The authorization provided $776.9 million for DOE's defense nuclear non-proliferation programs, with increases recommended by a 2001 report as the \"greatest unmet national security need\" for the US. Funding was also increased for two DOE programs providing alternative solutions. The United States Congress increased funding for two DOE programs aimed at providing alternative employment for nuclear weapons scientists in the former Soviet Union, reflecting concerns about proliferation from Russia and terrorist use of WMD. The Chemical Weapons Destruction Program, mandated in 1985 to destroy obsolete U.S. chemical weapons stockpile, faces challenges such as escalating costs, public concerns about destruction methods, and meeting the 2007 deadline set by the Chemical Weapons Convention ratified by the U.S. in 1997. Facilities for incineration or neutralization are being constructed for this purpose. Chemical Weapons. Incineration or neutralization facilities are being constructed at each depot where the weapons are stored. Congress appropriated $1.1 billion for the Chemical Weapons Destruction program, the same level as the previous year. An important issue for Members in the 107th Congress was authorizing new rounds of military base closures, with reluctance due to past controversies. President Bill Clinton's 1995 intervention in closing McClellan Air Force Base raised concerns about economic and social dislocations in local communities. By FY2002, the Department of Defense had completed multiple rounds of base closures affecting 451 installations. In 2001, a proposal was submitted to Congress for another round of base closures in FY2003, along with an \"Efficient Facilities Initiative\" to share military bases' facilities and land. This proposal aimed to give the Secretary of Defense a more significant role in the closure process and allow base commanders to contract with public or private entities for military facilities and services. The House and Senate had differing views on a new round of base closures, with the Senate supporting it and the House opposing. A compromise was reached to authorize a new round in 2005, with added restrictions on Base Closure Commissioners to prevent additional bases from being recommended. The Department of Defense was also allowed to extend the pilot program for alternative uses of military bases with more restrictions. The Bush Administration aimed to improve efficiency through competitive sourcing, allowing private companies to compete with government organizations. The program, conducted under OMBCircular A-76 rules, is controversial due to questionable savings estimates and the impact of government job cuts. The FY2002 Department of Defense Appropriations Act prohibits certain DOD activities from being converted to contractor performance if they are performed by ten or more civilian DOD employees. The FY2002 Department of Defense Appropriations Act prohibits certain DOD activities from being converted to contractor performance if performed by ten or more civilian DOD employees. The DOD appropriation conferees reduced O&M funds by $25 million for shipbuilding industrial base consolidation. General Dynamics Corporation and Northrop Grumman Corporation made offers to buy Newport News Shipbuilding in 2001. The Department of Defense and the Department of Justice opposed General Dynamics' offer to buy Newport News Shipbuilding in 2001, citing concerns about reduced competition and innovation in naval shipbuilding. Northrop Grumman's offer was not opposed, and they completed the acquisition of NNS on November 30, 2001. The competing merger proposals raised questions for Congress regarding potential savings, impact on competition, employment levels, and political strength of the shipyards. The Bush Administration announced the end of military training operations at Vieques by May 2003, superseding a previous agreement. Congress approved $40 million in assistance funding for Vieques as part of legislation. The new Governor of Puerto Rico, Sila Maria Calderon, opposes military training operations on Vieques and works towards their immediate end. Congress cancels the January 2002 referendum requirement and authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to close the Vieques range if equivalent training facilities are available. The lands would be transferred to the Department of the Interior if the range is closed. Today, approximately $14.5 billion per year is spent on national security space activities, with concerns about management leading to the creation of a commission chaired by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Management changes were announced in May 2001 to implement recommendations, with potential impacts from other congressional commissions on the national security space program. The FY2002 budget cycle impacted the national security space program, focusing on space control, space-based weapons for missile defense, and a new early warning satellite system. Concerns were raised about the SBIRS programs' management and technological readiness. Congressional action included reports on implementing Space Commission recommendations, with $33 million approved in the FY2002 DOD authorization bill. Congress approved the full request of $33 million for space control in the final versions of the appropriations and authorization bills. For space-based weapons, the authorizers fully funded the $165 million requested for space-based laser (SBL) development and the $20 million requested for kinetic energy weapons, but the appropriators made cuts to both requests. SBIRS-High and SBIRS-Low funding was also affected, with changes in procurement and RDT&E funding. Most of the funding for the nation's intelligence effort is provided in national defense bills. The budget of the Central Intelligence Agency is overseen by intelligence committees and included in the defense budget to prevent public disclosure. Intelligence agencies within the Defense Department are overseen by armed services and defense committees as well as select intelligence committees. Budget allocations for specific intelligence programs are usually classified and discussed in separate annexes to committee reports. The Department of Defense uses the radiofrequency spectrum for its operations. The 1755-1850 MHz spectrum is currently used for satellite systems, precision guided munitions, and tactical communication systems. The wireless communications industry is interested in using this spectrum for a next generation wireless service known as \"3G\". The Department of Defense uses the 1755-1850 MHz spectrum for satellite systems, precision guided munitions, and tactical communication systems. The Clinton Administration directed agencies to identify suitable 3G spectrum for commercial services by July 2001. FCC Chairman recommended extending the deadline to consider other ways to make additional spectrum available for advanced wireless services, including relocating DOD to other frequency bands. The Department of Defense must be reimbursed for relocation costs and provided with comparable spectrum for the 1755-1850 MHz band. DOD argues that full migration to another frequency band could take years due to satellites in orbit. No comparable bandwidth has been proposed for DOD yet. The GAO report concluded that more analysis is needed before decisions are made about the 1755-1850 MHz band. Congressional action included a resolution on the congressional budget for FY2002, with no language about relocating DOD to another frequency. The Conference report passed both the House and Senate in May and July 2001, leading to the enactment of P.L. 107-20 and P.L. 107-38 for emergency supplemental appropriations and disaster assistance. P.L. 107-40, S.J.Res. 23 authorized the use of US armed forces against those responsible for recent attacks. H.J.Res. 79/P.L. 107-97 made continuing appropriations for FY2002. H.R. 2586 authorized appropriations for military activities of the Department of Defense for FY2002. S. 1438 and S. 1416 aimed to authorize appropriations for military activities for FY2002. S. 1416 authorized appropriations for military activities of the Department of Defense for FY2002. It was reported by the Senate Committee on Armed Services and passed by the Senate with amendments. The House substituted the text with H.R. 2586 and passed the bill. The conference agreement was reported and passed by both the House and Senate, and the President signed it into law as P.L. 107-107 on December 28, 2001. On December 28, 2001, H.R. 3338 was passed by the House and Senate, making appropriations for the Department of Defense for FY2002.
