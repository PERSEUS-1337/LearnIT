    "content": "This report analyzes two key amendments to the Anti-Terrorism Act: the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 and the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 2019. It focuses on the impact of this legislation on U.S. aid to Palestinians and the jurisdiction of federal courts over the Palestinian Authority and Palestine Liberation Organization for terrorism-related offenses. The ATA prohibits acts of international terrorism and allows Americans injured by such acts to sue for damages. Personal jurisdiction was not specified before the ATCA amendment. The Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) did not dictate personal jurisdiction before the passage of the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act (ATCA). The ATCA was passed after a federal lawsuit involving American families affected by attacks against Israeli targets during the second Palestinian intifada. The lawsuit resulted in a $655.5 million award, which was later dismissed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for lack of personal jurisdiction. Personal jurisdiction in U.S. courts requires \"minimum contacts\" with the forum. The Second Circuit ruled that the terrorist attacks were not sufficiently connected to the U.S. for personal jurisdiction. The ATCA amended the ATA, allowing jurisdiction if a defendant accepted U.S. foreign aid from specific accounts. The ATCA does not mention the PA/PLO specifically. The ATCA responded to a court ruling on personal jurisdiction by ending U.S. bilateral aid to Palestinians in January 2019. Congress passed PSJVTA in December 2019, changing the legal framework by removing provisions triggering consent to jurisdiction for terrorism-related offenses. PSJVTA replaces ATCA's provisions on triggering consent for personal jurisdiction with three new actions: making payments to terrorists or their families, maintaining PA/PLO offices in the US, and conducting activities on behalf of the PA or PLO in the US. This new law applies specifically to the PA and PLO, potentially facing opposition from Palestinians over ending payments for terrorism-related acts. The PSJVTA replaces ATCA's provisions on triggering consent for personal jurisdiction with new actions related to payments to terrorists or their families, PA/PLO offices in the US, and activities on behalf of the PA or PLO in the US. This could lead to the resumption of aid but still includes conditions likely to trigger PA/PLO consent to personal jurisdiction. The law also establishes a claims process for US nationals harmed by terrorist attacks attributed to the PA or PLO. The PSJVTA establishes a process for the Department of State to facilitate the resolution and settlement of covered claims, including pending and completed civil actions against the PA or PLO under the ATA. The Secretary of State has specific timeframes to begin meetings with claimants and negotiations with the PA and PLO. There is no provision to withdraw pending cases from court, and jurisdictional provisions applicable before PSJVTA continue to apply. President Trump expressed concerns about potential interference with his constitutional authority in a signing statement. The PSJVTA establishes a process for resolving claims against the PA or PLO under the ATA. President Trump expressed concerns about potential interference with his constitutional authority. The enactment of PSJVTA in December 2019 has policy and legal implications for U.S. aid and personal jurisdiction over Palestinian entities. The enactment of PSJVTA in December 2019 has policy and legal implications for U.S. aid to Palestinian entities. The Administration made reductions to aid for Palestinians in 2018, affecting economic projects and security forces. Discussions are ongoing on how to reverse some consequences of the Aid Termination Act. The Trump Administration reprogrammed FY2017 ESF aid from the West Bank and Gaza to other recipients in September 2018. Some aid projects continued in the region using prior-year funding but shut down in January 2019. Security assistance for the Palestinians mainly came from the INCLE account, supporting nonlethal train-and-equip programs for PA West Bank security forces. INCLE assistance, along with NADR assistance, ended in January 2019 due to ATCA. Total INCLE appropriations for the PASF from FY2008 to FY2019 amounted to $919.6 million. The U.S. Security Coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority continues its security cooperation mission without funding support, facilitating Israel-PA security coordination. The Administration is open to amending ATCA to allow certain types of aid to Palestinians, as Israeli officials strongly support U.S. security assistance for PA security improvement. Israeli officials have supported U.S. security assistance to improve PA security capabilities and encourage closer coordination with Israeli forces. Despite the halt in U.S. aid, the PA still has a strong interest in security cooperation with Israel, especially in countering Hamas in the West Bank. The halt in U.S. security aid to the PA may impact their capabilities and professionalism, leading to fewer incentives for security cooperation with Israel. PA President Mahmoud Abbas's spokesman expressed concerns about the negative impact and increased instability. The resumption of U.S. aid depends on political decisions and cooperation from the PA. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 provided earmarks for security assistance and humanitarian needs in the West Bank and Gaza for the PA. The aid provisions may depend on the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 being amended. The Trump Administration had linked the resumption of aid to PA/PLO diplomatic contacts, which may be unlikely in the current political climate. The Trump Administration's FY2021 budget request excludes bilateral assistance for the West Bank and Gaza, potentially conditioning aid on PA/PLO engagement with the U.S. peace plan. It remains uncertain if the PA would cooperate with U.S. aid efforts due to political tensions and amendments to the Anti-Terrorism Act. The PA's acceptance of aid may be influenced by concerns about national dignity and potential liability in U.S. courts. It is unclear how economic aid would address humanitarian needs in the West Bank and Gaza. USAID's Michael Harvey suggested prioritizing water and wastewater assistance if aid were to resume. If ESF assistance were to resume, water and wastewater projects could be key objectives. The amendments to ATA aim to enhance personal jurisdiction over defendants in terrorist attacks injuring U.S. nationals, requiring minimum contacts for jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has established criteria for foreign entities to challenge jurisdiction in lawsuits. General personal jurisdiction requires a defendant to have substantial operations in a state to be sued there. Specific jurisdiction is based on the relationship between the defendant, forum, and litigation subject. ATA lawsuits against foreign entities must meet these jurisdictional requirements. ATA lawsuits against the PA and PLO have failed for lack of specific personal jurisdiction, as plaintiffs could not prove criteria like acceptance of foreign aid or maintenance of facilities in the US. The constitutionality of ATCA was not addressed due to this failure. The new deemed consent provisions in PSJVTA may face legal challenges regarding their constitutionality. The PSJVTA provisions may face legal challenges for potentially being unconstitutional conditions on operating in the US. The concept of personal jurisdiction and deemed consent under ATA could have significant implications for US policy and law. The PA's cooperation with U.S. aid for West Bank and Gaza, effects of aid cutoff since January 2019, potential resumption of aid, PA/PLO payments to prisoners, constitutional challenges to PSJVTA provisions. The Trump Administration's compliance with PSJVTA requirements for the State Department to establish a process for resolving claims against the PA/PLO under ATA is questioned. The outcome and process of this compliance remain uncertain."
