    "content": "The Act titled \"Fulfilling the Potential of Women in Academic Science and Engineering Act of 2008\" is referred to as the short title. The Congress finds that women are underrepresented in engineering and physics despite making up a significant proportion of science and engineering majors at top institutions like MIT. Women only receive 20% of bachelor's degrees in engineering and physics. Women in science and engineering face challenges in reaching their full potential due to limited resources and biases in research funding and institutional structures. The Federal Government plays a significant role in research funding, but women are underrepresented in faculty positions and leadership roles in higher education. Efforts are needed to address unintentional biases and outdated systems hindering women's access and advancement in these fields. Our institutions of higher education and professional organizations cannot afford to underutilize human capital in science and engineering. The Act defines key terms such as \"Director,\" \"Federal science agency,\" and \"institution of higher education.\" Workshops to enhance gender equity in academic science and engineering are addressed in Section 4 of the Act. The Director will develop a uniform policy for Federal science agencies to conduct workshops on minimizing gender bias in research evaluation and academic recognition. Coordination and support for these workshops will be ensured across agencies. The program of workshops on minimizing gender bias in research evaluation and academic recognition is supported every 2 years among Federal science agencies. Workshops can be carried out by making grants to eligible organizations, including nonprofit scientific and professional societies, organizations advancing women in science, and engineering disciplines. The workshops must invite a diverse group of participants. The program of workshops on minimizing gender bias in research evaluation and academic recognition is supported every 2 years among Federal science agencies. Invitees to workshops shall include chairs from the top 50 institution of higher education departments in the relevant discipline, members of research grant review panels, and individuals from Department of Energy National Laboratories. Activities at the workshops include research presentations and discussions to raise awareness of gender bias in various aspects of academic recognition and provide strategies to address it. Research presentations and workshop programs should address the unique challenges faced by women from historically underrepresented groups, promote best practices for mentoring women in STEM education, and include outreach to girls. A report evaluating the program's impact on reducing gender bias is due within 5 years of the Act's enactment. The program aims to reduce gender bias towards women in research funded by the Federal Government. The Director will report on recommendations for improving the evaluation process, considering participation rates, survey results, policy changes, and departmental impact. The report will analyze trends in data for department chairs and Department of Energy National Laboratory employees who participated in workshops, focusing on gender representation, tenure-track positions, promotion outcomes, years in rank, time at institution, attrition rates, and overall gender diversity. The report will analyze trends in data for women in nontenure-track positions, faculty in endowed chairs, and faculty on promotion and tenure committees. Workshops will be held in conjunction with disciplinary meetings to minimize costs, and Federal science agencies are authorized to contribute funds to support the workshop and evaluation requirements. The report will analyze trends in data for women in nontenure-track positions, faculty in endowed chairs, and faculty on promotion and tenure committees. Federal science agencies are authorized to provide grants for organizing workshops and cover travel expenses for speakers and participants. SEC. 5 of the Act mandates the development of a uniform policy to extend grant support for researchers with caregiving responsibilities and provide funding for interim technical staff support. Once the policy is developed, it must be shared with relevant committees. Each Federal science agency must collect standardized annual information on demographics, field, award type, budget request, review score, and funding outcome for research grants to higher education institutions. The Director will establish a policy for uniform data collection, and agencies must submit this data to the National Science Foundation annually. The NSF will store and publish the grant data in conjunction with the biennial report on Science and Engineering Equality. The curr_chunk states that compliance with the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act is required. The Director will annually publish a list of higher education science and engineering departments attending gender equity workshops, based on data from Federal science agencies. Institutions on the list can publicize their recognition."
