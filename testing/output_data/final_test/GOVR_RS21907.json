    "content": "The Secretary of the Treasury has the authority to determine U.S. currency, including Federal Reserve notes issued by the 12 Federal Reserve Banks. Currency is produced by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, featuring portraits of deceased individuals and the inscription \"In God We Trust.\" Seven denominations are currently issued, with portraits of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Alexander Hamilton, Andrew Jackson, Ulysses Grant, and Benjamin Franklin on the bills. The Secretary of the Treasury has the authority to change the design of Federal Reserve notes, except for the dollar bill. Several currency design changes have been initiated since 1996 to deter counterfeiting, but the individuals chosen in the 1920s remain on the notes. The Coinage Act of 1792 established the United States Mint, adopted the dollar as the standard monetary unit, and authorized U.S. coins, with their design, composition, weight, and fineness determined by statute. The Secretary of the Treasury can only change the design of an existing coin after 25 years from its adoption. The Mint, under the Treasury Department, makes U.S. coins with six denominations currently minted. All coins feature \"In God We Trust\" and portraits of past U.S. Presidents, except for the dollar coin. Recent coinage design changes have occurred, with only the dollar coin having a change in the individual portrayed. The redesign of the dollar coin was authorized by law to revitalize it. The Susan B. Anthony dollar was replaced by the Sacagawea Golden Dollar in 2000, which had a distinctive edge and golden color. The Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005 aimed to promote public interest in dollar coins by featuring different images each year. The Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005 authorized the minting of four coins each year featuring the images of the nation's Presidents in the order they served. Three Presidents, Roosevelt, Eisenhower, and Kennedy, were honored shortly after their deaths by their images being placed on circulating U.S. coins. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the only President elected to four terms, had his image placed on the dime after his death in 1945. The Mercury dime was issued in 1916, meeting the 25-year requirement for a new design without legislation. It was chosen as a tribute to President Roosevelt, who had established the \"March of Dimes\" campaign to combat polio. The new dime was minted on January 30, 1946, President Roosevelt's birthday and the start of the 1946 March of Dimes campaign. President Kennedy was elected in 1960 and after his assassination in 1963, legislation was requested to mint 50-cent coins with his image. The Kennedy half dollar was authorized in 1963 to feature President Kennedy's image, replacing Benjamin Franklin's likeness on the coin. Legislation was quickly passed despite some debate in Congress. President Eisenhower, who served two terms and led the victorious forces in Europe during WWII, died in 1969. At the time of his death, there was no circulating dollar coin, with the previous one being the Peace dollar minted between 1921 and 1935. The Peace dollar, minted between 1921 and 1935, featured the Statue of Liberty's head. Legislation was introduced in 1969 to place President Eisenhower's likeness on a new dollar coin, which was passed in 1970. The new coin was to be completely silverless for circulation but could have silver-clad versions for collectors. The Ronald Reagan Legacy Project was formed years before his death to honor his legacy. The Ronald Reagan Legacy Project aims to honor President Reagan by naming landmarks after him in over 3,000 counties nationwide. Legislation introduced in the 111th Congress proposed redesigning the $50 note to feature Reagan's image instead of President Grant's. President Grant, a two-term Republican President elected in 1868, is best known for leading the North to victory in the American Civil War. The Secretary of the Treasury has the authority to change currency without legislation, but concerns have been raised about redesigning currency to feature President Reagan. Some view the legislation as premature and fear it could spark partisan conflict. There are also worries about confusion and counterfeiting, as U.S. currency portraits have been consistent since the 1920s. President Reagan's image will eventually appear on the dollar coin as part of a series."
