    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Compassionate Assistance for Rape Emergencies Act\". Congress finds that approximately 25,000 to 32,000 women become pregnant each year due to rape or incest, with 22,000 of these pregnancies preventable through timely access to emergency contraception. A study from 1996 revealed that 50% of pregnancies resulting from rape or incest ended in abortion. Many hospitals do not routinely offer emergency contraception to sexual assault survivors, increasing the risk of pregnancy to 4.7% in those not protected by contraception during the assault. Emergency contraception is safe and effective in preventing unintended pregnancy, with the FDA stating it can reduce the risk by up to 95% if taken within 24 hours of unprotected intercourse. Medical research shows that administering emergency contraception sooner increases the likelihood of preventing pregnancy. The American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists support wider availability of emergency contraceptive pills. Emergency contraception is recommended by medical associations for female patients after sexual assault. Around 30% of US women are unaware of its availability. Data shows that emergency contraception prevented 51,000 abortions in 2000 and accounted for 43% of the decrease in total abortions between 1994 and 2000. All hospitals providing emergency medical treatment should offer emergency contraception to sexually assaulted women. Emergency contraception is crucial for sexually assaulted women to prevent unintended pregnancies and reduce the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV and hepatitis B. HIV has caused over 520,000 deaths in the US, with an estimated 1,000,000 infected individuals. Hepatitis B infects around 80,000 people annually, leading to long-term health complications for some. An estimated 1,250,000 individuals in the United States are chronically infected with hepatitis B, with 1 in 5 infected individuals at risk of dying from liver failure. Prompt treatment can prevent some sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV and hepatitis B. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend immediate post-exposure treatment for victims of sexual assault to prevent life-threatening infections. All hospitals providing emergency medical treatment must assess and treat sexually transmitted infections to minimize harm to sexual assault victims, preventing life-threatening infections.
