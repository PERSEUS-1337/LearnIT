    "content": "The federal government has funded efforts to explore carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. Recent Congresses have supported policies for CCS research, development, and tax credits. The U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment highlights the importance of reducing emissions to mitigate the impacts of climate change. The report focuses on federal policy for underground carbon storage in CCS, achieved through geologic sequestration and enhanced oil recovery. Both methods involve injecting CO2 into deep subsurface formations, regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act to protect underground water sources. Impacts of these actions depend on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change. The U.S. government regulates underground carbon storage under the Safe Drinking Water Act to protect water sources. Congress supports carbon storage through legislation directing R&D activities and increasing tax credits. This report provides background on underground injection and geologic sequestration processes, analyzing the federal framework for regulating CO2 injection. The report discusses the federal framework for regulating land-based underground injection of CO2 for geologic sequestration and EOR. It does not cover CCS elements not related to underground injection or regulation of geologic sequestration on federal land and offshore. Underground injection has been used for decades for various fluids disposal. Injection wells are used for various purposes such as waste disposal, oil and gas recovery, solution mining, and CO2 geologic sequestration. There are over 734,000 permitted injection wells in the US, with approximately 750 billion gallons of oil field brine injected annually. CO2 injection wells reach deep into isolated rock formations for long-term containment of CO2 emissions underground. Carbon dioxide (CO2) geologic sequestration involves trapping or transforming CO2 from stationary anthropogenic sources underground to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The captured CO2 is compressed into a supercritical fluid before injection into deep geologic formations, such as saline reservoirs or depleted oil and gas reservoirs. Research also suggests CO2 could be sequestered in deep ocean waters or mineralized. The National Energy Technology Laboratory estimates that the United States has significant onshore storage capacity for CO2, ranging from 2.6 trillion to 22 trillion metric tons. This capacity could potentially store all CO2 emissions from large stationary sources for centuries, at the current emission rate. The United States has significant onshore storage capacity for CO2, ranging from 2.6 trillion to 22 trillion metric tons. This capacity could potentially store all CO2 emissions from large stationary sources for centuries. The use of wells to inject CO2 for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) is a well-established process in the oil and gas industry. CO2 is the most common injection agent used in EOR projects, sourced from natural or anthropogenic sources and transported to injection sites by pipelines. The CO2 is injected into depleted oil or gas reservoirs for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) using existing well infrastructure. It combines with residual oil in the formation, pumped to the surface, separated, recompressed, and reinjected. Around 30-40% of CO2 is stored in each cycle, with some stored indefinitely in the reservoir. Commercial CO2-EOR projects operate in 80 oil fields in the US, mainly in the Permian Basin. The federal tax credit for carbon storage and increased CO2 supply from carbon capture could lead to expansion in CO2 injection for EOR operations in western Texas. Federal carbon storage R&D efforts have shifted towards exploring the commercial viability of storing large volumes of captured CO2. The DOE leads underground carbon storage R&D, including research on wells, storage design, geologic settings, and monitoring of injected CO2 through the Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships program. The RCSP program in the United States supports R&D projects for carbon storage through partnerships with industries and research institutions. Congress has backed DOE's carbon storage work through appropriations and legislation, including a 10-year carbon capture R&D program. This program aims to develop technologies for coal combustion facilities and promote a robust carbon sequestration program. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded DOE's carbon sequestration R&D and demonstration efforts, including large-scale projects testing carbon sequestration systems in various formations. Additionally, DOE was directed to conduct a national assessment for onshore CO2 sequestration capacity. In the United States, nine DOE-supported projects have injected CO2 into underground formations for CCS or EOR purposes. The Petra Nova facility in Texas is the first coal-fired plant with a CCS system, injecting CO2 for EOR. ADM in Decatur, IL is injecting CO2 for geologic sequestration. The Air Products Carbon Capture Project is also active in Port. The Air Products Carbon Capture Project in Port Arthur, TX, and the Michigan Basin Project in Otsego County, MI, are injecting CO2 for EOR operations. These projects received funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The RCSP program supports projects that collaborate with DOE, industry, and local research institutions for large-scale CO2 sequestration and storage. The RCSP program is in the development phase, with projects completing injection and moving to post-injection monitoring. Projects are scheduled to end by July 2022, with additional projects being selected. Worldwide, public-private partnerships have implemented CO2 geologic sequestration projects, with active projects in Norway and Australia. Chevron's Gorgon Injection Project in Australia plans to sequester 100 million tons of CO2 starting in 2020. Other countries like Canada, Japan, and Algeria have also conducted CCS projects. The federal framework for regulating underground CO2 injection is outlined, including the roles of federal and state governments, UIC well classes, and transitioning from EOR to sequestration wells. The SDWA governs underground injection activities in the US. The EPA regulates underground injection activities in the United States, including geologic sequestration of CO2. SDWA Section 1421 mandates regulations for state UIC programs to protect underground sources of drinking water. Underground injection is defined as the subsurface emplacement of fluids by well injection. EPA issues regulations, guidance, and minimum requirements for state UIC programs and permitting for injection wells. This includes standards for well construction, operation, monitoring, reporting, site closure, financial responsibility, and post-injection site care. The EPA regulates underground injection activities in the United States, including geologic sequestration of CO2. States must follow permitting requirements and standards established by the UIC program authorities. EPA can delegate enforcement authority for UIC programs to individual states through primacy. States seeking primacy must adopt and implement UIC programs meeting federal requirements. EPA grants state primacy through a federal rulemaking process for different classes of wells. The EPA regulates underground injection activities in the United States, including geologic sequestration of CO2. States must follow permitting requirements and standards established by the UIC program authorities. EPA can delegate enforcement authority for UIC programs to individual states through primacy. States seeking primacy must adopt and implement UIC programs meeting federal requirements. EPA grants state primacy through a federal rulemaking process for different classes of wells, allowing states to administer their own UIC programs with specific permitting and performance standards. EPA issued the first federal rule specific to underground injection of CO2 in 2010. The EPA issued the first federal rule in 2010 for underground injection of CO2, establishing UIC Class VI for geologic sequestration. EPA has delegated primacy for UIC well classes to multiple states, with North Dakota having primacy for all six classes. The EPA has delegated primacy for various UIC well classes to multiple states, with North Dakota having primacy for all six classes. EPA has direct implementation authority for Class VI in 49 states and territories, while sharing UIC implementation responsibility with seven states and two Indian tribes. Additional states are pursuing Class VI primacy, with Wyoming and Louisiana in the application process. Underground injection for CO2 sequestration is subject to SDWA UIC regulations for Class VI wells. The EPA has delegated primacy for various UIC well classes to multiple states, with North Dakota having primacy for all six classes. EPA has direct implementation authority for Class VI in 49 states and territories, while sharing UIC implementation responsibility with seven states and two Indian tribes. Two Class VI wells, both in Illinois, are currently permitted in the United States for injecting CO2 into a saline aquifer. EPA requires that state primacy for Class VI wells would be implemented under SDWA Section 1422, building upon Class I hazardous waste requirements. EPA added new requirements to address the unique properties of CO2 and geologic sequestration in the Class VI rule. The EPA's Class VI rule establishes tailored requirements for managing CO2 injection for geologic sequestration due to unique risk factors. These factors include the large volumes of CO2 injected, its buoyancy in underground formations, mobility, corrosive properties, and potential impurities. Class VI requirements have a larger injection site \"area of review\" compared to other classes, encompassing the three-dimensional extent of the CO2 plume, elevated pressure areas, displaced fluids, and surface area. The EPA's Class VI rule establishes specific requirements for managing CO2 injection for geologic sequestration, including monitoring CO2 plume movement and site care for 30-60 years. Technical guidance documents are available to assist with the permitting process for Class VI wells. Class II wells are used for injecting fluids related to oil and gas production, with EOR wells being the most common type. As of 2018, there were around 178,000 permitted Class II wells, mainly in California, Texas, Kansas, Illinois, and Oklahoma. States can request primacy for Class II oil and gas injection operations under SDWA Section 1422 or Section 1425, with EPA regulations specifying requirements for siting, construction, operation, monitoring, and testing. Section 1421 outlines requirements for Class II wells, while Section 1425 allows states to administer their own programs. Twenty-four states and two tribes have primacy under Section 1425, with most EOR wells located in these states. Class II wells inject CO2 into oil or gas fields to enhance production, while Class VI wells sequester CO2 underground. Class VI wells have higher injection pressures and different properties compared to Class II wells. EPA directly implements the Class II program in states without primacy. EPA Class II regulations have less stringent requirements compared to Class VI regulations. Class II wells do not need to provide seismicity information, continuous monitoring of injection pressure and CO2 stream, monitoring of CO2 plume and pressure front, or groundwater quality monitoring. They also do not require post-injection site care or emergency and remedial response. Class II wells can be permitted by a primacy state or EPA. Class II EOR wells must transition to a Class VI permit under certain conditions if there is an increased risk to underground sources of drinking water (USDWs). Owners or operators injecting carbon dioxide for long-term storage into an oil or gas reservoir must obtain a Class VI permit. If no increased risk is determined, operations can continue under Class II requirements. The injection and storage of CO2 in underground wells under UIC Class II or Class VI permits are typically not subject to other federal environmental regulations. Compliance with these permits exempts the well owner from liability and reporting requirements of statutes like CERCLA and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. The EPA rule excludes CO2 from hazardous waste requirements when injected into UIC Class VI wells, allowing for compliance with UIC permits without separate RCRA regulations. Certain federal regulations may apply to CCS processes supporting CO2 injection and sequestration. The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) established by EPA requires certain sources of GHGs to report emissions data, including injection and geologic sequestration of CO2. Reporting requirements apply to both Class VI and Class II wells that inject CO2 for long-term sequestration. EPA collects this information to track CO2 emissions and quantify the amount being sequestered. Facilities holding a Class VI permit for geologic sequestration must develop a monitoring, reporting, and verification plan to track CO2 sequestration and surface emissions. Reporting requirements under Subpart RR include reporting CO2 mass received, injected, produced, and emitted. Class II wells for CO2 injection are subject to Subpart UU, which has different monitoring and reporting requirements and does not mandate a verification plan. Congress may need to address policy issues related to carbon storage through underground injection, including considerations of the current regulatory framework under the SDWA UIC provisions. The major purpose of the act is to prevent endangerment of public water supplies from injection activities. Stakeholder perspectives, federal support for CCS, project costs, and monitoring and reporting requirements are also important factors to consider. EPA has the authority to regulate CO2 injection for geologic sequestration under the SDWA. EPA acknowledges limitations in regulating geologic sequestration under the SDWA, including areas beyond its authority such as CO2 capture and transport, managing health and environmental risks, property rights, and liability transfer. The Class VI Rule aims to balance protecting underground sources of drinking water while providing regulatory certainty and promoting public participation in geologic sequestration efforts. Some stakeholders have expressed concerns about risks associated with CO2 injection and geologic sequestration. EPA and other agencies recognize potential risks to the environment and human health. EPA notes that CO2-EOR expansion could increase endangerment to underground sources of drinking water due to injection pressures and well leakage pathways. The EPA included monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements specific to CO2 injection in the Class VI rule to prevent endangerment of underground sources of drinking water. The construction and testing requirements for Class VI are more stringent than those for Class II for EOR. Other risks from poorly managed projects include impacts on air quality, human health, and ecosystems, which are not addressed by SDWA authorities. The Task Force's 2010 report highlighted the need for clarification to address ecological and non-drinking water human health impacts from injection activities. The Task Force highlighted risks to surface water, local ecology, and human health from CO2 injection. Concerns include earthquakes induced by injection, with regulations in place to prevent seismic activity. NETL and stakeholders offer perspectives on potential health and environmental risks, including CO2 leakage. NETL and stakeholders discuss potential health and environmental risks of CO2 leakage during underground carbon storage. Despite rare reported leakage events in CO2 EOR projects, concerns remain. Stakeholders believe benefits of CO2 sequestration in reducing GHG emissions outweigh risks. EPA acknowledges stakeholder interest in liability and long-term stewardship in the Class VI rule. The Task Force acknowledged stakeholder interest in liability and long-term stewardship but noted that the agency does not have the authority to determine property rights or transfer liability. They identified that the existing Federal framework does not allow for a release or transfer of liability from owner/operators to others, which some see as a barrier to future CCS projects. Policy questions include ownership of subsurface formations for CO2 sequestration, property transfer or aggregation, and regulation of reservoirs crossing state and tribal boundaries. State laws and contractual arrangements, similar to those for oil and gas, may address some issues. Analysts have raised questions about financial liability and long-term stewardship of injection sites and storage reservoirs for oil and gas development. Issues such as responsibility after the 50-year care period, government assistance in managing risks, and federal financial involvement in sequestration projects need clarity. Large-scale geologic sequestration projects would require unique liability and stewardship structures to address CO2 characteristics and the entire project life-cycle. EPA emphasizes the importance of a regulatory framework for carbon storage technology to support industry adoption. Despite completion of demonstration projects, uncertainties remain for widespread commercial CCS operation in the US, including injection amounts and CO2 sources. The issues hindering widespread commercial CCS operation in the US include uncertainties in operations, CO2 sources, infrastructure gaps, and regulatory frameworks. Congress has supported federal activities for CCS through various acts, directing DOE to conduct R&D activities for technical knowledge and deployment. Bills in the 116th Congress aim to continue or expand DOE's CCS programs, including carbon storage initiatives and research on geologic sequestration methods. The 116th Congress bills support federal activities for CCS, including geologic sequestration methods and storage siting. Provisions also address costs of constructing and operating CCS systems, regulatory requirements, and partnership programs for large-scale demonstration projects. Regulatory costs associated with geologic sequestration are also considered. The EPA aims to balance risk and practicability in the Class VI rule for geologic sequestration, with analysts estimating costs of CCS projects to be in the billions. Retrofitting coal-fired power plants with CCS technology could be costly. The cost of retrofitting a 500-megawatt coal-fired power plant with CCS technology is estimated to be between $5 billion and $6 billion. It may be more cost-effective to switch to renewable energy sources rather than continue using coal with CCS. Uncertainty exists regarding future investments in CCS due to limited examples of completed commercial-scale operations and associated costs. The potential costs of commercial-scale CCS are not fully understood, with capture technology being the largest cost component. Variations in storage formations can greatly impact costs. Predicting future geologic sequestration costs is challenging due to variations in storage formations. Projects involving CO2 injection for EOR have different cost implications compared to permanent sequestration. EOR operations benefit from existing infrastructure, resulting in lower costs compared to geologic sequestration projects. These cost factors may influence decisions on investing in EOR or permanent sequestration projects. The cost of CO2 injection and storage projects can be influenced by factors such as revenue from additional oil and gas production for EOR projects. The price of oil and availability of CO2 are key economic drivers for CO2 EOR. Federal tax credits for carbon storage since 2009 may impact project costs and investment decisions. EPA emphasizes the importance of public understanding of CO2 geologic sequestration technology for meaningful input. EPA expects higher public interest in GS projects than other injection activities. Class VI rule adopts UIC public participation requirements, including public notice, hearings, and stakeholder involvement. Two Class VI permit cases involved FutureGen and ADM's Illinois facility, focusing on safety and environmental concerns. The local landowners raised concerns about safety and environmental protection issues related to a facility, including air and groundwater quality, protection of endangered species, property rights, property value, and increased traffic. Congress recognized the connection between geologic sequestration of CO2 and fossil fuel use in the EPAct in 2005 and EISA in 2007. DOE's CCS research aims to benefit fossil fuel power generating facilities by enhancing understanding of CO2 storage in geologic reservoirs. The EPA proposed Class VI rule aims to enable the continued use of coal by reducing CO2 emissions through capture and storage. Stakeholders advocate for further research on CCS coupled with negative carbon technology for achieving negative emissions trajectories. CCS is seen as a transitional technology to reduce CO2 emissions while expanding renewable energy sources. Some stakeholders argue that CO2 sequestration for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) could hinder the shift to renewable energy sources and increase greenhouse gas emissions. Federal tax credits for carbon storage were established in 2008 to incentivize CO2 storage through EOR and geologic sequestration. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased tax credits for CO2 sequestration, removing caps on qualified CO2 amounts but requiring a 12-year credit claim period. Eligible facilities must operate or start construction before 2024. The U.S. Treasury is reviewing comments on implementing regulations for the tax credit provision. Oil and gas industry commenters have expressed concerns about the proposed regulations. The tax credit for CO2 sequestration, authorized in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, is causing concerns among some in the oil and gas industry. Treasury estimates a $2.3 billion reduction in federal income tax revenue over the FY2020-FY2029 budget window. Legislation in the 116th Congress aims to extend construction deadlines and revise requirements for secure geologic storage of carbon oxide. Legislation in the 116th Congress focuses on research and development of CCS, including carbon storage through EOR and geologic sequestration, and adjustments to the 45Q carbon storage tax credit. The legislation includes provisions related to the secure geologic storage of carbon oxide for EOR and sequestration."
