    "content": "In 2008 and 2009, the weak market for motor vehicles in the United States and other industrial countries led to a significant decline in production and sales. U.S. light vehicle production fell by over 34% in 2009, with General Motors Corporation and Chrysler LLC experiencing even larger drops. This downturn had serious implications for automakers and the entire industry supply chain. Old GM and Old Chrysler faced financial crisis due to frozen credit sources, leading to bankruptcy in 2009. They received federal assistance to restructure operations and become more competitive under oversight from the Obama Administration and bankruptcy court. New GM and New Chrysler restructured operations to be more competitive. New boards were appointed, with U.S. government and UAW holding ownership stakes. New GM improved in 2010, paying off federal loan and repurchasing stock from the government. Treasury holds over 900 million shares of common equity in New GM. The U.S. government sold its shares in New GM through an IPO in 2010, reducing ownership to 32%. Additional shares were sold in 2012 and 2013 below the government's average cost per share. This marked the end of federal assistance to GM, with some outstanding claims in Old GM's bankruptcy process. General Motors Corporation faced a capital crisis in 2008 and 2009 due to plummeting auto sales, limited success in selling assets, and frozen capital markets. Executives sought U.S. government bridge loans as the company's liquidity crisis worsened. General Motors Corporation faced a capital crisis in 2008 and 2009 due to plummeting auto sales and frozen capital markets. The company sought financial assistance from the federal government after being unable to achieve its objectives despite efforts to restructure and secure debt financing. Ford Motor Company had successfully borrowed $23.5 billion in 2007 for restructuring when private capital was still available. In 2008 and 2009, General Motors faced extreme financial stress due to a decline in the U.S. auto market, a steady loss of market share, and a high break-even point for car making. This was in contrast to Ford's successful borrowing of $23.5 billion in 2007 when private capital was still available. General Motors faced financial stress in 2008 and 2009 due to declining market share and high break-even point for car making. Sales needed to hit 11.5-12 million units to break even, but U.S. sales in 2009 were only 10.4 million. Labor and retiree health care costs were also a burden, with retiree benefits adding $1,500 to the cost of each U.S.-made vehicle. Old GM faced financial stress in 2008 and 2009 due to declining market share and high break-even point for car making. Sales needed to hit 11.5-12 million units to break even, but U.S. sales in 2009 were only 10.4 million. Labor and retiree health care costs were also a burden, with retiree benefits adding $1,500 to the cost of each U.S.-made vehicle. At the time of bankruptcy, Old GM had obligations of nearly $30 billion to fully fund retiree health care and pension funds. It was alleged that Old GM's corporate executives had been too bureaucratic and out of touch with U.S. car buyers' preferences. The Auto Task Force at the Treasury Department oversaw restructuring of Old GM and emphasized changing GM's senior executive corps and internal corporate culture as crucial steps in transforming the company. The Obama Administration's actions in 2009, including firing the chairman and CEO, appointing new board members, and emphasizing the need to change the business model, aimed to signal the importance of these changes. In 2008, gasoline prices rose to over $4 a gallon in the United States, affecting demand for large vehicles critical to Old GM's profitability. The U.S. government provided $24.8 billion in loans to motor vehicle industries through the Troubled Asset Relief Program authorized by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act in response to the financial crisis. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act aimed to restore liquidity and stability to the US financial system through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The Treasury's guiding principles for TARP included protecting taxpayer investments, promoting market stability, boosting confidence, and disposing of investments promptly. TARP's broad authorities allowed for funding to the auto industry when specific legislation was not passed by Congress. The Obama Administration continued the precedent set by the Bush Administration by providing TARP funding to the auto industry in 2009. Both Chrysler and GM received additional TARP loans, while GMAC/Ally Financial received capital infusions to survive the market downturn. Chrysler Financial repaid its TARP loan quickly. Controversy arose over the legal basis and execution of the assistance. Table 2 summarizes the TARP aid given to the U.S. motor vehicle industry. In December 2008, Old GM received $13.4 billion in TARP assistance from the U.S. Treasury, followed by additional loans of $2 billion in April and $4 billion in May 2009. These loans were crucial for Old GM's survival during a restructuring overseen by the Auto Task Force. President Obama rejected Old GM's Viability Plan in March 2009, prompting the company to devise a more comprehensive restructuring plan by June 1. Old GM was given two months to come up with a new restructuring plan to qualify for more government aid. Despite reaching agreements with most stakeholders, a group of creditors refused, leading to GM filing for bankruptcy on June 1, 2009. The government provided a $30 billion loan during the bankruptcy proceedings, with $16.4 billion remaining unused in an escrow account. During the GM bankruptcy process, $16.4 billion remained unused in an escrow account as of September 30, 2009. Congressional interest focused on the treatment of Delphi Corporation retirees, leading to hearings and proposed legislation. GM also benefited financially from IRS policy rulings. New GM was able to carry forward $45 billion in losses and other costs from Old GM during the bankruptcy process, allowing it to avoid paying taxes on future profits for up to 20 years. These tax savings were not considered part of TARP support and should have increased the value of shares held by the Treasury and other common shareholders. The new company was established in July 2009 after just 40 days in federal bankruptcy proceedings. GM emerged from federal bankruptcy proceedings in July 2009 with smaller U.S. operations but a significant presence overseas. The company operates as five divisions: GM North America, GM Europe, GM South America, GM Financial, and GM International Operations. In 2012, over 47% of GM's vehicle sales were outside North America and Europe, with a focus on developing countries in Asia. Sales in China alone accounted for approximately 32% of worldwide sales. GM's North American sales are more profitable due to higher profit margins on larger vehicles like cars, pickup trucks, and SUVs. In 2012, $7.0 billion of GM's $7.9 billion earnings were from North America. GM's earnings in 2012 totaled $7.9 billion, with $7.0 billion coming from North America. The GMIO division earned $2.2 billion. Since 2009, GM has invested $10.1 billion in U.S. facilities, creating over 26,500 jobs. The New GM of 2009 saw a reduction in employment and plant closures, shedding brands like Pontiac, Saturn, and Hummer. In 2011, GM's U.S. market share rose to 19.7% but dropped to 17.9% in 2012 and 2013. Saab was sold to a Dutch company, and GM's sales in China exceeded U.S. sales for the first time in 2010. Health care costs for retired U.S. union workers were transferred to the UAW through agreements with the Detroit 3 automakers. The UAW gained a significant ownership stake in GM through the restructuring agreement. The VEBA gained a significant ownership stake in GM due to financial constraints. Old GM retained costly liabilities, including environmental and tort claims. The U.S. government became the majority owner of the restructured company post-bankruptcy, with TARP loans converted into ownership stakes. Positive financial results post-bankruptcy allowed New GM to use cash from escrow accounts to repay TARP borrowings. New GM used cash from escrow account to pay off $6.7 billion in loans by April 2010. Government acquired ownership stakes in various companies through TARP funds during financial crisis. Goal was to compensate taxpayers without hindering company recovery. The Obama Administration outlined principles for managing government ownership stakes in companies acquired through TARP funds, emphasizing the desire to dispose of equity promptly while setting conditions to protect taxpayers and promote financial stability. The government will manage its ownership stake in a hands-off, commercial manner, focusing on core governance issues and major corporate events. Disposal of large ownership stakes can be done through various methods. The U.S. government disposed of its ownership stake in New GM through an initial public offering in December 2012, allowing shareholders to sell significant amounts of their GM stock. This method was chosen due to the company's size and the government's stake, making a negotiated private sale unlikely. The U.S. government sold its remaining shares in GM in stages, with the final sale on December 9, 2013. The government aided GM with $50.2 billion in loans in 2008-2009 and held assets in New GM after bankruptcy, recouping $29.3 billion from equity sales. The U.S. government recouped approximately $39.7 billion from GM assistance, including $29.3 billion from equity sales, $7.4 billion in loan repayments, and other sources. There is a $10.5 billion gap between the amount outlaid and recouped. Economists consider various factors to determine if the government gained or lost on the assistance. Economists analyze factors such as government borrowing costs, risk premiums, and management expenses when assessing the budgetary impact of GM assistance. The Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget consider these factors in their budget scores. TARP assistance is scored similarly to loans under the Federal Credit Reform Act, using risk-adjusted market interest rates. However, these estimates are only reported in aggregate. For example, in May 2013, CBO estimated the budgetary cost of TARP assistance. The budgetary cost of TARP assistance for the auto industry was estimated to be $17 billion by CBO in May 2013, with a lifetime cost of $14.7 billion as of September 30, 2013. However, individual gains or losses on Chrysler, GM, and GMAC/Ally Financial were not separately reported. No complete cost estimate has been done since the final sale of GM stock."
