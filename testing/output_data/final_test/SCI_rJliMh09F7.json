    "content": "The proposed method addresses the mode-collapse problem in cGAN by regularizing the generator to produce diverse outputs based on latent codes. This allows for a balance between visual quality and diversity in conditional generation tasks like image-to-image translation and video prediction. The proposed method introduces regularization to cGAN models for diverse output generation in conditional tasks like image-to-image translation and video prediction, outperforming previous approaches. Conditional GANs often suffer from mode collapse, where only small subsets of the output distribution are represented by the generator. This issue is more prevalent in high-dimensional tasks like image and video generation. Recent efforts have focused on learning multi-modal mapping in conditional generative models to address this problem. In this work, a simple method is introduced to regularize the generator in conditional GANs to address mode collapse. The method encourages the generator to produce different outputs based on the latent code, aiming for a one-to-one mapping instead of many-to-one. This approach is shown to be effective across various cGAN architectures and tasks, outperforming more complex methods for achieving multi-modal conditional generation. The proposed method introduces a simple regularization technique to address mode collapse in conditional GANs, promoting diversity in generator outputs for tasks like image-to-image translation, image inpainting, and video prediction. This method effectively induces stochasticity in generator outputs, overcoming the mode-collapse issue observed in standard GAN settings. Recent studies have shown that existing approaches to modeling unconditional data distribution have not fully resolved the mode-collapse problem in conditional generative tasks. Some new methods have been proposed to address this issue, such as a hybrid model of conditional GAN and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for multi-modal image-to-image translation tasks. This approach involves designing an invertible generator with an additional encoder network to predict the latent code from the generated image. Our method proposes a different objective function compared to existing approaches, aiming to maximize the norm of the generator gradient to address the mode-collapse problem in conditional GANs. This method has shown stability across various tasks with fewer hyper-parameters. Our method aims to address the mode-collapse problem in conditional GANs by maximizing the generator gradient norm, leading to stability across tasks with fewer hyper-parameters. To combat mode-collapse in conditional GANs, a simple regularization is introduced to penalize the generator's behavior. This regularization maximizes the generator gradient norm, ensuring stability across tasks with fewer hyper-parameters. The regularization introduced in conditional GANs penalizes the generator's behavior by maximizing the generator gradient norm, promoting stability with fewer hyper-parameters. This regularization enforces diversity in the generator's outputs based on the latent code, allowing explicit control over the degree of stochasticity. It can be easily integrated into existing conditional GAN objectives and applied to various models, network architectures, and tasks. The proposed regularization in conditional GANs allows explicit control over diversity via a hyper-parameter \u03bb. Different types of diversity emerge with different \u03bb values, and the regularization can be extended to incorporate different distance metrics for measuring sample diversity. Additionally, the regularization corresponds to a lower-bound of the averaged gradient norm of the generator, addressing the gradient vanishing issue in GANs. The proposed method addresses the mode-collapse problem by increasing the spread of G(x, z) over the output space to capture more meaningful gradients from D. This approach aims to avoid the vanishing gradient issue near true data points and provides a new perspective on optimizing G. The mode-collapse problem in generator output is addressed by shrinking the neighborhood size around latent codes to prevent multiple codes from being collapsed into the same mode M. This approach aims to optimize the generator by constraining the neighborhood size above a certain threshold. Our regularization method prevents the generator from placing a large probability mass around a mode M by constraining the display form above a threshold \u03c4. It is related to BicycleGAN's objective of encouraging invertibility by optimizing the generator gradient to prevent mode collapse. Our method, DSGAN, optimizes a generator gradient to control diversity with a hyper-parameter \u03bb. It is effective in tasks like image-to-image translation, image inpainting, and future frame prediction, addressing mode-collapse issues. DSGAN adds regularization to existing cGAN baselines, using the same networks and a regression loss to ensure similarity between predictions and ground-truth. In image-to-image translation tasks, the DSGAN method optimizes a generator gradient with a hyper-parameter \u03bb to control diversity. It adds regularization to cGAN baselines and uses regression loss for similarity between predictions and ground-truth. The baseline cGAN model employs architectures from BicycleGAN for fair comparison and is evaluated on three datasets for quality and diversity metrics. The study evaluates image generation using LPIPS and FID metrics to measure diversity and realism. Human evaluation via AMT is also conducted. Regularization impact on multi-modal mapping is analyzed through weight variations. In a study on multi-modal mapping, an ablation study was conducted by varying regularization weights (\u03bb). The experiment used a label\u2192image dataset and showed that adding regularization led to increased diversity in generator outputs. However, too high \u03bb values resulted in less realistic outputs. This highlights a trade-off between realism and diversity in image generation. The study on multi-modal mapping conducted an ablation study by varying regularization weights (\u03bb = 20), showing a trade-off between realism and diversity. Comparison with BicycleGAN (Zhu et al., 2017b) revealed that both methods effectively learn multi-modal output distributions, with the method generating more diverse outputs and distributions closer to actual ones. Human evaluation on perceptual realism showed no clear winning method. The study compared different methods for multi-modal mapping and found no clear winning method. The proposed regularization can be easily integrated into various network architectures without modifications. Generation results are illustrated in FIG1, with qualitative comparisons to BicycleGAN and cGAN in Appendix D.1.3. The regularization was also applied to pix2pixHD for high-resolution image synthesis. The study compared different methods for multi-modal mapping and found no clear winning method.

Generation results are illustrated in FIG1, with qualitative comparisons to BicycleGAN and cGAN in Appendix D.1.3. The regularization was also applied to pix2pixHD for high-resolution image synthesis. Wang et al. FORMULA0 incorporates a feature matching loss based on the discriminator as a reconstruction loss in Eq. (5). TAB4 shows the comparison results on Cityscape dataset. Our regularization is compatible with other choices of L rec. The experiment demonstrates increased output diversity with a slight degradation in quality compared to BicycleGAN. Our method demonstrates improved output diversity at the cost of slight quality degradation compared to BicycleGAN. It is applied to image inpainting tasks using generator and discriminator networks from Iizuka et al. FORMULA0. The task involves generating complete images from images with missing regions. Data for inpainting is created by removing center pixels from 256 \u00d7 256 images of faces from the celebA dataset. FID and LPIPS are used to measure generation performance. See Appendix D.2 for more details about the network. In this experiment, an extension of regularization using encoder features is tested for generation performance. The regularization involves computing sample distances using features from a discriminator. The methods are denoted as DSGAN RGB and DSGAN FM. Comparisons are made with a cGAN baseline and variants. Analysis on regularization is conducted quantitatively and qualitatively. Regularization methods are compared quantitatively and qualitatively in this study. The addition of regularization induces multi-modal outputs from the baseline cGAN. Sample variations in DSGAN RGB are observed to be in low-level features like global skin color, which may not be suitable for faces. Using a perceptual distance metric in regularization leads to more semantically meaningful variations such as expressions and identity. The qualitative impact of \u03bb is shown in FIG8. The regularization methods in this study induce multi-modal outputs from the baseline cGAN. Qualitative analysis on latent space using DSGAN FM shows that the method generates realistic and diverse outputs based on fixed latent codes z. The generator outputs exhibit similar attributes and context-specific characteristics, indicating meaningful latent factors in z. Multiple faces are generated from the same z, showing disentangled latent factors from input context. In this section, the method is applied to a conditional sequence generation task where T future frames are anticipated based on K previous frames. The results show that the method generates diverse futures compared to other methods, with comparisons made between cGAN, SAVP, and DSGAN. The method compares against SAVP for multi-modal video prediction, using a cGAN model with regularization. Experiments are conducted on two datasets to measure diversity and quality. The study evaluates a human actions dataset for video prediction, measuring diversity and quality through various metrics. Results show that the model can predict effectively compared to SAVP. Our method outperforms SAVP in predicting diverse and realistic futures with fewer parameters and simpler training procedures. It shows better generalization to various videos and resolves mode-collapse in conditional GAN by regularizing the generator. The proposed regularization is simple, general, and easily integrated into existing conditional GANs for different tasks. In this section, a regularization method is proposed to induce diversity in conditional generation tasks by balancing realism and diversity. The regularization term is derived from the true gradient norm of the generator, aiming to match the learned distribution with the actual data distribution. The text discusses defining modes as subsets of the image space and how a sample in latent space can be attracted to a mode by a gradient step. It also introduces a proposition stating that if a sample is attracted to a mode, then there exists a neighborhood where other samples are also attracted to the same mode. The text discusses the impact of a proposed regularization on unconditional GAN using synthetic datasets. It compares model performance with and without the regularization, generating samples and evaluating their quality based on proximity to modes. The text discusses the impact of a proposed regularization on unconditional GAN using synthetic datasets. It compares model performance with and without the regularization, generating samples and evaluating their quality based on proximity to modes. The results show that vanilla GAN experiences severe mode collapse, while the regularization helps the generator capture more modes effectively. The regularization proposed in the study helps the generator capture more modes effectively in comparison to vanilla GAN setting. It spreads out the generator landscape, increasing the chance to capture useful gradient signals around true data points and mitigating the vanishing gradient problem. The regularization was observed to significantly improve model performance by addressing mode collapse issues. The generator in the experiment faced a severe vanishing gradient issue initially but managed to converge to FID and LPIPS scores close to those achieved with a balanced discriminator. The regularization loss decreased rapidly in the early training stages, aiding the generator in exploring its output space efficiently. This, along with the reconstruction loss, helped the generator capture useful learning signals from the discriminator and learn realistic and diverse modes in the conditional distribution. Additional experiment details and results are provided in this section due to space constraints in the main paper. The paper will release code and datasets upon acceptance. Detailed descriptions for evaluation metrics include LPIPS and FID scores. LPIPS measures diversity using features from AlexNet, while FID computes scores on the validation dataset by comparing generated images. To evaluate the generated images, the FID score is computed between the generated dataset and training dataset. Images are resized to match sizes, and features from InceptionV3 are used for Fr\u00e9chet Distance calculation. Human evaluation via AMT compares perceptual quality among different methods through side-by-side comparisons with baseline cGAN and BicycleGAN. Turkers choose visually plausible sets matching input conditions in 100 examples with 5 unique turkers per question. The qualitative comparisons of various methods in the main paper show that BicycleGAN has low visual quality, while our method excels in generating fine details. Interpolation results in Cityscape dataset demonstrate a smooth latent space learned with our proposed regularization. The learned latent space in DSGAN on Cityscapes dataset shows smooth interpolation results, contrasting with BicycleGAN which lacks meaningful changes and exhibits sudden transitions. DSGAN excels in generating diverse and meaningful predictions, indicating a better understanding of the latent space compared to BicycleGAN. The network architecture for image inpainting experiment is based on the generator and discriminator networks from Iizuka et al. (2017). The generator in GAN takes a 256 \u00d7 256 image with a masked region as input and produces a prediction of the missing region. The predicted image is combined with the input using a binary mask, and the output is passed to a discriminator. Modifications include using a feature matching loss and a patchGAN-style discriminator for better image generation quality. The modifications made to the generator in GAN aim to improve image quality, not related to regularization. Qualitative analysis shows that increasing the regularization weight enhances diversity in generator outputs, with noticeable changes in facial features, age, and identity while maintaining visual quality. The regularization in the model helps improve diversity in generator outputs, as seen in image inpainting results with different weights for regularization. A qualitative analysis on the learned latent space shows smooth transitions between samples, indicating a continuous conditional distribution. In this section, details on network architecture, datasets, and evaluation metrics for the video prediction task are provided. The effectiveness of the method is measured on the BAIR action-free robot pushing dataset and the KTH human actions dataset. The model is trained to predict 10 future frames and tested to predict 28 frames using 64x64 frames for both datasets. Data pre-processing details are also described for the BAIR Action-Free dataset. The BAIR Action-Free dataset contains robot arms moving on a table with diverse objects, while the KTH dataset features people performing various activities in a static background. Pre-processed data was used for the experiments, and video frames were manipulated to add diversity. The method is compared against SAVP for stochastic video prediction. The baseline cGAN model for stochastic video prediction uses a hybrid model of conditional GAN and VAE to address mode-collapse issues. The generator is based on an encoder-decoder network with convolutional LSTM, taking a latent code per sequence to encode global dynamics. The discriminator evaluates the entire video using 3D convolution operations to determine real or fake predictions. In our experiment, we evaluate the performance of the cGAN model for stochastic video prediction using various metrics. These metrics include diversity, dist min, and sim max, which measure the diversity, quality, and similarity of the generated samples to the ground-truth videos. Our method, compared to SAVP, generates more diverse future predictions in video datasets like BAIR and KTH. The regularization in our model prevents mode-collapsing behavior, leading to a variety of outputs. Our model generates diverse and meaningful future predictions in video datasets like BAIR and KTH. It produces clear predictions on both foreground and background, capturing interactions between objects more precisely compared to SAVP."
