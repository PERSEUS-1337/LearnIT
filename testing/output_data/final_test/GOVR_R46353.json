    "content": "The global pandemic of COVID-19 is impacting communities worldwide and in the United States, with containment and mitigation efforts in place to prevent overwhelming the healthcare system. Federal response includes laws and funding to address the pandemic, with a focus on supplemental appropriations for programs traditionally funded by LHHS. The LHHS has received approximately $280 billion in supplemental discretionary appropriations from COVID-19 response measures, in addition to $195 billion in regular FY2020 LHHS discretionary appropriations. The COVID-19 supplemental funds, designated as an \"emergency requirement,\" increased FY2020 LHHS discretionary appropriations by approximately 143%. Secretary Alex Azar allocated $105 million from the Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund for COVID-19 response efforts. On February 24, 2020, the Trump Administration requested $1.25 billion in supplemental appropriations for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund at HHS, along with proposals to repurpose existing funds for COVID-19 response efforts. This raised concerns from House Appropriations Committee members about the adequacy of budgetary resources available to HHS at that time. The Trump Administration requested $1.25 billion in supplemental appropriations for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund at HHS, along with proposals to repurpose existing funds for COVID-19 response efforts. The Administration estimated needing to allocate approximately $2.5 billion towards COVID-19 response efforts. H.R. 6074 was introduced on March 4, 2020, passed by the House and Senate, and signed into law on March 6, providing a total of $7.8 billion in supplemental appropriations, with roughly $6.4 billion for LHHS accounts and activities. The House passed a COVID-19 response measure, H.R. 6201, with provisions for telehealth services. Further negotiations led to changes in the final legislative package, including a resolution directing amendments to the bill before finalization. The House-passed bill (engrossment) was sent to the Senate and passed without amendment by a vote of 90-8 on March 18. The President signed the bill into law (P.L. 116-127) the same day, providing $2.5 billion in supplemental appropriations, with $1.25 billion for LHHS accounts and activities. The Administration released a second request for FY2020 supplemental appropriations of $45.8 billion for COVID-19 response on March 17. The Senate passed a $45.8 billion supplemental appropriations bill for COVID-19 response, with $11.1 billion allocated for LHHS accounts. The bill, H.R. 748, was ultimately passed into law (P.L. 116-136) after negotiations between Congress and the Administration. The CARES Act, signed into law as P.L. 116-136 on March 27, provided $330 billion in supplemental appropriations, with $172.1 billion allocated for LHHS accounts. Three weeks later, additional funding was provided to HHS for the Provider Relief Fund and COVID-19 testing through H.R. 266. On April 21, 2020, H.R. 266, an appropriations bill, was passed by the Senate and signed into law as P.L. 116-139 the next day. The bill provided $162.1 billion in supplemental appropriations, with $100 billion allocated for LHHS. In total, LHHS received approximately $280 billion in supplemental discretionary appropriations from COVID-19 response measures. HHS received the majority of LHHS COVID-19 supplemental funds, totaling $248 billion, while ED received $31 billion. DOL and RA received minimal amounts. DOL allocated $345 million for dislocated worker assistance under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. The report includes detailed highlights for HHS, DOL, ED, and RA. The WIOA National Reserve provides NDWGs to assist with worker dislocation from natural disasters and mass layoffs, mainly addressing COVID-19 pandemic effects. HHS allocated 93% of funds to the PHSSEF for emergency and ongoing public health activities. CDC and ACF received 3% each of the supplemental appropriations for COVID-19 response measures. HHS allocated funds to various agencies for COVID-19 response measures, with the majority going to the PHSSEF. CDC and ACF also received portions of the supplemental appropriations. The first, third, and fourth COVID-19 supplemental appropriations acts authorized HHS to transfer funds among accounts to respond to the pandemic. The PHSSEF received $232 billion in funding across four measures, accounting for 83% of all LHHS funds provided. These funds support various activities such as health care surge capacity and the development of medical countermeasures, including vaccines. PHSSEF supplemental funding of approximately $30.4 billion has been allocated for medical countermeasures, surge capacity, and COVID-19 testing activities. Funds support the development and procurement of diagnostic tests, treatments, vaccines, and medical supplies, as well as healthcare workforce and surge capacity efforts. Some funds may be transferred to other federal agencies or reserved for specific purposes like deposits to the Strategic National Stockpile. Activities are carried out by various ASPR components, including BARDA for countermeasure development. The second supplemental measure allocated $1 billion for COVID-19 testing for uninsured individuals, with payments made through the National Disaster Medical System. The third and fourth measures provided funding for a Provider Relief Fund to assist healthcare providers affected by the pandemic. The fourth supplemental measure allocated $25 billion for COVID-19 testing, surveillance, and contact tracing to enhance national capacity for containment. The funds are reserved for specific purposes, including support for states, localities, tribes, and health service providers. The bill specified transferring funds to various agencies and accounts for specific activities, such as $600 million to the FDA for testing. PHSSEF appropriations in previous measures also allocated funds to agencies like HRSA, CDC, and NIH for health-related programs and COVID-19 response activities. Total funding directed to these agencies for preparedness and response measures amounts to billions of dollars. The CDC and NIH received a total of not less than $7.5 billion and $3.6 billion respectively for COVID-19 response activities. The CDC funding supports public health activities and global disease detection, while the NIH funding supports research on vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. Additionally, ACL received $1.2 billion for response measures. ACL received $1.2 billion in COVID-19 response measures, with $750 million for activities to provide meals to low-income seniors. SAMHSA received $425 million, including funds for Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics and suicide prevention programs. CMS received $200 million for infection control surveys, and ACF received $6.3 million. In the third COVID-19 response measure, ACF received $6.3 billion for various human services programs, including funding for Child Care and Development Block Grant, Community Services Block Grant, Head Start, and Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Additionally, $30.925 billion in supplemental ED appropriations went to the Education Stabilization Fund, which includes the Governor's Emergency Education Relief Fund. The third COVID-19 response measure included three emergency relief funds: Governor's Emergency Education Relief Fund, Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund, and Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, totaling $30.750 billion. The Governor's Emergency Education Relief Fund can provide grants to local educational agencies and institutions of higher education impacted by COVID-19. The Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSERF) provides support for emergency educational services to students for various purposes, including child care, social and emotional support, and protection of education-related jobs. Funds are awarded to states based on Title I-A grants, with at least 90% going to local educational agencies (LEAs) for activities like technology acquisition, mental health, and summer learning. States retain some funds for emergency needs. The HEER Fund distributes funds to IHEs for COVID-19 related needs, including transitioning courses to distance education and providing grant aid to students. The Social Security Administration received $300 million for administrative expenses and employee support during office closures. Funding was allocated to LHHS programs and activities across four COVID-19 supplemental appropriations acts.
