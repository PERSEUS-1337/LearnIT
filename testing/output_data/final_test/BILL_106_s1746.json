The Republic of Turkey has played a significant role in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East since its founding in 1923. The friendship between the United States and Turkey dates back to the late 18th century, with numerous treaties and agreements between the two countries. Turkey and the United States have a strong friendship, evidenced by agreements on various issues. Turkey is strategically located between Europe and Asia, bordering the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. The strategic partnership between Turkey and the United States dates back to World War II and was solidified by various agreements, including Turkey's membership in NATO in 1952. Turkey, a founding member of OECD and the UN, has liberalized its economy since the 1980s and advocates for open trade. Despite a strong friendship, US-Turkey trade remains small, with US exports reaching $3.5 billion in 1998. A free trade agreement between the United States and Turkey would greatly benefit both countries by expanding their commercial ties, as Turkey's imports from the US were only $3.5 billion in 1998. The United States aims to negotiate a Free Trade Agreement with Turkey to achieve more open, equitable, and reciprocal market access, as well as reduce barriers that hinder trade between the two countries. The President is authorized to enter into a trade agreement with Turkey, with tariff proclamation authority to modify duties as needed. The President can make tariff proclamations to adjust duties under a trade agreement with Turkey, with limitations on duty rate reductions and increases. The aggregate reduction in the rate of duty on any article under a trade agreement shall not exceed a specified limit based on the effective date of the first reduction proclaimed. The President may round an annual reduction to simplify computations under paragraph (3) if deemed necessary. No staging is required for rate reductions on articles not produced in the United States. The USITC will identify articles exempt from staging. The President may round an annual reduction by the lesser of the difference between the reduction without regard to this paragraph and the next lower whole number, or one-half of 1 percent ad valorem. A rate of duty reduction or increase that may not be proclaimed by reason of certain limitations can only take effect if authorized within an implementing bill enacted into law. An agreement described in this subsection refers to a bilateral agreement between the United States and Turkey for the reduction and elimination of tariffs and nontariff barriers to trade, leading to a free trade agreement. Before initiating a trade agreement, the President must consult with relevant congressional committees and advisers to ensure the agreement aligns with the purposes of the Act. SEC. 6. IMPLEMENTATION OF UNITED STATES-TURKEY FREE TRADE AGREEMENT. The agreement under section 4 will enter into force for the United States if the President notifies Congress 60 days before entering the agreement, submits required law changes within 60 days after entering, and provides a copy of the final legal text afterward. The President must submit the final legal text of the agreement along with a draft implementing bill, proposed administrative action, and supporting information. The supporting information includes an explanation of how the bill and action will impact existing law, a statement on the agreement's progress in achieving Act objectives, and the President's reasons for the agreement. The President must submit the final legal text of the agreement along with a draft implementing bill, proposed administrative action, and supporting information. This includes reasons for the agreement, how it achieves objectives, changes from previous agreements, impact on US commerce, and any proposed administrative action. The Trade Act of 1974 applies to implementing bills that only approve a trade agreement. Provisions approving a trade agreement must achieve negotiating objectives and comply with the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. These provisions are necessary for implementation, enforcement, and adjustment to the effects of the trade agreement. SEC. 7. CONSIDERATION OF IMPLEMENTING BILL.\n\nWhen the President submits a bill to implement the trade agreement described in section 6(c), it shall be introduced and considered according to section 151 of the Trade Act of 1974. Amendments to section 151 include references to the United States-Turkey Free Trade Agreement Act of 1999."
