The emerging fields of nanoscience and nanoengineering, known as nanotechnology, involve manipulating matter at the atomic level to create materials, machines, and devices with unique properties. This technology has the potential to revolutionize various sectors such as materials, electronics, medicine, energy, and national security, similar to the impact of microelectronics, biotechnology, and information technology in the 21st century. Advancements in nanotechnology, funded by the government, can lead to breakthrough technologies that benefit the Federal government and its mission agencies. Advancements in nanotechnology can contribute significantly to the government's mission agencies. The market for nanotechnology products in the US could exceed $1 trillion. Mastering nanotechnology requires a unique skill set combining chemistry, physics, materials science, and information science. Funding in these critical areas has been stagnant, leading to a decline in young people pursuing these fields in graduate schools. This trend must be reversed to develop the next generation of skilled workers needed for nanotechnology development. Research on nanotechnology creates capabilities to alter ourselves and our environment, leading to social, ethical, philosophical, and legal issues. Achieving international leadership in nanotechnology is crucial for national security, with implications beyond defense devices. The Executive Branch has previously established perspectives necessary for nanotechnology development. Authorizing legislation can establish new technology goals, improve agency coordination, ensure optimal returns on investments, and simplify processes for the Executive Branch and Congress. The Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Advisory Board (referred to as the Advisory Board) is established to provide advice on research investment policy, strategy, program goals, and management processes related to nanoscience and nanotechnology. The Advisory Board will operate in coordination with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. The President, with the Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, will establish procedures for selecting up to 20 qualified individuals from industry and academia to serve on the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Advisory Board. Members must have expertise in various fields related to nanotechnology and hold diverse views on societal, ethical, educational, legal, and workforce issues. Recommendations from Congress and industry leaders will be considered in the selection process. The President will appoint a Chairperson to serve a 3-year term for the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Advisory Board. Members will serve 1 to 3-year terms and may be reappointed. Vacancies will be filled in the same manner as the original appointment. Members will not receive pay but will be reimbursed for travel expenses. The Advisory Board must meet at least twice. The Advisory Board, chaired by the President, must meet at least twice a year in consultation with the National Nanotechnology Coordination Office. The President will establish a National Nanotechnology Coordination Office to support the Advisory Board and coordinate Federal nanotechnology activities. Staff appointments will follow civil service laws. The Advisory Board advises on the National Nanotechnology Program, including setting goals, emphasizing long-term outcomes, research needs, achieving objectives, and measuring performance. The Advisory Board advises on the National Nanotechnology Program, focusing on setting goals, research needs, and measuring performance. Approaches include increasing multi-agency investments, creating programs for new instrument development, stimulating industrial partnerships, and addressing workforce issues through training and development. The Advisory Board advises on the National Nanotechnology Program, focusing on setting goals, research needs, and measuring performance. They consult with various entities involved in nanotechnology research and development, ensuring the program considers societal implications. SEC. 7. REPORTS. The Advisory Board must submit an annual report to the President, agency heads, and congressional committees. The report should cover the program's technical success, management and coordination among agencies, and funding levels. The Advisory Board's annual report should include a review of funding levels, balance in the program's portfolio, participation by minority serving institutions, policy issues in nanotechnology, and recommendations for new program goals and challenges. The annual report by the Advisory Board should include recommendations for new program goals, research areas, partnerships, investments, and technology transition studies. The curr_chunk discusses successful technology transition in nanotechnology, best practices, barriers, and recommendations for government-sponsored activities. The Act is exempt from termination under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, and there are funds authorized for its implementation."
