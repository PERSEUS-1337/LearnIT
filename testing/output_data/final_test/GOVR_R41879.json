    "content": "South Korea is the seventh largest U.S. export partner, receiving nearly $39 billion in U.S. goods exports in 2010. The United States imported nearly $60 billion in goods and services from South Korea in the same year, resulting in a merchandise trade deficit of $10 billion. Despite being a significant trade partner, export opportunities for the United States are limited due to the size of the South Korean market. The South Korean market is significant for U.S. exports and imports. U.S. exports to South Korea are diverse, with the top five categories accounting for 50% of all exports. U.S. imports from South Korea are more concentrated, with nearly 70% in three sectors, such as electrical machinery. The South Korean market is significant for U.S. exports and imports, with U.S. exports to South Korea being diverse. The top five export categories account for 50% of all exports, while U.S. imports from South Korea are concentrated in three sectors: electrical machinery, non-electrical machinery, and motor vehicles. Studies suggest that U.S. exports to South Korea under the KORUS FTA could increase more than imports, slightly reducing the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea. The USITC study predicts that U.S. exports to South Korea would grow by 24% over a 10-year period, with merchandise imports increasing by 10%. Certain sectors like textiles, apparel, and motor vehicles could see higher imports due to the KORUS FTA. However, the study warns that without a full analysis of services trade and international investment patterns, the simulation results should not be seen as definitive changes in total imports and exports or the trade balance impact of the FTA. The USITC used the Global Trade Atlas Project (GTAP) to estimate changes in trade for various sectors under the KORUS FTA. Results show potential increases in U.S. exports to South Korea exceeding imports, sectors with no expected changes, and sectors with balanced trade flows. The USITC used the Global Trade Atlas Project (GTAP) to estimate changes in trade under the KORUS FTA. Results show potential increases in U.S. exports to South Korea exceeding imports, sectors with no expected changes, and sectors with balanced trade flows. Industries where U.S. imports from South Korea may surpass exports are also identified. Macroeconomic changes can impact trade more than changes in tariffs. State-level tables in Appendix A detail top state exports to South Korea and their share of total exports. The GTAP model is used to estimate trade changes under the KORUS FTA, showing potential increases in U.S. exports to South Korea. State-level export data is reported at the two-digit level, sourced from the Census Bureau's Origin of Movement Data Series compiled from exporters' Electronic Export Information. The Census Bureau's Origin of Movement Data Series has limitations, particularly when shipments involve consolidation of goods through warehouses. This can lead to the state with the warehouse being credited with exports instead of the true origin state. For example, agricultural products shipped down the Mississippi River for export from New Orleans would be credited to New Orleans as the origin state. Export data may also understate exports from the original production state and overstate exports from central offices or intermediaries. This tends to overestimate exports from port states like California. The Origin of Movement (OM) data tends to overestimate exports from port states like California and New York, while underestimating exports from interior states like Iowa, Missouri, and South Dakota. Appendix C provides more details. Table 5 shows state exports to South Korea based on OM data, including state shares of U.S. exports to South Korea and state exports to South Korea as a share of total state exports to the world. CRS did not rank states due to data limitations. State tables are listed alphabetically in Appendix A.

Trade models used in the analysis of the KORUS FTA provide insights into trade mechanisms for nearly 100 countries. Trade models used in analyzing trade agreements may lack precision when estimating the effects of bilateral agreements, especially at the state level where the impact is expected to be less significant. These models do not consider changes in exchange rates, which can be a limitation when assessing the effects of such agreements. Trade models used in analyzing trade agreements may lack precision when estimating the effects of bilateral agreements, especially at the state level where the impact is expected to be less significant. These models do not account for changes in exchange rates, which could have a significant impact on trade patterns involving countries in a bilateral trade agreement. The estimates derived from trade models are static and do not consider dynamic effects that may arise from trade agreements. The assumptions made in these estimates, such as constant economic factors and trade composition, may be unrealistic given the dynamic nature of economies like the United States and South Korea. The assumptions made in trade models analyzing trade agreements may be unrealistic, limiting the usefulness of the results. To address this, USITC industry analysts refined estimates to assess the potential impact of the agreement at the industry level. This qualitative assessment analyzes the immediate impact and phased elimination of tariffs on various industrial sectors. These estimates provide insights into the impact of the KORUS FTA on state-level economies. The report uses Census Bureau data on the origin of movement of commodities by state to estimate exports to South Korea under the KORUS FTA. The data tracks exports from the zip code where transportation begins to the foreign destination, with limitations noted by the Census Bureau. The data on the origin of movement of commodities by state has limitations, particularly in cases where shipments are consolidated through warehouses or exported by central offices. This can lead to miscounting of exports, with port states like California and New York being overestimated, and interior states like Iowa, Missouri, and South Dakota being underestimated. The origin of movement data by state has limitations, especially when products are consolidated or stored by central offices before entering official export channels. This can lead to miscounting of exports, with some states being overestimated (e.g. California, New York) and others being underestimated (e.g. Iowa, Missouri, South Dakota). Despite these challenges, state-level export data provide the best available indication of what is produced and exported from each state. The issue of underestimation or overestimation is more common with agricultural products than manufactured goods, as the origin of movement and production often coincide for manufactured products. The origin of movement data for state-level exports has limitations, with some states being overestimated and others underestimated due to consolidated shipments. Value-added considerations are not included in state-level export statistics for manufactured goods. Coastal states with large ports record higher exports, while inland states report lower exports. The OM data series only reports sales price and exporting state, leading to underestimation of value added in many states for complex manufactured goods. Agricultural exports are also complicated to account for, with discrepancies in data for farm states and states with major ports. See Table C-1 for states with overestimated or underestimated exports. Bulk agricultural commodities like grains and soybeans are sold in interior states to intermediaries before being shipped to major coastal ports for export. The OM data underestimates agricultural exports by 25% in 28 states and overestimates them in 12 states. Unprocessed agricultural products are often sent to other states for processing before being exported, leading to discrepancies in export data. Agricultural products from Midwestern states are consolidated in New Orleans after being shipped down the Mississippi River. The OM state export data system may credit exports from one state to another due to processing and shipping routes."
