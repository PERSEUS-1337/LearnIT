    "content": "The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) mandates voter registration requirements for federal elections, aiming to increase voter participation, protect electoral integrity, and ensure accurate voter registration records. NVRA, also known as the motor-voter bill, builds on previous federal legislation to create uniformity in state electoral processes and expand voter enfranchisement. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) requires states to offer various voter registration methods, including motor-voter registration at DMVs, mail-based registration, and in-person registration at designated sites. States must also follow procedural requirements for voter registration. The NVRA included procedural requirements for states to follow when performing voter registration list maintenance or modifying records for registered voters. The FEC was tasked with providing guidance to states for implementing NVRA and publishing a biennial election report assessing its impact. These responsibilities were later transferred to the EAC after the enactment of HAVA in 2002. NVRA, as amended by HAVA, forms the framework for federal voter registration policy. The report discusses the history of voter registration laws, focusing on the NVRA and its key components. It also covers the implementation of NVRA, modifications to its provisions, and ongoing federal considerations on voter registration. Various legislative proposals addressing voter registration are described, with a list of related bills from the 115th Congress provided in the Appendix. The federal government has increased involvement in election aspects since the 1960s, with laws like the VRA and NVRA aimed at boosting voter participation. The NVRA was enacted in 1993 as the first comprehensive federal policy addressing voter registration, following previous attempts in the 1980s and 1990s to create national standards. Various legislative proposals were considered in Congress during this time, with previous versions of the NVRA introduced in the 1980s and early 1990s before the final legislation was signed into law on May 20, 1993. The Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act of 1984 (VAEHA) and the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986 (UOCAVA) were legislative predecessors to the NVRA, focusing on voting access and voter registration. VAEHA required states to make polling places accessible for elderly and disabled individuals, provide absentee ballots without notarization, and offer voting aids. It also mandated states to establish accessible registration facilities and offer registration aids. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986 (UOCAVA) required states to provide accessible registration facilities and aids for elderly or handicapped individuals to vote in federal elections. UOCAVA allowed uniformed servicemembers, their spouses, overseas citizens, and dependents to vote absentee using a federal write-in absentee ballot or a state absentee ballot approved by the presidential designee at least 60 days before an election. States had to accept and process valid voter registration applications from military or overseas voters at least 30 days prior to an election, using an official postcard form containing both a voter registration and absentee ballot application. The motor-voter bill, known for requiring states to establish voter registration procedures at DMVs and other locations, also mandates criteria for voter registration forms and acceptance of a national mail-based registration form. States must meet procedural requirements for voter registration under NVRA. The EAC provides guidance to states for implementing NVRA and publishes biennial election reports assessing its impact. Section 5 of NVRA allows driver's license applications to serve as voter registration applications for federal elections. The NVRA allows driver's license applications to serve as voter registration applications for federal elections. Voter registration information collected by DMVs must be relayed to election officials within specific timelines. DMVs have become a popular source for voter registrations since the enactment of NVRA. DMVs are the most common source of voter registration applications under NVRA. Between 2014 and 2016, DMVs accounted for the highest proportion of voter registration applications. States must also offer in-person voter registration opportunities at various locations, known as \"voter registration agencies.\" States must designate voter registration agencies, including public assistance programs, U.S. armed services recruitment offices, public libraries, schools, government offices, and more. Colleges in exempt states must make an effort to distribute voter registration forms to students. Voter registration agencies must provide forms, assistance, and submit completed applications. States must designate voter registration agencies, including public assistance programs, U.S. armed services recruitment offices, public libraries, schools, government offices, and more. These agencies must provide forms, assistance, and submit completed applications to the appropriate state election official within specific timelines. Individuals assisting with registration cannot influence political preference, display party allegiance, or discourage registration. NVRA also requires states to offer mail-based voter registration applications for federal elections. States are required to offer mail-based voter registration applications for federal elections, allowing voters to update their address. The FEC initially developed the federal application, but this responsibility was transferred to the EAC in 2004. States can also create their own mail-based forms, as long as they meet NVRA criteria. Forms must be available for distribution by governmental and private entities, with a focus on organized voter registration programs. The National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) requires states to provide mail-based voter registration applications for federal elections, with a focus on organized voter registration programs. The act also outlines procedures for handling undeliverable notices regarding voter registration applications and sets requirements for the information collected on voter registration forms. States must adhere to these criteria when creating their own mail-based forms. The NVRA requires states to provide mail-based voter registration applications for federal elections, focusing on organized voter registration programs. The act minimizes the information needed on voter registration forms by utilizing personal information provided elsewhere. Voter registration forms at state DMVs must be integrated into driver's license applications without duplicating information. The forms should only request the minimum necessary information to prevent duplicate registrations and enable state election officials to determine eligibility. The NVRA requires voter registration forms to include federal voting eligibility requirements and a signature from the applicant. Notarization or proof of citizenship cannot be required. The forms also include penalties for false applications and ensure confidentiality of registration information. The NVRA mandates that agencies accepting voter registration forms must transmit them to state election officials promptly. State officials must notify applicants of their application status and ensure timely registration for federal elections if submitted within 30 days of the election deadline. The NVRA requires voter registration forms to be transmitted promptly to state election officials. Once registered, a voter's name can only be removed if requested, deceased, moved out of the jurisdiction, convicted of a disqualifying crime, or found mentally incapacitated. States can remove voters due to death or change of residence, if notified by the voter, or if the voter does not respond to a notice from the registrar. The NVRA allows for the removal of voter registration rolls if the registrant fails to respond to notices and does not vote in two consecutive general elections. States must maintain accurate voter registration lists in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, in compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The U.S. Postal Service's \"National Change of Address\" program can be used to help maintain voter registration rolls. Removal of ineligible voters must be done at least 90 days before any federal election. NVRA does not specify a particular process for removing individuals from voter lists. The NVRA includes \"fail-safe\" voting provisions for voters who have moved within the same election jurisdiction, allowing them to update their voting records and vote on Election Day. This ensures that once registered, a voter should remain on the list as long as they are eligible to vote in that jurisdiction. Section 12 of NVRA establishes criminal penalties for federal election fraud and voter intimidation, including fines and imprisonment for individuals who attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce anyone involved in the voting process. States are required to maintain voter registration records and make them publicly available under NVRA. The NVRA requires states to maintain and make voter registration records publicly available. The FEC/EAC produces biennial reports assessing the Act's impact on elections, including recommendations for improvements. These reports provide statistics on voter registration activities, including total registered voters, new registrants, and sources of registrations. The NVRA requires states to maintain voter registration records and provides information on total registered voters, new registrants, and sources of registrations. Issues with list maintenance and recommendations for improvements are discussed in NVRA reports. Six states were exempt from NVRA initially, while the other 44 states were required to implement it by January 1, 1995. The NVRA allowed for a later enactment date for states to comply with its requirements, with no federal funding provided. States could use reduced mailing rates for voter registration mailings. Each state had to designate a chief state election official to coordinate NVRA responsibilities. The FEC and DOJ had specific roles in enforcing NVRA provisions. The FEC provided information to states, developed a federal voter registration form, and produced biennial reports to Congress. The Office of Election Administration within the FEC handled NVRA responsibilities until the passage of HAVA. The Office of Election Administration (OEA) initially handled NVRA responsibilities until HAVA transferred them to the EAC in 2002. Concerns were raised about the costs NVRA could impose on states due to lack of funding. The FEC and DOJ had specific roles in enforcing NVRA provisions, with the FEC providing guidance to states but lacking legal authority for interpretation. States began implementing NVRA without significant cost impediments, with motor vehicle and mail registration provisions being the easiest to implement. Voter registration rates increased post-NVRA, but isolating NVRA's specific impact is challenging. The FEC noted in its 1993-1994 NVRA report that computerization of voter registration greatly facilitates NVRA implementation. States had varying degrees of computerized record systems, with some being incompatible. States were given flexibility to comply with other NVRA provisions, such as designating voter registration agencies and voter list maintenance procedures. The FEC's 1995-1996 report highlighted the varied approaches states took in designating voter registration agencies and maintaining voter lists under NVRA. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) of 2002 addressed election administration issues post-2000 presidential election, focusing on aspects affecting NVRA and federal voter registration. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) of 2002 focused on parts that affected NVRA and voter registration in federal elections, including computerization of state voter lists, changes to the federal mail-based voter registration form, and transferring the FEC's role to the Election Assistance Commission (EAC). HAVA incorporated recommendations from FEC's biennial NVRA reports, establishing requirements for states to use computerized statewide voter registration lists. HAVA required specific additions to the NVRA mail-based voter registration form, including questions about citizenship and age eligibility, as well as instructions for first-time registrants to submit documentation. The act also provided funding to help states modernize voting equipment and improve federal election administration. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) created the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to oversee federal election activities, including payment and grant programs, testing voting systems, studying election issues, and issuing guidelines. The EAC absorbed the responsibilities of the FEC's Office of Election Administration and has provided recommendations in biennial reports since 2002. Since the establishment of HAVA in 2002, the EAC reports have included recommendations on voter registration and election administration, focusing on modernizing data collection and sharing practices among states. These broad-based suggestions are directed towards states and Congress, as the EAC lacks the authority to enforce action. Data from NVRA reports show DMV offices as the most common source of voter registration applications nationwide. Nationwide, DMV offices are the primary source of voter registration applications under NVRA. Online voter registration has seen growth, accounting for 17.4% of new registrations in 2016. Congress regularly introduces bills related to voter registration, with 66 pieces of legislation in the 115th Congress. These bills aim to expand voter registration methods. Under NVRA, bills in Congress aim to expand voter registration methods, including online registration and registration opportunities at state and local government offices. The legislation seeks to update voter registration technologies and processes. Some propose changing voter registration to an \"opt-out\" system, automatically registering individuals when they apply for a driver's license or other eligible agency form. This is currently in place in 17 states and the District of Columbia. Supporters believe it could increase registered voters, especially among underrepresented groups, and reduce costs. Critics argue against mandatory registration by the government. Some bills in the 115th Congress proposed automatic voter registration, while others suggested grants for states to implement it. Nine bills aimed at same-day voter registration, allowing individuals to register and vote at the same time. Critics raise concerns about the government mandating registration. Some states have same-day voter registration to simplify the process and increase registration rates. However, preelection registration deadlines are still seen as necessary by some to allow officials to process applications. In places with same-day registration, voters may cast provisional ballots until their information is verified, potentially causing delays in election results. Some states have same-day voter registration to simplify the process and increase registration rates. Currently, 38 states and the District of Columbia allow for online voter registration. Seven bills in the 115th Congress proposed requiring nationwide availability of online voter registration for federal elections. Proponents believe online voter registration could increase registration rates, especially among younger voters, and serve as an extension of accessibility accommodations for individuals with disabilities. Online forms with required fields could reduce errors on voter registration applications, despite upfront costs. Some proposals related to voter registration aim to reach younger teenagers, typically 16 or 17 years old, through preregistration programs. Five bills in the 115th Congress suggested such programs, along with voter education initiatives for minors. Currently, states and the District of Columbia allow individuals under 18 to preregister to vote. Some states and the District of Columbia allow individuals under 18 to preregister to vote, aiming to improve turnout rates for younger voters. Concerns exist about the validity of preregistrations if individuals move before the first eligible election, potentially causing confusion or extra costs for election officials. Verification of voter registration data is a challenge for state election officials to prevent fraudulent voting. Some states require identification at the time of voter registration to verify identity. Legislation has been proposed to require photo identification at the time of registration to confirm identity. In the 115th Congress, proposed bills regarding voter identification laws were introduced. Some believe these laws may disenfranchise eligible voters. Changes to voter registration information can occur due to various reasons like name changes or address moves. Legislation aimed to add criteria to voter removal requirements under NVRA. In the 115th Congress, proposed bills aimed to add criteria to NVRA's voter removal requirements and address concerns about protecting voters' personal information in voter registration databases. Personally identifiable information like names, addresses, and birthdays is commonly stored in these databases, which are used by election officials to update voter registration records within the state. Interstate information sharing systems like ERIC and Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck are also utilized. Some states use systems like ERIC and Crosscheck to compare voter registration records for identifying ineligible or duplicate voters. Concerns arise over data security and accuracy of matches, as methodologies may lead to false identifications. These systems request additional data to improve accuracy in voter removal processes. The enactment of HAVA in 2002 led to election technology upgrades for states, but the EAC recommends further modernization of voter data collection and maintenance. States use electronic methods for voter registration, list maintenance, voting administration, and election result tracking, emphasizing cybersecurity. Considerations include protecting personal information, ensuring system reliability during high usage, and preventing misuse of voter data. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designated federal election infrastructure as critical in January 2017 due to cybersecurity concerns, including potential manipulation of election results. Assistance was provided to address security issues after cyberattacks on state and local election systems in 2016. In September 2017, DHS notified 21 states of election system hacking attempts before the 2016 election. Concerns exist about detecting successful hacks. Legislative proposals aim to protect election systems from hackers and foreign interference through technology upgrades for voter registration websites and databases. The decentralized nature of election administration and the variety of software and database systems in use may present challenges if uniform federal requirements are introduced. Twelve bills in the 115th Congress proposed improvements to technology systems for voter registration. Some proposals included grant programs to help offset costs for states. Voter registration has been a subject of interest to Congress, with many proposals introduced but federal policies have remained largely unchanged. The NVRA has remained largely unchanged, except for revisions made by HAVA in 2002. Many believe in widespread voter registration access to protect the right to vote. State election officials face challenges in maintaining accurate voter lists, with technological advancements aiding but also posing data security risks. Some question the need to expand federal voter registration requirements, weighing benefits against other considerations. When considering voter registration policy changes, challenges arise in imposing uniform regulations across states with their own election laws. Federal proposals often mirror state initiatives, offering lessons for broader implementation. Some proposals prioritize election integrity and other areas of administration beyond voter registration."
