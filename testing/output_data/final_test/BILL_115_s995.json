    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Spokane Tribe of Indians of the Spokane Reservation Equitable Compensation Act\". It includes findings related to the Spokane Tribe of Indians. Congress finds that the Corps of Engineers investigated the Columbia River for power production sites, licenses involving tribal land require a reasonable annual charge, the Columbia Basin Commission received a permit for water power development at Grand Coulee, and the Spokane Tribe would have benefited if the site had been developed by them or a private entity. In the mid-1930s, the Federal Government federalized the Grand Coulee Dam project and began construction. The project's development affected the interests of the Spokane Tribe and the Colville Reservation, leading to the recognition that both tribes should receive a share of revenue from the dam's power production. Congress granted the United States the right, title, and interest of the Spokane Tribe and Colville Tribes in tribal land for the construction of the Columbia Basin Project. In connection with the Columbia Basin Project, the Secretary compensated the Spokane Tribe $4,700 and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation $63,000. In 1994, Congress ratified the Colville Settlement Agreement following litigation under the Indian Claims Commission Act. This agreement required compensation for past land use by the Colville Tribes. The Colville Settlement Agreement required a payment of $53,000,000 for past land use and annual payments of $15,250,000 for continued land use, adjusted based on revenues from the Grand Coulee Dam project. The Spokane Tribe did not file a claim within the statute of limitations, and neither tribe filed claims for compensation before August 13, 1951. In 1976, the Colville Tribes successfully amended their 1951 land claims to include the Grand Coulee claim, while the Spokane Tribe settled their land claims with the United States in 1967. The Spokane Tribe suffered harm from the Grand Coulee Dam, with 39% of their tribal acreage taken for its construction. The payments and delegation made under this Act are considered fair compensation for the past and ongoing use of Spokane tribal land for hydropower production at Grand Coulee Dam, as resolved by the Spokane tribal membership. The Act aims to provide fair compensation to the Spokane Tribe for the use of their land for hydropower generation at the Grand Coulee Dam. The Act defines key terms such as \"Administrator,\" \"Colville Settlement Agreement,\" \"Colville Tribes,\" and \"Computed annual payment.\" The Act defines key terms such as \"Computed Annual Payment,\" \"Confederated Tribes Act,\" \"Secretary,\" \"Spokane Business Council,\" and \"Spokane Tribe.\" The Administrator will make payments to the Spokane Tribe, starting with 25% of the Computed Annual Payment for fiscal year 2019 on March 1, 2020. Subsequent payments of 25% or 32% will be made annually until 2030. Payments made to the Spokane Business Council or Spokane Tribe under section 5 can be used or invested in the same manner as other tribal governmental amounts. The Secretary and Administrator will not have any trust responsibility for the funds after they are paid. The payments and generated income will be treated similarly to the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan Distribution of Judgment Funds Act. After payments are made to the Spokane Business Council or Spokane Tribe under section 5, the amounts will become Spokane Tribe governmental funds and will be subject to an annual tribal government audit. SEC. 7. REPAYMENT CREDIT. The Administrator shall deduct $2,700,000 from interest payable to the Treasury in fiscal year 2030 and subsequent years. The deduction will be credited to interest payments on debt associated with the generation function. The Administrator will deduct $2,700,000 from interest payments to the Treasury in fiscal year 2030 and subsequent years. Any excess deduction will be allocated to other interest payments due during the fiscal year and applied as a credit against other payments to the Treasury. SEC. 8. EXTINGUISHMENT OF CLAIMS.\n\nUpon payment to the Spokane Tribe under section 5(a), all monetary claims against the United States for a fair share of hydropower revenues from Grand Coulee Dam will be extinguished.\n\nSEC. 9. ADMINISTRATION.\n\nThis Act does not set a precedent or bind the Southwestern Power Administration, Western Area Power Administration, or Southeastern Power Administration."
