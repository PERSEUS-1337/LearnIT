    "content": "A pension is a voluntary benefit offered by employers to assist employees in preparing for retirement, classified as defined benefit (DB) or defined contribution (DC) plans. DB plans provide regular monthly benefit payments in retirement, while DC plans, like the 401(k) plan, offer individual accounts for retirement income. This report focuses on DB plans, which can be single-employer or multiemployer plans sponsored by more than one employer, often as part of a collective bargaining agreement. Multiple-employer plans are also a type of pension plan. ERISA sets standards for private-sector pension plans regarding plan participation, vesting requirements, and fiduciary duties. It applies to single-employer and multiple-employer plans, which are not maintained as part of collective bargaining agreements. ERISA established standards for private-sector pension plans, including plan participation, vesting requirements, and fiduciary duties. It also created the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to insure DB pension plans in case of termination. ERISA covers only private-sector and nonprofit organization plans, excluding government and church plans. Pension funding includes plan benefits, set-aside amounts, and required employer contributions to ensure there are enough funds for benefits. The employer contributions required each year for a single-employer DB plan are based on a formula using length of service, accrual rate, and final years' salary. ERISA mandates that DB plans have enough assets to pay benefits, with employers making annual contributions to reach 100% funding. Figure 1 shows a typical DB pension plan's balance sheet with plan assets representing investments made. The balance sheet of a pension plan consists of plan assets (investments made with contributions) and plan liabilities (participants' benefits). Assets are invested in equities, debt, private equity, hedge funds, and real estate. Two methods are used to report asset values: market values and smoothed values. Smoothed values help determine funding goals and necessary contributions, preventing large swings in asset values. Smoothed values in pension plans help create a more predictable funding environment by preventing large swings in asset values. Advocates of reporting market values argue that smoothed values can overstate the financial health of pension plans, as they are often higher than market values. Future benefits in pension plans are calculated and reported as present values, with benefits spread out over many years. This process helps express expected benefits in the future as a present value. Future benefits in pension plans are calculated as present values through discounting, which is the reverse of compounding. The formula for calculating future values as present values is shown in Figure 2. A simplified example of a DB pension benefit calculation is illustrated in Figure 3, where benefits are discounted using an interest rate of 10%. The present value of pension benefits is calculated by discounting future benefits over several years. The DB plan funding ratio compares plan assets to liabilities, indicating financial health. The DB plan funding ratio is a key indicator of the plan's financial health. A ratio of 100% means there are enough funds to cover future benefit obligations, while ratios below 100% indicate underfunding. Even in underfunded plans, participants may still receive benefits in the short term, but without additional contributions or higher returns, future benefits may be at risk. Setting aside funds at the beginning of each year is crucial to meet benefit obligations. The DB plan funding ratio is crucial for financial health. In year 2, an additional contribution of $23.81 is needed to fund the recalculated benefit value. In year 3, an additional contribution of $26.20 is required. This example only covers the first three years, with ongoing funding needed for the plan. The DB plan funding ratio is recalculated annually, with payments required to address any shortfalls. The present value of a dollar amount is affected by the interest rate, with higher rates decreasing the value. At a 15% interest rate, pension benefits are valued at $187.72 in year 1, $215.88 in year 2, and $248.26 in year 3. Contributions are needed to fund the pension benefit, assuming no investment gains or losses. The example illustrates yearly payments for a pension plan over three years, with varying amounts based on interest rates. Contributions continue until the obligation is fully met. The initial payment is lower at a 15% interest rate compared to a 10% rate, but subsequent payments are higher. The total payments over time sum up to the retirement benefits received. The interest rate used by single-employer DB plans is discussed in detail in the report. The minimum required contribution for a DB pension plan is determined by the value of benefits earned by participants, installment payments for underfunding and waived contributions, and the target normal cost. This cost includes pension benefits earned by employees and administration costs. Funding for a DB plan can change due to adjustments in benefits, employer contributions, and participant changes. Plan underfunding can increase due to events like stock market declines or interest rate decreases. Employers must increase contributions to make up for losses, which can be paid off in installment payments via amortization. Funding target is the value of benefits earned, while funding shortfall is the amount needed to cover the deficit. The funding shortfall of a pension plan is the difference between the funding target and plan assets. Factors like investment losses and interest rate decreases can contribute to funding shortfalls. The PPA requires underfunding to be amortized over seven years, with the option for a funding waiver in cases of substantial business hardship. In 2018, there were over 23,000 single-employer DB pension plans with 26.2 million participants, and 81.4% of plans were underfunded in 2016 according to PBGC data. In 2016, 95.2% of pension plans were underfunded, totaling $625.4 billion in underfunding. Additionally, 18.6% of plans were overfunded, amounting to $15.3 billion. The 100 largest corporate DB pension plans had $1.6 trillion in assets and $1.9 trillion in benefit obligations in February 2020, with a funding percentage of 82.2% and $0.3 trillion in underfunding. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 established new funding rules for pension plans. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 established new funding rules for pension plans, requiring them to become 100% funded over a certain time period. Plans must use specified interest rates and actuarial assumptions to calculate their funding targets. Special rules were created for certain types of plans, including government contractors, airlines, and cooperatives. Pension plans must discount their future benefit obligations using three different interest rates called segment rates, based on the corporate bond yield curve. The IRS publishes these rates monthly. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 introduced new funding rules for pension plans, requiring them to reach 100% funding over time. Plans must use specified interest rates to calculate their funding targets, including segment rates based on the corporate bond yield curve. Shortfall and waiver amortization charges must be paid over specific periods, with special rules outlined for certain pension plans. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 introduced new funding rules for pension plans, requiring them to reach 100% funding over time. Eligible plans, such as those maintained by commercial passenger airlines or catering services for airlines, had special funding rules allowing for longer amortization periods and alternative interest rates. Certain government contractor plans had their adoption of new funding rules delayed until the 2011 plan year. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 introduced new funding rules for pension plans, with special provisions for eligible plans like those of government contractors with revenue exceeding $5 billion. Funding relief provisions have delayed implementation dates, extended amortization periods, and modified interest rates for pension plans since PPA's enactment in 2006. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 introduced new funding rules for pension plans, including special provisions for eligible plans. Changes in interest rates and amortization periods allow plans to contribute less money per year over a greater number of years. Higher interest rates decrease the present value of plan liabilities, requiring smaller contributions in the near term but higher contributions in the longer term. The U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 provided funding relief for certain airline plans by extending the amortization period and specifying an interest rate for calculating the funding target. The WRERA delayed PPA transition rules due to economic downturn. The Pension Relief Act of 2010 allowed plans to amortize underfunding over 9 or 15 years. Plan sponsors had to make additional contributions if they paid excess compensation. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) established a funding corridor with minimum and maximum interest rates for calculating plan liabilities. The corridor widened over time to 70% and 130% by 2016. Interest rates are adjusted if they fall outside this corridor. The funding corridor established by MAP-21 widened to 70% and 130% by 2016. Interest rate adjustments affect future benefit obligations and plan contributions, impacting taxable income and Treasury revenue. Legislation delays widened corridor implementation until 2021. The segment rates are determined using funding corridors, with adjustments made if rates exceed the maximum segment rate. The corridors have widened over the years under different provisions, impacting benefit obligations, plan contributions, and Treasury revenue. Treasury adjusts segment rates based on maximum and minimum segment rates. Special funding rules apply to plans sponsored by specific types of employers. Funding rules were delayed for certain cooperatives and charities. Subsequent legislation expanded the delayed effective date for certain charities and modified funding rules for Cooperative and Small Employer Charity (CSEC) pension plans. CSEC plans are multiple-employer pension plans established by eligible cooperatives and charitable organizations to provide retirement benefits. The Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010 extended the delayed effective date to apply to certain charitable organizations' pension plans. The Cooperative and Small Employer Charity Pension Flexibility Act of 2013 established funding rules for CSEC pension plans, exempting them from PPA's funding rules. Plans must report the use of CSEC-specific funding rules to the Department of Labor. The Boy Scouts of America Master Pension Trust is the only plan meeting expanded criteria for CSEC plans. The CARES Act applies CSEC funding rules to plans sponsored by charitable employers providing services for mothers and children. The March of Dimes pension plan is the only one meeting these criteria. The SECURE Act provided special funding rules for pension plans of community newspapers with no benefit increases after 2017. These plans are maintained by family-controlled organizations existing for 30+ years. The SECURE Act and CARES Act provide funding relief for certain pension plans, including those for community newspapers and charitable employers. The CARES Act allows contributions due in 2020 to be made in 2021 with interest. Policymakers should consider the implications of funding relief on participant benefits, PBGC, and the federal budget. Funding relief results in lower employer contributions in the short term. Some stakeholders support funding relief for defined benefit plans to allow employers flexibility for other priorities, such as retaining or hiring employees. However, some policymakers oppose funding relief as a special-interest bailout. Concerns have been raised about employers using saved funds for non-core business activities. Legislation like the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010 limited certain employer actions after adopting funding relief measures. Following funding relief measures, participants in defined benefit plans remain entitled to their benefits, with employer contributions and plan assets potentially lower. However, in cases of employer bankruptcy, the timing of contributions may impact participants' benefits and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). Participants with benefits exceeding the PBGC guarantee or with non-guaranteed benefits could see reductions when PBGC takes over the plan. Following funding relief, there are fewer plan assets available to pay non-guaranteed benefits when PBGC becomes trustee of the plan. PBGC's financial position is harmed as it receives fewer assets from the plans it trustees. ERISA requires PBGC to be self-supporting and not receive appropriations from general revenue. Increasing unfunded liabilities in terminated plans may burden PBGC's single-employer insurance program, despite ending FY2019 with a surplus of $8.6 billion. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and market downturn in early 2020 are likely to worsen the funding position of single-employer pension plans. Funding relief can negatively impact single-employer pension plans and PBGC's financial position. It can provide short-term revenue for Treasury and PBGC by reducing required contributions, leading to higher taxable income. Stakeholders criticize the use of funding relief for budgetary offsets without considering policy justifications. Additionally, greater DB plan underfunding results in higher variable-rate premiums paid to PBGC. Data on CSEC plans in the 2017 plan year is provided in Table A-1. In 2017, CSEC plans had 239,000 participants, $19.6 billion in assets, and a total funding target of $20.7 billion. The largest plan was the Retirement Security Plan with $8.6 billion in assets and a $9.2 billion funding target. The Congressional Research Service analyzed Form 5500 data from 2014 to 2017 to identify plans using CSEC funding rules. Most private-sector pension plans submit annual forms to the IRS, DOL, and PBGC. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) requires pension plans to file Form 5500 and specific schedules with information about the plan, participants, and financial details. Data on private-sector defined benefit (DB) pension plans using CSEC funding rules in 2014-2017 are available on DOL's website. Some plans may not accurately report their use of CSEC funding rules. In 2017, 29 pension plans, including the Johns Hopkins Health System Corporation Plan, used CSEC funding rules. The Employee Benefit Plan of Jewish Community of Louisville, Inc. indicated using CSEC funding rules in 2014-2016, but data for 2017 is not available. Data for the Employee Benefit Plan of Jewish Community of Louisville, Inc. for the 2017 plan year is not available, and participant count for 2016 was 110."
