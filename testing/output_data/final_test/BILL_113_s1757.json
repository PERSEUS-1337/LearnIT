    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fluke Fairness Act of 2013\". It includes findings. Congress finds that summer flounder is economically important for fishermen in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic US. The Magnuson-Stevens Act of 2006 established catch limits and accountability measures for fish stocks, leading to the exploration of new management strategies for depleted stocks like summer flounder. Management of summer flounder occurs in both State and Federal waters through a joint plan between the Council and the Commission. The State's recreational and commercial harvest limits for summer flounder are currently based on outdated data, leading to uneven allocation among East Coast states. The Fishery Management Plan does not consider regional changes in fluke stock location or angler effort. This outdated management system does not reflect the current state of the summer flounder stock. The Federal Government needs to establish a new fishery management plan for summer flounder based on current data and modern techniques. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as Commission, Council, National Standards, Secretary, and Summer Flounder. SEC. 4. SUMMER FLOUNDER MANAGEMENT REFORM. The Federal Government is required to implement a new fishery management plan for summer flounder using updated data and techniques. The Council must submit a modified fishery management plan for summer flounder within 1 year of the Act's enactment, based on scientific information, reflecting changes in distribution and abundance, and complying with National Standards. The Council must consult with the Commission to ensure consistent management of summer flounder throughout its range. If the Council fails to submit an approved plan, the Secretary will prepare and approve a modified plan. SEC. 5. REPORT.\n\nWithin 1 year of approving a modified fishery management plan for summer flounder, the Comptroller General will report to Congress on the plan's implementation and its compliance with National Standards."
