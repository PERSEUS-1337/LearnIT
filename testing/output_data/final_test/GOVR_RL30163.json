    "content": "Nonresidential structures are depreciated over 39 years at a straight-line rate, while residential structures are depreciated over 27.5 years. Prior to 1971, new properties had a depreciable life of 40 years with faster depreciation methods available, such as sum-of-years-digits (SYD) and declining balance (DB) methods like double declining balance (DDB). The double declining balance method applies the same rate to the undepreciated balance, causing depreciation amounts to decline over time. Taxpayers could switch to a straight-line writeoff at the halfway point for DDB or earlier for slower DB methods. The value of depreciation allowances depends on the timing of deductions and the concept of discounting future payments. Table 1 shows historical depreciation methods and tax lives, with present values of deductions at a 10% discount rate. Depreciation lives for real estate have decreased since 1954, with smaller present values. Residential structures have shorter tax lives and less beneficial straight-line writeoff methods. The treatment of capital gains and rules for used buildings affect the tax burden assigned to buildings. Used assets are now treated the same as newly constructed buildings. Component depreciation in the past made depreciation rules more complex. Depreciation value depends on the discount rate, influenced by inflation. High inflation can lead to understated depreciation. Economic depreciation deductions reflect the return of principal and changes in market value due to asset deterioration. Matching tax deductions with economic depreciation determines the effective tax burden. Three major empirical approaches include vintage price comparisons, rent comparisons, and perpetual inventory methods. Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates tax burden in National Income Accounts. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates economic depreciation in the National Income Accounts using a method based on useful life and retirement ages. Economic depreciation should be indexed for inflation to accurately measure income. The vintage price approach determines depreciation by observing potential sales prices as assets age, but there are limitations with this method, especially in real estate. Real estate presents unique challenges due to its heterogeneous nature, with properties varying in size, location, and maintenance. Researchers use hedonic indexes to control for these differences, but data availability can be a limitation. Age plays a significant role in determining asset value, with depreciation being a measure of this effect. Specific issues, such as censored sample bias, have been identified with this approach. Censored sample bias and the lemons problem affect the accuracy of depreciation estimates in the used asset market. Censored sample bias leads to underestimation of depreciation due to the absence of completely depreciated assets in the sample. The lemons problem arises from the higher presence of low-quality assets in the market, leading buyers to expect lower quality and lower prices. The lemons problem in the used car market leads to lower prices for lower-quality assets, overstating depreciation. In markets with sophisticated buyers or other reasons for selling, this problem is less likely to occur. Additionally, vintage value can affect depreciation if older structures were built more soundly or if a particular vintage is in high demand. The vintage of structures, like Victorian buildings, is in high demand, affecting depreciation. Tax rules can also impact depreciation estimates, especially when tax life differs for new and used assets. Age-related heteroskedasticity can lead to greater variations in depreciation measurements. Heteroskedasticity in real estate refers to larger variations in asset values for older assets, impacting depreciation estimates. Techniques can correct for this issue. A well-known study by Hulten and Wykoff estimated depreciation rates for office and factory structures, translating into present values of 33% and 42% of the purchase price, respectively. The study by Hulten and Wykoff estimated depreciation rates for office and factory structures, highlighting the importance of correcting for censored sample bias. DeLeeuw suggests that demolishing a structure may be due to more profitable land use patterns, where the site value appreciates while the structure becomes obsolete. The study by Hulten and Wykoff emphasized the need to correct for censored sample bias when estimating depreciation rates for office and factory structures. Taubman mentioned that buildings can become obsolete, leading to their demolition, with the site value appreciating. Some buildings may disappear due to accidents like fires, resulting in inadequate compensation from insurance. Recent studies on depreciation rates for office buildings in Chicago did not correct for censored sample bias, leading to understated estimates. Deloitte and Touch's study on depreciation rates for various building types found rates of 2.67% for industrial buildings, 4.48% for retail buildings, 3.46% for office buildings, and 3.95% for residential rental buildings. Previous studies on structures depreciation focused mainly on housing, with rates ranging from less than one percent to slightly over 2%. Different depreciation patterns were tested, such as a method slower than straight line depreciation. The study by Goodman and Thibodeau, Shilling, Sirmans, and Dombrow, and Clapp and Carmelo analyzed depreciation rates for owner-occupied and rental housing. They found varying rates of depreciation, with initial high rates falling over time. Rental housing depreciated more rapidly than owner-occupied housing. Knight and Sirmans also noted some properties appreciated due to the vintage effect. Some studies suggest that poorly maintained homes depreciate faster than average, while well-maintained homes depreciate slower. Rental housing may depreciate faster than owner-occupied housing, but some studies show no difference. Examining rents can help determine depreciation, but long-term leases may affect the pattern of depreciation. Some studies have found that poorly maintained homes depreciate faster than average, while well-maintained homes depreciate slower. Rental housing may depreciate faster than owner-occupied housing, but some studies show no difference. Long-term leases can affect the pattern of depreciation, with some studies showing a decline in gross rent over time. The decline in gross rent can lead to a higher depreciation rate, around 4%, due to maintenance costs not being a fixed share of gross rent. This results in a present value of about 45 cents on the dollar for a 0.6% decline in gross rent, assuming net rents decline even faster. Maintenance costs not being small initially or declining can further increase the depreciation rate. The recent study by Deloitte and Touche estimated higher decline rates in gross rents, ranging from 1.9% to 2.5%. Another type of study examines replacement costs for housing, providing an aggregate overall depreciation rate without censored sample bias issues. Leigh reports various depreciation rates for housing stock, including tenant housing depreciating at 1.3% for 1950-1970, 2.2% for 1950-1960, and 0.6% from 1960-1970 with adjustments for conversions and losses. Without adjustments, depreciation rates are 2.3% for 1960-1970, 3.1% for 1950-1960, and 1.8% for 1970-1980. The adjustment for housing depreciation rates considers geometric decay for infinite lives but not necessarily for finite lives. Failure to adjust may overlook the transformation of owner-occupied units into rental properties. An aggregate housing depreciation rate combining tenant and owner-occupied housing shows consistent estimates over different time periods. Leigh's subsequent study reports slightly lower depreciation rates by adjusting for varying productive efficiencies by age. The range of estimates for structures depreciation rates indicates empirical challenges and heterogeneity. Adjusting for varying productive efficiencies by age yields a lower estimate of about 1%. Considering potential censored sample bias, structures likely depreciate at rates exceeding 2% but less than 4%. Estimates of economic depreciation rates for equipment and structures are difficult to determine due to lack of rental data or benchmark asset data. Depreciation estimates for machinery are often based on the vintage price approach. Studies by Hulten, Wykoff, Oliner, and Beidleman provide varying estimates for equipment depreciation. Alternative approaches use observations of investment combined with output for broad aggregates. In the Tax Reform Act of 1986, efforts were made to align economic and tax depreciation rates, using accelerated methods without indexing for inflation. Changes since then have altered these relationships, such as lengthening the depreciation life for nonresidential structures in 1993. In 1993, the depreciation life for nonresidential structures was extended from 31.5 to 39 years to offset revenue losses from liberalizing passive loss restrictions. Tax rates were raised for corporations and high-income individuals, increasing tax burdens. The expected inflation rate decreased, lowering tax burdens. Effective tax rates varied among assets, with equipment receiving more favorable treatment compared to structures. The gap between the two widened, not solely due to longer depreciation periods. The effects of lower inflation on tax burdens for equipment versus structures were significant. Accelerated depreciation was used to offset the penalization of short-lived assets by inflation. Different depreciation rates were found for industrial, other, and retail structures. Effective tax rates varied based on these depreciation rates. The effective tax rates on retail structures can be adjusted by either increasing the tax burden on equipment or decreasing the tax rate on structures. For example, increasing the typical 7-year life of equipment by one year would raise the tax burden by 2 percentage points. Increasing the life by 2, 3, or 4 years would result in tax burdens of 31%, 33%, and 35% respectively. It would require a larger absolute change to lower the tax burden due to smaller present values and depreciation methods. In order to lower tax burdens on structures to 27%, changes in depreciation methods and tax rates are necessary. For office buildings and apartments, a life of 20 years would be required, while for factory buildings, a life of 17 years would be needed. Substituting double declining balance methods for straight-line would decrease tax rates on various structures. Adjusting tax lives to 27.5 years with double declining balance methods would further reduce tax burdens on office buildings and factories. To further lower tax burdens on structures to 27%, changes in depreciation methods and tax rates are necessary. Shortening tax lives for structures to 20 years or less, adopting double declining balance, and aligning all tax lives with the current life allowed for residential structures would help achieve this goal. There is still uncertainty regarding economic depreciation rates and the categorization of equipment assets for tax purposes. Shortening tax lives for structures to the current life allowed for residential structures would align tax rates on structures and equipment. The Treasury criticized the tax system in 1984 for favoring equipment over structures, but arguments that structures are favored due to easier financing can be challenged. Altering depreciation practices may not efficiently address existing tax distortions favoring debt finance and individual investment over corporate equity investment. The tax system may favor debt finance and individual investments over corporate equity investment. Investments outside the corporate sector are preferred, but there is a debate on whether depreciation should be less beneficial for proprietorships and partnerships. Suggestions include relieving double taxation on corporate equity income and providing beneficial treatment to structures. Constraints on debt finance have been implemented through passive loss rules and other restrictions. The 1986 Tax Reform Act imposed constraints on finance through passive loss rules and restrictions on tax shelters. There is a misconception that structures are more leveraged than other assets, but data shows that debt-to-asset ratios decline over time. Data from the housing census and Federal Reserve Flow of Fund Accounts can be compared to analyze debt to asset shares. Comparing assets based on average debt-to-asset ratios is more accurate than initial borrowing rates. The debt-to-asset ratio for residential rental real estate is compared to the corporate sector, using two measures: total liabilities divided by total assets and credit market liabilities as a percent of tangible physical assets. Data indicates that the ratio is not higher than that of the corporate sector. Corporate tax statistics also support this finding. The debt to asset ratios for lessors of buildings and nonfinancial corporations are slightly overstated due to historical asset valuation and accelerated depreciation. Even when adjusting for depreciation, lessors of buildings have lower debt to asset ratios compared to other assets, suggesting that structures do not have higher debt ratios than other assets. Based on the evidence available, structures appear to be overtaxed relative to equipment. Adjusting equipment lives or structures lives could align tax rates. Arguments for heavier taxation on structures due to easier measurement are inconsistent with leveraging evidence."
