    "content": "This paper introduces a novel attack method called the generative model inversion attack, which successfully inverts deep neural networks by leveraging partial public information to learn a distributional prior via generative adversarial networks (GANs). The paper introduces a generative model inversion attack that inverts deep neural networks using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to guide the process. It proves that highly predictive models are vulnerable to inversion attacks due to the strong correlation between features and labels. Our experiments show a significant improvement in identification accuracy using a proposed attack on face image reconstruction from a face recognition classifier. Differential privacy is not effective against these attacks. Deep neural networks are widely used in various applications, raising concerns about privacy when sensitive data is involved. Privacy attacks, such as model inversion attacks, aim to reconstruct sensitive features. Model inversion attacks aim to reconstruct sensitive features of training data by exploiting their correlation with the model output. These attacks are implemented as an optimization problem to find the sensitive feature value that maximizes likelihood under the target model. The first model inversion attack was proposed in the context of genomic privacy, showing how access to a linear regression model can reveal private genomic attributes. Recent work has extended these attacks to other settings and target models, demonstrating effectiveness on simple models. Model inversion attacks aim to reconstruct sensitive features of training data by exploiting their correlation with the model output. Recent work has extended these attacks to other settings and target models, demonstrating effectiveness on simple models. However, it remains uncertain if these attacks can be successful against deep neural networks due to the challenges posed by the non-convex nature of the optimization problem and the high-dimensional, continuous data space of sensitive features. In this paper, a generative model inversion (GMI) attack is proposed to invert DNNs and synthesize private training data with high fidelity, focusing on image data. The key observation is that obtaining information about the general data distribution, especially for images, is relatively easy. For example, an adversary could crawl facial images from the Internet to understand how a face image is structured, even without access to private training data. The text discusses using generative models to learn prior knowledge from public datasets to regularize the inversion problem in face image structures. It also introduces a GMI attack algorithm based on GANs to reveal private training data of DNNs and highlights the vulnerability of highly predictive models to inversion attacks. The text presents a theoretical result linking a model's predictive power to its susceptibility to MI attacks and conducts experiments to demonstrate the attack's performance. Privacy attacks against ML models aim to reveal training data, with membership attacks identifying individuals in the data and MI attacks reconstructing features for specific labels. Various privacy attack methods have emerged alongside defenses with formal privacy guarantees. Differential privacy (DP) provides formal privacy guarantees by randomizing algorithms to protect against membership attacks in machine learning. However, DP does not explicitly safeguard attribute privacy targeted by model inversion (MI) attacks. MI attacks aim to reconstruct sensitive features from trained models, as demonstrated in previous studies. The algorithm proposed by al. (2017) enables MI attacks without knowledge of non-sensitive features by poisoning training data. Evaluation of attacks is limited to linear models, while Fredrikson et al. (2015) applied MI attacks to complex models like shallow neural networks for face recognition, producing blurry and hardly recognizable face images. Yang et al. (2019b) suggested training a separate network to swap input and output for MI attacks, but their approach has limitations. Several recent papers have formalized MI attacks and studied factors affecting a model's vulnerability theoretically. Wu et al. (2016) characterized model invertibility for Boolean functions using influence from Boolean analysis, while Yeom et al. (2018) formalized the risk posed by models to individuals in training data. Our theory does not rely on the adversary having access to the joint distribution of private features and labels, unlike previous theories. Our GMI attack does not require this assumption and is supported by experimental findings. In this section, the threat model and attack method are discussed in detail. An adversary uses a model to predict sensitive features, with face recognition classifiers as the target network. The adversary may have auxiliary knowledge to aid in their inference. MI attacks on images involve filling in sensitive features associated with a specific identity in the training set, using auxiliary knowledge like blurred or corrupted images. This differs from image inpainting tasks, which focus on filling missing pixels for visually realistic results without considering specific identities. Our approach to MI attacks leverages training strategies from image inpainting to improve reconstructed image recognizability. The generator and discriminator are trained with public data to reconstruct missing sensitive regions realistically. The goal is to find the latent vector that achieves the highest likelihood under the target network while being constrained to the data manifold learned by the generator. If not properly designed, the generator may not allow the target network to easily distinguish between different latent vectors. To address the issue of latent vectors collapsing in the feature space, a loss term is introduced to promote diversity in the data manifold learned by the generator. This involves two stages: public knowledge distillation using unlabeled datasets to train the generator and discriminators, and secret revelation to recover missing sensitive regions in images. In the secret revelation stage, an optimization is solved to find the latent vector generating an image with maximum likelihood under the target network, while the prior loss penalizes. In the secret revelation stage, an optimization is solved to find the latent vector generating an image with maximum likelihood under the target network, while the prior loss penalizes unrealistic images and the identity loss encourages generated images to have likelihood under the targeted network. The log likelihood is used as a model performance measure for predicting labels of features, and maximizing it is equivalent to minimizing cross entropy loss. The data distribution is unknown, with sensitive and non-sensitive parts of features defined as Xs and Xns. The predictive power of sensitive features under a model is defined as the change in model performance when excluding it from the input. The goal of an adversary in an MI attack is to guess the value of a sensitive feature given its label, model, and auxiliary knowledge. The best attack outcome is to recover the entire posterior distribution of the sensitive feature. The vulnerability to MI attacks is inevitable if sensitive features are highly predictive under the model. Adversaries can estimate the model using public datasets and adapt attack algorithms to output a feature distribution instead of a single point. The similarity between distributions p(Xs|y, xns) and pf(Xs|y, xns) is crucial in measuring MI attack performance. Theorem 1 states that highly predictive models are more vulnerable to Membership Inference (MI) attacks. This contradicts a previous study by Yeom et al. (2018) which focused on overfitting data. Their assumption about the adversary having access to the joint distribution of the private training data differs from the current study. The study focuses on Membership Inference (MI) attacks, aiming to learn private feature distribution from model parameters without assuming prior knowledge of the joint distribution. Three datasets are used for evaluation: MNIST, ChestX-ray8, and CelebA. Images are cropped and resized for analysis. The study focuses on Membership Inference (MI) attacks using different datasets like MNIST, ChestX-ray8, and CelebA. Images are cropped and resized for analysis, and datasets are split into private and public parts for training the target network. Various target networks with modified FC-layers are implemented for digit classification on MNIST. The target networks used for different tasks include 3 convolutional layers and 2 pooling layers for digit classification on MNIST, ResNet-18 for disease prediction on ChestX-ray8, and VGG16, ResNet-152, and face.eoLVe for face recognition on CelebA. The private dataset is split into training (90%) and test (10%) sets, and various optimizers and parameters are used for training the networks and GAN in the attack pipeline. In the second stage, \u03bb i = 100 is set, and z is optimized using SGD with a learning rate of 0.01, batch size 64, and momentum 0.9. The latent vector z is initialized randomly 5 times and optimized for 1500 iterations each round. The MI attack efficacy is evaluated quantitatively using four metrics, including Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), to assess if private information is exposed in the recovered image. The Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) measures pixel-wise similarity between images, with higher PSNR indicating better quality. However, reconstructed images may still reveal identity information even if not close to the target image. Evaluation metrics like Attack Accuracy (Attack Acc) are needed to assess semantic similarity between reconstructed and target images. An evaluation classifier predicts identity based on the reconstructed image, with high accuracy indicating privacy exposure. The evaluation classifier for target individual privacy should be different from the target network to avoid overfitting and should be highly performant. State-of-the-art architectures are adopted for each task, such as a 5-layer convolutional network for MNIST, VGG-19 for ChestX-ray8, and a model from (Cheng et al., 2017) for CeleA. The evaluation classifier is pretrained on MS-Celeb-1M and fine-tuned on the target network's training set, achieving 96% accuracy. Feature Distance (Feat Dist) measures the l2 feature distance between images. The text discusses the Feature Distance (Feat Dist) and K-Nearest Neighbor Distance (KNN Dist) metrics for measuring the distance between reconstructed images and target classes. It also compares the proposed GMI attack with existing attacks like EMI and PII. The algorithm in (Fredrikson et al., 2015) exploits identity loss for image reconstruction. Pure image inpainting (PII) minimizes W-GAN loss for image recovery from a public dataset. Attack performance is evaluated in three settings: no auxiliary knowledge, blurred image access, and corrupted image access. The proposed GMI attack performance is compared in Table 1. The GMI attack outperforms EMI on deep nets, improving attack accuracy by 75% against the face.evoLVe classifier. Sophisticated models are more vulnerable to attacks. The attacker can use auxiliary knowledge with blurred or partially blocked images, using center and face \"T\" masks. Our method consistently outperforms existing MI attack in generating adversarial examples that can fool the target network without exhibiting recognizable features of private data. The inversion optimization problem is ill-posed, leading to visually meaningless local minimums. The study evaluates the effectiveness of MI attacks using public datasets to recover private images. Results show that while PII leads to realistic recoveries, the reconstructed images lack identity features. The attacks are more successful on the center mask than the face T mask due to the latter hiding identity features. Prior knowledge from public datasets is crucial for attack success, with GANs used to distill this knowledge. The impact of public datasets on attack performance is assessed, particularly when the data is from the same distribution as the private data. The study evaluates MI attacks using public datasets to recover private images. The size of the public data and distribution shift affect attack performance. Shrinking public data size by 10 times only varies attack performance by less than 7%. Training GAN on PubFig83 and attacking CelebA results in a drop in attack accuracy by more than 20%. To enhance the reconstruction quality of MI attacks on public datasets, landmarks are detected in face images, and pre-processing steps like rotation and cropping are applied. Experimental validation shows a correlation between predictive power and vulnerability to MI attacks. Various methods to increase feature predictive power are considered, such as enlarging training size, dropout regularization, and batch normalization. The proposed method from Section 2.2 is slightly modified for efficiency. The proposed method in Section 2.2 is modified for efficiency by excluding diversity loss from the attack pipeline to allow multiple architectures to share the same GAN for prior knowledge distillation. Attack performance is better for models with higher feature predictive powers, consistent across different architectures. GMI and EMI attacks are visualized in Figure 5 using MNIST data. The GMI attack is compared with a baseline in Table 4. The performance of GMI is significantly better than EMI in attacking ChestX-ray8 data, as shown in Table 5. The implications of differential privacy (DP) for MI attacks are investigated, with challenges in producing face recognition models with DP guarantees. The study turns to the simpler MNIST dataset for analysis. The GMI attack outperforms PII in exposing private information from differentially private models, even with stringent privacy guarantees. Varying differential privacy budgets has little impact on protecting against the GMI attack, sometimes even improving its performance. DP only hides the presence of a single instance in the training set, limiting the protection of specific individuals. In this paper, a generative approach to Membership Inference (MI) attacks is presented, achieving state-of-the-art success rates for attacking Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with high-dimensional input data. The approach extracts generic knowledge from public datasets using GAN to regularize the inversion problem. Experimental results show high performance even with public datasets that do not include the target identities, are unlabeled, small in size, or from a different distribution. Theoretical analysis highlights the connection between a model's predictive power and vulnerability to inversion attacks. The text discusses vulnerability to inversion attacks and proposes extending the attack to the black-box setting. The proof of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 is provided, showing the relationship between models and KL divergence. Experimental details include network architecture with specific details on encoders, decoder, and discriminator layers. The text discusses vulnerability to inversion attacks and proposes extending the attack to the black-box setting. Experimental details include network architecture with specific details on encoders, decoder, and discriminator layers. SimpleCNN has five convolutional layers with batch normalization and leaky ReLU, while SoftmaxNet has one FC layer. MNIST dataset is split into private and public sets for training target networks. Target network is a Multilayer Perceptron with 2 hidden layers. Evaluation classifier is a CNN with three convolution layers and two fully-connected layers achieving 99.2% accuracy on MNIST test set. Differential privacy is ensured by adding Gaussian noise to SGD steps. Privacy budget is monitored using moment accounting technique. During training, batch size is set to 256, epochs to 40, and L2 norm of per-sample gradient is clipped at 1.5. Different noise scale ratios are used to obtain target networks with varying \u03b5 values. For models with \u03b5 = 0.1, SGD with a learning rate of 0.01 is used for stable convergence. Generator architecture is tailored to MNIST dataset by adjusting input channels, kernel sizes, and discriminator layers. GAN training in the first stage of GMI attack uses batch size of 64 and Adam optimizer with specific parameters. For the second stage of the attack, a batch size of 64 is used with SGD optimizer and Nesterov momentum. The optimization runs for 1500 iterations. A center mask is applied to block the central part of digits. Attack accuracy is calculated across 640 randomly sampled images from the private set with 5 random initializations for each image."
