    "content": "The \"Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success Act\" or the \"A PLUS Act\" aims to provide states and local communities with flexibility to improve academic achievement and implement education reforms. It also aims to reduce administrative costs of Federal education programs and ensure accountability for advancing academic achievement, especially for disadvantaged children. The \"A PLUS Act\" defines key terms such as accountability and declaration of intent, emphasizing the responsibility of public schools to report student progress and states to manage Federal funds for educational programs. The \"A PLUS Act\" defines key terms such as State, State Authorizing Officials, and State Designated Officer, outlining the roles and responsibilities of state officials in managing educational policies and declarations of intent. The \"Officer\" is the person designated by State Authorizing Officials to submit declarations of intent to the Secretary and act as the point-of-contact for the State regarding responsibilities under the Act. SEC. 4. DECLARATION OF INTENT. Each State can submit a declaration of intent to the Secretary to receive Federal funds for managing educational policy. States can consolidate programs for educational purposes, excluding those funded under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The funds received must be used according to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Each State educational agency operating under a declaration of intent must remove fiscal and accounting barriers to consolidate funds for educational purposes. The declaration must list eligible programs and provide assurances for submission. The declaration of intent for State educational agencies must be authorized by State officials, specify the duration, ensure fiscal accountability, comply with civil rights laws, promote educational opportunities for the disadvantaged, and maintain accountability to parents and citizens. The declaration of intent for State educational agencies must be authorized by State officials, specify the duration, ensure fiscal accountability, comply with civil rights laws, promote educational opportunities for the disadvantaged, and maintain accountability to parents and citizens. The duration of the declaration of intent shall not exceed 5 years, and the Secretary will review and recognize the declaration within 60 days unless it fails to meet the requirements. If no action is taken by the Secretary, the declaration will be deemed valid. State Authorizing Officials can direct amendments to a declaration of intent, which may expand or reduce its scope, modify its duration, or exclude coverage of a Federal program. Amendments must be submitted to the Secretary for consideration. State Authorizing Officials have the authority to amend a declaration of intent, which can include expanding or reducing its scope, modifying its duration, or excluding coverage of a Federal program. The effective date of the amendment must allow for full compliance with Federal program requirements for any program removed from the declaration of intent. Once an amendment is executed, all program requirements for any program removed from the declaration of intent will apply to the State's use of funds allocated under that program. SEC. 5. TRANSPARENCY FOR RESULTS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. Each State must inform parents and the public about student achievement assessments and demonstrate student progress for accountability. States must establish an accountability system and provide annual reports on student progress, including performance data disaggregated similarly to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act requires States to use Federal funds to improve academic achievement, reduce disparities between student groups, and enhance educational opportunities for the disadvantaged. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. States with a declaration of intent can spend up to 1% of Federal funds on administrative expenses, except if Part A of Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is not included, then the limit is 3%. Private school children and teachers must be included in activities funded under this Act, similar to the participation provided under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965."
