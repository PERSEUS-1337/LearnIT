    "title": "AB 1343",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 1016.2 is added to the Penal Code, requiring defense counsel to provide advice to noncitizen defendants on potential immigration consequences of their criminal cases, as mandated by the Sixth Amendment and California courts. Defense counsel must investigate and advise on immigration consequences of available dispositions and defend against adverse consequences when consistent with the defendant's goals and informed consent. In Padilla v. Kentucky, the US Supreme Court allowed consideration of immigration consequences in plea negotiations, stating it benefits both parties. Deportation is a significant penalty for noncitizens, even for minor offenses. Noncitizen defendants benefit from understanding immigration consequences during plea negotiations to avoid adverse outcomes like deportation and family separation due to criminal charges. Informed advice from counsel can help mitigate these consequences. Once in removal proceedings, noncitizens may be transferred to various immigration detention facilities across the country. Mandatory detention is triggered by many criminal offenses, preventing the person from requesting bond. In immigration proceedings, there is no court-appointed right to counsel, leading to a majority of detained immigrants being unrepresented. Immigration judges often lack the authority to consider factors like family hardship, length of time in the US, or rehabilitation when deciding on the person's status in the country. The immigration consequences of criminal convictions are significant in California, where a large percentage of the population is foreign-born. Many children in the state live in households headed by foreign-born individuals, with a high number of these children being U.S. citizens. Thousands of parents of U.S. citizen children in California have been deported in recent years, with little chance of ever returning. The Legislature aims to codify relevant case law to promote justice in such cases. In California, Section 1016.3 of the Penal Code requires defense counsel to provide accurate advice on immigration consequences and defend against them when possible. Prosecution should consider immigration consequences in plea negotiations for a just resolution. This does not change the requirement for defendants to disclose their immigration status. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by this act, as per the Government Code."
