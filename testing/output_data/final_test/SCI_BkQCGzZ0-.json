    "content": "Recurrent models for sequences have been successful in language modeling and machine translation. To improve representation in sequence models, an autoencoder is proposed to compress sequences through a discrete latent space. An improved semantic hashing technique is introduced to propagate gradients through this representation. The technique performs well on a new efficiency measure and latent codes correspond to words and phrases. An application of the autoencoder-augmented model is also presented. Autoencoders have a history in deep learning and can operate on continuous or discrete representations. Discrete latent representations are beneficial for language tasks, such as autoregressive models. Discrete representations can be used in reasoning systems or reinforcement learning. However, using discrete latent variables in deep learning is challenging. In this work, an architecture is presented for autoencoding text with continuous autoencoders, addressing challenges with autoregressive components. The compression function is trained using semantic hashing techniques, enhancing it with a saturating sigmoid and a straight-through pass. The text discusses a technique for discretizing language models using a sigmoid and straight-through pass without noise annealing. The method is tested by adding an autoencoded sequence component to language models and comparing perplexity values. The number of bits used in the autoencoded part is proposed as a measure of performance, showing superiority over other methods like GumbelSoftmax. The addition of the autoencoded part improves the sequence model's performance. The paper introduces a discretization technique for language models using a sigmoid and straight-through pass. It discusses the addition of an autoencoded sequence component to improve model performance and presents a decoding method that enhances translation diversity. Key contributions include a novel discretization method, performance measurement for autoencoders in sequence models, and an improved sampling approach. The paper introduces a discretization technique for language models using a sigmoid and straight-through pass. The method involves adding noise to a vector, computing two vectors, and using the discretized value for evaluation and inference. The code and hyperparameter settings for replicating the experiments will be available as open-source. The paper presents a discretization technique for language models using a sigmoid and straight-through pass. During training, gradients always flow to one vector, even if another vector was used in the forward pass. The vector is discretized into 16 bits for prediction, with dense vectors having a much larger dimensionality. A fully-connected layer converts the high-dimensional vector into a 16-bit vector for interpretation as an integer between 0 and 65535. The text chunk discusses the application of a dense layer to map a vector into n dimensions using learned matrices and bias vectors. A feed-forward network is used to convert a discretized vector back into a high-dimensional vector. The network utilizes relu functions and large filter sizes to recover from a discretization bottleneck. The text chunk introduces the discretization method Gumbel-Softmax BID4 BID8, where a vector is transformed into logits and then a discrete vector is obtained by selecting the index with the maximum value. During training, samples are drawn from the Gumbel distribution to approximate the 1-hot vector representation. The architecture of the autoencoding function c(s) involves applying convolutions to halve the size of the input sequence s, using ReLU non-linearities and layer normalization. This process includes adding a residual block and a final strided convolution to reduce the size of s. The autoencoding function c(s) involves applying convolutions to halve the input sequence s, using ReLU non-linearities and layer normalization. The final compression function is given by c(s) = bottleneck(s). The network has access to a large context due to 3 convolutions with kernel 3 in each step. Training with c(s) defined above from scratch is challenging. The autoencoding function c(s) involves applying convolutions to halve the input sequence s, using ReLU non-linearities and layer normalization. To aid training, a side-path for c(s) without discretization is added initially. The network reaches almost 0 loss during pretraining when c(s) = s for the first 10000 steps. Switching to c(s) = bottleneck(s) increases loss, which improves with further training. The autoencoding function is tested by using it to prefix the sequence s in a sequence model. The sequence model architecture used is the Transformer, with parameters for predicting c(s) separate from those predicting s. The sequence c(s) is added as a prefix to s after being reversed and separated by a symbol. The sequence model was not tuned, using default settings from the Transformer authors. The study experimented with autoencoding on 3 sequence tasks: character-level language model, word-level language model, and word-level translation model. Different vocabularies were used to test the method's applicability and improvement in decoding. The LM1B corpus was used for language modeling and the WMT English-German corpus for translation, both tokenized into a vocabulary of 32000 words and word-pieces. The study focused on autoencoding performance using the WMT English-German corpus with a vocabulary of 32000 words. It compared the method to GumbelSoftmax for sequence tasks, measuring performance quantitatively through perplexity per token. The study analyzed autoencoding performance on the WMT English-German corpus with a vocabulary of 32000 words. It compared the method to GumbelSoftmax for sequence tasks, measuring performance quantitatively through perplexity per token. The autoencoder was designed to peek at additional information before decoding, which could lower the perplexity of the model if perfectly aligned with the language model. The efficiency of the autoencoder in reducing perplexity was calculated based on the difference between the actual perplexity and the theoretical minimum. The study analyzed autoencoding efficiency in reducing perplexity on the WMT English-German corpus. DSAE measures how well available bits are used by the model. Comparison with Gumbel-Softmax was done on log-perplexities of baseline and autoencoder models. The study compared autoencoding efficiency with Gumbel-Softmax on word-level problems. Gumbel-Softmax results heavily depended on the temperature parameter tuning. Additional loss term was added to increase variance and optimize performance. Despite efforts, only 12% efficiency was achieved in the language model. Our method achieved almost 60% efficiency on character-level language modeling and maintained 55% efficiency on word-level language modeling. However, efficiency dropped to 19% on the translation task due to limitations in the compression process. Despite this lower efficiency, the method is still useful for sampling from the model. Experiments were conducted to ensure stability by varying noise deviations in the semantic hashing part during word-level language modeling with a smaller model. Experiments were conducted on word-level language modeling with a smaller model configuration to test the method's robustness to noise deviations. Results showed that the method worked even without noise, with a standard deviation of 1.5 still effective. The small model achieved a DSAE of 48.5%, comparable to the larger baseline model's 55%. The discrete latent symbols' interpretability was also explored after training the models. In a 32-fold compressed character-level language model, the interpretability of discrete latent symbols was investigated by decoding with beam search. Replacing symbols revealed repeated phrases, indicating potential fixed meanings. In a 32-fold compressed character-level language model, the interpretability of discrete latent symbols was investigated by decoding with beam search. Replacing symbols revealed repeated phrases, indicating potential fixed meanings. However, further analysis with an 8-fold compressed character-level language model showed that the latent code is structured, with the meaning of latent symbols depending on other symbols before them. In a study on latent symbols in a compressed language model, decoding with beam search revealed fixed meanings for certain symbols. Further analysis with a simpler model showed context-independent latent symbols, with examples like \"gallery\" and \"climate\" being consistently decoded.

Context-independent latent symbols like \"gallery\" and \"climate\" were consistently decoded, showing interesting patterns in the latent code. However, using autoencoder models in practice poses challenges, such as lack of diversity in results obtained by beam search and potential introduction of artifacts or semantic changes with sampling.

Using autoencoder models in practice poses challenges, such as lack of diversity in results obtained by beam search and potential introduction of artifacts or semantic changes with sampling. An example is shown where translations using beam search and sampling resulted in similar outputs with little diversity and changes in semantics. The study on latent symbols in a compressed language model revealed fixed meanings for certain symbols during decoding with beam search. Using autoencoder models in practice poses challenges, such as lack of diversity in results obtained by beam search and potential introduction of artifacts or semantic changes with sampling. Sampling c(s) and running beam search for the appropriate sequence s can help preserve high-level diversity without introducing low-level artifacts. The study combines text autoencoders with discrete autoencoders to improve diversity in results obtained by beam search. Samples obtained show diverse sentence structures while preserving the original semantics, addressing the challenge in neural translation. Improved semantic hashing in discrete autoencoders yields over 50% efficiency, allowing for deciphering of latent code. Sampling from the latent code and using beam search produces diverse samples. Future work includes exploring the impact of function architecture on latent code and enhancing sequence autoencoding efficiency. Potential applications include training multi-scale generative models end-to-end. Autoencoders can be used for training multi-scale generative models end-to-end, enabling the generation of realistic images, audio, and video. They also have applications in reinforcement learning, where using latent code can help agents plan in larger time scales and explore more efficiently."
