    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 3501 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to define key terms related to physician assistants, including the Board, approved programs, trainees, physician assistants, and supervising physicians. The curr_chunk defines terms related to physician assistants, including supervision by a licensed physician, regulations in Chapter 13.8 of Title 16, routine visual screening, and program manager of a diversion program. The curr_chunk defines terms related to physician assistants, including delegation of services agreement, other specified medical services, and medical records review meeting for adequate supervision. A physician assistant acts as an agent of the supervising physician when authorized to perform medical services under the supervision of a licensed physician. The physician responsible for supervision must be identified in the medical record for each patient care episode. A physician assistant under the supervision of a physician can assist a doctor of podiatric medicine in the same medical group. The supervising physician must be physically available for consultation, and the assistant can only perform tasks within the scope of practice of the podiatric doctor. Physician assistants and their supervising physicians must establish written guidelines for supervision, which can be met through adopting protocols for tasks. Protocols must include diagnosis and management criteria, tests to order, drugs to recommend, and patient education. Procedures protocols must outline patient information, consent, procedure preparation, technique, and follow-up care. Protocols for physician assistants must be developed or referenced by the supervising physician and surgeon, signed, and dated. The supervising physician must review and sign a sample of 5% of patient medical records within 30 days to ensure adequate supervision. The supervising physician and surgeon, along with the physician assistant, must conduct a monthly medical records review meeting, reviewing at least 10 patient records each month. The documentation of the reviewed records must be jointly signed and dated by both parties. The supervising physician and surgeon must review a sample of at least 10 medical records per month for at least 10 months using a combination of mechanisms. Cases with significant risk to the patient must be selected for review. The Medical Board of California may establish alternative mechanisms for physician assistant supervision. No medical services related to eye care, including refractive states, optical devices, contact lenses, or dentistry, can be performed under this chapter. Routine visual screening is allowed. Compliance with this section ensures compliance with relevant regulations. Section 3502.1 of the Business and Professions Code allows physician assistants to administer medication under the supervision of a licensed physician. The supervising physician can limit the authority of the physician assistant in issuing drug orders. Each supervising physician must establish written formulary and protocols for physician assistants to issue drug orders, specifying criteria and contraindications. Protocols for Schedule II controlled substances must include diagnosis criteria. Physician assistants act on behalf of supervising physicians when issuing drug orders. A drug order issued by a physician assistant is treated as a prescription, with the signature of the physician assistant considered valid. This allows physician assistants to issue drug orders under the authority of their supervising physicians. A drug order issued by a physician assistant must be based on protocols or approved by the supervising physician before being carried out. The physician assistant may administer drugs listed in the formulary without advance approval, but for other drugs, approval is required. Additionally, the physician assistant can hand a properly labeled prescription drug to a patient under the supervision of a physician. A physician assistant must have advance approval from a supervising physician to administer Schedule II through Schedule V controlled substances, unless they have completed an approved education course on controlled substances. The course must include at least three hours on Schedule II substances, and completion must be verified by the board before the physician assistant can use a registration number. The physician assistant must have advance approval from a supervising physician to administer controlled substances without prior approval for that specific patient. Any drug order issued by a physician assistant must have a reasonable quantitative limitation consistent with customary medical practice in the supervising physician's practice. A written drug order by a physician assistant must include the supervising physician's information, the physician assistant's details, and their signature. For controlled substances, the order must also have the physician assistant's federal controlled substances registration number and comply with specific regulations. The physician assistant must include their details and signature on the drug order, acting on behalf of the supervising physician and surgeon. The supervising physician must review, sign, and date the medical record of patients treated by a physician assistant within seven days for Schedule II controlled substances. Physician assistants with proper controlled substance education must have their medical records reviewed by the supervising physician for patients treated with Schedule II drugs. Verification and documentation of completion are required as per California regulations. Physician assistants with a certificate of completion of a specific course meet the education requirement as per California regulations. Physician assistants authorized to issue drug orders for controlled substances must register with the DEA. The board will consult with the Medical Board of California to assess the impact of exempting certain drug orders from physician review. No reimbursement required by this act as it creates, eliminates, or changes penalties for crimes or infractions, per California Constitution."
