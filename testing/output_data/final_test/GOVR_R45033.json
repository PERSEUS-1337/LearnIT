    "content": "Faced with North Korea's nuclear and missile testing programs and threats against the U.S. and allies, U.S. policymakers consider aggressive negotiation. Past negotiations with North Korea are summarized, highlighting lessons on utility, timing, scope, and goals. Trump Administration officials have differing views on negotiating with North Korea. President Trump has criticized diplomacy with North Korea. In 2017, President Trump criticized negotiations with North Korea, calling it extortion and appeasement. He also dismissed Secretary of State Tillerson's efforts as a waste of time. However, in March 2018, Trump accepted Kim Jong-un's offer for dialogue on denuclearization and normalization of relations. This marked a shift towards diplomacy despite previous criticisms. The United States and South Korea aim to use coordinated global pressure to bring North Korea back to denuclearization talks. President Trump and other Administration officials emphasize the importance of dialogue with North Korea, utilizing maximum pressure through sanctions and military cooperation to encourage Pyongyang to return to dialogue. The United States and South Korea aim to use global pressure to bring North Korea back to denuclearization talks. Senior military officials support diplomacy efforts, hoping for a diplomatic solution to the challenge posed by Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-un's willingness to discuss denuclearization in March 2018 was a notable shift, as North Korea had previously rejected the idea since Kim came to power in 2011. North Korean officials insist on denuclearization talks but demand an end to US \"nuclear threat\" and \"hostile policy\". Despite previous negotiations, North Korea refuses to discuss nuclear disarmament unless US policies change. The goals of North Korea in negotiations with the United States include establishing official relations, securing economic assistance, removing sanctions, downgrading US military presence, signing a peace treaty, and being recognized as a nuclear-weapons state. Congress has tools to influence negotiations with North Korea. Congress plays a significant role in influencing negotiations with North Korea, particularly in providing U.S. energy and humanitarian assistance. They have established levers of influence, such as a Special Envoy on North Korean human rights issues. Past U.S.-DPRK talks have been influenced by Congress, impacting the implementation of agreements. North Korea has engaged in various formal negotiations, including the Agreed Framework, bilateral missile talks, Six-Party Talks, and the Leap Day Deal. These negotiations typically involved North Korea halting its nuclear or missile programs in exchange for economic and diplomatic incentives. Pyongyang joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1985 and allowed inspections of its nuclear facilities by the IAEA. The first nuclear crisis was triggered in the 1980s due to evidence of North Korea's clandestine nuclear weapons development effort. The first nuclear crisis in North Korea began in February 1993 when the IAEA identified suspected nuclear waste storage depots. North Korea refused inspections, leading to negotiations with the US and IAEA. Agreements were made for inspections in exchange for security assurances and energy assistance, but none lasted long. North Korea was estimated to have enough plutonium for one or two bombs. The Clinton Administration's \"coercive diplomacy\" policy involved a credible threat of military force against North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear facility. The crisis was resolved in June 1993 with a deal brokered by former President Jimmy Carter, where North Korea agreed to freeze its plutonium production in exchange for a nuclear power reactor and normalized relations with the US. Talks continued under Kim Jong-il after Kim Il-sung's death in 1994. The nuclear talks in the early 1990s took place amidst worsening geopolitical and economic conditions for North Korea. South Korea's \"Nordpolitik\" under President Roh Tae-woo established relations with Moscow and Beijing in 1990 and 1992. Economic support from the Soviet Union and China declined, leading to hardship and a massive famine in North Korea. The end of the Cold War prompted the US to withdraw its land-based tactical nuclear weapons from overseas bases. These factors pressured North Korea. In the early 1990s, worsening geopolitical and economic conditions in North Korea, including South Korea's \"Nordpolitik\" and declining support from the Soviet Union and China, pressured Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il to seek a new relationship with the West. This led to the 1992 Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the 1994 Agreed Framework with the US, committing North Korea to freeze its plutonium production programs in exchange for assistance. The Agreed Framework of 1994 between North Korea and the United States involved North Korea receiving two nuclear power light-water reactors (LWRs) in exchange for freezing its plutonium production programs. The agreement included IAEA verification tools, permanent monitoring of nuclear facilities, assurances against nuclear threats, and commitments to political and economic normalization. Additionally, the US provided energy assistance and eased sanctions, with 500,000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil (HFO) annually through KEDO. The United States, Japan, and South Korea formed the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) to provide over $400 million in energy assistance to North Korea from 1995 to 2002. U.S. contributions covered fuel oil shipments and KEDO administrative costs, while South Korea and Japan funded most of the LWR construction. Congress required progress in nuclear and missile negotiations before allocating money to KEDO operations, which the Clinton Administration found detrimental to the Agreed Framework. Calls to end assistance arose in Congress after North Korea's first long-range ballistic missile test in August 1998. The Clinton Administration initiated a policy review after North Korea tested a long-range ballistic missile over Japan. The review concluded that the Agreed Framework should be kept in place but supplemented by additional negotiations to end all North Korean nuclear weapons activities and long-range ballistic missile testing. Negotiations with North Korea focused on curbing their missile program and ending missile exports. In September 1999, North Korea agreed to a moratorium on testing long-range missiles in exchange for the partial lifting of U.S. sanctions and bilateral talks. North and South Korea held a summit in June 2000, their first, to improve relations amid North Korea's famine. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Pyongyang in October 2000 to finalize an agreement to end ballistic missile development in exchange for international assistance. In 2000, negotiations between President Bill Clinton and Kim Jong-il for a framework agreement on North Korean satellites fell through due to the disputed 2000 U.S. presidential election results. The Clinton Administration's decision not to make the trip led to a shift in U.S. policy towards North Korea under President George W. Bush. The next two years saw diplomatic efforts and challenges in implementing existing agreements, with some key members of the Administration and Congress opposing the continuation of the Agreed Framework. In June 2001, the Administration announced comprehensive negotiations with North Korea, including lifting U.S. sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, and addressing military posture. President Bush labeled North Korea as part of an \"axis of evil\" in his 2002 State of the Union address. In February 2002, President Bush expressed support for engagement with North Korea and stated no intention of invasion. Talks between the United States and North Korea were postponed after a naval skirmish in June 2002. The parties continued to implement the Agreed Framework, with the first light-water reactor foundation poured in August 2002. North Korea refused IAEA verification and threatened to withdraw. North Korea threatened to pull out of the Agreed Framework if faster progress was not made on reactor construction. Delays in raising funds and concluding contracts prevented the construction of the first LWR by 2003. A Japan-North Korea Summit in September 2002 raised hopes for resolution, and North Korea renewed its commitment to a missile testing moratorium. However, a new crisis began in October 2002. In October 2002, a new crisis arose when the US presented evidence of North Korea's clandestine uranium enrichment program. North Korea confirmed the allegations, nullified the Agreed Framework, and declared its right to possess nuclear weapons. The US, Japan, and South Korea condemned the violation of agreements and declarations regarding denuclearization. North Korea also rejected discussions with the IAEA on the uranium enrichment program. The IAEA and KEDO called on North Korea to clarify reports of a uranium enrichment program and comply with safeguards agreements. KEDO decided to halt fuel oil shipments until North Korea dismantles its highly-enriched uranium program. North Korea accused the US of failing to fulfill obligations. North Korea expelled IAEA inspectors from its Yongbyon nuclear site, withdrew from the NPT, and resumed plutonium production in 2003. The U.S.-DPRK relationship became more hostile, leading to multilateral talks involving China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea, and the United States in 2003. The Six-Party Talks aimed to resolve the crisis and issued a joint statement in 2005 outlining principles for verifiable actions. The Six-Party Talks in 2005 resulted in a joint statement outlining principles for achieving verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, including the concept of \"CVID\" - complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement. The DPRK agreed to abandon all nuclear weapons and programs, with compromises on energy assistance, security guarantees, and diplomatic relations. Follow-up negotiations stalled after the U.S. Treasury Department's actions against Banco Delta Asia in 2005. The U.S. Treasury Department's actions against Banco Delta Asia in 2005 raised money laundering concerns due to suspected counterfeiting. This led to the freezing of North Korean accounts with $25 million in deposits and prompted financial institutions in other countries to close North Korean accounts. The BDA action had a chilling effect on the Six-Party Talks, with North Korea demanding a resolution before making concessions on the nuclear issue. This ultimately led to North Korea testing a nuclear device for the first time on October 9, 2006, causing other members of the talks to seek stronger multilateral sanctions. The United Nations Security Council passed resolution 1718, calling on North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons and imposing international sanctions. The Six-Party Talks resumed in February 2007, with North Korea agreeing to disable nuclear facilities in exchange for fuel oil and removal of US sanctions. China, Japan, and Russia were involved in the negotiations. In 2007, the Six-Party Talks resumed with North Korea agreeing to disable nuclear facilities in exchange for fuel oil and removal of US sanctions. IAEA inspectors monitored the shut-down at Yongbyon until 2009, but verification measures were elusive, leading to tensions and a stalemate in talks. North Korea shifted its focus towards developing its nuclear weapons capability in 2009. In 2009, North Korea shifted towards developing its nuclear weapons capability. Kim Jong-il's declining health coincided with this shift. President Obama's inauguration speech in January 2009 sought to engage dictatorships, but North Korea's rocket launch in April led to UNSC condemnation and North Korea's withdrawal from talks. North Korea conducted a second nuclear test and restarted its plutonium production. In 2009, North Korea resumed plutonium production and conducted a second nuclear test. Subsequently, they built a uranium enrichment plant at Yongbyon. In 2010, North Korea launched attacks on South Korea, sinking a navy corvette and attacking Yeonpyeong Island. The Obama Administration then adopted a strategy of \"strategic patience\" in response. The Obama Administration adopted a strategy of \"strategic patience\" in dealing with North Korea, focusing on coordinating efforts with allies and increasing sanctions on Pyongyang. Secret bilateral discussions were held in 2011 to return to denuclearization negotiations. After Kim Jong-il's death, uncertainty arose regarding Kim Jong-un's willingness to agree to previous terms. North Korea solidified its commitment to nuclear weapons development under Kim Jong-un's leadership, eventually declaring itself a \"nuclear-armed state\" in May 2012. The Obama Administration worked on strengthening international sanctions through the U.N. Security Council and engaged in several rounds of bilateral talks. On February 29, 2012, the United States and North Korea reached an agreement on steps towards denuclearization. North Korea agreed to a missile and nuclear testing moratorium, halting nuclear activities at Yongbyon, and allowing IAEA inspectors back. The U.S. announced plans for nutritional assistance and further talks. The United States and North Korea reached an agreement on steps towards denuclearization in February 2012. However, North Korea's launch of an \"earth observation satellite\" in April 2012 halted the movement towards diplomacy. In March 2018, President Trump agreed to meet with Kim Jong-un, marking the first time a sitting U.S. president would meet with the North Korean leader. As of March 16, Pyongyang has not confirmed the invitation for high-level diplomacy surrounding the PyeongChang Winter Olympics. The United States and South Korea delayed joint military drills to accommodate North Korea's participation, working to ensure compliance with sanctions. Analysts credit the global pressure campaign for influencing Pyongyang's behavior. The outcomes included the resumption of official dialogue and the restoration of an inter-Korean hotline. During the Olympics, North Korea sent high-level delegations, proposing a summit with South Korea. Moon responded by urging Pyongyang to engage in dialogue with the U.S. for further development in inter-Korean relations. The Trump Administration and North Korea expressed willingness to meet, but a planned secret meeting was canceled. Moon called for concessions from both sides. Moon urged concessions from both North Korea and the Trump Administration, with North Korea showing willingness to denuclearize and the US lowering its dialogue threshold. After the Olympics, Moon sent a delegation to North Korea, where Kim Jong-un expressed readiness for open-ended dialogue with the US on denuclearization and normalization of relations. North Korea agreed to freeze nuclear and missile tests during the dialogue. North Korea agrees to freeze nuclear and missile tests during ongoing dialogue. Kim Jong-un expresses eagerness to meet with President Trump. Trump agrees to meet Kim by May, maintaining pressure campaign until North Korea takes concrete action. The White House Press Secretary stated that the Trump-Kim summit would not happen without concrete actions from North Korea. Details about the summit, including timing, location, and agenda, remain unclear. North Korea's definition of \"denuclearization\" and a security guarantee is a key question. Kim Jong-un wants to discuss denuclearization linked to the dissolution of threats and a security guarantee for the DPRK regime. The Trump-Kim summit may involve negotiations on denuclearization, threat elimination, and security guarantees. Pyongyang's improved nuclear capabilities, increased international sanctions, and President Trump's openness to military action are key factors differentiating this round of diplomacy from previous ones. Since 2017, North Korea has been banned. President Trump's talk of a preventive military attack may have influenced North Korea to seek talks and China to support expanded sanctions. However, this could lead South Korea to prioritize engagement with North Korea over Seoul-Washington relations. North Korea has resumed nuclear weapons production and testing since the collapse of the Leap Day Agreement in 2012. Future talks may involve elements of past denuclearization agreements, such as nuclear testing moratoria and international monitoring of nuclear facilities. North Korea is likely to demand more economic incentives or security concessions in negotiations due to its improved nuclear and missile capabilities. There are differing opinions on the value of further negotiations with North Korea, with some anticipating increased receptiveness while others doubt any willingness to accept limits on its nuclear and missile programs. Negotiating with North Korea is debated, with some analysts believing it is necessary for reducing conflict and feasible due to Kim Jong-un's focus on economic development. However, many think North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons voluntarily. Pyongyang seeks a robust deterrent against the US/South Korean attack and uses nuclear weapons for coercion and international prestige. Some believe DPRK aims for international respect and reunification of Korean Peninsula through nuclear capabilities. Kim Jong-un driven by domestic politics to advance nuclear and missile programs. Debate on North Korea's commitment to agreements due to past behavior. Concerns about avoiding scenarios where North Korea pulls out of agreements. Supporters of diplomacy argue that negotiations can still provide security benefits to the United States, reducing the risk of conflict escalation and catastrophic loss of life. A study found a correlation between U.S.-DPRK diplomacy and decreased North Korean provocations, but it did not guarantee a halt in weapons development. North Korea halted weapons development programs, with past agreements resulting in temporary benefits. The Agreed Framework slowed nuclear weapons development by shutting down plutonium facilities at Yongbyon from 1994 to 2002. North Korea abided by a moratorium on long-range missile tests from 1999 to 2006 and disabled some plutonium facilities as part of the Six-Party process. These successes before Kim Jong-un's leadership are cited as reasons to focus on halting North Korea's nuclear and missile testing. The U.S. aims for complete denuclearization through diplomacy with North Korea. The goal of diplomacy with North Korea is the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Some analysts suggest seeking more achievable goals in the short term, such as freezing nuclear and missile programs to halt weapon advancements and lower tensions. Former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry advocates for this approach. Former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry argues for an agreement to halt testing of nuclear explosive devices and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) in North Korea. Others suggest focusing on deterring North Korea from using its weapons and preventing war, while some advocate for accepting a limited North Korean nuclear force to avoid conflict. Confidence-building measures, such as hotlines and transparency measures, are also proposed to reduce the chance of military conflict. Supporters of resuming channels of contact between countries like the United States and North Korea emphasize reducing risks of conflict escalation. Negotiations could cover various contentious issues including North Korea's nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons programs, as well as human rights conditions and steps to normalize relations. Confidence-building measures like increasing transparency of military forces could also help reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The U.S.-DPRK relations involve various aspects such as opening interests sections, signing a peace treaty, addressing detained U.S. citizens, humanitarian assistance, reunification meetings, and search for missing servicemen. A key issue is whether preconditions should be set for negotiations. President Trump's decision to meet with Kim Jong-un was influenced by North Korea agreeing to halt missile tests and discuss denuclearization. This is seen as a result of North Korea valuing a meeting with the U.S. President. The Trump Administration has offered conflicting signals on preconditions for negotiations with North Korea, including the need for Pyongyang to halt threats and nuclear tests. There is uncertainty on whether North Korea must denuclearize before formal talks can begin. The Trump Administration has conflicting signals on preconditions for talks with North Korea. President Trump emphasized the need for denuclearization in a speech, while a senior official mentioned reducing threats and provocations as requirements for negotiations. The question remains whether North Korea must commit to abandoning nuclear weapons entirely. North Korea has rejected dialogue on denuclearization unless other countries drop their preconditions. China and Russia proposed a \"suspension for suspension\" approach, but the US and South Korea rejected it. Adjusting joint military exercises has been suggested, but some view it as rewarding North Korea and doubt its effectiveness. The U.S.-DPRK negotiations have taken various formats over the years, including the Agreed Framework, four-party talks, and the Six-Party Talks. Bilateral negotiations have been embedded into these multilateral structures. The Trump Administration's stance on the multilateral format is unclear, but it has expressed commitment to coordinating with South Korea and Japan. North Korea prefers bilateral negotiations with the United States but has used unofficial channels like the \"New York channel,\" Track 2, and Track 1.5 discussions to explore possibilities for official negotiations. These discussions are often held in third countries, with occasional permission for North Koreans to enter the United States."
