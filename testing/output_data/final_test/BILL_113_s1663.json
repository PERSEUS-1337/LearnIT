It also aims to ensure compliance with the Fifth Amendment guarantee of due process. Congress finds that the Constitution vests legislative powers in Congress, executive power in the President, and judicial power in the Supreme Court and inferior courts established by Congress.

It also restricts the issuance of presidential proclamations, rules, regulations, and conditions on grants or contracts. No new executive actions can be taken without specific authorization.
