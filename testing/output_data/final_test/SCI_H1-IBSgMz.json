    "content": "Self-normalizing discriminative models approximate the normalized probability of a class without computing the partition function, which is beneficial for computationally-intensive neural network classifiers. Neural language models, dealing with millions of classes, have self-normalization properties. Recent studies found that language models trained with Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) exhibit self-normalization, but couldn't explain why. This study provides a theoretical justification by viewing NCE as a low-rank matrix approximation and compares it to an explicit approach for self-normalizing language models. The ability of statistical language models to estimate word probabilities is crucial for NLP tasks. Recurrent Neural Network language models are preferred but face scalability issues due to softmax computation. Various methods have been proposed to address this problem. Various methods have been proposed to address the scalability issues faced by Recurrent Neural Network language models due to softmax computation. These methods include importance sampling, hierarchical softmax, BlackOut, Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE), and self-normalization for predicting normalized probabilities at test time. Self-normalized discriminative models are trained to produce near-normalized scores, allowing for the avoidance of costly exact normalization at test time without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Two main approaches are used: explicit self-normalization, which encourages the softmax normalization term to be close to one during training, and an alternative approach based on Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) where fixing the normalization term to a constant does not impact performance. Recent studies have empirically observed that models trained using Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) with a fixed Z exhibit self-normalization. However, the theoretical analysis by BID0 is the only one explaining this behavior. This study contributes by providing a theoretical justification for NCE's self-normalization property, showing that NCE's unnormalized objective aims to find the best low-rank approximation of the normalized conditional. The study provides a theoretical justification for Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) self-normalization property in language modeling. It explores the self-normalization performance of NCE and an alternative approach over two datasets, revealing a surprising correlation between model perplexities and self-normalization properties. The NCE algorithm is reviewed for language modeling, interpreted as a matrix factorization procedure. Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) is a popular algorithm for training language models efficiently. It transforms the parameter learning problem into a binary classifier training problem by assuming a mixture distribution for word sampling. The approach involves a binary random variable to distinguish noise samples from true samples, with a parametric form for the word distribution. Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) uses Bayes' rule to train a binary classifier for word-context co-occurrences. The normalization term Zc is crucial, but computing it at test time is expensive due to the large vocabulary. The original NCE paper proposed learning the normalization term during training. The NCE algorithm uses Bayes' rule to train a binary classifier for word-context co-occurrences. Setting Zc=1 at train time doesn't affect model performance. An alternative interpretation views NCE as a low-rank matrix approximation, making the normalization factor redundant during training. This self-normalization property was empirically observed in later works. The Pointwise Conditional Entropy (PCE) matrix of a conditional word distribution is defined as pce(w, c) = log p(w|c). The NCE algorithm uses Bayes' rule to train a binary classifier for word-context co-occurrences. The NCE score is a corpus-based approximation of the joint distribution of words and their left side contexts. The NCE score reaches its maximum at the PCE matrix, indicating its effectiveness in modeling word-context relationships. The NCE algorithm uses Bayes' rule to train a binary classifier for word-context co-occurrences, with the NCE score reaching its maximum at the PCE matrix. The function S nce (m) at its maximum point, the PCE matrix, has a concrete interpretation in terms of Kullback-Leibler (KL) and Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergences. The NCE algorithm aims to find the best d-dimensional approximation of the PCE matrix by minimizing the Jensen-Shannon divergence between joint word-context distribution and the product of their marginal distributions. It uses a parametric model to define conditional probability and requires a normalization factor for each context to ensure proper training. In the NCE algorithm, the goal is to find the best low-rank approximation of the PCE matrix without normalization factors. Previous studies have used different values for factor Z, with some finding that setting a specific value can improve training stability and performance. The NCE algorithm aims to find the best low-rank approximation of the PCE matrix without normalization factors. It is not related to distribution normalization. The NCE model defined by the matrix m is approximately self-normalized if m is close to the PCE matrix. The NCE algorithm aims to find the best low-rank approximation of the PCE matrix without normalization factors. It is not related to distribution normalization. The NCE model defined by the matrix m is approximately self-normalized if m is close to the PCE matrix. In our analysis, we show that the NCE training goal is to make the unnormalized score close to the normalized log probability. If the unnormalized score is close to log probability, then the log partition function is close to zero, indicating self-normalization. The NCE algorithm aims to find the best low-rank approximation of the PCE matrix without normalization factors. It is not related to distribution normalization. The standard LM learning method is not self-normalized, while BID4 proposed to encourage self-normalization in training by penalizing deviation from self-normalizing. BID0 suggested an efficient approximation method by eliminating costly computations. The NCE algorithm aims to find a low-rank approximation of the PCE matrix without normalization factors. It is not related to distribution normalization. BID4 proposed self-normalization in training, while BID0 suggested an efficient approximation method by eliminating costly computations. justifies computing Z c only on a subset of the corpus by showing that if a given LM is exactly self-normalized on a dense set of contexts, then E| log Z c | is small. Importance sampling (IS) is an efficient alternative to a full softmax layer closely related to NCE. The IS objective function cancels out the normalization factor Zc, eliminating the need to estimate it in training. Unlike NCE, IS does not result in a self-normalized network, requiring explicit computation of the normalization factor at test time. The study compares self-normalizing NCE-LM with standard softmax LM, showing differences in self-normalization properties and perplexity results. The study compares self-normalizing NCE-LM with standard softmax LM. Models were initialized with output bias terms for self-normalization. Implementation details followed previous work for strong perplexity results. The study evaluates self-normalization in language models using two datasets: PTB and WIKI. Self-normalization is assessed using metrics \u00b5 z and \u03c3 z to determine how well the model normalizes. A model with |\u00b5 z | >> 0 can be corrected. The study evaluates self-normalization in language models using metrics \u00b5 z and \u03c3 z. \u03c3 z is considered more important than \u00b5 z. Perplexity metric is also analyzed for model predictions. Results show NCE-LM is self-normalized with low |\u00b5 z | and \u03c3 z values, while SM-LM is not. The study compares self-normalization and perplexity results of different language models. SM-LM is not self-normalized, while NCE-LM shows self-normalization with low |\u00b5 z | and \u03c3 z values. Perplexity improves with higher model dimensionality, but quality of NCE-LM's self-normalization degrades. Further investigation is needed to understand this behavior. Table 2 compares self-normalization and perplexity performance of DEV-LM for different \u03b1 values on validation sets. Larger \u03b1 values improve self-normalization but worsen perplexity, especially for smaller models. The study also notes that self-normalization degrades with larger model sizes, and proposes a technique to center log(Z) values around zero for test-set evaluation. The shifted NCE-LM and DEV-LM models with d = 650 achieve near perfect \u00b5 z value and nearly identical unnormalized perplexities to real perplexities. Comparing NCE-LM and DEV-LM perplexities shows similar performance. The comparison between NCE-LM and DEV-LM shows near identical performance, with NCE-LM not including the normalization term in its training objective, leading to faster training time. Analysis of the self-normalization properties of NCE-LM reveals a notable advantage in training efficiency. The self-normalization properties of NCE-LM were analyzed by computing the correlation between entropy and normalization term. A regularity was observed where higher log(Zc) values were negatively correlated with entropy, especially in larger models. Low entropy distributions with high log(Zc) values deviated from the self-normalization objective. Examples of such distributions were seen in contexts like \"During the American Civil [War]\" and \"The United [States]\". This observation could impact the model's performance. The regularity observed in larger models shows a correlation between entropy and normalization terms, impacting the model's performance. The empirical investigation on NCE's self-normalization properties suggests potential improvements for self-normalization algorithms in the future. The regularity observed in larger models shows a correlation between entropy and normalization terms, impacting the model's performance. Insights on the function of self-normalized predictions and distribution entropy aim to enhance self-normalizing models in future work."
