    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Improving Care for Vulnerable Older Citizens through Workforce Advancement Act of 2017\". Congress acknowledges that a significant portion of Americans age 65 and older require person-centered, coordinated care due to chronic conditions. Direct-care workers play a crucial role in providing hands-on long-term care and personal assistance to elders and individuals with disabilities or chronic conditions in the United States. Eldercare and disability services positions make up nearly one-third of health care jobs in the US, with over 4 million direct-care workers. The majority of these workers are now in home- and community-based settings, expected to outnumber facility workers by 2 to 1 by 2020. A 2008 report called for new care delivery models to address the aging population. The Institute of Medicine report on nursing recommended full utilization of nurses' education and training, promoting collaborative team-based care models. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act emphasizes improving care coordination and integration to lower costs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act emphasizes lowering costs through better coordination of care and integration of services, especially for individuals with multiple chronic conditions, requiring new care models for long-term services and supports. The Older Americans Act of 1965 is amended to include a demonstration program on care coordination and service delivery. This is in line with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's focus on lowering costs through better care coordination for individuals with multiple chronic conditions. The Assistant Secretary will establish a demonstration program awarding grants to eligible entities for projects focusing on care coordination and service delivery redesign for older individuals with chronic illness or at risk of institutional placement. This includes designing new care models and providing career advancement opportunities for direct-care workers. The demonstration program will include 6 projects focusing on utilizing direct-care workers to promote smooth transitions in care and prevent hospital readmissions. Direct-care workers will be integrated into interdisciplinary care coordination teams to achieve this goal. Two demonstration projects will focus on maintaining and improving the health of individuals with multiple chronic conditions and long-term care needs. Direct-care workers will assist in monitoring health status, ensuring compliance with care, and educating the individuals and family caregivers. Another two projects will train direct-care workers to take on clinical responsibilities for specific diseases like Alzheimer's, dementia, heart failure, and diabetes. Eligible entities include long-term care and rehabilitation facilities. The curr_chunk outlines eligible entities for a healthcare project, including hospitals, labor organizations, community-based aging service providers, and more. Eligible entities for a healthcare project must submit an application detailing care coordination models, objectives for improving care quality, and a coordinated care team approach with an enhanced role for direct-care workers. The demonstration project aims to enhance the role of direct-care workers in healthcare, increasing efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Eligible entities receiving grants will engage in planning activities such as designing project implementation, developing training curricula, and articulating care team plans. The demonstration project grants aim to enhance direct-care workers' role in healthcare by implementing cost-saving plans and evaluating project sustainability. Grants awarded shall not exceed $600,000 and activities must be completed within 1 year. Eligible entities may receive grants for implementation activities related to the project. The entity must meet certain criteria to carry out the project, including successful completion of grant activities, a feasible plan for financial sustainability, a meaningful model for direct-care worker advancement, and training a significant number of workers and serving older individuals. Implementation activities involve training all care team members and evaluating staff competency.
