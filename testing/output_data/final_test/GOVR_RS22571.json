    "content": "H.R. 6 introduced by House Democratic Leadership revises tax and royalty policies for oil and natural gas to fund energy efficiency and renewable energy reserves. It is part of the \"100 hours\" legislative package in the 110th Congress, aiming to reduce subsidies and create revenue streams for clean energy programs. The bill H.R. 6 aims to reduce dependency on foreign oil by investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency. It allows for additional spending on these programs without violating budget enforcement procedures. Section 301 of the bill would use revenue from the Reserve to offset costs of legislation promoting domestic renewable energy, energy-efficient products, and clean energy technologies. The budget adjustment procedure is outlined in Section 301. The bill H.R. 6 aims to reduce dependency on foreign oil by investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency. It allows for additional spending on these programs without violating budget enforcement procedures. The reserve fund procedures in the annual budget resolutions would adjust spending levels to accommodate a spending increase for legislation promoting domestic renewable energy, energy-efficient products, and clean energy technologies. The proposed changes would generate additional revenue from selected tax incentives for oil and natural gas, estimated at $7.7 billion over 10 years, and changes to the royalty system for oil and natural gas, estimated at $6.3 billion. The CBO estimates that the proposed changes in H.R. 6 would generate a total of $14 billion for the Reserve over 10 years. Annual revenue flow would vary from $900 million to $1.8 billion. Opponents argue that reducing oil and gas incentives would harm production and lead to job losses and higher fuel prices. Proponents argue that the incentives are unnecessary due to record profits and that the Reserve could support various R&D and deployment programs. The House passed a bill creating a deficit-neutral reserve fund for energy efficiency and renewable energy. The budget resolution would revise the congressional budget for FY2007, establish the budget for FY2008, and set budgetary levels for FY2009 through FY2012. The Senate resolution would create three reserve funds, including support for oil and natural gas development. The House and Senate passed resolutions creating deficit-neutral reserve funds for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and responsible development of oil and natural gas. The funds aim to support research, development, and deployment of alternative energy sources to reduce reliance on foreign oil. Section 332 and Section 338 create deficit-neutral reserve funds for extending energy tax incentives and manufacturing initiatives supporting alternative fuels, automotive and energy technologies."
