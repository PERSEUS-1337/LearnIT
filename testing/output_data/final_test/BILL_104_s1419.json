    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nigeria Democracy Act\". The Congress finds Nigeria to be a key country in Africa with a large population and significant potential. The relationship between the American and Nigerian people has been historically friendly. Nigeria has faced political instability since gaining independence in 1960, including a civil war in the Biafra region. The nullification of the 1993 presidential election by the military government is noted. General Sani Abacha overthrew the interim government in a military coup in 1993 and announced a three-year transition to democratic elections in 1995. His rule was marked by human rights abuses, economic decline, and corruption. Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others were executed in 1995 despite international pleas for clemency. General Obasanjo, Beko Ransome-Kuti, and General Sheu Musa Yar'Adua have been sentenced to long prison terms in secret tribunals. The United States and other international members have imposed limited sanctions against Nigeria to promote human rights and a transition to civilian government, but with limited impact. General Abacha's military rule undermines confidence in the Nigerian economy, damages relations with the United States, threatens West Africa's stability, and harms the people of Nigeria. The Congress declares that the United States, in collaboration with the international community, should maintain a policy towards the Government of Nigeria to protect human rights, facilitate the transition to civilian government, and promote economic development. Sanctions may be imposed against the Government of Nigeria. The United States imposes measures to promote democracy and human rights in Nigeria, including prohibiting assistance, voting against loans from international financial institutions, prohibiting air transportation, and restricting defense articles and services. The United States imposes restrictions on Nigerian nationals hindering democracy, excluding them from visas and entry. Funds from certain US agencies cannot be used for Nigeria, and US nationals are prohibited from investing in a specific project in Nigeria. The US imposes restrictions on Nigerian nationals hindering democracy, blocking assets and prohibiting investments in Nigeria's energy sector. The US imposes restrictions on Nigeria, including suspending international sports activities and prohibiting air transportation with Nigeria. The President will direct the Secretary of Transportation to stop US air carriers from flying to Nigeria. The Secretary of State will end the air transport agreement between the US and Nigeria. The Secretary of Transportation will ban Nigerian-owned aircraft from flying to the US and prohibit US-owned aircraft from landing in Nigeria. The President will direct measures to stop air transportation between the US and Nigeria, including banning US carriers from flying to Nigeria and Nigerian-owned aircraft from flying to the US. Exceptions apply in cases of national interest or emergencies. Additionally, the President should urge other countries to take similar steps to promote democracy and human rights in Nigeria. The President should actively pursue international sanctions against Nigeria, including an arms embargo, an embargo on oil sales, and condemnation at the United Nations Human Rights Commission. The President may waive sanctions if Nigeria releases all political prisoners. The President may waive sanctions against Nigeria if certain conditions are met, including the release of political prisoners and a commitment to human rights and democratic government. Sanctions can also be waived to support international peacekeeping operations. The sanctions will be lifted when the President certifies to Congress that the conditions have been met and the Nigerian Government is civilian and democratic. SEC. 5. ADDITIONAL MEASURES. The sense of Congress is that the US should impose additional measures against Nigeria if progress towards civilian, democratic government and human rights is not made within three months of this Act. The President must report on Nigeria's progress within three months, and if deemed insufficient, further actions will be taken. The President must report on Nigeria's progress towards civilian, democratic government and human rights within three months. If deemed insufficient, additional measures such as an international oil and arms embargo, unilateral oil embargo, and ban on export of refined petroleum products to Nigeria may be imposed. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"international financial institutions\" refer to various organizations including the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund. The term \"national of the United States\" includes citizens, lawful permanent residents, and certain business entities. The term \"new investment\" refers to a commitment or contribution of funds, loans, or extensions of credit, excluding reinvestment of profits or contributions of money or assets.
