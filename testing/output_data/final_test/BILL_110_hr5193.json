Fifteen individuals were sentenced to death before exoneration, serving an average of 12 years. About 70% of DNA exonerees are from ethnic minority groups. In 35% of cases, the Innocence Project identified the actual perpetrator through DNA testing. Exonerations have occurred in 31 states and the District of Columbia since 1992.

It is dedicated to exonerating wrongfully convicted individuals through DNA testing and reforming the criminal justice system.
