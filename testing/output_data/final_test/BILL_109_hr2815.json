Loan forgiveness for public service employees is addressed in Section 428K of the College Access and Affordability Act. Loan forgiveness is provided for individuals working in public service positions to reduce student debt burdens and attract more talented individuals to public service careers. The Secretary assumes the obligation to repay loans for new borrowers after 1998 who are employed full-time in qualified public service positions. Loan forgiveness is available for individuals in public service positions to alleviate student debt and encourage talented individuals to pursue public service careers. To qualify, individuals must not be in default on a loan and must be employed in qualified public service positions, such as highly qualified teachers in mathematics, science, bilingual, and special education in low-income communities. Loan forgiveness is available for teachers in public or nonprofit schools in low-income areas eligible for assistance under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The school must be determined by the Secretary to have a certain enrollment of children. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 offers loan forgiveness for teachers in low-income schools with a specific enrollment percentage. Additionally, first responders and nurses in low-income communities may also qualify for loan forgiveness. Nurses and child welfare workers in low-income or needy communities may qualify for loan forgiveness if they meet specific employment criteria. The Secretary will repay up to $20,000 of loans for individuals working in public or private child welfare services. Repayment amounts increase over the first five years of service. The loan amount for consolidation loans can be considered qualified only if used to repay specific loans for eligible borrowers. This section does not allow the refunding of certain types of loans. The Secretary will repay the proportionate amount of interest on a loan if a portion is repaid under this section. Student borrowers cannot receive benefits under both this section and the National and Community Service Act. Borrowers cannot receive reductions under both this section and other specified sections. Teachers remain eligible if they meet certain requirements while performing service in a qualifying school. The Secretary will repay the interest on a loan if a portion is repaid under this section. Borrowers who meet requirements while teaching in a qualifying school can continue teaching and be eligible for loan forgiveness. Eligible individuals must submit an application for loan repayment to the Secretary. An eligible individual may apply for loan repayment after completing qualifying service. The Secretary can prescribe necessary regulations, and definitions include 'child welfare services' and 'degree'. An eligible nurse must have graduated from an accredited nursing school, hold a valid nursing license, and possess a graduate degree in nursing. An eligible nurse must have a graduate degree in nursing or an equivalent degree from a collegiate, associate, or diploma school of nursing as defined in the Public Health Service Act. In a low-income community, 70% of households earn less than 85% of the State median household income. The term 'year' refers to an academic year for teachers or nurses in accredited schools."
