The goal is to visualize and understand the decision-making process of the agent, focusing on critical states where specific actions are necessary or where high/low rewards can be achieved. By learning a generative model over the state space of the environment, the method optimizes a target function for the state of interest, providing valuable insights into the system's situational awareness. The method presented aims to generate insightful visualizations for various environments and reinforcement learning methods, including Atari games and autonomous driving simulators. It emphasizes the importance of interpretable decision-making processes for artificial agents, drawing parallels to human capabilities. This approach could be a valuable tool for AI safety applications. In this paper, a novel technique is presented to generate insightful visualizations for pre-trained reinforcement learning agents. The method focuses on understanding and analyzing trained models, particularly in the context of deep reinforcement learning networks. The approach aims to improve the generalization capability of agents by carefully crafting validation sets to encompass potential failure cases. In this work, a generative model of the environment is learned to probe a self-driving agent's behavior in novel states. These states are created through an optimization scheme to induce specific actions in the agent, allowing for observation of critical scenarios and understanding of its shortcomings. The method discussed involves generating states based on user-specified objective functions without impacting the agent's training. It categorizes prior work into visualization techniques for image recognition and reinforcement learning, focusing on visualizing features and neuron activations in CNNs. Saliency methods, image synthesis, and perturbation-based methods are distinguished for understanding decision-relevant regions and input modification. Saliency methods quantify input modification effects on model output using gradients. Various advanced methods like guided backpropagation and GradCAM distinguish regions supporting or opposing predictions. These methods can generate believable saliency maps even for networks with random weights. Perturbation methods modify inputs to analyze model behavior. Perturbation methods analyze image regions' importance by modifying inputs, such as sliding an occluding rectangle or introducing blurring/noise. Input reconstruction techniques involve synthesizing inputs to the agent, like reconstructing images from image patches or inverting CNN representations. Regularization techniques are essential when maximizing the activation of a specific class or neuron in CNNs. Various methods such as total variation, Sobolev gradients, Gaussian filters, and optimization schemes for input clusters are used for regularization. Additionally, CNNs with random weights can also be utilized for regularization. Alternatively, a denoising autoencoder is employed by some to optimize in latent space. In contrast to regularization techniques used in CNNs, BID27 utilizes a denoising autoencoder to reconstruct pre-images for image classification. BID43 and BID25 employ t-SNE embeddings for clustering and visualization in deep reinforcement learning. BID9 explores the impact of the current state on policy using saliency methods, while BID39 visualizes the value and advantage function of their dueling Q-network. Activation maximization methods for visualization have not been previously explored. The typical methods fail in RL networks, generating images outside the valid game states even with regularization. In the next section, the paper introduces notation and definitions for formulating the reinforcement learning problem as a Markov decision process. The goal is to visualize RL agents based on a user-defined objective function without constraints on the agent's optimization process. Visualization is achieved through a generative model over the state space to synthesize states that lead to interesting behavior. The paper introduces a generative model to synthesize states that induce specific agent behavior, different from saliency-based methods. The model is inspired by variational autoencoders and aims to constrain the optimization problem for better results. The paper introduces a generative model inspired by variational autoencoders (VAEs) to synthesize states that induce specific agent behavior. The model consists of an encoder and decoder to map inputs to a Gaussian distribution in latent space and reconstruct the input. Three objectives guide the training of the generator: generating samples close to valid states, inducing correct behavior in the agent, and ensuring efficient state sampling. The loss term Lp(s) minimizes the difference between the reconstruction and input to capture critical details in decision-making tasks like Atari games. The model introduces an attentive loss term to focus on critical regions of reconstruction, computes saliency maps using guided backpropagation, and includes objectives to model agent perception and ensure distribution prediction stays close to Gaussian. After introducing an attentive loss term and computing saliency maps, the model focuses on modeling agent perception and ensuring distribution prediction stays close to Gaussian. The encoder f maintains proximity to a Gaussian distribution, allowing for optimization initialization with a random vector and serving as a regularizer. The generator is used in an optimization scheme to generate state samples meeting a user-defined objective, enabling the agent to interpret and act upon them as if they were real environment states. An energy optimization scheme is formulated to generate samples satisfying a specified objective in the latent space of the generator. The target function T and regularizer R can be defined by the user for the agent being visualized. T can represent the Q-value of a specific action, while R can be the KL divergence between x and a normal distribution. Gradient descent can optimize Equation 4 for x = (\u03c3, \u00b5) to ensure samples drawn from x are close to the Gaussian distribution. Different target functions T can be defined based on the agent, such as action maximization for a DQN. In this section, the method is evaluated on Atari games and a driving simulator using three reinforcement learning algorithms. Qualitative results, flaw detection in agents, loss analysis, and comparisons with previous techniques are presented. In our experiments, we use specific factors to balance loss terms, train the generator on 10,000 frames, and optimize with Adam BID15. The generator has a latent space of 100 dimensions and consists of four encoder stages. Training takes approximately four hours on a Titan Xp, with a batch size of 16 for 2000 epochs. The starting number of filters is 32 and is doubled at every stage, with decoding being inversely symmetric to encoding. The generator used for mean and log-variance prediction in the experiments on Atari games trains a double DQN BID39 for two million steps with a reward discount factor of 0.95. The input size is 84 \u00d7 84 pixels, and the generator performs up-sampling to a 128 \u00d7 128 output, which is then center cropped to 84 \u00d7 84 pixels. The agents are trained on grayscale images, while the generator is trained with color frames and converts to grayscale using a differentiable, weighted sum of the color channels. Visualizations from various Atari games using different target functions are shown in FIG0. The method generates high and low reward situations in Atari games, with critical situations identified by maximizing the difference in estimated Q-values. Visualization results for Seaquest show situations with low oxygen or close proximity to enemies, indicating rewarding but low-scoring outcomes. In Name This Game, critical situations occur near the air refill pipe to prevent suffocation underwater. In Kung Fu Master, the agent's low health makes the order of attack crucial. Visualization techniques are used to show optimal actions, such as moving left to avoid enemies. The visualization method is applied to different RL algorithms like ACKTR. The T \u00b1 objective is presented to visualize states with high and low rewards, like low oxygen or close proximity to enemies. The ACKTR visualizations are similar to DQN in image quality and interpretability, indicating independence from specific RL algorithms. Analyzing Seaquest, low oxygen states are observed when maximizing Q-values, leading to suffocation deaths due to the agent's failure to resurface. The impact of visualization in understanding flaws of the agent is highlighted, with suffocation being a major cause of death. Analyzing the three loss terms of the generative model, guided backpropagation results in precise saliency maps focusing on player and enemies for reconstructions important to the agent. In an experiment evaluating the agent on reconstructions rather than real frames, the agent with generator goggles achieves the same score as the original agent if the reconstructed frames are perfect. Weight visualization shows that the player's submarine and close enemies carry the most weight in decision making, highlighting their importance. The VAE baseline scores lower due to ignoring the small ball in Pong. Our method aims to improve the performance of the agent by addressing the issue of reconstructing meaningful pre-images in reinforcement learning tasks. Despite using various regularization techniques, the pre-image often converges to a fooling example that maximizes the class but is far from the actual environment states. Comparisons with other methods show similar poor pre-image results. The low performance of standard methods for activation maximization can be attributed to the visualization of first layer filters of Atari agents. The Conv1 of a DQN is shown in Figure 5, with observations that Pong only requires five distinct filters due to its focus on moving parts, while a complex game like Seaquest utilizes all available filters. This highlights that the CNN architecture contains enough filters for visually complex games, not needed for simpler environments like Pong. The study explores the challenges of visual complexity in games and the importance of temporal components in certain environments. It questions the existence of a common feature extractor for all games and discusses the impact of poor Conv1 weights on model distraction. Additionally, it introduces a 3D driving simulation environment for training an A2C agent, emphasizing the continuous nature of driving tasks in complex environments. The study discusses the challenges of visual complexity in games and the importance of temporal components in certain environments. It introduces a 3D driving simulation environment for training an A2C agent, highlighting the continuous nature of driving tasks in complex environments. The agent is tested in different pedestrian environments to assess its recognition of critical pedestrian behavior. The study tested an A2C agent in a \"distracted pedestrians\" environment, where it ran over humans. The visualization technique identified biases in the training data by analyzing sampled frames. The generator was evaluated for its ability to generate novel states, showing that most generated states differ from the training data by 25% of the pixels on average. The study evaluated an A2C agent in a distracted pedestrians environment, where it collided with people crossing the road. The generator was tested for its ability to create new states, with 73% of the synthesized samples differing by more than 20% of pixels from their closest training sample. The agent showed awareness of traffic lights and cars but did not understand the severity of hitting pedestrians. The method presented involves synthesizing inputs for deep reinforcement learning agents using generative modeling and user-defined objectives. By training the generator to produce states perceived as real by the agent, it optimizes the latent space to sample relevant states. This approach aims to understand and visualize agent behavior in critical situations to enhance safety and robustness. The study demonstrates that this method can accelerate the detection of problematic situations for trained agents. To showcase diverse results, four random samples generated by the method for a DQN agent trained on Atari benchmark environments will be presented. The study involves synthesizing inputs for deep reinforcement learning agents using generative modeling and user-defined objectives. Visualizations are optimized for meaningful objectives in Atari benchmark environments. The method can generate reasonable images even when the agent fails to learn a meaningful policy. Additional objectives maximizing/minimizing expected rewards are also explored."
