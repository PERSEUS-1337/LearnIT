Congress acknowledges Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s dedication to securing liberty and justice for all citizens, his leadership in the civil rights movement, and his famous \"I Have A Dream\" speech delivered at the March on Washington in 1963. He was a strong advocate of nonviolence. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. advocated nonviolent resistance to end segregation and racial discrimination in America, earning him the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize. Americans should honor his legacy to achieve equality. Efforts are being made to preserve his personal papers for future study at the Library of Congress. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint $1 silver coins weighing 26.73 grams, with a diameter of 1.500 inches, containing 90% silver and 10% copper.
