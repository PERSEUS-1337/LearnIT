Waivers can be granted under certain circumstances. The Buy America Act imposes domestic content restrictions on Department of Transportation funds for transportation projects, requiring steel, iron, and manufactured products to be made in the US. Exemptions can be granted based on public interest, insufficient domestic production, or unreasonable costs. Raw materials can be imported, but manufactured products must undergo manufacturing processes before use in highway projects. Section 313's Buy America Act restrictions apply to manufactured products predominantly made of steel or iron. FHWA regulations clarify requirements for Title 23 projects, including using US-manufactured steel or iron, or applying coatings to meet criteria. The state can enforce Buy America Act restrictions by requiring the use of domestic materials in projects funded under Title 23. This includes standard contract provisions, alternate bid procedures for steel and iron materials, and limitations on the use of foreign materials. The Buy America Act requirements apply to all contracts eligible for assistance under Title 23, regardless of funding source, if at least one contract for the project is funded through Title 23. This provision ensures that Buy America requirements will apply to all contracts within a NEPA document funded through Title 23, even if other contracts are funded through non-federal sources. The FHWA is prohibited from imposing funding restrictions that would prevent a state from imposing stricter requirements on the \"use of articles, materials, and supplies mined, produced, or manufactured in foreign countries in projects carried out with\" Title 23 funds. Waivers to the Buy America requirements have been issued by the FHWA, including a general waiver in 1983 for manufactured products other than steel and iron products. The FHWA issued waivers in 1997 and 2012, stating that products subject to Buy America must be predominantly made of steel or iron, with at least 90% content. Miscellaneous steel or iron components are exempt. The waiver was granted to protect the domestic manufacturing industry, as foreign competition in natural materials was deemed insignificant. The FHWA issued waivers in 1997 and 2012 to protect the domestic manufacturing industry by requiring products subject to Buy America to be predominantly made of steel or iron. A nationwide waiver for certain steel items used in ferryboat construction was issued in 1994 due to insufficient domestic availability. The FHWA granted nationwide waivers for pig iron, processed, pelletized, and reduced iron ore to avoid administrative burden. These materials are not produced in sufficient quantities in the US and are still subject to Buy America. The FHWA issued a Notice and Request for Comment on the need for general waivers to Buy America. A bill in Congress may require a review of nationwide waivers every five years. States can request waivers if materials are not produced in the US in sufficient quantities. The FHWA evaluates requests for waivers of Buy America requirements based on factors like cost and administrative burden. Public notice and comment are required before issuing a waiver, and waivers cannot be granted for foreign products from countries that have violated agreements with the US. Section 50101 of Title 49 of the U.S. Code mandates that funds appropriated for certain FAA projects must use American-made steel and goods. Waivers can be granted if it is in the public interest. The FAA can waive the requirement for American-made steel and goods if it is not in the public interest, if the materials are not available in sufficient quantity or quality, or if using domestic materials will increase project costs by more than 25%. Waivers can also be granted if more than 60% of the cost of components and subcomponents are produced in the United States, and final assembly occurs in the U.S. Nationwide waivers have been issued for certain products from specific manufacturers that often meet the 60% domestic content provision. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) administers funding under Chapter 53 of Title 49 of the U.S. Code for public transportation projects, requiring steel, iron, and manufactured goods used in the project to be produced in the United States. The FTA regulations clarify that steel and iron requirements apply to construction materials used in infrastructure projects, excluding components of other manufactured products or rolling stock. The FTA requires steel, iron, and manufactured goods used in Chapter 53 projects to be made in the United States. All manufacturing processes and components must be of American origin. In Chapter 53 projects, bidders must comply with Buy America provisions, ensuring the use of American-made materials. The FTA allows states to impose stricter requirements but will not participate in contracts governed by non-state Buy America provisions. Waivers for Buy America requirements can be granted if it is in the public interest, with factors considered on a case-by-case basis. The FTA issues waivers from Buy America requirements for specific cases, such as non-availability of materials in the US or cost increase over 25% with domestic materials. No individual applications are needed for general waivers for certain purchases by FTA grantees. The FTA grants waivers from Buy America requirements when there is a cost increase of over 25% with domestic materials or for specific cases like non-availability of materials in the US. Waivers may also be issued for rolling stock if certain conditions are met, such as a majority of components being produced in the US and final assembly occurring in the US. The FTA issues waivers to Buy America requirements for foreign sourced spare parts if they are 10% or less of the project cost. Waiver applications must be published in the Federal Register for public comment. Waivers cannot be granted for goods from countries with waived Buy America requirements that have violated agreements with the US. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 (PRIIA) authorizes appropriations for new grant programs supporting intercity passenger rail and high-speed rail services. Spending under PRIIA is subject to Buy America requirements, mandating that steel, iron, and manufactured goods used in projects must be produced in the US for costs exceeding $100,000. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) intends to implement regulations for these requirements. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) will reference the FTA's regulations for guidance on Buy America requirements until it publishes its own regulations. The FRA will use the FTA's definition of \"produced in the United States\" for manufactured goods, requiring all manufacturing processes to occur in the US with domestic components. States are allowed to impose stricter requirements on the use of materials. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) may issue waivers for Buy America requirements if certain conditions are met, such as insufficient domestic production or increased project costs. Unlike FTA regulations, FRA waivers for rolling stock procurement are not allowed if domestic components exceed 60% of total costs. Waivers must be published in the Federal Register for public notice. The FRA, like the FTA, is restricted from granting waivers for goods made in a foreign country with a Buy America waiver agreement that has been violated. Waivers are only given when clear evidence shows the bidder meets requirements, with the expectation of achieving full domestic manufacturing soon. Amtrak is a for-profit corporation established by statute. Amtrak, as a for-profit corporation, is not restricted by Buy American requirements that apply to direct federal government purchases. However, Amtrak has its own Buy America requirements, where purchases over $1,000,000 must be of articles, material, or supplies mined or produced in the US, or manufactured substantially from US materials. The FRA interprets this to mean that manufactured goods must have a domestic component content. The Buy America requirements for Amtrak mandate that goods must have a domestic component content exceeding 50% by cost, based on the definition of \"domestic end product\" from Buy American regulations. Amtrak may be exempt from certain requirements if it is deemed to be in the public interest, the cost is unreasonable, or the necessary goods are not available in sufficient quantities or of satisfactory quality in the US. Additionally, exemptions may be granted for rolling stock or power train. Amtrak may receive an exemption from Buy America requirements for rolling stock or power train equipment if they cannot be purchased and delivered in the United States within a reasonable time."
