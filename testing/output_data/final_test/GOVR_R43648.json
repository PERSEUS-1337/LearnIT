    "content": "H.R. 3964, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act, introduced on January 29, 2014, passed the House on February 5, 2014. It is similar to H.R. 1837 with some additions. Title I of H.R. 3964 focuses on Central Valley Project Water Reliability, making changes to the management and operation of the federal Central Valley Project. Title I of H.R. 3964 aims to ensure replacement of water for fish and wildlife purposes by the end of 2018 at the lowest cost possible. It also includes changes to fish definitions, broadening the purposes of the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund, reducing revenues into the fund, mandating operation under the Bay-Delta Accord, and developing a plan to increase water yield. Title II focuses on the San Joaquin River Restoration, directing the Secretary to cease implementation of the 2006 Settlement Agreement and declaring the new legislation fulfills obligations to maintain fish below Friant Dam. Title III of H.R. 3964 directs the Secretary of the Interior to convert water service contracts to repayment contracts for water contractors, allowing accelerated repayment of outstanding obligations totaling approximately $1.18 billion for irrigation and $121 million for municipal & industrial purposes in 2012. Title IV of H.R. 3964 provides assurances of water rights protections for those with senior water rights to the Central Valley Project (CVP), including Sacramento River Valley Settlement Contractors. It also establishes a new shortage policy for certain CVP water service contracts north of the Delta to limit reductions in water supplies. Title V asserts Federal supremacy to protect existing water rights in the coordinated operations of the CVP and California State Water Project, without setting precedent in other states. Title V of H.R. 3964 asserts Federal supremacy to protect existing water rights in the coordinated operations of the Central Valley Project (CVP) and California State Water Project. It also declares that the act will not affect the State of California Proclamation of State Emergency issued in 2014. Additionally, it includes adjustments to a Wild and Scenic River boundary, potentially allowing for increased storage at Exchequer Dam. The CVPIA established fish restoration goals, a restoration fund, and made contracting and operational changes. It has been controversial, especially for junior water users whose allocations were limited. Various factors, such as state water quality control requirements and water rights priorities, also impact water deliveries. Title I of H.R. 3964 addresses provisions of the CVPIA opposed by some. Title I of H.R. 3964 addresses provisions of the CVPIA that are opposed by some irrigators, including dedication of project water for fish and wildlife purposes, water transfer limitations, tiered pricing formulas, and restoration charges. The bill aims to add new purposes to the CVP under CVPIA, ensure replacement of water used for fish and wildlife, facilitate water transfers, and narrow the scope and definition of existing CVP purposes. Section 102 of H.R. 3964 aims to narrow the scope of fish stocks protected under CVPIA by changing the definition of \"anadromous fish\" to only include those in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers as of October 30, 1992. This would eliminate coverage for non-native species like striped bass and shad. The section also sets restoration goals at population levels after some species were already listed as endangered, potentially constraining flows for fish and wildlife under CVPIA. Section 103 of H.R. 3964 would remove limitations on new CVP contracts under CVPIA, allowing for contracts to be issued without certain conditions being met. It would also increase the maximum contract term from 25 to 40 years, directing the Secretary to renew contracts successively over a 40-year term. The renewal process may not be subject to negotiation or review, potentially impacting the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Section 103(2) of H.R. 3964 would direct existing long-term repayment of water service contracts to be administered under the Act of July 2, 1956. This act allows for the conversion of water service contracts to repayment contracts and grants contractors who have repaid obligations a \"first right\" to project water for irrigation, subject to state water rights laws. The proposed Section 104 of H.R. 3964 aims to provide long-term certainty for water service contractors in the Central Valley Project (CVP) by basing water rights on beneficial use. It also includes provisions for charging contractors only for water actually delivered and expediting water transfers within the CVP. The proposed Section 104 of H.R. 3964 aims to provide long-term certainty for water service contractors in the Central Valley Project (CVP) by basing water rights on beneficial use and expediting water transfers within 45 days. It would also prohibit environmental or mitigation requirements for transfers and allow for transfers without being subject to certain requirements of the CVPIA. Additionally, it would specify that water use related to the CVP must only be measured by contracting district facilities up to the point where surface water is commingled with other water supplies, and eliminate tiered pricing requirements and revenue streams for fish and wildlife enhancement under the CVPRF. Section 105 of H.R. 3964 aims to address fish, wildlife, and habitat restoration under the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) by making the provision of flows to protect fish optional rather than required. It specifies that \"reasonable water flows\" should be provided from the 800,000 acre feet of water allocated for fish and wildlife purposes, setting a ceiling for these purposes. This section also removes the requirement for consultation with the California Department of. Section 105 of H.R. 3964 removes the requirement for consultation with the California Department of Fish and Game regarding modification of CVP operations for fish and wildlife, replacing it with consultation with the U.S. Geological Survey. It also allows (b)(2) flows to be used for purposes other than fish protection, adjusting accounting for (b)(2) water and directing that it be credited based on a specific methodology. Additionally, it alters provisions related to reductions in deliveries for (b)(2) water under the CVPIA. The proposed changes in H.R. 3964 would mandate a 25% reduction of (b)(2) water when Delta Division water supplies are forecasted to be reduced by 25% or more. This is a departure from the current CVPIA provision where reductions in (b)(2) deliveries are optional and can be up to 25%. Additionally, pursuit of fish and wildlife programs authorized by Section 3406 would be considered meeting the purposes of the CVPIA. Section 106(a) would remove the requirement that not less than 67% of funds be allocated to the Central Valley Project. The CVPIA direction mandates that at least 67% of funds for the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund be used for habitat restoration and related activities. It prohibits requiring donations or payments for storage or conveyance of non-CVP water, surplus water delivery, or water for groundwater recharge. It also removes the requirement for collecting payments to recover mitigation costs and sets a limit of $4 per megawatt hour for payments to the CVPRF by CVP power contractors. Section 106(d) of the CVPIA would establish an advisory board primarily composed of water and power contractors to review and recommend CVPRF expenditures. This board would oversee the completion of fish, wildlife, and habitat mitigation and restoration actions by 2020, leading to a reduction in water and power contractor payments into the CVPRF. Additionally, Section 108(a) directs the operation of the CVP and SWP according to the principles outlined in the 1994 Bay-Delta Accord, including setting maximum restrictions on water usage. The 1994 Bay-Delta Accord set maximum restrictions on water usage, which are now more restrictive than before. The legislation aims to implement the accord without considering the Endangered Species Act or other laws related to the operation of the CVP and SWP. However, it also states that water rights priorities will remain intact. Section 108(b) prohibits any restrictions on valid water rights to protect species affected by the CVP or SWP, as well as any \"public trust value\" by the state of California. Section 108 of the legislation prohibits any agency from restricting water rights to protect public trust values under the state's Public Trust Doctrine. It also preempts state law on catch limits for nonnative fish in the Bay-Delta. Section 107 amends the CVPIA to allow the Secretary to use CVP facilities for beneficial purposes and requires a least-cost plan to increase CVP water supplies by FY2015. Section 107 of the legislation mandates the implementation of an increased water plan to meet CVP purposes, including contractual obligations, starting in October 2015. If the plan fails to increase water supply by 800,000 acre feet by the end of FY2016, certain actions would be suspended. The Secretary is authorized to partner with local authorities for storage projects but federal funds cannot be used for financing or construction. The legislation allows non-federal construction of water facilities but prohibits the use of federal funds. State regulations in California govern fishing of non-native anadromous fish, including size and catch limits. Proposals to relax restrictions on fishing non-native species like striped bass have sparked debate. Supporters argue that these fish harm native species like salmon and Delta smelt, while opponents fear the impact on sport fisheries without limits. Section 114 of H.R. 3964 proposes a pilot program to remove non-native predator fish from the Stanislaus River, including striped bass, smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass. The program aims to quantify fish removal, assess the impact on native species, use methods like electrofishing, and obtain necessary permits. The program would be implemented for seven years. The pilot program proposed in H.R. 3964 aims to remove non-native predator fish from the Stanislaus River using methods like electrofishing. The program, to be managed jointly by the Commissioner and two districts, would be funded entirely by the Districts. Reports on fishery data are to be submitted annually, with a final effectiveness report due at the program's conclusion. Anadromous fish in the Stanislaus River and New Melones Dam would be defined as native stocks of salmon present as of October 30, 1992. The bill H.R. 3964 sets a baseline for native salmon population in the Stanislaus River and excludes the definition of anadromous fish for the New Melones Dam. It includes provisions for hatchery fish in determining anadromous fish under the ESA, potentially reducing ESA restrictions. The bill also expands the CVP service area. Section 110 of H.R. 3964 expands the CVP service area to include a portion of Kettleman City, with a long-term water contract for up to 900 acre-feet. Section 111 allows compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act to suffice for NEPA requirements for CVP projects, potentially speeding up approval processes. Section 112 of H.R. 3964 directs the Secretary to offer a contract for impoundment and storage of water rights in New Melones Reservoir. The Secretary must ensure that such storage will not harm other CVP water contractors and must meet legal obligations related to environmental laws. Minimum storage requirements and a 10-year contract term are also specified. The Act directs the Secretary to offer contracts for impoundment and storage of water rights in New Melones Reservoir, with minimum storage requirements and a 10-year term. Section 115 allows for rescheduling of unused CVP water for storage and use in the following year, with timelines and conditions to ensure it doesn't interfere with CVP operations. Many provisions in Title I of the bill have tradeoffs, such as limiting fish stocks protection and expanding funding for fish and wildlife restoration. These tradeoffs are also seen in controversial sections like directing renewal of existing contracts, which could streamline the regulatory process but may impact fish populations. Section 108 of H.R. 3964 directs the Secretary to operate the CVP and SWP according to principles outlined in the 1994 Bay-Delta. The provisions of H.R. 3964 under Title I raise questions about the impact on CVP water supplies for users and the environment. Key questions include the availability of more water for CVP users, the effect on Delta water quality and fish viability, reservoir releases, water availability for contractors in the Sacramento watershed, viability of listed species, and impacts on water quality. The Bureau of Reclamation's Friant Dam on Central California's San Joaquin River has impacted Chinook salmon populations since the late 1940s. Legal action was taken in 1988 to restore the river for salmon recovery due to water diversion for agriculture. The parties reached a settlement agreement in 2006 to restore fisheries in the San Joaquin River by releasing water from Friant Dam. Legislation was passed in 2010 to implement the agreement, including reintroducing Chinook salmon after 60 years. The settlement agreement in 2006 aimed to restore fisheries in the San Joaquin River by releasing water from Friant Dam for the first time in over 60 years. The controversy surrounding the agreement stems from the reduction of water diversions for off-stream purposes, such as irrigation and hydropower. The quantity of water used for restoration flows and the resulting reduction in water deliveries are related, but not necessarily one-for-one due to factors like flood flows. In the driest years, no water would be released for restoration purposes, thus not affecting deliveries to Friant contractors. Additionally, restoration flows released in late winter and early spring may help minimize reductions in deliveries by freeing up space for additional runoff in Millerton Lake.

In the driest years, no water would be released for restoration purposes, thus not affecting deliveries to Friant contractors. Restoration flows released in late winter and early spring may help minimize reductions in deliveries by freeing up space for additional runoff in Millerton Lake. The impacts of water releases for fisheries restoration versus water diverted for off-stream purposes will affect existing surface and groundwater supplies in and around the Friant Division Service Area. The majority of Friant water contractors, their organizations, and environmental, fisheries, and community groups supported the Settlement Agreement and its implementing legislation, while others opposed it. Title II of H.R. 3964 addresses the ongoing controversy surrounding the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement by discharging obligations to maintain fish populations below Friant Dam. It removes references to the Settlement Agreement and amends the Act's purpose to focus on river restoration. Sections 201-203 provide for the general repeal of certain provisions. Section 201-203 of H.R. 3964 repeal the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act, change the purposes and definitions of P.L. 111-11, and direct the Secretary of the Interior to cease implementation of the Settlement Agreement. Section 204 makes significant changes to the restoration settlement. Section 204 of H.R. 3964 would make significant changes to the San Joaquin River restoration settlement by removing provisions for physical restoration and implementing a new definition for \"Restoration Flows.\" It would require the Secretary to develop a plan to fully recirculate, recapture, reuse, exchange, or transfer all restoration flows within one year. Section 204 of H.R. 3964 would modify the San Joaquin River restoration settlement by focusing on recirculating, reusing, and transferring restoration flows. It aims to replenish water supplies for users and address impacts before implementing modified restoration flows. The section also includes preemption of state laws with more restrictive requirements. The bill includes a qualified preemption of Section 8 of the Reclamation Act of 1902 and preempts any state law imposing more restrictive requirements on authorized activities. It also addresses obligations under California state law and the federal ESA related to fish below Friant Dam. The bill includes provisions to meet state obligations and federal ESA requirements related to fish below Friant Dam. Changes to the implementation of the SJRRSA include allowing CVP contractors to take legal action against the Secretary for non-compliance, setting up a process for filing claims for damages, and altering the authorization of appropriations. These provisions aim to support water users affected by reduced flows. Section 210 of the bill makes changes to repayment contracts and accelerated repayment, removing references to the settlement and updating definitions for \"restoration flows.\" Section 211 repeals implementation issues for Central Valley spring run Chinook salmon. Section 212 alters the Secretary's authority to provide financial assistance for certain water projects. The bill makes changes to repayment contracts and accelerated repayment, updates definitions for \"restoration flows,\" and alters the Secretary's authority to provide financial assistance for water projects related to San Joaquin River restoration. The proposed changes to SJRRSA may impact the Stipulated Settlement Agreement, with some parties opposing Title II of the bill. The bill proposes changes to repayment contracts and accelerated repayment, updates definitions for \"restoration flows,\" and alters the Secretary's authority to provide financial assistance for water projects related to San Joaquin River restoration. Limited information is available on how enactment of the bill would affect ongoing restoration efforts. Reclamation law has historically been based on project repayment by water and power users, with different types of contracts used for the Central Valley Project. Under water service contracts, contractors pay a combined capital repayment and operations and maintenance charge for each acre-foot of water delivered, unlike repayment contracts where the bill is due regardless of water usage. Water service contracts in the Central Valley Project were typically for 40 years but were reduced to a maximum of 25 years in 1992. Reclamation law limits the amount of land that can be irrigated with water from federal reclamation projects. The Reclamation Reform Act raised the original acreage limitation from 160 to 960 acres to promote development in the American West. The 960-acre limit has been a point of contention between large landholders and taxpayer groups, environmentalists, and others opposing federally subsidized water for large farms. Section 301 of the Reclamation Reform Act authorizes the Secretary to convert agricultural and municipal water service contracts to repayment contracts, allowing for accelerated repayment of construction costs. The Reclamation Reform Act allows for the conversion of water contracts for municipal and agricultural purposes to repayment contracts, enabling accelerated repayment of construction costs. Current Central Valley Project (CVP) contract rates are based on a target repayment date of 2030, with outstanding repayment obligations of approximately $1.15 billion for irrigation contracts and $147 million for M&I contracts. Districts interested in prepaying or accelerating repayment would likely need to secure a loan or issue a bond to raise capital for the payment. The federal repayment amount in agricultural contracts is like a no-interest loan for irrigation contracts. Districts considering prepayment would need to weigh the financial costs of new financing with operating and opportunity costs. The proposed Title I of the bill offers added permanency to water contracts, potentially making prepayment more attractive. However, the benefits of using Bureau of Reclamation water on more land and eliminating requirements may not outweigh the financial and administrative costs of new financing. The prepayment of federal irrigation contracts could offer benefits such as eliminating reporting requirements for landowners and reducing administrative costs. Reclamation must comply with state laws, including acquiring water rights for projects like the CVP, leading to contracts with senior water users for water supply guarantees. Title IV of H.R. 3964 aims to protect senior water rights holders, including \"Exchange Contractors\" and wildlife refuges, by limiting reductions to their water supplies based on hydrological conditions. It also includes language to safeguard Sacramento River Settlement Contracts from potential ESA-related reductions. Title IV of H.R. 3964 aims to protect senior water rights holders, including \"Exchange Contractors\" and wildlife refuges, by limiting reductions to their water supplies based on hydrological conditions. It also includes provisions to safeguard Sacramento Valley Settlement Contractors and Sacramento River watershed water service contractors from potential ESA-related reductions. Key provisions include honoring state water rights, adhering to water rights priorities, and placing new limits on water supply reductions. The section provides protections for service contractors, ensuring a minimum delivery of 75% of contracted water supply in dry years for Sacramento River watershed contractors. It also safeguards M&I water contractors from adverse impacts, directing the Secretary to avoid redirected water supply or fiscal impacts within the Sacramento River watershed or State Water Project. The Secretary's operation of the CVP must meet legal obligations imposed by state or federal agencies, including the ESA or H.R. 3964. Title IV protects northern and senior water rights holders but may not provide the same level of protection to Delta water users. The bill may not provide new water to junior contractors beyond what is allowed by environmental restrictions. The bill may not end water supply shortages until new water supplies are developed. It is unclear how some sections of the bill align with preemption language and how it would be implemented in practice. Title V asserts federal supremacy to protect existing water rights. The bill addresses concerns about potential precedent-setting for water rights in other states and reconciles conflicts with emergency authorities granted to the State Water Resources Control Board. The bill allows the SWRCB to modify standards and operational constraints to increase water supplies during emergencies. It also authorizes expedited water transfers, funding for projects, and notifications to water right holders. Additionally, it includes language to adjust a Wild and Scenic River boundary for the Merced River, potentially allowing for increased storage at Exchequer Dam. The bill proposes changes to water management regulations, including modifying standards for emergencies and allowing expedited water transfers. It also includes adjustments to the Wild and Scenic River boundary for the Merced River, potentially increasing storage at Exchequer Dam. Additionally, it addresses disaster assistance eligibility and federal reclamation law implementation. H.R. 3964 aims to address decreased water deliveries to California's CVP and SWP contractors, allowing for greater water deliveries by preempting federal and state laws. It would impact fish-and-wildlife protections and other operational mandates tied to the coordinated operations of the CVP and SWP. The bill also seeks to modify water management regulations and disaster assistance eligibility. Title IV of H.R. 3964 aims to protect California's senior water right holders, particularly in the Sacramento Valley watershed and \"area-of-origin\" areas. The bill's use of the fixed 1994 Bay-Delta Accord as a basis raises concerns about its impact on current water quality standards and biological opinions under the federal ESA. The exact amount of water that would be made available to certain users is unclear, and the bill's potential to relieve water supply shortages is uncertain. The bill aims to relieve water supply shortages in the Delta by potentially altering environmental restrictions, but uncertainties remain about its effectiveness. Factors like state water rights and pumping restrictions may still contribute to delivery curtailments, especially for junior water rights holders. The state water quality control plan in the Delta, known as \"D-1641,\" dictates water delivery timing and quantity south of the Delta. The correlation between Bay-Delta Accord requirements and D-1641 could impact water exports significantly. H.R. 3964's provisions would be in effect beyond the current drought, potentially affecting ongoing plans like the Bay Delta Conservation Plan. The Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP) could be impacted if ESA and state protections in the Bay-Delta are removed as proposed. H.R. 3964 aims to prohibit any state or federal law from reducing water supplies beyond those allowed in the Bay-Delta Accord, declaring federal supremacy over water management. Some argue that the bill may undermine efforts to achieve the co-equal goals of providing for a more reliable water supply. The bill may undermine efforts to achieve the \"co-equal\" goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting the Bay-Delta ecosystem, which is the foundation of state and federal conservation efforts. The legislation's overall approach and potential impact on California's water management regime may spark ongoing debate."
