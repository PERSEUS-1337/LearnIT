    "content": "The ACA and Reconciliation Act of 2010 impose a fee on for-profit health insurers starting in 2014. The fee, collected by the IRS, starts at $8.0 billion in 2014 and increases to $14.3 billion in 2018. Covered entities include health insurance issuers, health maintenance organizations, and entities offering Medicare. Entities subject to the fee imposed by the ACA and Reconciliation Act of 2010 include for-profit health insurers, health maintenance organizations, and entities offering Medicare Advantage or Medicaid managed care plans. Certain types of health insurers or insurance arrangements, such as self-insured plans, voluntary employees' beneficiary associations (VEBAs), governmental entities, and nonprofit entities receiving more than 80% of their funding from government sources, are not subject to the fee. Nonprofit entities incorporated under state law that receive more than 80% of their gross revenues from government programs targeting low-income, elderly, or disabled populations are exempt from the fee imposed by the ACA and Reconciliation Act of 2010. They may not engage in substantial lobbying or political campaign activities. Student health insurance coverage purchased by educational institutions through a separate insurer is also exempt. The ACA fee is based on net health care premiums written by covered issuers, excluding certain types of insurance benefits. This fee applies to health insurance, including limited-scope dental and vision benefits, and retiree health insurance. Exempt entities include nonprofits receiving over 80% of revenue from government programs for low-income populations, as well as student health insurance purchased through educational institutions. The ACA fee is calculated based on net health care premiums written by covered issuers, excluding certain types of insurance benefits. The fee is apportioned among insurers based on their net premiums written and dollar value of business. Covered insurers are not subject to the fee on their first $25 million of net premiums written. The fee is imposed on 50% of net premiums above $25 million and up to $50 million, and 100% of net premiums exceeding $50 million. The ACA fee is calculated based on net health care premiums written by covered issuers. Insurers are not taxed on the first $25 million of premiums, with a tax levied on 50% of premiums between $25 million and $50 million. Certain tax-exempt insurers have differing treatment. The IRS calculates each insurer's annual fee based on their net premiums written as a share of total net premiums written by all covered entities. Insurers must report annual premium data to the IRS by April 15 of the following year. Entities with less than $25 million in net premiums written are not subject to the fee but still need to submit premium information. The IRS determines net premiums written based on annual reports and other available sources. Insurers report this information on Form 8963. The IRS notifies each insurer of their preliminary fee allocation and net premiums written for health insurance. Insurers must review and correct any errors in IRS fee calculations for U.S. health insurance premiums. The IRS provides preliminary fee calculations by June 15, with insurers having until July 15 to submit corrections. Final fee determinations are issued by August 31, which may differ from the preliminary fee due to error corrections or additional information. Insurers must pay the final fee by September 30 each year, with penalties for late filing or inaccurate information. Insurer information submitted on Forms 8963 is not confidential and may be inspected publicly. Penalty waivers are possible with reasonable cause for late reporting. The penalty for inaccurate reporting of net premiums written under the ACA is calculated based on the difference between the actual fee and the fee imposed due to faulty reporting. Insurers cannot deduct the ACA premium fee from their annual taxes as it is considered an excise tax by the IRS. States have been imposing premium taxes on insurance products for years, with insurers potentially passing on the ACA tax to consumers through higher premiums. Government programs like Medicare and Medicaid consider insurers' tax payments when setting reimbursement levels. The ACA insurer fee may lead to slightly higher premiums for consumers. Repealing Section 9010 of the ACA could reduce premium prices by 2% to 2.5% for insurance plans. The Joint Committee expects a 2% to 2.5% reduction in insurance plan premiums due to the ACA insurer fee. Some insurance companies have estimated the fee's impact, with Blue Shield of California forecasting a 2.3% increase and Kaiser Permanente predicting a 0.65% increase in premiums. Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey estimates a $125 million cost increase in 2014 due to the tax. The tax will increase costs by $125 million in 2014, leading to higher premiums. A study by Milliman estimated premium increases of 1.7% to 2.9% in following years. Nonprofit insurers may have a competitive advantage due to lower fees. Estimating the impact on the insurance industry and government programs like Medicare and Medicaid is complex due to limited data. The NAIC collects premium data for uniform financial reporting. The NAIC collects premium data on direct premiums earned and written, rather than on net premiums written. The ACA defines net premiums written as gross premiums from insurance sales, minus certain deductions. The NAIC will start collecting data on net premiums written in the future. Companies are required to provide information to the IRS under the ACA. Existing NAIC data offer some guidance on the breakdown of insurance fees. In 2012, for-profit health insurers in the United States wrote about $295 billion in direct premiums. Medicare and Medicaid accounted for a significant portion of this total. The impact of the premium fee on Medicare and Medicaid programs is a key question, as the fee does not apply to direct government programs. However, private insurers contracted by the federal government offer Medicare Advantage and Part D plans, as well as state-federal Medicaid managed care plans. Private for-profit insurers are subject to the ACA premium fee on their Medicare and Medicaid business. They served 71% of Medicare Advantage enrollees in 2011, while not-for-profit insurers accounted for about 29%. About 74% of Medicaid beneficiaries were in managed care plans in 2011. More than half of Medicaid managed care enrollees are enrolled in managed care organizations on a risk-payment basis. The ACA premium tax will impact rates for managed care plans, potentially increasing costs for states and insurers. Government regulations may limit how much of the fee can be passed on to Medicare beneficiaries. Insurers' ability to pass on the fee will be restricted, affecting the distribution of costs between insurers and federal/state governments. The distribution of the fee will also depend on how many states expand their Medicaid programs. Under a nationwide full Medicaid expansion scenario, the Medicaid portion of the fee would increase by about 12%, with corresponding reductions to the share paid by commercial plans and Medicare. Concerns exist about the potential impact of the ACA premium tax on insurers, businesses, and consumers, as part of a broader series of taxes and fees aimed at expanding insurance coverage and controlling healthcare spending. Federal subsidies will help offset higher premiums for some consumers. The ACA health exchanges, established by January 1, 2014, provide access to private insurers' health plans meeting federal standards. Individuals and small businesses purchasing through exchanges may qualify for federal subsidies and tax credits, softening the impact of ACA insurer tax. CBO estimates 22 million will purchase coverage through exchanges by 2016, with 87% receiving subsidies. Small employers may be eligible for an ACA tax credit if they contribute at least 50% towards employees' health insurance. The ACA requires small businesses to contribute at least 50% towards employees' health insurance. For-profit employers can receive a maximum credit of 50% of their contribution, while nonprofit organizations can receive up to 35%. The small business tax credit is available for two consecutive tax years. The ACA also mandates increased regulation and oversight of insurance costs, with the federal government providing grants to states to review insurance rates and requiring health insurance companies to justify any unreasonable rate increases. Legislation has been introduced to repeal the ACA fee on health insurance providers. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to repeal the ACA fee on health insurance providers and require fuller consumer reporting. Bills include H.R. 763, S. 603, H.R. 1558, and S. 24 to repeal the annual fee on health insurance providers. Additionally, H.R. 1205 and S. 764 aim to require health plans to disclose ACA-imposed taxes and fees in their annual summaries. Debate continues on possible changes to the ACA insurer regulations. There is debate over changes to the ACA insurer premium fee, with concerns raised by state governors about increased costs for fully capitated Medicaid managed care plans. Federal regulations require premiums to be \"actuarially sound,\" but cost-sharing limitations in Medicaid may prevent fees from being passed on to enrollees. If premium rates rise, states and the federal government, which jointly fund Medicaid, could end up paying more to operate the program. The Republican Governors Association has requested Congress to exempt Medicaid and CHIP from the insurer premium fee. The Republican Governors Association has asked Congress to exempt Medicaid and CHIP managed care plans from the insurance tax. Some analysts believe states can negotiate with insurers to control premium costs, potentially avoiding passing on the full impact of the fee. The Association of American Medical Colleges suggests using a portion of the premium tax to support U.S. graduate medical education. Concerns exist about the healthcare workforce's size, specialty mix, and geographic distribution, with forecasts of a physician shortage exacerbated by millions of newly insured consumers under the ACA. Large healthcare providers plan to recoup excise taxes through fees or increased insurance premiums. Large healthcare providers aim to offset excise taxes by imposing fees or raising insurance premiums on enrollees. This could result in consumers bearing the economic impact of the taxes. Insurers are concerned about being \"double-taxed\" due to ACA fees and excise taxes, as well as income earned from additional fees and higher premiums. They have requested that these extra costs be excluded from gross income calculations for tax purposes. Insurers are concerned about being \"double-taxed\" due to ACA fees and excise taxes. They argue that the fees should be seen as a \"recovery\" for past taxes paid. The IRS has requested comments on this issue, as excluding these costs could benefit health insurers and reduce expected revenue from the ACA fee."
