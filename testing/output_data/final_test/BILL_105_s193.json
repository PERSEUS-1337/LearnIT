    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Human Research Subject Protections Act of 1997\". The Act \"Human Research Subject Protections Act of 1997\" emphasizes the importance of protecting human subjects in research. It references the Constitution and the Nuremberg code, highlighting the need for voluntary consent and competent, informed consent from human subjects in research. Regulations were published in 1974 by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to govern the protection of human subjects in research. In 1991, regulations were expanded to apply to research sponsored by 16 additional Federal agencies. Congress enacted Public Laws in 1974 and 1983 to establish ethical advisory bodies for human research subjects. Recommendations from these bodies have influenced Federal regulations. In 1995, the President's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments identified deficiencies in the protection of human subjects, particularly in flawed consent forms. They recommended a Federal policy mandating informed consent for all subjects of classified research, without exemptions or waivers. Additionally, subjects should be informed of the sponsoring Federal agency and the involvement of classified information. Some Federal agencies do not follow the Common Rule for research involving human subjects. Private entities not receiving Federal funding or FDA approval are exempt. Research institutions with Federal sponsorship may choose to apply the Common Rule voluntarily. The Act does not explicitly require informed consent and independent review for research involving human subjects. The regulation of these activities is necessary to prevent burdens on commerce and protect the rights of human research subjects. The Act aims to apply common rule protections to all human subject research and enforce criminal sanctions for violations. The Act aims to establish criminal sanctions for violations, prohibit federal support for unreviewed classified research, address regulatory conflicts, and create an Office for Protection of Research Subjects within the Department of Health and Human Services.

TITLE I--GENERAL RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS\n\nSEC. 101. APPLICATION OF COMMON RULE REQUIREMENTS AND PROTECTIONS.\n\n    (a) Requirements and protections under part 46 of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, apply to research using human subjects.\n    (b) This Act supersedes any conflicting provisions in part 46 of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nSEC. 102. OFFICE FOR PROTECTION OF RESEARCH SUBJECTS. The Secretary must establish the \"Office for Protection of Human Research Subjects\" within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Office may be reassigned from the Office for Protection from Research Risks to carry out duties under the Act. Funding must be ensured for the Office's activities. To conduct research using human subjects, a research facility must have a valid registration with the Secretary and meet specified requirements, including principles for protecting subjects' rights and welfare, designating responsible officials, and establishing review boards. The applicant research facility must assure compliance with board membership, functions, research review, approval, suspension, record maintenance, and obtaining informed consent from human subjects, children, and parents as per common rule protections. The registration of a research facility is valid for a 3-year period, but may be suspended or revoked by the Secretary. A facility can be deemed compliant if it has a valid assurance with the Department of Health and Human Services. Failure to register or have an assurance in effect prohibits a facility from conducting activities covered by the Act. SEC. 104. INSPECTION AND INVESTIGATION. The Secretary may conduct inspections or investigations to determine if a research facility is violating the Act. Access to facilities and records must be provided to the Secretary for this purpose. Penalties for violations are outlined in Chapter 90 of Title 18, United States Code. The Human Research Subject Protections Act of 1997 imposes penalties for forcibly assaulting, resisting, or impeding individuals engaged in official duties under the Act. Using a deadly weapon during such acts incurs harsher penalties. Homicide of an individual carrying out duties under the Act results in fines or imprisonment as per specified sections. SEC. 105. ENFORCEMENT. The Secretary can suspend the registration of a research facility for up to 30 days if there is a violation of the Act. Penalties for employees knowingly violating the Act include a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment for up to 3 years. Violation of the Act can result in referral to the Department of Justice for prosecution. The Secretary has the authority to create necessary regulations for implementing the Act. Federal funds cannot be used for classified research without informed consent or exemption from review by a board. In addition to common rule protections, human subjects in classified research with Federal funding must be informed of the funding agency, the classified nature of the research, and an unclassified description of the research purpose."
