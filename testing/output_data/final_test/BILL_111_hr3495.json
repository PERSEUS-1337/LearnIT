The Congress finds that the Medicare home health benefit is at risk of agency cherry-picking profitable beneficiaries, which hinders access to care for complex patients. The Government Accountability Office has noted challenges in placing eligible patients in home health due to their extensive care needs. Proposals to reduce Medicare payments may harm mission-driven and non-profit agencies with low margins. Proposals to reduce Medicare payments may harm mission-driven and non-profit agencies with low margins. SEC. 3. SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS FOR PEACH AGENCIES. A fund called the \"PEACH fund\" will be established to provide supplemental payments to home health agencies meeting specific criteria under title XVIII of the Social Security Act. The fund's sources of funding, administration, and allowed uses will be specified. Additionally, a new section for supplemental payments for peach agencies will be inserted after section 1895 of the Social Security Act. The Secretary designates home health agencies as PEACH agencies if they meet specific criteria, including offering a complete range of services on a 24/7 basis. The home health agency must provide services to all eligible beneficiaries, offer charity care equal to or greater than 1% of total revenue, and allow the Secretary to verify their eligibility annually for the PEACH program. The Secretary will make supplemental payments to PEACH agencies based on information submitted in the Medicare cost report. Home health agencies must report necessary information for designation and payment as a PEACH agency. The first year as a PEACH agency will receive a supplemental payment. The PEACH agency's payment is determined by its shortfall, which includes the cost of home health services delivered under parts A and B, actual costs of home health and community-based services, and payments received for these services. The PEACH agency receives supplemental payments based on the aggregate cost of uncompensated home health services delivered, paid within 90 days of the annual cost report submission. In subsequent years, interim payments are made based on cost reports intervals and estimated shortfalls. The PEACH fund, capped at $500,000,000 annually, is administered by the Secretary for supplemental payments to PEACH agencies based on estimated shortfalls. If the fund is insufficient, payments are made in proportion to each agency's shortfall relative to the aggregate shortfall of all agencies. The PEACH fund, capped at $500,000,000 annually, is administered by the Secretary for supplemental payments to PEACH agencies based on estimated shortfalls. The Secretary shall make a preliminary supplemental payment to each agency within 90 days of receiving its annual cost report, followed by an additional payment if funds remain after all cost reports are received. Definitions for 'charity care' and 'uncompensated care' are provided in this section. The Social Security Act is amended to include provisions for services provided by a home health agency to individuals who cannot afford to pay for them. The Secretary will issue regulations for implementing the Act. $500,000,000 is authorized for appropriation each fiscal year starting in 2010 for the Act's purposes."
