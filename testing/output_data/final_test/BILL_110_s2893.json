    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ludlow Massacre National Historic Landmark Act\". The 1913-1914 Colorado coal strike was a violent labor conflict with miners protesting for higher wages, enforcement of laws, and union recognition. Striking miners lived in tent colonies, like Ludlow, where a battle with the National Guard resulted in multiple deaths, including women and children. The Ludlow Massacre of April 20, 1914, involved 2 women and 11 children trapped in a shelter engulfed in flames during a strike. President Woodrow Wilson sent the United States Army to the strike zone in response to the violence. The United Mine Workers of America ended the strike on December 10, 1914. The events stirred national outrage, leading to protests and investigations by Congress and the U.S. Commission on Industrial Relations. After the massacre, the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company took actions, including launching a major public relations campaign. The Ludlow Massacre of 1914 led to historical and archaeological inquiries, including a book by George McGovern and Herbert Guttridge. The United Mine Workers of America has maintained the Ludlow Massacre Memorial since 1918 and holds an annual memorial service. The Ludlow Massacre Memorial holds an annual service to honor those who died in the strike. The Ludlow Tent Colony Site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its national significance, importance as a memorial site, and archaeological resources. SEC. 3.
