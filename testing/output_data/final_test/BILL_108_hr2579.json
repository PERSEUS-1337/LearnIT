    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States Agricultural Products Market Access Act of 2003\". It includes findings and purposes. Congress finds that the export of agricultural products is crucial for the US economy, with agriculture contributing positively to the trade balance. Increasing agricultural exports will boost farm income, support family farms, and benefit rural communities. The denial of fair market access for US agricultural products hinders export potential, leading to a $4.7 billion annual loss. This Act aims to address unfair trade practices and promote open trade. The Act aims to remove constraints on fair and open trade in agricultural products, ensure equitable market access for US exports, and promote free trade in agricultural products. SEC. 183 of the Trade Act of 1974 identifies countries that deny market access for agricultural products. The Trade Act of 1974, in section 183, requires the United States Trade Representative to identify foreign countries that restrict market access for U.S. agricultural products based on unfair practices or unjustified standards. The Trade Representative must also prioritize countries that pose significant barriers to agricultural trade. The Trade Act of 1974 mandates the Trade Representative to identify priority foreign countries based on unfair market access practices for U.S. agricultural products. Criteria include egregious acts denying fair access, adverse impact on U.S. products, and lack of progress in negotiations. The Trade Representative must identify priority foreign countries based on unfair market access practices for U.S. agricultural products, considering progress in negotiations and consulting with relevant government officials and stakeholders. The Trade Representative identifies foreign countries based on unfair market access practices for U.S. agricultural products, considering historical trade relations and factual basis for violations of international law or agreements. The Trade Representative can revoke or identify foreign countries as priority foreign countries based on unfair market access practices for U.S. agricultural products. The Trade Representative must provide detailed explanations for revocations and identify priority foreign countries in semiannual reports to Congress. Denial of fair market access is defined as violating international agreements or creating discriminatory trade barriers. The Trade Representative is required to publish this information. The Trade Representative must publish a list of identified foreign countries and provide annual reports to Congress on actions taken to achieve fair market access for US agricultural products. The Trade Act of 1974's table of contents is amended to include a new section after section 182. The Trade Act of 1974 is amended to include a new section on identifying countries that restrict market access for agricultural products.
