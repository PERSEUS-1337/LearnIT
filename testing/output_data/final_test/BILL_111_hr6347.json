    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Holocaust Accountability and Corporate Responsibility Act of 2010\". It includes findings related to the Holocaust. The Congress acknowledges substantial Federal funding for high-speed rail projects in the United States, with additional funding expected in the future. Various entities will be responsible for the design, construction, and operation of the rail lines through competitive bidding processes at the State level. High-speed rail is recognized for its economic, environmental, and travel time benefits. Entities competing for high-speed rail grants must adhere to human rights and ethical standards. Some have engaged in questionable conduct, including profiting from deporting thousands to death camps during World War II. During World War II, certain companies profited from deporting victims to extermination camps like Auschwitz and Buchenwald. Victims and their families, now residing in the United States, have yet to receive justice. However, they face the possibility of their tax dollars going to a company involved in transporting them to these camps for profit. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"direct involvement\" refers to owning or operating trains used to deport individuals to extermination camps from January 1, 1942, to December 31, 1944. An \"entity\" includes corporations, affiliates, or entities that certify direct involvement and are under common control with other entities. The term \"property\" refers to personal belongings owned or controlled by victims of deportations, including jewelry and books, that may have been taken or confiscated. This definition applies regardless of whether any equity interest in the entity is owned by a foreign state. The term \"records\" includes various documents related to deportations, such as correspondence, receipts, and audits. The term \"State\" refers to different regions within the United States. SEC. 4. CERTAIN ENTITIES INELIGIBLE FOR FEDERALLY FUNDED HIGH-SPEED RAIL CONTRACTS. Entities applying for federally funded high-speed rail contracts must certify if they were involved in deporting individuals to extermination camps during 1942-1944. If involved, they must disclose this information to the relevant state or local agency. Entities must disclose to state or local agencies whether they have records or property related to deportations, providing detailed descriptions and locations if applicable. Entities must disclose details of how they disposed of property related to deportations and whether they have provided restitution to victims or reached settlement agreements. Entities involved in deportations can provide mitigating circumstances but will be ineligible if they had direct involvement. Entities involved in deportations must disclose property disposal details and restitution efforts. Those with direct involvement are ineligible for high-speed rail project contracts without making restitutions or settlements."
