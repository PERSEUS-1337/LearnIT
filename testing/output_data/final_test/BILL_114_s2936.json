    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stop Subsidizing Childhood Obesity Act\". Congress acknowledges the alarming increase in childhood obesity rates over the past 30 years, with over 1/3 of children and adolescents in the US now overweight or obese. Studies predict that adult obesity rates could surpass 60% in some states by 2030 if current trends continue. Poor eating habits and lack of physical activity in youth are setting the stage for lifelong health issues. Children and youth are not meeting basic nutritional goals, consuming excess calories, added sugars, and high levels of sodium, total fat, and saturated fats. Food marketing to children amounts to $2 billion annually, with companies using various channels like television, internet, and product placement to promote unhealthy foods. Studies show that television food advertising influences children's food choices, diets, and health, leading to concerns about the marketing of high-calorie foods to this demographic. Marketing of high-calorie foods to children and adolescents is a major contributor to childhood obesity. Over 80% of food advertisements seen by children on TV are for nutritionally poor foods. Studies suggest that eliminating tax deductions for advertising unhealthy foods to children could reduce childhood obesity rates by 5-7% and save up to $260 million in healthcare costs while preventing 130,000 cases of obesity over 10 years. The section denies deductions for advertising targeting children to promote unhealthy food consumption. No deduction allowed for advertising targeting children to promote unhealthy food consumption, including travel expenses and entertainment expenses. The Secretary will contract the National Academy of Medicine to develop procedures for evaluating and identifying poor nutritional quality foods and associated brands. A report outlining the proposed procedures must be submitted within 12 months. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as 'brand' (used to identify goods or services), 'child' (an individual aged 14 or under), and 'food' (including beverages, candy, and chewing gum). The Secretary is required to promulgate regulations within 18 months, based on a report from the National Academy of Medicine, to carry out the purposes of this section. The curr_chunk provides regulations defining terms such as 'marketing', 'directed at children', 'food of poor nutritional quality', and 'brand primarily associated with food of poor nutritional quality' for the purposes of this section. Section 280I denies deductions for advertising targeting children to promote unhealthy food. Effective 24 months after enactment, this applies to expenses incurred. Additionally, Section 4 allocates more funding for the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. The Secretary of the Treasury will transfer additional funding to the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program annually, equal to the revenue increase from the amendments made by the Act."
