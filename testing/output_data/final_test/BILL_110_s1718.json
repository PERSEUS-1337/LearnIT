    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Veterans Education Tuition Support Act\" or the \"VETS Act\". Congress finds that the defense of the United States is of utmost importance, with over 1.3 million Armed Forces members serving in Iraq or Afghanistan since 2003. This includes National Guard and Reserve members who have been called to active duty, sacrificing their personal lives and education. In 2005, 500,000 veterans claimed education benefits, with 47,000 being National Guard or Reserve members returning from service in Iraq or Afghanistan. Many Armed Forces members rely on financial aid and Montgomery GI Bill benefits for college. The 6 percent interest rate cap on debts for active duty members is not applied to Federal student loans. Returning deployed members are forced to start repaying private student loans soon after returning. Members of the Armed Forces face challenges transitioning from combat to the classroom, including bureaucracy when reenrolling in education programs. Studies show that symptoms of PTSD may take up to a year to appear. Colleges are not required to accommodate students called to active duty, leading to difficulties with tuition reimbursement and reenrollment requirements. Members of the Armed Forces need a full academic year to reintegrate into society before repaying student loans. The Act aims to assist them in transitioning to civilian life, reenrolling in education programs, and capping student loan interest rates at 6 percent.

The effective date for these changes is after the enactment of this section."
