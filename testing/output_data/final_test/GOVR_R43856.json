    "content": "Congressional involvement in museum siting in DC began in the early 19th century with petitions to build museums in the capital. The federal government has supported museum creation since the 1840s, with the Patent Office Building displaying art collections. The Smithsonian Institution was founded in 1846 after James Smithson bequeathed his fortune to the United States for the increase and diffusion of knowledge. It has since grown to 20 museums in Washington, DC, and New York City. The Smithsonian was created by Congress to consolidate various objects belonging to the United States in Washington. Congress has used this model to establish other museums, including those within the Smithsonian Institution and independently operated ones like the National Gallery of Art. Congressional authorization is required for most federally operated museums. Legislation was introduced in the 113th Congress to authorize the National Museum of the American Latino and study the potential creation of a National Women's History Museum. The National Museum of the American Latino and the National Women's History Museum have been proposed for establishment in Washington, D.C. The Commission to Study the Potential Creation of a National Women's History Museum was established in 2014 to determine if the museum should be authorized, funded, and included as part of the Smithsonian Institution. Congressional action is needed for the creation of federally operated museums. The report examines common methods of establishing museums in the District of Columbia, including creation of a museum study commission, donation acceptance, and direct authorization through law. Issues for congressional consideration in new museum creation are discussed, such as subject matter, funding, location, and management. The potential role of current laws, like the Commemorative Works Act, in guiding the placement of museums on and around the National Mall is also highlighted. Private museums are not within Congress's purview, while federal museums are generally created by statute and may receive appropriations. Federal museums in the District of Columbia are typically created by statute and fall into two categories: Smithsonian and non-Smithsonian museums. Congress can establish federal museums through recommendations from advisory commissions, accepting donations, or direct authorization. Commissions created by the President or Congress have studied the potential creation of new museums, often through executive orders. For example, President Jimmy Carter established the President's Commission on the Holocaust in 1978. The President's Commission on the Holocaust was established in 1978 to make recommendations for a memorial. Since 2001, Congress has authorized commissions for new museums, such as the National Museum of African American History and Culture Plan for Action Presidential Commission and the Commission to Study the Potential Creation of a National Museum of the American Latino. Both commissions were tasked with recommending plans for the establishment and maintenance of their respective museums in Washington, D.C. The American Latino Museum Commission was created to recommend the establishment of a National Museum of the American Latino in Washington, D.C. Donations of art or artifacts can lead to the creation of new museums, such as Joseph H. Hirshhorn's donation of his modern art collection to the Smithsonian in 1966. In 1966, Joseph H. Hirshhorn donated his modern art collection to the Smithsonian, leading to the creation of the Joseph H. Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. Similarly, in 1937, the National Gallery of Art was established following Andrew W. Mellon's donation of artwork and the construction of the west building. The National Air Museum was authorized by Congress to memorialize the national development of aviation and collect aeronautical equipment of historical significance. General of the Army Henry H. Arnold advocated for its creation within the Smithsonian. The National Air Museum was authorized by Congress to expand Smithsonian aviation collections and operate as a bureau within the Smithsonian. Congress provided specific guidelines for the museum's operation, including the composition of a board to oversee it. Additionally, Congress has authorized the creation of four new museums in the District of Columbia since 1980. Congress has authorized the creation of several new museums in the District of Columbia, including the Law Enforcement Museum, the National Museum of the American Indian, and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Legislation has also been introduced for the National Museum of the American Latino. When considering a new museum, Congress must evaluate factors such as subject matter, management, location, funding, and the role of the Commemorative Works Act. For example, when authorizing the National Museum of the American Indian, Congress considered the impact on existing museums with similar collections. The National Museum of the American Indian and the African American Museum Commission were tasked with considering the impact of new museums on existing collections. The commission recommended developing complementary collections to local museums and promoting a reciprocal exchange of ideas. Evaluating a proposed museum's subject matter and impact on existing museums is crucial for its success and integration into the museum landscape. The African American Museum Commission conducted a survey on the establishment of a national museum in Washington, DC, with 87.5% supporting it and 12.5% expressing concerns about competition in attendance, collections, or funding. This information could be valuable for Congress to avoid duplication of museum collections or diversion of resources. Establishing a new museum could face challenges related to management and operations, with potential recommendations for placement within the Smithsonian Institution or another federal agency. The Smithsonian Institution, with its extensive experience in museum operations and collections management, could provide valuable services for a new museum. The Smithsonian Institution has vast experience in museum operations and collections management, making it an ideal body for inclusion of new museums. However, adding more museums could increase administrative burdens and require additional resources. Lawrence M. Small, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, praised Congress for structuring the National Museum of African American History and Culture similarly to other Smithsonian museums. The Smithsonian Institution praised Congress for structuring the museum like other Smithsonian museums. They appreciate the work done to address raised issues. Concerns were raised about adding new museums that do not conform to the institution's current structure. If a new museum is created, it could be placed within an existing non-Smithsonian federal entity. The Department of State in Washington, DC has a museum policy for managing collections. Some sponsors want new museums independent of federal agencies like the Smithsonian. The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and National Gallery of Art operate independently. The National Law Enforcement Museum was authorized during the 106th Congress to operate independently from the Smithsonian Institution, allowing for control over exhibits and fundraising without restrictions. This independence would also enable direct control over operations through a board of directors and staff appointments, although starting from scratch for operations and administration would be a challenge. An independent museum's authorization statute would likely need to provide explicit fundraising and gift acceptance provisions, authority to hire an executive director and staff, and restrictions on borrowing items from the Smithsonian collections. The location of a museum within the District of Columbia is a significant decision, with many preferring a location on or near the National Mall, subject to restrictions by available land and governing laws. Options for designating site locations for future museums include direct designation or providing choices for site location by Congress. Congress could designate specific site locations for museums or provide choices for site location. Past museum statutes have designated site locations for the National Museum of the American Indian and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Advisory commissions have been asked to study potential museum locations on or near the National Mall. Congress could designate specific site locations for museums or provide choices for site location. Statutorily designating a site location for future museums may exclude expertise from advisory commissions, such as the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts. This could inadvertently disregard past work done by these bodies for the siting of new projects. Alternatively, providing a choice of sites for Congress to consider might be more practical. Congress could create a process to locate museums within the District of Columbia, allowing expert agencies to guide the site selection process before Congress approves a site location. This process could mirror the one used for selecting sites for memorials in the District of Columbia. A process could be established for siting museums in Washington, DC, similar to the guidelines used for memorials. This would allow city planners to recommend locations to Congress for approval, potentially reducing individual Members' influence over site selection. Federal museums in DC have historically been funded through appropriations, but recent statutes have specified design funding. Recent museum authorization statutes now require design and construction costs to be split between federal and nonfederal sources, ensuring equal cost sharing. This funding approach, such as the Smithsonian's Legacy Fund, incentivizes donors to contribute to projects. The Legacy Fund incentivizes donors to contribute to museum projects by providing federal funds as an incentive. Relying heavily on private donations can be risky if donors are not willing to provide continued funding. Congress has previously authorized appropriations for construction and operations of museums. The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum received federal appropriations for 56% of its budget in FY2012, with the rest raised from nonfederal sources. Future museum authorizations may need to consider providing appropriations, as relying solely on private donations could make it difficult to cover costs. For example, the proposed National Women's History Museum is estimated to cost $300 million for design and construction alone. The Commemorative Works Act (CWA) guides the creation of memorials in DC, but no museum has been created under its terms. Past statutes suggest that museums are barred on NPS or GSA lands in DC. The National Museum of African American History and Culture was exempted from the Commemorative Works Act (CWA), allowing museums on NPS- or GSA-administered land in DC. Congress could standardize the museum creation process by applying the CWA, setting guidelines for placement, and clarifying third-party roles. Congress has the authority to exempt future museums in DC from the Commemorative Works Act, allowing for more flexibility in their location. Approval from oversight agencies like the National Capital Planning Commission and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts would still be required. This process has been historically varied, with Congress often accepting donations for new museum projects. Recent practices suggest that Congress has often accepted donations or recommendations from advisory commissions to create new museums in DC. The use of commissions to provide recommendations on museum creation has been prevalent over the last 30 years, offering valuable information to Congress for decision-making. Museums can provide Congress with valuable information through advisory commissions, which are subject matter experts in the proposed museum's subject and management. Congress can use commission reports to make decisions on funding, location, and operations of new museums. The process for evaluating new museum proposals may not need a standard procedure due to the limited number of proposals in each Congress."
