This section will expire on September 30, 1999. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in the chapter. The Secretary must implement the program under section 1705 of title 38, United States Code by October 1, 1996. The amendment to section 1729 of title 38, United States Code allows for expenses related to establishing new outpatient clinics and increasing outpatient visits for eligible veterans. Additionally, a reserve fund is created for these purposes. A reserve fund is set aside annually with specific amounts allocated, and funds can only be used up to the available unobligated amounts. The reserve amount on December 1, 1995, is calculated based on the unobligated balance in the Fund, minus expenses, exceeding $579,282,000. On December 1, 1996, the reserve fund amount is calculated based on the unobligated balance in the Fund, minus expenses, exceeding $640,918,000. On December 1, 1997, the reserve fund amount is calculated based on the unobligated balance in the Fund, minus expenses, exceeding $731,334,000. On December 1, 1998, a new reserve amount will be set aside. On December 1, 1998, the reserve fund amount is determined by subtracting the unobligated balance in the Fund on September 30, 1998, from $758,321,000. On December 1, 1999, the reserve fund amount is calculated similarly, using the unobligated balance on September 30, 1999, and $372,435,000. The Secretary shall deposit the unobligated balance of the Fund into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts annually by January 1, minus necessary expenses. Regulations will be prescribed for allocating reserve amounts to incentivize recoveries and collections, with up to 25% available for this purpose. The regulations allow for up to 25 percent of recovered funds to be directly allocated to medical centers with above-average recoveries, while the rest is distributed based on a plan targeting areas with the greatest need for outpatient care. The Under Secretary for Health conducts an annual study to assess capacity needs for outpatient care. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress on medical care cost recovery, including details on the plan, regulations, allocations, and actions taken the previous fiscal year."
