    "content": "An automatic annual Social Security benefit increase is triggered by the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), reflecting the cost of living. The increase is based on the growth in the index from the previous year to the current year. If the CPI-W triggers a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), it becomes effective in December and payable in January of the following year. This mechanism was first adopted in 1972, with COLAs first payable in 1975. The Social Security Administration announced a 2.8% COLA for January 2019 based on CPI-W data. Since 1975, automatic COLAs have been paid annually, except for 2010, 2011, and 2016. COLAs are triggered if the current year's CPI-W is higher than past years. The average CPI-W for the third quarter of the current year determines if a COLA will be paid. If it is higher than the highest average CPI-W for the cost-of-living computation quarter, a COLA is triggered. If not, no COLA is payable. For example, in 2009, the average CPI-W was lower than in 2008, so no COLA was paid in 2010. The CPI-W for the third quarter of 2010 was higher than in 2009 but not as high as in 2008, leading to no COLA in January 2011. A COLA was triggered in 2012 when the CPI-W for the third quarter of 2011 exceeded that of 2008. New cost-of-living computation quarters were established from 2012 to 2014. No COLA was paid in January 2016 as the CPI-W for the third quarter of 2015 did not surpass that of 2014. This led to a COLA payable in January 2017 based on the cost-of-living computation benchmark quarter. The cost-of-living computation benchmark quarter for the COLA payable in January 2017 remained the third quarter of 2014, compared with the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2016. If the CPI-W does not trigger a COLA, benefits stay the same, impacting Medicare Part B enrollees with premium withholdings from Social Security benefits. The hold-harmless provision ensures their net benefits will not decrease. The hold-harmless provision in the Social Security Act ensures that Medicare Part B enrollees' net benefits will not decrease due to an increase in the Part B premium. In years with no Social Security COLA increase and a Part B premium increase, more beneficiaries are protected by this provision. For example, in 2016 and 2017, 70% of beneficiaries were held harmless. However, in 2018, with a higher COLA, only 28% were affected. The Medicare trustees project a $1.50 increase in 2019 Medicare Part B premiums, potentially affecting those held harmless in 2018. Social Security COLA may not cover the full premium increase, leading to a return to paying the standard premium amount in 2019. Actual premiums could vary from projections. Beneficiaries may see a net reduction in Social Security benefits due to increases in Medicare Part D premiums or plan changes. Other programs like Supplemental Security Income and railroad retirement benefits are adjusted based on Social Security COLAs. Veterans' pension benefits may also increase in line with Social Security, but require annual legislation. COLAs under the Civil Service Retirement System and federal programs are also impacted. The COLA for recipients of Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) benefits equals the Social Security COLA if inflation is 2% or less, but is lower than the Social Security COLA otherwise. Some Social Security program elements are indexed to wages and increase only when a COLA is payable. Changes to these elements are based on growth in national average wages and can be increased only when a COLA is payable. The taxable earnings base, RET exempt amounts, and SGA for the blind remained unchanged in 2010, 2011, and 2016 when no COLA was payable. If a COLA is triggered, these amounts increase based on the national average wage index. For example, the taxable earnings base would have increased from $118,500 in 2015 to $122,700 in 2016 if a COLA was triggered. The increase in the taxable earnings base is calculated based on the average wage index growth. Table 3 shows the history of Social Security COLAs since 1975. Before automatic COLAs began in 1975, ad-hoc legislative cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security benefits were granted at irregular intervals. The first increase occurred in October 1950, with a 77% raise in benefits. Smaller increases followed through separate legislation. In 1974, a 7% increase was paid from April to June, followed by an 11% increase from July onwards. The authorization for automatic benefit increases starting in 1975 was part of P.L. 92-336."
