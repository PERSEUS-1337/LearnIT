During the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key witnessed the British bombardment of Fort McHenry and was inspired to write \"The Defence of Fort McHenry\" after seeing the American flag still flying proudly. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson popularly renamed the anthem The Star-Spangled Banner and ordered it to be played at military and naval occasions. In 1931, President Herbert Hoover officially designated it as the National Anthem of the United States. The coin specifications are outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint $1 silver coins in commemoration of the bicentennial of the Star-Spangled Banner. The coins will weigh 26.73 grams, have a diameter of 1.500 inches, and contain 90% silver and 10% copper. These coins will be legal tender.
