    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Biofuels Energy Independence Act of 2001\". The Congress acknowledges the strategic vulnerability of the United States due to its heavy reliance on imported petroleum. The Act aims to reduce this dependence by shifting towards alternative, renewable, domestic agricultural sources to achieve a trade balance in energy supply. The United States currently imports a significant amount of vehicle fuels and heating oil, leading to a trade deficit. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve should focus on encouraging domestic production to reduce reliance on imports. The Reserve currently holds 545 million barrels of fuel, but none of it is biobased. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve holds 545 million barrels of fuel, with 92.2 percent purchased from foreign sources. A proposal suggests exchanging some reserves for ethanol and biodiesel to diversify energy sources and enhance energy security. Biofuels offer a solution to reduce reliance on foreign energy sources and enhance energy security. With agricultural surpluses and record high petroleum prices, utilizing domestic biobased oils can immediately address the nation's energy needs. In the short term, biofuels can meet at least one-fifth of the current US fuel demand using existing technologies. Biofuels can help reduce reliance on foreign energy sources and enhance economic security by replacing imported oil with domestically produced renewable biofuels. Increasing cultivation, research, and technology can further boost biofuel production to meet a significant portion of the current US fuel demand. Increased use of renewable biofuels can bring economic benefits to rural and urban areas, reduce the trade deficit, and increase income for farmers. For example, a sustained market of 100,000,000 gallons of biodiesel could result in $170,000,000 in increased income for farmers. Farmer-owned biofuels production has already shown improved income for farmers, such as in Minnesota where corn prices have increased by $1.00 per bushel. The use of grain-based ethanol and biomass ethanol significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional gasoline. Ethanol-blended gasoline has reduced smog-forming emissions by 25% since 1990. Ethanol also decreases tailpipe carbon monoxide emissions by up to 30% and exhaust volatile organic compounds emissions by 12%. Ethanol and biodiesel offer significant environmental benefits. Ethanol reduces toxic and particulate emissions, while biodiesel eliminates sulfur and aromatics linked to air pollution. Biodiesel also reduces CO2 emissions by 78.5% compared to petroleum diesel and decreases unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter when used in conventional engines. The Biofuels Feedstocks Energy Reserve Program, established by the Secretary of Agriculture, aims to provide feedstocks for biofuels production and support the industry during feedstock shortages or price increases. The Secretary can purchase agricultural commodities at commercial rates to establish, maintain, or enhance the Biofuels Feedstocks Energy Reserve when there is abundant supply and a need for carryover stocks. The purchased commodities must be sufficient for at least 1 year's utilization for renewable energy purposes and additional quantities to incentivize research and development of new renewable fuels and bio-energy initiatives. Whenever the market price of a commodity in the Biofuels Feedstocks Energy Reserve exceeds the cost of production by 100%, the Secretary will release stocks at acquisition cost. Storage payments are also addressed. The Secretary will provide storage payments to producers for agricultural commodities purchased for the Biofuels Feedstocks Energy Reserve. Payments will be determined to encourage producer participation and reflect local storage rates. The terms and conditions of storage payments for each crop will be announced at specific times. The Secretary will announce specific dates for storing feed grains and other commodities in the Biofuels Feedstocks Energy Reserve. The announcement will include the maximum quantity of commodities allowed for storage to promote orderly marketing and ensure an adequate supply for biofuels production. The Secretary may also relocate stored commodities in commercial warehouses with owner consent for public interest reasons. The Secretary may permit rotation of stocks and ensure quality maintenance for stored commodities. They can buy and sell equivalent quantities in different locations to handle, distribute, and locate the commodities owned or controlled by the Commodity Credit Corporation. Purchases to offset sales must be made within 2 market days. The Secretary will make a daily list available showing the price, location, and quantity of transactions for purchases to offset sales within 2 market days. Standards for quality of commodities stored in the Biofuels Feedstocks Energy Reserve will be reviewed, with a focus on maintaining quality through inspection, maintenance, and stock rotation requirements. SEC. 105. USE OF COMMODITY CREDIT CORPORATION. The Secretary will utilize the Commodity Credit Corporation to implement this title, using trade channels efficiently. SEC. 106. REGULATIONS. Within 60 days, the Secretary will issue necessary regulations. TITLE II--BIOFUELS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. SEC. 201. LOANS AND LOAN GUARANTEES. The Secretary of Agriculture may make and guarantee loans for biofuels production, distribution, development, and storage. Eligible applicants include farmers, farm cooperatives, municipalities, nonprofits, states, and territories unable to secure credit elsewhere. Loan guarantee eligibility precludes loan eligibility for applicants residing in the community for loans with prevailing rates and terms. Interest rates are based on US obligations, with a repayment period of 5 to 20 years. The Secretary will establish a revolving fund. The Secretary will establish a revolving fund for making loans and deposits received will be used for loans and loan guarantees. The Secretary may prescribe regulations, and there are limitations on appropriations for the cost of loans and guarantees. The Secretary will establish a revolving fund for making loans and deposits received will be used for loans and loan guarantees. Appropriations will be made to the revolving fund for fiscal years 2002 through 2009."
