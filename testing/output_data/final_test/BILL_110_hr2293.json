Congress found that on October 15, 2003, a convoy of US diplomatic vehicles was attacked by Palestinian terrorists in Gaza, resulting in the deaths of John Branchizio, Mark Parson, and John Marin Linde, who were providing security for a visit to identify Palestinian scholarship candidates. Palestinian Authority officials were aware of the terrorists' identities. Following her visit to Israel and the West Bank in February 2005, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced that President Abbas assured her of the Palestinian Authority's commitment to bring justice for the murders of three American personnel in Gaza in 2003. The United States Rewards for Justice program is offering a $5,000,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the killings of John Branchizio, Mark Parson, and John Marin Linde, who have yet to be brought to justice by Palestinian terrorists. The Palestinian Authority's failure to bring Mark Parson and John Marin Linde's killers to justice raises concerns about their suitability as a partner for the US in resolving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Future US assistance may be suspended if the Palestinian Authority does not cooperate in prosecuting the terrorists. The US emphasizes the importance of cooperating to bring Palestinian terrorists to justice for killing American diplomats. The Secretary of State must provide regular reports on efforts to prosecute the perpetrators. The Palestinian Authority's efforts to bring to justice the terrorists who killed American diplomats are being assessed, including the number of arrests, interrogations, and cooperation with the United States. The Secretary of State must assess the Palestinian Authority's efforts in bringing the terrorists who killed American diplomats to justice. The certification requirement will be lifted if the terrorists are identified, arrested, and brought to justice. The appropriate congressional committees will be informed of these developments. The House and Senate committees on Foreign Affairs and Appropriations must be informed of the Palestinian Authority's efforts to bring terrorists who killed American diplomats to justice. The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 16, 2007."
