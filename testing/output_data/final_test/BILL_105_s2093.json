    "content": "The text chunk discusses an amendment to the Higher Education Act of 1965 regarding Class Size Demonstration Grants. The purpose is to provide grants to State educational agencies to study the benefits of reducing class size on student performance and classroom management. The Secretary will award grants to State educational agencies for demonstration projects to reduce class size, with a 50% Federal share. Up to 5% of funds may be reserved for other activities. Grants will be based on the need and ability of agencies to reduce class size in elementary schools. The Secretary will prioritize demonstration projects that involve reducing class size in elementary and secondary schools, based on the ability of State educational agencies to provide non-Federal share of costs, sustain the project after Federal funding ends, and demonstrate consultation with parents, teachers, and school administrators in program design. The Secretary will prioritize demonstration projects involving at-risk students in early grades, including economically disadvantaged, disabled, and limited English proficient students. State educational agencies must use federal funds to supplement, not replace, other available funds for the purpose of the subpart. SEC. 563 outlines the requirements for annual competition in demonstration projects, including factors like class size reduction, education level, instructional strategy, and project duration. Projects must use randomized techniques or comparison groups. SEC. 564 details the application process. To receive a grant under this subpart, a State educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary with specified information. The Secretary encourages agencies to apply for a 5-year period and the application must include objectives for grant funds, steps to reduce class size, and plans for acquiring teaching personnel and classroom space. The State educational agency must provide details on acquiring teaching personnel and classroom space, data collection methods for evaluating class size reduction programs, assurance of non-Federal funding, and additional assurances as required by the Secretary. Grants will only be awarded to projects of sufficient size and scope to fulfill the purpose of the subpart. \"SEC. 565. EVALUATION AND DISSEMINATION.\" The Secretary will conduct a national evaluation of class size reduction projects to assess costs and effects on student performance, attendance, discipline, and teacher satisfaction. States receiving grants must cooperate and provide necessary information. Results will be reported to Congress and widely disseminated. Authorization of appropriations for research and development activities related to aircraft performance by NASA requires $15,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 and the following 4 years. The Administrator must receive full payment from the private sector for conducting such activities."
