    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Exchange Information Disclosure Act\" and requires weekly reports on health benefit exchanges. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is amended to require weekly reports on consumer interactions with the Internet website. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act now mandates weekly reports on consumer interactions with the Federal Government's health insurance website, including website visits and web chat numbers by State. The weekly reports on consumer interactions with the Federal Government's health insurance website include data on web chat logins, account creations, enrollment in health plans or Medicaid, zip code distribution of enrollees, coverage levels, and website functionality issues and resolutions. The curr_chunk provides details on problems with the website, including issues with logging in, enrolling in coverage, transferring to State Medicaid programs, and calculating premium tax credits. It also mentions the identity of contractors involved, costs, payment methods, and names of Federal officials overseeing the process. The curr_chunk outlines key aspects related to eligibility for health plans, tax credits, income verification, information transfer to insurers, and consumer privacy. It requires weekly reporting until March 31, 2015, after the enactment of the Act. The curr_chunk requires reporting on the federally operated customer service call center, including call volume, website issues, referrals to oversight centers and state commissioners, and enrollment numbers in qualified health plans. The curr_chunk discusses the disclosure of navigators and certified application counselors, including making a list of them available to Congress, State attorneys general, State insurance commissioners, and the public. It also requires the Secretary to update this list weekly. The Secretary must disclose a list of certified agents and brokers trained by the Federal Exchange on a weekly basis until March 31, 2015, on the healthcare.gov website."
