    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Skin Cancer Prevention, Education, and Consumer Right-To-Know Act\". The Congress finds that skin cancer is a growing epidemic in the United States, with over 1,000,000 new cases diagnosed annually and about 10,000 Americans dying each year from the disease. Melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer, has tripled among Caucasians since 1980. One in 5 Americans and one in 3 Caucasians will develop skin cancer in their lifetime, with the risk doubling for those who have had 5 or more sunburns. Over 90 percent of skin cancers are caused by sun exposure, yet less than 33 percent of people use sun protection. Prolonged exposure to UVA and UVB radiation from the sun is the main cause of skin cancer. The current United States sunscreen standards set by the FDA only protect against UVB radiation, the main cause of sunburn and skin cancer. This leaves Americans vulnerable to UVA radiation, which penetrates the skin more deeply and causes premature aging and skin cancer. This false sense of security may lead people to stay in the sun longer, increasing their risk of skin damage and cancer. The FDA is amending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to include a broad-spectrum sunscreen standard in response to the current lack of protection against UVA radiation in sunscreen products. The FDA is implementing a standard for broad-spectrum protection in sunscreen products to enhance protection against skin cancer and premature aging. This standard includes specific labeling requirements and the adoption of a recognizable symbol for compliant products. The standard also mandates a minimum ratio of 1 to 3 for UVA protection. The FDA standard for broad-spectrum protection in sunscreen products includes a minimum ratio of 1 to 3 for UVA protection, a critical wavelength of 370 nanometers, a minimum level of UVB protection of SPF 6, and truth in labeling requirements. Claims of broad-spectrum protection can only be made if the product meets these requirements. The FDA standard for broad-spectrum protection in sunscreen products requires specific UVA and UVB protection levels, critical wavelength, and truth in labeling. Protection levels must be measured using standardized testing methods, with a preference for in vitro testing. The Secretary must issue final regulations by December 31, 2007, for sunscreen product compliance. The FDA standard for broad-spectrum protection in sunscreen products includes definitions for broad-spectrum protection, sun protection factor, and UVA protection factor. Broad-spectrum protection refers to protection from both UVA and UVB radiation, while the sun protection factor indicates how long a person can stay in the sun without burning. The UVA protection factor measures the minimum UVA radiation dose needed to induce pigment darkening on protected skin. The FDA standard for broad-spectrum protection in sunscreen products includes definitions for UVA and UVB radiation. UVA radiation ranges from 320 to 400 nanometers, while UVB radiation ranges from 290 to 320 nanometers. The requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regarding sunscreen protection will take effect either on a date determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or one year after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 4. EDUCATION. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will implement a nationwide education campaign on the risks of sun exposure without broad-spectrum sunscreen. The campaign aims to increase public knowledge on skin cancer causes, risks of unprotected sun exposure, UVA and UVB radiation roles, sunscreen application, and broad-spectrum protection standards. The education campaign under this section will last for at least one year."
