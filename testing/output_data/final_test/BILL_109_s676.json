    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Graduation Really Achieves Dreams Act\" or the \"GRAD Act\". Congress finds that the national secondary school graduation rate is only 70 percent, with lower rates for African-American and Latino students. In high poverty urban districts, only about 1/3 of students graduate. In rural areas, only 58.8 percent of students attend higher education institutions. Approximately 3,000 students drop out of school daily, and Alaska Natives have a high dropout rate. Alaska Natives have a significantly higher dropout rate compared to other students in Alaska, with 8.8 percent dropping out. Students in the lowest 25 percent for achievement scores are 3.5 times more likely to drop out than those in the next quarter. About 25 percent of secondary students read below basic levels, with minority and low-income 9th graders performing at a 5th or 6th grade level in reading. During the 2002-2003 school year Alaska Benchmark Examinations, lower percentages of Alaska Natives were proficient in reading, writing, and math compared to other students. Achievement gaps persist into secondary school, with lower percentages of Alaska Natives proficient in subjects tested on the Alaska High School Graduation Qualifying Examination. Achievement gaps also exist across racial and socioeconomic lines in rural schools, with a high child poverty rate in some areas. Recruiting and retaining good teachers is a significant challenge. Recruiting and retaining good teachers in rural areas is challenging due to lower salaries, poor working conditions, and geographic isolation. Low graduation and college attendance rates indicate that schools are not meeting the needs of low-income, minority, and rural students. Many college students lack basic skills, with a high percentage needing remedial courses. A small percentage of low-income students who enter college struggle to complete a degree, with only 27% from the bottom 20% income bracket finishing within 8 years. Graduation rates impact early drop-out rates in the military, with attrition rates higher for non-secondary school graduates and GED recipients. This has led to the Armed Forces no longer accepting dropouts and valuing alternative certificates less. (15) Failing to graduate from secondary school increases the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity. Increasing graduation rates by 1 percent could save $1.4 billion in incarceration costs. (16) 80% of adults with bachelor's degrees are employed, compared to 60% of secondary school graduates and 40% of dropouts. (17) Job growth for bachelor's degree holders is projected to be 25%, compared to 9% for those with only a secondary school degree by 2008. Personalization of the school environment has been shown to boost success rates for low-performing secondary school students, with many feeling disengaged from school. Effective education programs that enhance graduation rates start early and cover all grades from kindergarten to grade 12. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as \"at-risk,\" \"feeder pattern,\" \"elementary school,\" \"secondary school,\" and \"Secretary.\" SEC. 4. PROJECT GRAD. The Act aims to support programs improving graduation and college rates for at-risk students and provide grants to Project GRAD USA for implementing integrated education reform services. Project GRAD programs are expanded to new sites through a grant agreement that requires the grantee to enter into subcontracts with nonprofit educational organizations serving at-risk students. The grantee must implement various programs and provide matching funds, as well as build the capacity of subcontractors. Activities to enhance subcontractors' management capacity, expand programs, implement new Project GRAD sites, and raise public awareness for education reform services to benefit at-risk students. The subcontractor programs referred to in this section shall be known as \"Project GRAD programs\" and each subcontractor must implement a Project GRAD program with feeder patterns of public schools. Grant funds can be used to pay subcontractors and cover costs associated with improving graduation and college attendance rates for at-risk students. The Project GRAD program aims to improve graduation and college attendance rates for at-risk students in public schools. It includes research-based programs in reading, math, and classroom management, campus-based social services, and a college access program offering scholarships and support for students meeting criteria. The grantee must use funds for services to increase graduation and college attendance rates, with a limit of 8% for administration costs. Matching requirements are also specified for the grantee. The grantee must provide $200 per pupil to subcontractors in the Project GRAD program, taking into account resources and student outcomes. Subcontractors must match the funds received. The grantee may provide matching funds in cash or in kind, with waiver authority for subcontractors who demonstrate need. The grantee can also decrease their share based on subcontractor resources. Evaluation by an independent entity is required every 3 years. An independent entity must evaluate the performance of students in Project GRAD programs every 3 years. The evaluation should use strong research methods and compare student achievements with those who do not participate in the program. The grantee must ensure subcontractors provide detailed reports on Project GRAD program results, including student achievement data, graduation rates, college attendance, and financial reporting as required by the Secretary for program effectiveness evaluation. The grantee, in consultation with the Secretary, will determine the content of evaluations for Project GRAD programs. Copies of evaluations must be provided to the Secretary, Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, House Committee on Education and the Workforce. Authorization of appropriations for this Act includes $27,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 and necessary sums for the following 5 years."
