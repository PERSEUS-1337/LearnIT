Evacuation involves moving people out of danger, providing temporary resettlement and resources, and eventually returning them to their homes. Timing evacuations is crucial to avoid disasters during the process, but evacuations can also pose hazards. Evacuations can be hazardous, with more deaths occurring during Hurricane Rita evacuation than the actual hurricane. Special-needs individuals may require more time to prepare and travel, leading to the suggestion of \"shelter in place.\" Congressional concern has increased due to the 2005 New Orleans evacuation, prompting changes in federal policy. Federal policy defers to states for evacuation laws and officials may suggest or require evacuations using state and local authority. The federal government facilitates evacuations through federal statutes, such as the Robert T. Stafford Disaster and Relief Emergency Assistance Act, which allows the President to direct the Secretary of Defense to use resources for emergency work. This can occur before a disaster declaration to assist with precautionary evacuations. The federal government can provide transportation assistance for evacuees to return to their predisaster residences or alternative locations, as authorized by the Post Katrina Act. This expands the government's role to not only assist in evacuations but also in returning disaster victims or relocating them. The federal government can provide transportation assistance for evacuees to return to their predisaster residences or alternative locations, as authorized by the Post Katrina Act. Limited information exists on the implementation of this new authority for evacuee return. The National Response Framework assigns roles to federal agencies, states, localities, and nonprofit organizations for evacuations during overwhelming incidents. The National Response Framework (NRF) includes Incident Annexes that address specific hazard situations, such as the Mass Evacuation Incident Annex. This Annex assigns DHS and FEMA the responsibility for coordinating mass evacuations with federal, state, local, and tribal governments. Coordination among multiple command entities is essential for carrying out evacuation operations at any scale. FEMA's National Hurricane Program (NHP) assists state and local agencies in developing hurricane evacuation plans through projects like Hurricane Evacuation Studies (HES). HES helps determine hurricane effects, shelters, and public response. NHP also conducts hazard analyses for coastal communities to identify evacuation zones and assess population demographics. Evacuation analyses help communities determine evacuation zones, develop maps, and assess clearance times. Techniques like informing citizens about routes and shelter locations can speed up evacuations. Providing resources along the route and having tow trucks available can also improve effectiveness. Hazard analyses identify vulnerable areas, while evacuation analyses assess the impact size. Evacuation analyses help identify modes of transportation and potential routes for evacuations in areas susceptible to hazards. Lessons from disasters like wildfires and hurricanes have improved knowledge on large-scale evacuations, particularly from incidents like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Techniques from studies on Hurricane Katrina evacuations have shown ways to make evacuations more effective. The evacuations during Hurricane Katrina were generally successful due to effective procedures such as contra-flow and coordination through conference calls. However, evacuations in New Orleans and Jefferson Parish faced significant challenges, leading to negative public perception of the overall evacuation efforts. Critics described the evacuation call as weak, bureaucratic, and confusing. During Hurricane Rita evacuations, criticisms of weak, bureaucratic, and confusing evacuation calls led to stronger language being used during Hurricane Ike evacuations. The effectiveness of this approach in getting individuals to evacuate remains unclear. Gasoline shortages and gridlock influenced evacuation experiences. \"Shadow evacuations\" occurred during some disasters, where individuals left without official orders, burdening evacuation routes and causing fuel shortages. Efforts in Hurricane Ike, such as discouraging non-evacuation zone departures and multiple vehicle evacuations, helped reduce shadow evacuations. During Hurricane Katrina evacuations, the timing of evacuation orders was crucial, with large metropolitan areas needing at least 48 hours to evacuate. However, early evacuation orders could be risky due to uncertainties in weather forecasts. Delayed or incomplete evacuations in New Orleans and Jefferson Parish resulted in the need for post-hurricane evacuations, leading to loss of lives and increased suffering. Federal reports highlighted the importance of timely and complete evacuations to mitigate the impact of disasters. The incomplete evacuation after Hurricane Katrina led to the need for a second evacuation, causing problems in communication, lack of awareness, and a shortage of bus drivers. Economically disadvantaged individuals, those with pets, and special-needs populations faced difficulties during the evacuations, with some unable to leave due to transportation issues. Special-needs populations were underserved, with some too frail for transport and others dependent on service animals that struggled to navigate flooded streets. Some chose not to evacuate. Legislation enacted after Hurricane Katrina includes grants for developing evacuation plans that cater to special needs populations, individuals with pets, and service animals. The responsibility to evacuate is not solely on the government, as some individuals chose not to evacuate despite being aware of the need to do so. Despite evacuation planning and resources in place, some individuals chose to wait out Hurricane Katrina, underestimating its severity. Congress may consider better integrating federal, state, and local efforts for evacuation, addressing inequity issues, and reforming evacuation policies. The Stafford Act mandates relief without discrimination based on economic status, with FEMA responsible for evacuating disaster victims. The National Commission on Children in Disasters recommended a national evacuee tracking system after Hurricane Katrina. FEMA was required to establish the NEFRL system and the National Emergency Child Locator Center for family reunification. Over 5,000 children were reported missing after the hurricane. The National Commission on Children in Disasters recommended a national evacuee tracking system after Hurricane Katrina. FEMA established the NEFRL system and the National Emergency Child Locator Center for family reunification. Congress may consider establishing a coordinator within FEMA to address the needs of children in disasters. Foreign nationals in the US face challenges during natural disasters due to lack of personal identification documents. Enforcement of immigration laws may hinder foreign nationals' access to emergency disaster relief. Unauthorized aliens can receive short-term, in-kind assistance under certain conditions, but they are not immune from deportation while receiving federal disaster aid. After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, some displaced aliens were afraid to seek government help due to deportation fears. DHS officials arrested and deported some unauthorized aliens affected by the hurricanes. The 2005 hurricanes displaced unauthorized aliens, potentially hindering their evacuation due to deportation fears. Congress may review the relationship between evacuation and immigration policies. The U.S. Department of Transportation issued a report on hurricane evacuation plans, highlighting the need for better integration of federal, state, and local emergency plans. Congress could consider improving jurisdictional integration and expanding FEMA grants for technology research to enhance evacuation planning. Geographic information systems (GIS) are being used to aid emergency managers in decision-making. Geographic information systems (GIS) are utilized in emergency management for efficient evacuation route planning and identifying vulnerable populations. \"Virtual Alabama\" combines GIS and aerial photography for real-time asset deployment and evacuation routing. A citizen-evacuation system using RFID and wireless technologies is being developed to provide real-time information on evacuees during emergencies. The system aims to provide real-time information on evacuees to aid officials in tracking special-needs populations and reuniting families after disasters. It also helps reduce the need for dangerous search-and-rescue operations. Another emerging technology is a software tool using operations research methods to assist emergency managers in deciding on evacuations efficiently. This tool can identify bottlenecks, predict problems, and aid in clearing out inhabitants in stages during evacuations. Additionally, software tools can optimize relief supply locations before hurricanes hit land. Planners optimize relief supply locations before hurricanes hit land. Congress could make technology more available to emergency managers or fund further research. Evacuation policy presents difficult choices for inhabitants of hazardous areas, creating a disincentive to evacuate and potentially causing inequity between evacuees and those who stay. Congress could address the lack of inspectors available for post-disaster home inspections by expanding the Stafford Act's Public Assistance program to bring in outside inspectors. They could also consider providing federal assistance for evacuee expenditures for re-entry, such as grant assistance, small loans, and tax relief. Congress could explore options to increase citizen participation in state and local evacuation planning, as well as provide assistance to help governments carry out evacuations. This could lead to more complete evacuations, especially in cases where multiple evacuations are necessary due to hurricanes occurring in close succession. Officials during Hurricane Ike were concerned about evacuation fatigue leading to incomplete evacuations. Congress could offer grants to study and address evacuation fatigue to increase citizen participation in evacuations. Successful evacuation plans also include strategies for returning and relocating residents safely. Section 425 of the Post-Katrina Act provides transportation assistance for relocating displaced individuals. The amendment expands the federal government's role in evacuations by authorizing the return of evacuees to their predisaster residences. Questions arise about who covers the cost of return transportation and belongings. Evacuees may need reimbursement for items like moving vans and rental trucks. The National Advisory Committee (NAC) raised concerns about FEMA's ability to manage transportation assistance for evacuees returning home after disasters. NAC requested clearer guidance on criteria for assistance, suggesting a need for congressional oversight if the policy proves costly or difficult to administer. After Hurricane Katrina, federal policy now sets national standards for evacuations, with legislation ensuring the return or relocation of evacuees. The Stafford Act was amended to include transportation-dependent groups in evacuation plans. President Obama's focus on special-needs populations may increase federal involvement, shifting roles and responsibilities. This federal assumption of more responsibility creates standards for states and localities, potentially saving lives. Increased federal involvement in evacuation planning may intrude on state sovereignty and lead to unfunded mandates. States and localities must identify transportation-dependent groups to ensure they are included in evacuation plans. Some emergency management officials lack understanding of these groups, prompting Congress to monitor their identification and incorporation into plans. Increased federal involvement in evacuation planning may intrude on state sovereignty and lead to unfunded mandates. States and localities must identify transportation-dependent groups to ensure they are included in evacuation plans, updating them periodically as demographic characteristics change. Anticipating potential problems in evacuation planning is crucial, along with integrating federal, state, and local efforts and addressing equity issues that may arise. Examples of evacuation-related statutes are provided in Table A-1."
