The \"Local Control of Cellular Towers Act\" outlines findings regarding the negative impacts of personal wireless services facilities near residential areas and the importance of state and local government control over their placement through zoning regulations. The Federal Communications Commission establishes policies for interstate and international communications, ensuring compliance with Federal laws like the National Environmental Policy Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. The Commission defers to State and local authorities for regulating the placement of wireless facilities through zoning and land use regulations. The Federal Communications Commission defers to State and local authorities for regulating the placement of wireless facilities through zoning and land use regulations. Alternative technologies for wireless facilities may be less intrusive, such as small towers that do not disrupt skylines or tree canopies. It is in the interest of the Nation to modify requirements to allow State and local governments more flexibility in applying ordinances to wireless facilities. PCS-Over-Cable, PCS-Over-Fiber Optic, and satellite telecommunications systems, including Low-Earth Orbit satellites, offer a significant opportunity to provide \"911\" emergency telephone service throughout the United States without intruding on the environment. The burden of proof in civil actions related to the placement of such facilities is on the person seeking to construct or modify them. The Federal Aviation Administration relies on State and local governments to regulate telecommunications facilities near airports or high-volume air traffic areas. Preempting State and local zoning regulations for these facilities could negatively impact aviation safety, airport capacity, airspace use, public health, and community welfare. The Telecommunications industry should adhere to high standards in their communications with governmental authorities. The purpose of the Act is to repeal limitations on State and local authority regarding personal wireless services facilities and allow them to regulate the placement based on land use impacts. The Act aims to regulate the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless services facilities to protect the environment, public health, and safety.

The curr_chunk addresses the authority of State or local governments to require studies and documentation for personal wireless services facilities to address radio frequency interference. The curr_chunk focuses on documenting compliance with radio frequency exposure limits, interference impacts, and laws governing the effects of wireless facilities on the environment and public health.
