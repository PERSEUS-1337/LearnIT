    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Depositary Services Efficiency and Cost Reduction Act\". The Congress finds that the Secretary of the Treasury compensates financial institutions for critical depositary and financial agency services by placing compensating balances and using imputed interest. Due to low interest rates and reaching the debt limit, the Treasury has had to adjust the size of compensating balances. The fluctuation of compensating balances and collateral pledging by financial institutions have created financial uncertainty for the Treasury and cash management. Transparency in financial services to the Government is crucial for Congress oversight. Direct payment for services would enhance cash and debt management responsibilities. The Secretary of the Treasury's cash and debt management responsibilities would be strengthened by reducing the need to adjust balances due to interest rate fluctuations or reaching the debt limit. Transitioning from compensating balances to direct payments could lead to cost savings and more efficient services. Transitioning from compensating balances to another compensation method must be carefully managed to prevent higher-than-necessary transitional costs and enable financial institutions to modify their planned investment of cash and securities. Authorization of appropriations for services provided by depositaries and financial agencies of the United States is granted for fiscal years after 2003. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to reimburse financial institutions for services required by the Treasury or other Federal agencies, including those rendered before 2004. An orderly transition is also outlined. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use appropriations to pay financial institutions for services, transitioning from compensating balances. Compensating balances can only be used in extraordinary circumstances post-transition. The Secretary of the Treasury must report any use of compensating balances to the appropriate committees. During the transition to using appropriations, steps must be taken to prevent financial disruption and maintain accounting controls. The Secretary of the Treasury must report annually to Congress on the use of compensating balances and appropriations authorized in section 3. The report may be included in the President's budget submission for the following fiscal year. The Secretary of the Treasury must report annually to Congress on the transition from compensating balances to appropriations authorized in section 3 for financial institutions. The report will be submitted to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate. The report submitted annually to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury analyzes the cost of transition, direct costs of services paid from authorized appropriations, and benefits of direct payment over compensating balance arrangements. Technical Amendment to the Federal Reserve Act includes changes regarding assets held by Federal reserve banks."
