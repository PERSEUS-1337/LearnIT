    "content": "The U.S. Constitution outlines the roles of the President and the Senate in appointing government officials. The President nominates officials with the Senate's advice and consent, as stated in the Appointments Clause. The Senate must confirm nominees before they can assume office. The Recess Appointments Clause allows the President to fill vacancies during Senate recesses. The Recess Appointments Clause grants the President the power to fill vacancies during Senate recesses by granting temporary commissions that expire at the end of the next session. The purpose of this clause was to ensure the government's operation when the Senate was not in session. Declarations from the founding era provide insight into the interpretation of this power, with Alexander Hamilton describing it as a supplement to the general method of appointment. During the ratification debates in Pennsylvania, a figure of the American Revolution discussed the Senate's need to not sit constantly due to the provision for the President to fill vacancies during recesses. The interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause has been complicated by changes in the congressional schedule since the founding period. Congress used to have short sessions followed by long breaks, but now includes intra-session recesses. The practice of Congress taking intra-session recesses has evolved over time, with shorter breaks becoming more common. The interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause has been complicated by changes in the congressional schedule and the use of recess appointment power by Presidents for political purposes. This has led to significant political and legal controversy throughout history. The treaty with Great Britain in 1813 sparked Senate debate. Presidents Jackson, Taylor, and Lincoln made numerous recess appointments. Recess appointments to the judiciary were common in the early republic, with 12 Justices receiving recess appointments to the Supreme Court. Congressional response to long adjournments and the spoils system led to restrictions on the President's appointment power. The interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause has been a subject of debate among Attorneys General, legislators, and scholars. Different opinions exist regarding the phrases \"the Recess of the Senate\" and \"Vacancies that may happen,\" with some advocating for a narrow interpretation and others for a broad one. While the executive branch and Senate have historically favored a broad interpretation, recent legislative responses aim to limit the President's use of recess appointments. In 2014, the Supreme Court addressed the scope of the Recess Appointments Clause for the first time in Nat'l Labor Relations Bd. v. Noel Canning. The Court considered whether the President's recess appointment power applies to intra-session recesses, vacancies existing during a recess, and recess appointments during pro forma sessions. The Senate convenes every three days in pro forma sessions. This report discusses statutory pay restrictions as a method to curb politically motivated recess appointments and the authority and tenure of recess appointees. The President has the power to fill vacancies during Senate recesses, with commissions expiring at the end of the next session. A functionalist interpretation allows the President to make recess appointments during inter- or intra-session recesses and fill any vacancy regardless of when it arose. In 2013, the D.C. Circuit Court ruled that recess appointments by the President can only be made during inter-session recess at the end of Congress, and only to vacancies that arose during that recess. This decision invalidated three recess appointments made by President Obama to the NLRB, which was later affirmed by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court rejected the D.C. Circuit's interpretation of recess appointments, with Justice Breyer writing the majority opinion. Justice Scalia, in a separate opinion, agreed with the D.C. Circuit's formalist interpretation. The historical interpretations of \"the Recess of the Senate\" and \"Vacancies that may happen\" are discussed, with the issue of recess appointments arising later than the vacancy issue due to changes in congressional scheduling. The first formal Attorney General opinion on the subject is also mentioned. The first formal Attorney General opinion on recess appointments was issued in 1901 by Attorney General Philander C. Knox, concluding that the phrase applied only to inter-session recesses. This position was later changed in 1921 by Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty, who declared that appointments made during intra-session recesses were constitutional. Daugherty's opinion focused on the practical aspects of recess appointments. Attorney General Daugherty supported the constitutionality of intra-session recess appointments, emphasizing the need to prevent the hindrance of governmental functions. He stated that short adjournments do not constitute the recess intended by the Constitution and highlighted the potential for abuse of discretion in presidential appointments. Subsequent opinions from the Attorneys General and the Office of Legal Counsel continued to uphold the validity of intra-session recess appointments. Prior to Noel Canning, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit supported the constitutionality of intra-session recess appointments, allowing President George W. Bush to appoint William H. Pryor Jr. during a 10-day recess. The court emphasized the historical practice and purpose of the Clause to ensure the proper functioning of the government, rejecting arguments that the appointment should be limited to one specific recess. The Eleventh Circuit upheld the appointment of a judge within a 10-day intra-session recess, citing historical practices and rejecting arguments for specific limits on recess appointments. The court's interpretation of \"the Recess\" differed from the D.C. Circuit's view, which limited it to inter-session recesses. The D.C. Circuit found the use of the definite article \"the\" significant in indicating a specific recess, not just any break in proceedings. Historical analysis suggested a lack of power for intra-session recess appointments in the early years after the Constitution's ratification. The court rejected a functionalist interpretation and concluded that the Senate enters \"the Recess\" only during inter-session recesses. The phrase \"Vacancies that may happen\" during recess was a key point of interpretation. The interpretation of the phrase \"Vacancies that may happen\" during the recess of the Senate was debated, with early opinions favoring a narrow view that vacancies must arise after the recess begins. Edmund J. Randolph and Alexander Hamilton both emphasized a strict interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause, stating that vacancies existing before the recess could not be filled through recess appointments. In 1823, Attorney General William Wirt interpreted the Recess Appointments Clause broadly, encompassing all vacancies existing before and during the recess. Subsequent Attorneys General in 1832 and 1841 endorsed Wirt's interpretation, deviating from the earlier narrow view advocated by Randolph and Hamilton. Attorney General Wirt's broad interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause was briefly challenged, but opinions returned to his view by 1855. Later Attorneys General consistently interpreted \"happen\" to include newly created unfilled offices. Attorneys General opinions consistently interpreted the Recess Appointments Clause broadly, including recess appointments to offices that became vacant while the Senate was in session. Federal courts in the 1880s and modern era supported this broader interpretation based on historical practice and congressional recognition. The D.C. Circuit in Noel Canning diverged from established interpretations of the Recess Appointments Clause, arguing that a \"vacancy\" must arise after the Senate enters \"the Recess.\" This interpretation was based on a textual analysis, stating that the term \"happen\" cannot encompass all vacancies in existence. The D.C. Circuit in Noel Canning rejected historical arguments supporting broad recess appointment power, emphasizing that the Senate's assent to a practice does not prevent judicial review. The Supreme Court later ruled the NLRB recess appointments invalid due to a short intra-session recess, setting a precedent for stricter interpretation of the President's recess appointment power. The Supreme Court ruled on the invalidity of NLRB recess appointments, with five Justices rejecting the D.C. Circuit's interpretation of the Clause. Justice Breyer emphasized historical practice in interpreting the President's recess appointment power. Justice Scalia disagreed with the majority's deference to historical practice in interpreting the Constitution, arguing that the Court should not be bound by self-aggrandizing practices adopted by political branches after the founding era. He cited the Court's decision in INS v. Chadha as an example of where the Court did not hesitate to strike down a long-standing practice, despite Congress enacting similar provisions over 50 years. In Noel Canning, the Court held that \"the Recess of the Senate\" includes both inter- and intra-session breaks, citing founding-era documents. Justice Scalia criticized the majority for embracing an adverse-possession theory of executive power, warning it could aggrandize the Presidency beyond constitutional bounds and undermine separation of powers. The Court in Noel Canning found textual support for a broad interpretation of \"the Recess of the Senate\" but declared the text ambiguous and looked to historical practice. It noted Attorneys General opinions emphasizing the functionalist purpose of the Recess Appointments Clause since Congress began taking shorter breaks post-World War II. The Court also highlighted Senate support for intra-session recess appointments and a 1905 Senate Committee report favoring a functional definition of \"the recess.\" The Court in Noel Canning established that the Recess Appointments Clause applies to both inter- and intra-session recesses. They determined that a recess of more than 3 days but less than 10 days is presumptively too short to fall within the Clause, as the Framers did not anticipate frequent and lengthy intra-session breaks. The Court in Noel Canning ruled that a recess of less than 10 days is not long enough to trigger the President's recess appointment power, as it is presumptively too short. Justice Scalia agreed with a narrower interpretation that \"the Recess\" only applies to inter-session breaks. Justice Scalia supported a narrower interpretation of \"the Recess\" as only applying to inter-session breaks, critiquing the majority's interpretation for being linguistically unsound and lacking a textually grounded principle. Justice Scalia criticized the majority's broad interpretation of \"the Recess\" as judicial overreach, arguing that historical practice does not support it. He highlighted the lack of intra-session recesses for nearly 80 years and the absence of intra-session recess appointments even during breaks longer than 10 days. Scalia pointed to early history and Attorney General Knox's 1901 opinion as evidence that neither the Executive nor the Senate believed in such a power. He also questioned the majority's reliance on the 1905 Senate Report, stating it only clarified breaks between sessions, not constructive breaks. Justice Scalia objected to the majority's methodology in interpreting \"the Recess\" clause, believing it would lead to the Executive Branch gaining more power. The majority's interpretation included vacancies occurring during both recess and session, citing ambiguity in the language of the Clause. The Court interpreted the \"Recess\" clause broadly, allowing the President to make recess appointments for vacancies that arose before the recess. Historical practice dating back to President James Madison supported this interpretation, with the Senate not opposing it for most of the last century. The Senate did not oppose the broad interpretation of the \"Recess\" clause for most of the last century. Despite sporadic disagreement in the early 19th century, the Senate later supported a functionalist interpretation of the Clause in 1905 and allowed payment to recess appointees filling certain pre-recess vacancies in 1940. The Senate's historical support of the President's interpretation of the \"Recess\" clause for nearly 200 years, along with the Court's acknowledgment of this tradition, led to the recognition that these practices hold significant weight in interpreting the constitutional provision. The Court expressed reluctance to disrupt this long-standing practice, emphasizing the importance of preserving the authority that Presidents have exercised for so long. Justice Scalia's concurring opinion disagreed with the majority's interpretation of \"Vacancies that may happen,\" aligning with the D.C. Circuit's view that a vacancy must initially occur during the recess. This interpretation was seen as more in line with the subordinate role the Clause was intended to play in appointing officials. The Recess Appointments Clause was intended as a subordinate way of appointing officials, not primary. The 1823 Wirt opinion was found to be mistaken in its interpretation, as historical practices and early statutes supported a narrower view. Scalia disagreed with the majority, arguing that vacancies must occur during the recess for the clause to apply. Justice Scalia disagreed with the majority's broad interpretation of the Constitution's purpose and historical practices regarding recess appointments. He argued that the majority's reliance on modern era examples was not representative of historical practices, pointing out that the President's authority to make such appointments was not settled until the mid-19th century. Additionally, he highlighted that from 1863 to 1940, it was illegal to pay any recess appointee who filled a pre-recess vacancy, which discouraged such appointments. Justice Scalia disagreed with the majority's interpretation of historical practices regarding recess appointments, stating that the evidence of 'historical practice' was actually evidence of inter-branch conflict. The last question in Noel Canning was whether the President's recess appointment power applies during Senate pro forma sessions, which was crucial due to President Obama's appointments to the NLRB. In 2011, President Obama nominated Terrence F. Flynn, Sharon Block, and Richard F. Griffin, Jr. to the NLRB to prevent membership from dropping below the required quorum. The Senate did not act on these nominations and adopted a unanimous consent agreement for pro forma sessions to occur from December 20, 2011, to January 23, 2012. The President made recess appointments to the NLRB on January 4, 2012, during pro forma sessions, citing Senate inaction. The validity of these appointments hinged on whether the pro forma sessions should be considered as periods when the Senate was in session. The Court considered whether pro forma sessions should be treated as periods when the Senate was in session or in recess. The Court concluded that pro forma sessions count as sessions of the Senate, allowing the President to make recess appointments during these sessions. The Court determined that pro forma sessions of the Senate should be considered as sessions rather than recess, allowing the President to make recess appointments. The Senate's capacity to conduct business during these sessions was evident, as demonstrated by the passage of a bill into law by unanimous consent. The Court ruled that the President's NLRB recess appointments were invalid due to the Senate being in a short intra-session recess of three days, which did not trigger the President's recess appointment power. The Court rejected the government's argument to examine the Senate's actions during pro forma sessions, stating it was legally and practically inappropriate. This decision could potentially allow the Senate to prevent future Presidents from making recess appointments by holding pro forma sessions. The Supreme Court's ruling on NLRB recess appointments stated that the Senate's short intra-session recess did not trigger the President's recess appointment power. The Court's decision could potentially allow the Senate to prevent future Presidents from making recess appointments by holding pro forma sessions. The government warned that this ruling could disrupt the balance between branches, but the Court stated it would not significantly alter the constitutional balance. The Court emphasized that the Recess Appointments Clause is not meant to overcome serious institutional friction, which can be resolved through other methods like compromise among branches. The Supreme Court's ruling on NLRB recess appointments emphasized that resolution can be achieved through judicial interpretation, compromise among branches, and the ballot box. Justice Scalia did not address the significance of pro forma sessions in his opinion on the invalidity of the recess appointments. The Court unanimously found the appointments unconstitutional, but was divided on the reasoning. Despite a broad interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause, the majority ruled the appointments invalid. The Supreme Court ruled NLRB recess appointments invalid due to a short Senate recess. Justices disagreed on interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause. President can appoint during any Senate recess of 10 days or longer. The Supreme Court ruled NLRB recess appointments invalid due to a short Senate recess. The Court's ruling allows the Senate to prevent recess appointments with pro forma sessions. Congress has enacted legislation to restrict pay for recess appointees. Pay restrictions on recess appointees date back to the mid-19th century. The legislation enacted in response to President Lincoln's recess appointments prohibited payment of salaries to appointees until confirmed by the Senate. Senator Fessenden emphasized the Senate's power to prevent payment to appointees serving without consent. The Tenure of Office Act in 1867 placed restrictions on the President's appointment and removal powers, limiting the ability to suspend officers during recesses to cases of misconduct, crime, or incapacity. Recess appointments could only be made for vacancies due to death. If the Senate did not agree with a suspension, the officer would resume their duties. The Tenure of Office Act in 1867 restricted the President's appointment and removal powers, allowing recess appointments only for vacancies due to death or resignation. If a recess appointee's nomination was not confirmed by the Senate in the next session, the office would remain vacant. President Andrew Johnson ignored the act when he removed Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, leading to criminal penalties and salary cut-offs. Congress repealed parts of the act in 1869 and entirely in 1887. Similar limits on the President's removal power were deemed unconstitutional in the 1926 Myers v. United States decision, but the pay restriction for recess appointees from 1863 remained intact. The pay restriction for recess appointees, originally enacted in 1863, was amended in 1940 to provide exceptions, currently codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a75503. The second exception allows payment to a recess appointee with a pending nomination before the Senate, but prohibits payment to a successive appointee already serving under a prior recess appointment. The pay restriction for recess appointees, as outlined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a75503, allows payment to a recess appointee with a pending nomination before the Senate. However, payment is prohibited to a successive appointee already serving under a prior recess appointment. If a recess appointee is paid under one of the exceptions, a nomination to fill the vacancy must be submitted to the Senate within 40 days of the next session. The pay restriction for recess appointees, outlined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a75503, allows payment to a recess appointee with a pending nomination before the Senate. However, payment is prohibited to a successive appointee already serving under a prior recess appointment. An appropriations rider enacted in 2007 also bars payment to an individual serving in a position after the Senate has rejected their nomination. The exceptions under \u00a75503 aim to make the prohibition on salary payments more flexible, as explained in a House report. The pay restriction for recess appointees, outlined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a75503, allows payment to a recess appointee with a pending nomination before the Senate. Exceptions (a)(1) and (a)(3) allow for payment if the vacancy arose, or the pending nomination was rejected, within 30 days \"before the end of the session.\" The term \"session\" refers to any time the Senate convenes. Arguments have been made regarding the Anti-Deficiency Act provision that could bar a recess appointee from serving. The provision in 31 U.S.C. \u00a71342 prohibits federal officers or employees from accepting voluntary services exceeding authorized limits, except in emergencies. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) allows waiver of compensation if it renders the service gratuitous. Compensation fixed by statute cannot be waived. The provision in 31 U.S.C. \u00a71342 prohibits federal officers or employees from accepting voluntary services exceeding authorized limits, except in emergencies. GAO has ruled that compensation fixed by statute cannot be waived. This may not apply to recess appointees, who are already barred from receiving pay under 5 U.S.C. \u00a75503. The President's appointment power, including recess appointments, is derived from the Constitution, making it difficult to argue against recess appointees serving in government. The pay limitations for recess appointees aim to protect the Senate's advice and consent function by indirectly controlling recess appointments. The constitutionality of these limitations has not been fully adjudicated, but there are concerns that any restrictions on the President's recess appointment power could be unconstitutional. The constitutionality of pay restrictions for recess appointees under 5 U.S.C. \u00a75503 might be questioned, especially in relation to judicial recess appointees. While Attorneys General have advised Presidents on the applicability of pay restriction statutes without constitutional concerns, previous cases like Staebler and Noel Canning have raised potential constitutional issues. The Noel Canning case upheld a broad interpretation of the President's recess appointment power, allowing appointments during inter- or intra-session recesses of sufficient length. This could lead to an expansive view of the President's recess appointment authority. The potential constitutional issues surrounding recess appointments could empower the President to bypass Senate confirmation through successive appointments. However, the Senate's pro forma sessions may act as a counterweight. A recess appointee holds the same authority as a confirmed appointee, with their commission expiring at the end of the Senate's next session. A recess appointee holds the same authority as a confirmed appointee, with their commission expiring at the end of the Senate's next session. The service of a confirmed appointee continues until the end of the statutory term or at the pleasure of the President, subject to Congress's requirements. The Supreme Court's decision in Noel Canning did not change this understanding. A recess appointment could last for almost two years, depending on whether it is an intersession or intrasession appointment. A recess appointee holds the same authority as a confirmed appointee, with their commission expiring at the end of the Senate's next session. The President may remove a recess appointee before the expiration of his term. The duration of a recess appointment includes the rest of the session in progress plus the full length of the session that follows. The tenure of a recess appointee confirmed by the Senate to an office with a fixed statutory term depends on the particular statutory language regarding terms of office and filling vacancies. The duration of a recess appointment includes the rest of the session in progress plus the full length of the session that follows. The tenure of a recess appointee confirmed by the Senate to an office with a fixed statutory term depends on the particular statutory language regarding terms of office and filling vacancies. Attorney General Homer Cummings in 1933 opined that the new commission for the full statutory term relates back to the date on which the person first assumed office by means of the recess appointment. The interpretation of the term of office for a confirmed appointee varies, with some opinions stating that previous service under a recess appointment should not be included, while others argue that the full statutory term relates back to the date of the recess appointment. This is supported by legal opinions and historical court decisions. The Court differentiated between recess appointments made under the statute and the President's constitutional recess appointment power. Attorney General John Berrien applied this rationale to other officers appointed during a recess, stating that such appointments are limited to the end of the succeeding session of Congress. The official term of a recess appointee lasts until the end of the succeeding session of Congress or until a new commission is accepted. If a recess appointee who is also the President's nominee is rejected by the Senate, they can still hold office until the session ends. After the constitutional term of a recess appointee expires, a new recess appointment can be made. Successive recess appointments of the same person may have pay restrictions. The President can make recess appointments with certain restrictions. A vacancy must exist before the President can use this authority, which may be complicated by holdover provisions for fixed term positions. The Department of Justice believes a vacancy arises when a fixed term appointment expires. The Appointments Clause deals with vacancies that occur when an officer continues serving after their fixed term expires under a holdover provision. Judicial interpretation of vacancy in light of holdover provisions varies based on statutory language. In Staebler v. Carter, a court found a vacancy under the Recess Appointments Clause when a holdover commissioner at the FEC continued to serve. The holdover provision allowed a member to serve until a successor took office, leading to a recess appointment being upheld for the FEC. The court found a vacancy at the FEC when the holdover commissioner's term expired, allowing for a recess appointment to be made. The court rejected the argument that the Recess Appointments Clause only applies when no one is available for the office. The district court in Mackie v. Clinton held that the Recess Appointments Clause depends on the wording and structure of the holdover provision, creating a \"prospective vacancy\" for a Governor to continue serving for one year past the end of their term. The court in Mackie v. Clinton emphasized that a one-year holdover period prevents susceptibility to concerns expressed in Staebler. In Wilkinson v. Legal Servs. Corp, it was held that a vacancy is created upon resignation, death, or removal of a Director, with the holdover provision being mandatory. The court in Wilkinson v. Legal Servs. Corp held that the holdover provision does not infringe upon the President's recess appointment power, but merely defines when vacancies exist on the LSC Board triggering the Recess Appointments Clause. The decisions in Staebler, Mackie, and Wilkinson show that the interpretation of a holdover provision as a vacancy for recess appointment purposes depends on its specific language. The Recess Appointments Clause has been a source of controversy since George Washington's time, with differing interpretations by the executive and legislative branches. In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in NLRB v. Noel Canning that the President can make recess appointments during Senate recesses of at least 10 days. The Supreme Court ruled in NLRB v. Noel Canning that a Senate recess must be at least 10 days for the President to make recess appointments. The decision left open the possibility for exigent circumstances, not political disagreements, for appointments during shorter recesses. The impact of the decision on future actions of the President and Senate remains uncertain."
