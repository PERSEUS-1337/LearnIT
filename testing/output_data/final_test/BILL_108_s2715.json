    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"International Student and Scholar Access Act of 2004\". Congress finds that the United States needs to improve student visa screening to prevent terrorists from exploiting the system. However, maintaining openness to international students is crucial for foreign policy, education, and the economy. Educating future world leaders in the US and promoting scientific exchange are vital for national security and global influence. The United States has seen a significant increase in Visa Mantis checks to protect against technology transfers, with delays in security clearances discouraging international scholars. International students contribute billions to the US economy, but delays in obtaining student visas have deterred many from studying in the US. Total international applications to graduate schools in the United States for fall 2004 declined 32 percent from fall 2003. The number of international students enrolled in the United States grew by 6 percent during the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 school years but leveled off dramatically in 2002-2003. Concerns about the SEVIS monitoring system have contributed to the decline in foreign applicants. The US requires a visa system for exchange programs that enhances national security. The United States needs a comprehensive strategy to recruit international students and improve their access to higher education in the country.

This includes refining controls on entry for visitors engaging in advanced science and technology study or research to focus on cases of concern. The standards for timeliness in international student and visitor visas include a 15-day response time for agencies involved in clearance, a 30-day review completion time, expedited processing for delays, and a process for applicants to inquire about their application status. Establish a special review process to resolve cases pending for over 60 days. SEC. 203. INTEROPERABLE DATA SYSTEMS AT THE FBI.
