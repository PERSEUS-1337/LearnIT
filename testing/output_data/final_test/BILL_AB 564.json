    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 4677 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended. Section 4677 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to state that all parental fees collected by regional centers shall be deposited in the Developmental Disabilities Program Development Fund. This fund is created to support new programs and expand existing ones for individuals with developmental disabilities, focusing on promoting independence and self-determination. Starting July 1, 2009, parental fees will be deposited according to Section 4784. The State Council on Developmental Disabilities requests information on services needed every five years from regional centers. They collaborate with the department and regional center agencies to develop standardized forms for collecting this information. These forms also seek input on innovative service delivery models to address consumer needs. The State Council on Developmental Disabilities collaborates with regional centers to gather information on needed services every five years. The state council may use various sources, including public hearings and quality assurance assessments, to inform their decisions. The department will provide additional information upon request. The State Council on Developmental Disabilities collaborates with regional centers to assess the need for new community services and supports every five years. The assessment includes identifying services currently unavailable and highlighting innovative service delivery models. The State Council on Developmental Disabilities conducts a needs assessment every five years, updated annually, included in the state plan, and shared with the Legislature and the public. Recommendations for program funding are made to the Department of Finance based on this assessment. The Program Development Fund can be supplemented by federal funds allocated in the state plan, available for departmental use with approval from the state council. Funds must align with program development priorities in the state plan and cannot revert to the General Fund. The future fiscal impact of allocations on state supported services for persons with developmental disabilities is a key consideration. Priority services needed but currently unavailable can be submitted by regional centers. Excess parental fees may be used for specified purposes only with specific appropriations to the State Department of Developmental Services. The deposit of federal moneys into the Program Development Fund does not require compliance with a different definition of \"developmental disabilities\" for determining eligibility or allocating funds. Section 4782 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is repealed, and Section 4784 is amended. The Director of Developmental Services will annually review and adjust parental fees for services through regional centers, considering economic conditions. The fee schedule will not exceed an inflationary factor and is exempt from certain government code regulations. The parental fee schedule for caring for a child at home includes factors such as medical expenses, living arrangements, parental payments, and transportation costs. Families below the federal poverty level are exempt from assessment and payment. Children starting out-of-home placement after July 1, 2009, will be assessed the adjusted fee in full. The department will determine fee increases for children placed out-of-home before July 1, 2009, to be implemented over three years. All fees collected starting July 1, 2009, will be remitted to the State Treasury for program development. The department will assess a monthly fee to parents of children under 18 years of age receiving 24-hour out-of-home care services if the family's gross income is above 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Fees collected exceeding the June 30, 2009 schedule will be deposited into the Program Development Fund to offset General Fund costs. This section will become inoperative on July 1, 2016, and repealed on January 1, 2017, unless extended by a later statute. The monthly parental fees and credits set by this section are exempt from certain government code regulations. Fees start 60 days after a child is placed in 24-hour out-of-home care. The monthly parental fee for parents in 24-hour out-of-home care is based on income documentation provided to the department within 30 days. Self-employed parents must submit their most recent federal tax return. If income documentation is not provided, parents must report and certify their income on a form provided by the department. Parents' monthly fees for childcare are based on their family income relative to the federal poverty level. Fees range from 3% to 6% of annual gross income, divided by 12, depending on income bracket. Income documentation must be provided within 30 days, with self-employed parents submitting their most recent tax return. If documentation is not provided, income must be reported and certified on a form from the department. The monthly parental fee for parents who fail to provide income documentation within 30 days will be equivalent to the maximum cost of caring for a child in the west region. If documentation is later provided, the fee will be recalculated and adjusted retroactively based on the income information provided. The monthly parental fee assessed under this section is based on the cost of caring for a child in the west region or the cost of services provided, whichever is lower. It is recalculated annually or when a parent reports a change in income or family size. (5) Parents of children in 24-hour out-of-home care before July 1, 2016, will have their monthly parental fee recalculated annually or upon request, with a review by the department. (6) The department may temporarily waive the fee for parents facing unavoidable catastrophic losses or significant medical expenses for a child who is a regional center consumer. Parents can receive a credit equal to one day of the monthly parental fee if they remove their child from 24-hour out-of-home care for a home visit lasting six or more consecutive hours. The credit is calculated by multiplying the monthly fee by 12 and dividing by the number of days in the year. To claim the credit, parents must submit a request to the department within 60 days of the visit. Failure to do so will result in denial of the credit. All fees collected are deposited into the Program Development Fund to support new programs or offset General Fund costs. Parents can appeal the monthly parental fee or credit denial by submitting a written request to the director within 30 days. The appeal can only address disputes regarding family income used for fee calculation. The director will review the fee or credit denial within 30 days and provide a decision. All decisions on monthly parental fee appeals are retroactive to the assessed date. The section will be effective on July 1, 2016."
