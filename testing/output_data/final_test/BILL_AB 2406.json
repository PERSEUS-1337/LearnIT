    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 65852.22 of the Government Code allows local agencies to create junior accessory dwelling units in single-family residential zones. The ordinance may require a permit and limit the number of units to one per lot with a single-family residence. Owner-occupancy is required unless the owner is a governmental agency, land trust, or housing organization. The ordinance allows for the creation of junior accessory dwelling units in single-family residential zones. Requirements include a deed restriction prohibiting separate sale, construction within existing walls, inclusion of an existing bedroom, separate entrance, and adherence to size and attribute restrictions. The ordinance allows for junior accessory dwelling units in single-family residential zones with specific requirements, including an efficiency kitchen with certain specifications. Additional parking cannot be required, but inspections may be necessary to ensure compliance with building standards. An application for a permit under this section is processed ministerially, without discretionary review or a hearing, and must be issued within 120 days. A local agency may charge a fee to cover permit issuance costs. For fire and life protection ordinances, a junior accessory dwelling unit is not considered a separate dwelling unit. Local entities can still enforce regulations uniformly. For water, sewer, and power services, a junior accessory dwelling unit is not treated as a new unit. A junior accessory dwelling unit, defined as a unit within an existing single-family structure no more than 500 square feet, may have separate sanitation facilities. Local agencies, including cities, counties, or city and counties, can enforce parking, water, sewer, or power regulations uniformly for all single-family residences, regardless of the presence of a junior accessory dwelling unit. This act is an urgency statute allowing local jurisdictions to create secure income for homeowners and housing for renters immediately."
