    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Young Americans Financial Literacy Act\". The Congress finds that there is a high demand for financial education in schools, with 87% of Americans and 92% of K-12 teachers supporting it. However, only 12% of teachers currently teach the subject. Additionally, the percentage of Americans who rate themselves highly in personal finance knowledge has decreased from 60% in 2013 to 56% in 2016, with 75% admitting they could benefit from professional financial advice. Research-based financial literacy education programs are needed to reach individuals at all ages and socioeconomic levels, particularly those facing unique and challenging financial situations. It is important to respond to immediate financial stability needs while also focusing on long-term solutions to prevent future personal financial disasters. High school and college students benefit from cumulative financial education, leading to increased financial knowledge and responsible behavior as young adults. Parents recognize the need to better prepare their teens for financial challenges, including budgeting and investing. A majority of young adults prioritize making better money management choices as a key issue for Americans today. According to the Government Accountability Office, improving financial literacy is crucial for individual well-being and the country's economic health. Focusing on economic education and financial literacy for young people aged 8 through 24 is especially important as they establish financial independence. SEC. 3.
