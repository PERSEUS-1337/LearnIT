    "content": "Alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles, such as those powered by natural gas, electricity, or hybrid systems, face barriers to wider acceptance due to higher costs and limited refueling infrastructure. Despite these challenges, these vehicles offer greater efficiency and environmental benefits compared to conventional vehicles. There is growing interest in promoting these vehicles in response to environmental and energy security concerns. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 and 2005 established tax incentives for alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles. Incentives include the Electric Vehicle Tax Credit and Clean Fuel Vehicle Tax Deduction. A federal tax credit of 10% of the purchase price of an electric vehicle, up to $4,000, was available in 2005 but will be reduced to $1,000 in 2006 and phased out after that. The Clean Fuel Vehicle Tax Deduction is available for alternative fuel and hybrid electric vehicles based on weight. Vehicles under 10,000 pounds qualify for a $2,000 deduction, those between 10,000 and 26,000 pounds qualify for $5,000, and vehicles above 26,000 pounds qualify for $50,000. The deduction was terminated in 2005 and replaced with a tax credit. Businesses installing alternative fuel refueling infrastructure can also claim a deduction. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded tax incentives for nonconventional vehicles, replacing the Clean Fuel Vehicle Tax Deduction with a tax credit for hybrid vehicles. Businesses installing alternative fuel refueling infrastructure can claim a tax deduction of up to $100,000. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 replaced the Clean Fuel Vehicle Tax Deduction with tax credits for hybrid vehicles, lean-burn passenger vehicles, and fuel-cell vehicles. It also introduced a tax credit for alternative fuel vehicles and refueling infrastructure installation. The tax credits are based on factors like fuel economy increase and emissions standards for hybrid vehicles. The tax credit for hybrid vehicles is based on emissions standards, fuel economy, and incremental cost compared to conventional vehicles. The credit is set to expire in 2009, with potential credits ranging from $0 to $3,150 for different models. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 also established a tax credit for passenger vehicles with \"lean-burn\" engines, mainly for diesel-powered vehicles meeting specific standards. The tax credit for lean-burn passenger vehicles based on fuel economy standards is set to expire at the end of 2010. Currently, no vehicles on the market qualify for the credit, but automakers are expected to work on reducing emissions to meet the standard in the future. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 also provides a tax credit for fuel-cell vehicles, with additional credits for passenger vehicles achieving at least 50% better fuel economy than conventional vehicles. This credit expires at the end of 2014. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 offers a tax credit for the purchase of new alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs), equal to a percentage of the incremental cost of the vehicle. The credit expires at the end of 2010 and requires the vehicle to be a \"dedicated\" AFV. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 offers a tax credit for the purchase or installation of alternative fuel infrastructure. The credit is equal to 30% of the cost, with a maximum credit of $30,000 for retail property and $1,000 for residential property. The credit expires after 2014 for hydrogen infrastructure and after 2009 for all other fuels."
