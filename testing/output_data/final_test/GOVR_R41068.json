    "content": "Since the early 1970s, federal law has mandated the creation of metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) in urbanized areas with a population of 50,000 or more to plan transportation infrastructure. There are 381 MPOs nationwide, categorized by population size. The main purpose of MPOs is to plan transportation at a metropolitan scale, which is where most economic activities and commuting occur. This level of organization often falls outside the oversight of state governments. Some argue that metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) should have more power in planning and selecting projects using federal transportation funds, as they are currently subordinate to state departments of transportation and local governments. This perceived weakness has led to calls for increased authority for MPOs in various areas, including transportation, housing, and the environment. Some argue for increased power for metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) in coordinating policies and programs at the metropolitan scale, including transportation, housing, and the environment. Others believe the current relationship between state government, local government, and MPOs is balanced. A third view suggests that MPOs, controlled by planners with anti-car views, may be detrimental to transportation systems and should be abolished or have their functions reduced. Surface transportation programs were authorized by SAFETEA-LU for FY2005-FY2009, with Congress considering a new reauthorization. The Congress has extended surface transportation programs multiple times while considering a new reauthorization. This presents an opportunity to review policies related to Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) and the planning process, including potential changes in climate change legislation. Key issues for Congress to consider include MPO authority, representation, technical capacity, and implementation of sustainability initiatives. Other planning issues such as long-range planning requirements, planning scale, and freight transportation needs are also discussed. The federal requirement for transportation planning in urban areas dates back to the 1962 Federal-Aid Highway Act, with MPOs becoming mandatory in urbanized areas since the 1973 Federal-Aid Highway Act. The designation and structure of MPOs, including voting representation, are determined by agreement between the state governor and local governments. In areas with 200,000 residents or more, known as transportation management areas (TMAs), MPOs must consist of local elected officials and officials from major public agencies. The MPO is made up of local elected officials, public agency officials, and state officials forming a policy board. Day-to-day operations are managed by an executive director and a small staff of professional planners. Smaller MPOs often hire consultants for technical work due to limited permanent staff. Staff numbers vary, with small MPOs having an average of 3.2 full-time and 1.4 part-time staff, medium MPOs with 8.2 full-time and 1.5 part-time staff, and large MPOs with 49.3 full-time and 3.9 part-time staff. Smaller MPOs often hire consultants for technical work and rely on help from the state DOT. The main requirements for every MPO are the preparation of a long-range Metropolitan Transportation Plan (MTP) covering 20 years and a Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) covering four years. The MTP must be updated every five years, or four years in areas with air quality issues, and the TIP must be updated every four years. The MTP includes an assessment of transportation supply and demand, investment strategies, environmental effects, and a financial plan for implementation. The long-range plan involves preparing travel demand forecasts, estimates of inputs and outputs, and a fiscally constrained four-year Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) prioritizing federally supported projects. Approval by the MPO and governor is required, with projects selected from the TIP. Urbanized areas with 200,000 residents or more have specific requirements for project selection. Large and medium MPOs in urbanized areas with 200,000 residents or more have authority to select projects from the TIP in consultation with the state and public transit operators. State DOT has authority to select projects on the NHS, Bridge Program, and IM Program in cooperation with MPOs. MPOs in small urban areas have less authority, with highway projects selected by the state and transit projects by designated recipients. Transportation plans at the metropolitan and state levels must be consistent. Transportation plans in metropolitan areas must align with state requirements and air quality standards. The local MPO policy board determines conformity between regional transportation and air quality plans every four years or when updates occur. Developing the TIP, or project programming, is seen as a crucial task for setting budget priorities. Since the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) have had more influence in developing Transportation Improvement Programs (TIPs) and selecting projects for implementation. ISTEA empowered MPOs by giving them authority over certain transportation funds in urban areas. MPOs are responsible for planning in urbanized areas and areas likely to become urbanized in the next 20 years, which may encompass the entire metropolitan statistical area. The planning process for Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) is required to be multi-modal and consider factors such as economic competitiveness, safety, accessibility, environmental quality, and intermodal connectivity. In designated areas, planning must include a congestion management process that focuses on travel demand reduction and operational management strategies. In nonattainment areas, federal funds may not be advanced for highway projects that significantly increase the carrying capacity for single-occupant vehicles without addressing the issue. The metropolitan planning process in TMAs must be certified by the Secretary of Transportation every four years, focusing on how planning is carried out and stakeholder participation. MPOs are required to allow stakeholders to comment on the transportation plan, including freight shippers, public transit operators, and the general public. MPOs must develop a public participation plan for stakeholders to comment on the transportation plan. Federal certification is necessary, or funds may be withheld. MPOs also handle land-use planning, project implementation, transit operations, and environmental planning, with federal funding providing the majority of support. Federal funding, primarily from a 1.25% deduction of federal highway funds, supports about 80% of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) for transportation planning. Funds are apportioned to states based on urbanized population ratios and distributed to MPOs based on state-approved formulas. Additionally, NHS, STP, and Equity Bonus funds can be used for planning activities, along with federal transit funds. Since the early 1960s, federal transit funds have supported metropolitan planning activities, with MPOs required to match 20% of funds from state and local sources. In FY2009, nearly $400 million in federal funds were apportioned for metropolitan planning. Congress has strengthened the metropolitan transportation planning process and the role of MPOs, with significant changes introduced by ISTEA and the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. ISTEA and subsequent legislation increased federal planning funds for MPOs and emphasized air quality goals in metropolitan planning. The role of MPOs is currently under debate in Congress for reauthorizing surface transportation programs, with key issues including MPO authority in planning and funding allocation. The authority of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) in relation to state DOTs for planning and funding allocation is a key issue in Congress. MPOs are seen as relatively powerless due to state control over federal highway funding, leading to urban areas receiving less funding compared to rural areas. This has sparked debate on increasing MPO decision-making authority to address disparities in infrastructure funding. The authority of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) is limited in highway funding distribution, with states favoring rural areas over urban areas. MPOs must collaborate with state DOTs and local governments for project selection, leading to a bias towards highway construction projects more suitable for rural environments. This has sparked calls for increased decision-making authority for MPOs to address disparities in transportation funding. Adherents argue that highway improvements prioritize faster speeds and neglect non-vehicular traffic needs in urban areas. This bias towards highway projects leads to metropolitan decentralization, impacting cities and older suburbs negatively. They suggest directing more federal funding to urbanized areas and giving Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) greater decision-making power in infrastructure funding allocation. The proposed Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 2009 (STAA) aims to empower Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) with greater decision-making authority and accountability for transportation outcomes. The bill, although incomplete, includes the creation of the Metropolitan Mobility and Access (MMA) Program to shape the future of regions through direct funding allocation. The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 2009 (STAA) aims to empower Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) by creating the Metropolitan Mobility and Access (MMA) Program, providing funding directly to MPOs in large urban areas for multi-modal transportation projects to reduce congestion, improve mobility, safety, and environmental sustainability. MPOs must develop an approved metropolitan mobility plan with performance-based goals to receive funds starting in FY2012. The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 2009 empowers Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) by providing funding directly to MPOs in large urban areas for multi-modal transportation projects. Funding is contingent on meeting performance-based goals and metrics, with continued funding dependent on annual progress reports. Concerns exist about the ability of some MPOs, particularly in smaller urbanized areas, to efficiently administer federal funds. The creation and organization of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) are dictated by state law, and changes at the federal level may require reevaluation of MPO governance structures. Without substantial federal funding and stronger authority, MPOs are likely to remain relatively weak compared to state and local governments. The State of Washington established a commission to address transportation issues in the Puget Sound region, where 128 agencies were managing transportation. The commission found challenges in prioritizing regional interests due to the focus on individual agency or mode of transportation interests. It recommended creating a new Puget Sound Regional Transportation Commission (PSRTC) with authority to address these issues. The State of Washington established a commission to address transportation issues in the Puget Sound region, recommending the creation of a new 15-member Puget Sound Regional Transportation Commission (PSRTC) with authority over planning, prioritizing, and funding all modes of regional transportation. The agency should have responsibility for land use, roads, transit, taxing, tolling, and borrowing authority. Despite recommendations for a powerful regional entity, it has not been established to date. The curr_chunk discusses the failure of metropolitan transportation planning and MPOs due to special-interest influence favoring smart growth strategies. These strategies focus on densifying urban areas and promoting alternatives to cars, but have not effectively addressed air quality and greenhouse gas emissions. The argument is made that these tools will continue to fail if cost effectiveness is prioritized. The curr_chunk discusses different views on highway funding allocation, with one view suggesting that urban regions receive more transit funding to compensate for less highway funding. Another view argues that rural areas receive more highway funding due to greater infrastructure needs. A third view advocates for maintaining the current authority of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) and state Departments of Transportation (DOTs). The curr_chunk discusses the authority of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) and state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) in the hierarchy of the highway system, emphasizing the importance of state control over state-owned roads to address broader transportation and economic needs. MPOs are governed by a board of voting members typically consisting of local elected representatives. MPOs are governed by a board of voting members, including local elected representatives and other appointed members. Voting representation on MPO policy boards varies, with criticism of unequal representation due to malapportionment. Malapportionment in MPOs leads to over-representation of suburban residents over central city residents, resulting in under-representation of racial and ethnic minorities in decision-making. Only 16 out of 50 urbanized areas provide voting weighted by population, with central city populations receiving only 29% of votes despite making up 59% of residents. Suburban residents, on the other hand, make up 26% of the population but receive 55% of the votes. The study revealed that racial and ethnic minorities are underrepresented on MPO voting boards, with non-Hispanic white members dominating. This imbalance leads to a skewed allocation of funding towards transit, with suburban areas receiving more votes and directing less funding to transit projects. Less funds are directed to transit in the MPO budget due to malapportionment, but it may not significantly impact decision-making. Many MPOs operate on a consensus basis, and voting based on population size is rarely used. This prevents the most populous jurisdiction from dominating the MPO, giving a voice to less populous areas that may be geographically large or rapidly growing. MPO decisions regarding minority and low-income populations are also influenced by federal laws like Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and Executive Order 12898. Federal laws and regulations, such as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and Executive Order 12898, require MPOs to develop public participation plans to address the needs of underserved populations like low-income and minority households. MPO certification reviews ensure compliance with these requirements, although critics argue that enforcement through certification is weak and rarely used. Congress could potentially alter local representation and participation in Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) by requiring voting on MPO boards to be proportional to the population of member jurisdictions. Another option is to strengthen federal certification requirements for MPOs, particularly those in Transportation Management Areas (TMAs), to better incorporate public participation. MPOs need to enhance public participation and diversity in board membership. Congress could provide funding for DOT to develop techniques for achieving these goals. Many MPOs lack the technical capacity and funding to meet federal planning requirements. Many Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) struggle with limited staff and resources, often relying on state DOTs for support. A key challenge is meeting the increasingly complex modeling requirements for forecasting travel growth and air quality conformity. Despite growing federal requirements, funding for model development has decreased. One solution could be increased federal funding for planning activities, including model development and data acquisition. Increasing federal funding for planning activities, such as model development and data collection, is suggested to address the challenges faced by Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs). This could involve raising the deduction from highway programs or providing more flexibility in the use of federal planning funds. MPOs also face constraints in utilizing all their apportioned federal planning funds due to local matching share requirements. One option is to increase the federal share from the current 80%, although this may impact support from state and local governments. One approach to address the challenges faced by Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) is to increase FHWA and FTA technical support, potentially by reducing federal requirements for metropolitan planning. This could involve raising the population threshold for creating an MPO or dropping the requirements for developing long-range plans. The STAA has proposed increasing the threshold to 100,000 residents, while maintaining existing MPOs between 50,000 and 100,000 residents as required by current law. Some suggest dropping long-range planning requirements due to unpredictable future conditions. However, infrastructure projects last longer than 20 years, so considering long-term impacts is important. Criticisms of federal transportation policy include ignoring effects on urban land use development and funding divisions into highway and transit \"silos.\" Federal transportation policy is criticized for favoring road building in rural and newly urbanizing areas, leading to low-density development and car dependency. The solution proposed is to focus on solving metropolitan region problems and integrating transportation, housing, and environmental policies to encourage transit-oriented development. Transit-oriented development (TOD) aims to provide various transportation options like automobile, transit, bicycling, and walking for accessing work and amenities. It can reduce vehicle-miles traveled, lower household transportation costs, and promote sustainable communities. The Obama Administration's Interagency Partnership for Sustainable Communities involves DOT, HUD, and EPA to improve access to affordable housing and transportation options while protecting the environment nationwide. The Obama Administration's Interagency Partnership for Sustainable Communities aims to enhance integrated planning and investment in metropolitan areas by providing planning grants. These grants are similar to the Transportation, Community, and System Preservation Program established in TEA-21 and continued in SAFETEA, which provide small discretionary grants for research and planning to address transportation, community, and system preservation plans. The Transportation, Community, and System Preservation Program (TCSP) aims to improve relationships between communities and systems through private sector initiatives. TCSP grants are typically awarded through congressional earmarks, with some exceptions. However, the lack of a clear purpose for the program makes it challenging to evaluate project success and overall program effectiveness. The new planning grants for sustainability and livability initiatives lack clear understanding and criteria for distribution. Funding sources like the FTA are using existing program funds for these initiatives, but the limited amounts are already designated for transit projects. Congress may question the effectiveness and accountability of these initiatives without proper legislation in place. In surface transportation reauthorization, new authority and resources may come from climate change legislation. One proposal suggests that metropolitan areas develop 20-year Regional Blueprint plans to coordinate transportation investments with land use strategies. Plans would need approval from state, DOT, EPA, and review from HUD and Department of Health and Human Services. The STAA proposes to provide MPOs with federal funding directly and adds factors for consideration in the planning process such as sustainability, reducing GHG emissions, and improving public health. MPOs would need to develop performance measures to meet set targets, aligning with climate change legislation in Congress. The Clean, Low Emission, Affordable, New Transportation Efficiency Act (CLEANTEA) was introduced in 2009 as a transportation-related aspect of climate change mitigation. It includes a new fund from the auction of GHG emission allowances, requirements for states and MPOs to develop GHG reduction plans, and the use of funds for planning and implementing projects. H.R. 2454 allocates 1% of auctioned funds for transportation, while S. 575 / H.R. 1329 proposes 10% for transportation purposes. Controversy surrounds whether GHG emission reduction plans must be approved by the EPA. The provision for EPA oversight in transportation projects was included in H.R. 2454 but later dropped. Environmentalists support EPA oversight for stricter limits, while the transportation community opposes it for fear of delays and favoritism towards environmental goals. Different views exist on promoting denser, transit-oriented development for sustainability, with concerns about housing affordability. The debate over urban development and transportation policies revolves around the impact on housing affordability, transit usage, and greenhouse gas emissions. Analysts argue that promoting denser, transit-oriented development may hinder mobility and lead to more highway congestion. They suggest that reducing emissions can be achieved through technological advancements like plug-in hybrids rather than changing travel behavior, which they believe could harm regional economies. Urban development and transit funding are crucial due to concerns about GHG emissions and climate change. EPA reports that transportation accounted for 28% of GHG emissions in the US in 2007, with highway vehicles responsible for 23%. Analysts argue that reducing vehicle miles traveled is necessary to decrease GHG emissions, with compact development potentially reducing the need to drive by 20-40%. The special study committee of TRB found that denser urban development could lower household VMT by 5 to 12 percent, possibly up to 25% with additional measures. However, doubling residential densities by 2050 is challenging due to local control over land use and concerns about congestion and taxes. The committee believes that compact, mixed-use development could reduce VMT, energy use, and CO2 emissions. The committee found that compact, mixed-use development could reduce VMT, energy use, and CO2 emissions by up to 11% by 2050. There are concerns about the feasibility of changes in development patterns and public policies to achieve these reductions. Congress may need to consider whether MPOs should be required to develop long-range plans, with critics arguing for a focus on short-term TIP instead. The long-range planning process is led by professional planners aiming to change travel behavior through smart growth solutions and subsidizing non-automobile modes of transportation. Critics argue that federal requirements for long-range planning are impractical due to the unknowable future factors involved. They suggest focusing on short-term planning and making project decisions based on political rather than rational grounds. The planning process should focus on short-term goals, incentivize transportation agencies to improve outcomes, and promote user-fee-based funding. Incorporating freight transportation needs into planning is crucial, but there is a lack of clear mandate in federal law. Public outreach is required, but the freight community is often not involved meaningfully. Some suggest making freight plans a mandatory component of statewide and metropolitan transportation planning. The need to incorporate freight transportation into planning is highlighted, with suggestions for making freight plans mandatory in statewide and metropolitan transportation plans. Recommendations include federal funding for states and MPOs to hire freight experts and the development of national transportation and multi-state freight corridor plans. The STAA proposes new requirements for transportation planning, including a National Transportation Strategic Plan, state freight plans, and freight corridor plans. Funding would be provided for up to ten freight corridor coalitions to develop these plans, involving representatives from various transportation entities. The plans must align with existing long-range transportation plans. The STAA proposes new requirements for transportation planning, including a National Transportation Strategic Plan, state freight plans, and freight corridor plans. This could lead to potential challenges in coordinating and aligning multiple layers of planning, potentially hindering transportation system improvements. America has undergone a \"metropolitan revolution\" since World War II, transitioning from tightly drawn regions to a sprawling, decentralized development pattern. The metropolitan areas have transitioned from a central core to an amorphous sprawl without a unifying hub or culture, leading to increasing fragmentation of governance. This decentralization has resulted in numerous local governments within metropolitan regions, impacting economic efficiency and competitiveness. Despite the challenges posed by governmental fragmentation, there is a significant interdependence between places in a metropolitan area that affects regional issues like transportation congestion. Regional governance in metropolitan areas has been enhanced through state-granted power of annexation and multijurisdictional consolidation to address transportation congestion and governmental fragmentation. For example, Houston expanded by 65% between 1960 and 1990 through annexation, while the City of Indianapolis consolidated with Marion County. The consolidation of the City of Indianapolis and Marion County in 1970 reduced governmental fragmentation. Powers to annex and consolidate are weak in many states, but the development of special-purpose regional bodies like MPOs could help enhance regional governance. Strengthened MPOs may offer a way to reduce metropolitan governance fragmentation, leading some to advocate for Congress to enhance their authority and resources."
