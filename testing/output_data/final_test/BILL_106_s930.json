The Department will retain ownership of Jean Airport and maintain it as a general aviation airport. The land described in subsection (a) may be conveyed in parcels over a period of up to 20 years for airport construction and development.

During a 5-year period starting 20 years after the first parcel conveyance for airport development, the Secretary can reclaim the land if no progress is made. This decision must be recorded after a hearing. The Secretary can reclaim land if no progress is made after a hearing, refunding the Department for the parcel.
