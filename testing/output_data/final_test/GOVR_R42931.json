    "content": "Global health has become a priority in U.S. foreign policy, with appropriations for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) increasing significantly. Congressional funding for NTDs grew from $15 million in FY2006 to $100 million in FY2014, with a request for $86.5 million in FY2015. Congressional interest in combating NTDs is evident through higher appropriations and the establishment of caucuses focused on these issues. The House and Senate Malaria Caucuses expanded to include NTDs in 2009 and 2012, respectively. Tropical diseases primarily occur in the tropics, with 17 classified as \"neglected\" by the World Health Organization. Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affect the poorest people in 149 countries, primarily where access to clean water and health services is limited. 7 NTDs account for 90% of the global burden, including intestinal worms, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, trachoma, and onchocerciasis. Control efforts involve individual treatment and mass drug administration. The seven most common neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) can be treated with mass drug administration (MDA), but complex transmission cycles make elimination challenging. Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are contracted through contact with worm eggs in soil, requiring access to sanitation facilities to interrupt transmission. WHO recommends a five-pronged strategy for NTD control, including MDA and innovative disease management. Global efforts to combat neglected tropical diseases have accelerated since WHO coined the term in 2003. The Global Plan to Combat Neglected Tropical Diseases set goals for control, elimination, and eradication by 2015, with a Roadmap in 2012 highlighting progress and new targets for 2020. Guinea worm disease has been nearly eliminated, endemic in only four countries by 2012. Since 2012, guinea worm disease has been nearly eliminated, with 97% of cases in South Sudan. Progress has been noted with only 10 cases reported from January to April 2014. Sleeping sickness cases fell by over 70% from 1995 to 2012. In 2012, a commitment to combat neglected tropical diseases was affirmed in London with the signing of the London Declaration. In 2020, the Roadmap outlined goals for donor commitments, including $785 million for drug distribution, 1.4 billion drug treatments annually, access to drug compound libraries, and increased financial support for NTD programs. Donors provided nearly 1.35 billion NTD treatments in 2013, up from 995 million in 2011. However, treatment access rates vary per disease and region, with an estimated 1.4 billion people lacking access to treatments. In 2012, treatment rates for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) varied by region, with 37% of children with soil-transmitted helminths (STH) receiving deworming treatment. Pharmaceutical companies have donated medicines for most NTDs, but a $1.4 billion funding gap remains. An additional $200 million annually is needed between 2014 and 2020 for drug delivery and program costs. Research and development (R&D) for new treatments, vaccines, and testing supplies are also crucial. Concerns arise about drug resistance in STHs like hookworm. Existing tools may not meet 2020 goals, highlighting the urgent need for additional resources. There is an urgent need for additional drug treatments and vaccines for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) that are difficult to treat and costly to manage. Patients require specialized care at well-equipped health facilities, which may not be available in affected countries. Additionally, exposed populations need systematic screening as these diseases are generally asymptomatic. Dengue is also a growing global health problem, leading to serious illness and death among children in certain regions. Dengue is a leading cause of serious illness and death among children in some Asian and Latin American countries, with over 2.5 billion people at risk of infection. Between 50 million and 100 million people contract the disease annually, and it is now endemic in more than 100 countries. Dengue has been detected in several U.S. states and territories, including Florida, Texas, and Puerto Rico. There is no specific treatment or vaccine for dengue, but early detection and proper care can reduce fatality rates from about 20% to less than 1%. Congress has taken steps to encourage drug development for certain diseases, including NTDs. The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 and the Rare Diseases Act of 2002 defined rare diseases as those affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the US. These acts led to the approval of 26 drugs in 2012. The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 created a priority review voucher to incentivize drug development for tropical diseases, allowing for a priority review of another drug product. The FDA draft guidance describes diseases covered by the Priority Review Voucher (PRV), including tropical diseases like cholera, malaria, and tuberculosis. Some neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) listed by WHO are excluded. U.S. institutions supporting global NTD control efforts include USAID, CDC, NIH, and Department of Defense. The USAID-managed NTD Program was launched in 2006 by the Bush Administration in response to congressional support for addressing neglected diseases. Various organizations and companies, including the Gates Foundation and Merck, play important roles in combating NTDs. The NTD Program, launched in 2006, aimed to integrate treatment for multiple NTDs and expand access to drugs. President George W. Bush committed $350 million to expand the program to 30 countries, while President Barack Obama made it a priority to administer 1 billion NTD treatments and halve the prevalence of the seven most common NTDs by 2013. The Obama Administration announced reaching one billion NTD treatments, surpassing goals. USAID spent over $370 million on global NTD programs from FY2007 to FY2013. Congress allocated $100 million for NTD programs in FY2014, with a $86.5 million request for FY2015. Progress has been made in combating select neglected tropical diseases, with Guinea worm disease close to eradication. The WHO 2020 Roadmap emphasizes the need for global access to clean water and sanitation to eradicate NTDs. The United States has been instrumental in combating these diseases and is expected to play a key role in achieving the 2020 NTD goals. The 113th Congress may need to consider various issues in reaching these goals, including improving hygiene practices and strengthening local health capacity. Experts emphasize the importance of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) in controlling neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Improved WASH can reduce the prevalence of NTDs like soil-transmitted helminths, schistosomiasis, and trachoma. Investments in water and sanitation are crucial for addressing NTDs that cannot be eliminated by drugs alone. Investments in water and sanitation are crucial for addressing neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and achieving global goals. The international community aimed to halve the number of people without access to clean water and basic sanitation by 2015 through the Millennium Development Goals. The estimated cost to meet global water and sanitation targets was $72 billion annually, with $54 billion needed for maintenance. In 2010, OECD members committed $7.8 billion to improve global access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Increased investments in WASH are necessary as mass drug administration alone cannot eliminate NTDs. The administration emphasizes the importance of integrated vector management in combating neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and improving the health of women and children. They plan to expand drug provision for soil-transmitted helminths (STH) in children through USAID-supported education programs. The Obama Administration highlights the connection between water, sanitation, and global health. The Administration categorizes water and sanitation programs as a \"cross-cutting area\" under global health but provides limited information on how these programs advance global health efforts. In the FY2013 budget request, water programs are primarily funded through Development Assistance (DA) and Economic Support Fund (ESF) accounts, with only 12% of funds coming from the Global Health Programs account. This separation suggests a lack of integration between water and sanitation programs and global health projects. The U.S. NTD Program primarily focuses on mass drug administration (MDA) despite recognizing the importance of a comprehensive approach. The 113th Congress may consider applying an intersectoral approach to the program without necessarily increasing spending, by improving integration of health and development programs. Pharmaceutical companies have donated sufficient supplies for NTD control and elimination. Pharmaceutical companies have donated NTD medicines, but over 60% of those in need lack access. Weak health systems in endemic countries hinder drug delivery. Streamlining treatments is crucial, with efforts to integrate services for multiple diseases. LF and STH can be treated with the same medication, and partnerships with schools are being formed for treatment programs. Some providers partner with schools to combine LF and STH treatment with feeding programs. Concerns arise over declining deworming rates in young children. Weak health systems in affected countries limit NTD program effectiveness. Critics argue that disease-specific programs divert resources from overall health systems, while supporters highlight measurable progress in reducing associated deaths. Advocates debate the effectiveness of vertical disease programs, with evidence supporting both sides. Funding for pharmaceutical R&D for NTDs is considered insufficient, hindering private development of vaccines and drugs due to the lack of a viable commercial market. NTDs primarily affect the poorest in developing countries who cannot afford drugs, leading to reluctance from drug manufacturers to invest in costly discovery processes. The average time for a drug to reach approval in the United States is 6 to 10 years. Some analysts question the financial incentives provided by the PRV for NTD products. Only two companies, Novartis and Johnson & Johnson, have received the voucher. Novartis did not see a market return as their drug application failed to win FDA approval. Johnson & Johnson has not yet used their voucher earned in 2012. Market analysts believe the utility of the voucher will remain uncertain until it is sold and has a clear market value. It is unclear if the PRV alone will provide enough incentive for drug development. Congressional interest in strategic investments for drug development incentives may focus on prioritizing neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) with serious clinical outcomes that lack treatment options or affect a large number of individuals. This includes diseases like Buruli ulcer, Chagas disease, human African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniases, leprosy, yaws, and dengue. Developing vaccines and diagnostic tools for NTDs, such as a vaccine for rabies, could be prioritized. Additionally, investing in diagnostic tools for diseases that are difficult to detect, like Buruli ulcer, and advancing promising treatments already in development, such as a vaccine for certain diseases, could be beneficial. Advancing promising treatments like a vaccine for certain filarial infections could be beneficial."
