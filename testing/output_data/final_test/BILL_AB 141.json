    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the importance of mentoring and assessment for effective teaching. Induction programs help new teachers transition into the profession with individualized support. California established the Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment program in 1998 to support new teachers. Until 2009, the state provided funding for this program. In 2009, the state granted LEAs flexibility with Teacher Credentialing Block Grant funds during the Great Recession. In 2013, the state eliminated K-12 categorical programs, including the Teacher Credentialing Block Grant, with the LCFF. Some induction providers shifted costs onto teachers or closed programs. According to data from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, 12 percent of providers charge teachers around $2,000 annually for induction programs. These high fees create financial burdens for new teachers and hinder their access to quality induction programs, impacting their professional growth and retention in the teaching profession. Enrollment in teacher preparation programs has significantly decreased in recent years, with fewer than 20,000 students enrolled in 2013 compared to over 40,000 in 2008. The teacher shortage is expected to worsen in the next 20 years due to increased student enrollment and teacher retirements. Access to high-quality induction programs is crucial for addressing this shortage, as shown by data from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing in 2008. The effectiveness of induction is demonstrated by the 87 percent retention rate of teachers who participated in a BTSA program. The Governor and Legislature allocated $490 million in the 2015-16 Budget Act to support educator quality and effectiveness through mentoring and support for new teachers and administrators. The 2015\u201316 Budget Act directs the Commission on Teacher Credentialing to evaluate existing induction requirements and propose funding recommendations by September 1, 2015. Section 44259 of the Education Code is amended to limit professional preparation for teaching credentials to two years. This aims to support new teachers and improve the quality of induction programs. To become a teacher in California, one must have a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution, not in professional education, and pass the state basic skills proficiency test administered by the commission. The commission also encourages institutions to offer minors in education and special education for aspiring teachers. Professional preparation programs accredited by the Committee on Accreditation must meet standards set by the commission, including a teaching performance assessment aligned with California Standards for the Teaching Profession. Candidates must demonstrate the ability to help students meet academic standards. Integrated programs of subject matter and professional preparation are recommended. The postbaccalaureate and internship programs for professional preparation must include the study of alternative methods for developing English language skills, focusing on reading skills such as phonemic awareness, phonics, and decoding. This instruction must be research-based and meet the commission's standards for program quality and effectiveness. A program for professional preparation must include a strong emphasis on language and comprehension skills, ongoing diagnostic techniques, early intervention, guided clinical practice, and direct, systematic, explicit phonics instruction. The program for a multiple subjects credential should also cover integrated methods for teaching language arts. To obtain a teaching credential, one must complete an approved subject matter program or pass a subject matter examination, demonstrate knowledge of the US Constitution, and show basic competency in using computers in the classroom. The minimum requirements for the clear multiple or single subject teaching credential include possession of a valid preliminary teaching credential or equivalent, and completion of a program of beginning teacher induction approved by the commission and the Superintendent. Beginning teachers must participate in an approved induction program without being charged a fee, starting from the 2016-17 school year. This includes teachers with preliminary teaching credentials. An alternative program of beginning teacher induction provided by local educational agencies must be approved by the commission and the Superintendent based on set standards. Beginning teachers cannot be charged a fee to participate in this program. An alternative program of beginning teacher induction, sponsored by a regionally accredited college or university in cooperation with local school districts, must meet the commission's standards. Beginning teachers cannot be charged a fee to participate in this program. The commission will determine if a candidate has met requirements for a teaching credential through completion of an accredited internship program or an approved clear credential program after a baccalaureate degree. Regulations will be adopted to implement this. The commission will determine if a candidate has met requirements for a teaching credential through completion of an accredited internship program or an approved clear credential program after a baccalaureate degree. Experience required includes health education, field experience with pupils with exceptional needs, and advanced computer-based technology training. The commission develops standards for program quality in education, including technology use. Credentials issued before 1993 remain valid unless replaced with a new credential. (f) A credential program approved by the commission cannot deny access based solely on obtaining a teaching credential through an accredited internship program. (g) Individuals performing teaching services before January 1, 1999, under previous requirements, are exempt from new requirements added by amendments. As of January 1, 1997, individuals with a teaching credential or enrolled in a teaching credential program are exempt from certain requirements. The Legislature intends for new requirements to apply only to those entering a program after January 1, 1997."
