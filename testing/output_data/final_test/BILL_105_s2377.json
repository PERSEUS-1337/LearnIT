    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Clean Gasoline Act of 1998\". According to Congress, motor vehicles are a significant source of air pollution in the United States, contributing to nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and carbon monoxide emissions. Gasoline with high sulfur concentration negatively impacts catalytic converter function, and reducing sulfur levels in gasoline can improve vehicle emissions. Recent studies by AAMA, AIMA, and the Coordinating Research Council confirm that sulfur in vehicle fuel impairs emission controls of LEVs and ULEVs, reducing hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxide emissions. Sulfur-induced impairment of advanced emission control systems is not fully reversible. Industry research shows that lowering gasoline sulfur levels from 330 ppm to 40 ppm reduces hydrocarbon emissions by 34%, carbon monoxide emissions by 43%, and nitrogen oxide emissions by 51%. Failure to control sulfur in gasoline will hinder the adoption of more fuel-efficient technologies. The technology for removing sulfur from fuel is readily available and cost-effective, with gasoline sulfur levels in the US averaging between 300 and 350 ppm, far higher than many other countries. The European Union recently approved a standard of 150 ppm. The European Union approved a standard of 150 ppm sulfur in fuel to be phased down to 30-50 ppm by 2005. Japan has a 50 ppm standard, while California regulates sulfur concentration in all gasoline sold with a 40 ppm per gallon maximum or a 30 ppm per gallon annual average. The California Air Resources Board credits low sulfur gasoline with reducing ozone levels by 10-12% in various regions, stating that reducing sulfur concentration in gasoline is a cost-effective pollution prevention measure with immediate benefits for air quality. Unlike vehicle hardware requirements, sulfur control produces immediate emission reductions across the vehicle fleet. Sulfur concentration requirements for gasoline are outlined in Section 3. Sulfur concentration requirements for gasoline are amended in Section 211 of the Clean Air Act to limit sulfur content to 40 parts per million per gallon of gasoline. Compliance can be measured using an alternative method. The Clean Air Act limits sulfur content in motor vehicle gasoline to 40 parts per million per gallon. A person can avoid violation by keeping the average sulfur concentration below 30 parts per million per gallon during a 1-year period. The Administrator may establish lower sulfur concentrations in motor vehicle gasoline through regulations if research shows air quality benefits or advanced vehicle technologies reduce emissions. The Clean Air Act allows for the reduction of air pollutants from motor vehicles by requiring gasoline with lower sulfur concentrations. Penalties and injunctions under the Act are amended to include these new requirements. The Clean Air Act mandates the use of low sulfur motor vehicle gasoline to reduce air pollutants. The Administrator of the EPA must report to Congress on the impact of this gasoline on urban and regional air quality within 6 to 8 years of the Act's enactment."
