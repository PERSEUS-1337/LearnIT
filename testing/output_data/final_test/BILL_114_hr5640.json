    "content": "The \"Electricity Storage Innovation Act\" is also known as the \"Electricity Storage Basic Research Initiative\" under Section 975 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Electricity Storage Basic Research Initiative aims to expand knowledge on controlling, storing, and converting electrical energy. It supports scientific inquiry into chemical and physical processes within various systems. The initiative leverages expertise and resources from different programs within the Office of Science and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. The Secretary will organize multidisciplinary teams for the Electricity Storage Basic Research Initiative, leveraging expertise from various sectors. Additional activities may be organized through different organizational structures. The Secretary will carry out a program to support research on multivalent ion materials in electric energy storage systems as part of the Electricity Storage Basic Research Initiative. This includes investigating electrochemical properties, dynamics of materials, charge transfer phenomena, and mass transport. The Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy will support translational research and development of physical concepts in this area. The Secretary will review program activities to determine technical milestones achievement. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2017 through 2020 is $50,000,000 from Basic Energy Sciences Program account and $25,000,000 from Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy account. No funds can be used for commercial application of energy technology. The Secretary will review program activities to determine technical milestones achievement. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2017 through 2020 is $50,000,000 from Basic Energy Sciences Program account and $25,000,000 from Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy account. No funds can be used for commercial application of energy technology. The Secretary shall carry out a program to support research on modeling and simulating organic electrolytes at the molecular and atomic level in monovalent and multivalent systems. High performance computational tools will be developed to maximize the effectiveness of computing systems. The Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy will support translational research, development, and validation of physical concepts. The Secretary will review program activities to determine technical milestones achievement. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2017 through 2020 is $30,000,000 from Basic Energy Sciences Program and Advanced Scientific Computing Research Program accounts. The Secretary will carry out a program to support research on mesoscale electrochemistry as part of the Electricity Storage Basic Research Initiative. This includes studying electrochemistry in confined spaces for bio-electrochemistry and energy conversion and storage. No funds can be used for commercial energy technology applications. The Director and Associate Director will investigate mesoscale electrochemical confinement to replicate new behavior. The Assistant Secretary will support research and development of physical concepts. The Secretary will review program activities for technical milestones and authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2017 through. The subsection authorizes funds from various programs for fiscal years 2017-2020, with a prohibition on commercial application of energy technology. No additional funds are authorized, and existing funds will be used. The House of Representatives passed the Electricity Storage Basic Research Initiative on July 11, 2016."
