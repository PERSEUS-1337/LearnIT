    "content": "The Future of Healthcare--Granting Access to Innovation in America Act (GAIA Act) aims to address preventable deaths caused by medical errors in the United States, particularly medication errors. According to findings, there are 98,000 preventable deaths each year from medication errors, making it the 6th leading cause of death in American hospitals. The Act focuses on implementing computerized provider order entry technology to improve patient safety. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may provide grants to hospitals and skilled nursing facilities for demonstration projects to reduce medication errors and improve care quality through computerized technology. This technology includes features like drug-allergy information, legible drug orders, and medication menus for clinicians. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may provide grants for hospitals and skilled nursing facilities to reduce medication errors and improve care quality through computerized technology, including decision-support software requirements for CPOE technology. The software described in this paragraph assists physicians and clinicians in making medication-related decisions by providing advice on drug doses, performing checks for drug allergies and interactions, providing reminders, and incorporating patient-specific information. The software described assists physicians in medication decisions by providing advice on drug doses, checking for allergies and interactions, giving reminders, and incorporating patient-specific information. Grants for electronic medication administration records require the installation of specific software for use with CPOE technology within a specified timeframe. The software described in the grant includes an electronic medication administration record (EMAR) that documents drug details and acts as a scheduler. Grant funds can be used for purchasing CPOE technology and decision-support software. Facilities with previously installed CPOE technology may receive a grant for updating and training on decision-support software and EMAR. The goal is to achieve 100% compliance among physicians and clinicians. Matching requirements apply for grants under subsection (a). The applicant must agree to provide non-Federal contributions towards the costs of the project as determined by the Secretary. Contributions can be in cash or in kind, and may come from public or private entities. The amount of non-Federal contribution required can include equipment or services, but not indirect or overhead costs. The applicant must agree to provide non-Federal contributions towards the project costs as determined by the Secretary. Contributions can be in cash or in kind from public or private entities, excluding indirect or overhead costs. A grant under subsection (a) requires the submission of reports detailing quantitative reductions in medication errors, compliance with CPOE technology usage, workflow changes before and after technology implementation, and improvements in workflow. The grant application for CPOE technology improvements in healthcare facilities must be submitted to the Secretary with necessary information. Grants are limited to $500,000. The Secretary must report to Congress on the progress of the program within five years of distributing grants exceeding $500,000. Definitions for terms like \"barcode point-of-care,\" \"CPOE technology,\" and \"decision-support software\" are provided in the Act. The terms related to computer software, electronic medication administration record, rural hospital, rural skilled nursing facility, Secretary, and skilled nursing facility are defined in the Act. Funding authorization is also addressed. Funding authorization of $25,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2006-2010 for CPOE technology and decision-support software grants. Fifty percent allocated for initial purchase and installation, remaining fifty percent for other grants. (C) Fifty percent of the funding is allocated for upgrading technology and software, as well as for other authorized purposes. Twenty percent is designated for grants to rural hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, including amounts reserved for rural facilities under previous allocations."
