The \"Taxpayer's Defense Act\" includes a section on mandatory congressional review of rules related to taxes. Any rule that establishes or increases a tax must not take effect before a specific bill is enacted and is not subject to review under certain conditions. Agencies must submit a report to Congress when promulgating such rules. Section 815 requires agencies to submit a report for each rule they promulgate, including a concise statement of the rule's basis and purpose. Section 817 outlines the process for introducing a bill in Congress after the agency report is submitted. A bill introduced in Congress must be referred to the appropriate committees within 7 legislative days. The committees must report the bill without amendment within 30 calendar days of its introduction, or a motion to discharge the committee can be made by a Member favoring the bill. After a bill is reported or a committee has been discharged from further consideration, a motion can be made to resolve into the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for consideration of the bill. Debate on the motion is limited to 1 hour, divided equally between proponents and opponents, with the previous question ordered on the motion without a chance for reconsideration. During consideration of the bill in the Committee of the Whole, general debate is limited to 1 hour and divided equally between proponents and opponents. The bill shall be considered as read for amendment under the 5-minute rule. After the consideration of the bill, the Committee shall report it to the House without intervening motion. The previous question shall be ordered on the bill to final passage without intervening motion. Any bill introduced in the Senate shall be referred to the appropriate committee or committees. The committee must report the bill without amendment within 30 days of its introduction. If a committee fails to do so, it will be discharged from further consideration of the bill. Bills received from the House of Representatives in the Senate will not be referred to committee and will be placed on the calendar. After no more than 10 hours of consideration, the Senate shall proceed to vote on the final disposition of a bill, excluding all motions except a motion to reconsider or table. A single motion to extend the time for consideration by 5 hours is allowed. The time for debate on the bill shall be limited. The time for debate on a disapproval bill is divided between the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader. A motion to recommit a bill is not allowed. If the Senate has read a bill for the third time, they can proceed to consider a bill with a special message from the House without further debate. Consideration of motions, amendments, or appeals on a House bill is limited to 4 hours in the Senate. Representatives on a bill are limited to 4 hours of debate. Debate on motions or amendments is limited to 30 minutes, while debate on appeals or points of order related to House messages is limited to 20 minutes. Time for debate is divided equally between proponents and managers, unless the majority manager is also a proponent, in which case the minority manager controls opposition time. Technical amendments are made to Chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, including the addition of \"SUBCHAPTER I--DISCRETIONARY CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW\" and \"subchapter ii--mandatory review of certain rules.\" Section 804 is amended to replace \"this chapter\" with \"this subchapter.\""
