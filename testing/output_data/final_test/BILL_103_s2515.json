It amends Section 110(5) of title 17, United States Code, regarding the communication of a transmission embodying a performance or display of a work in commercial establishments. SEC. 3. BINDING ARBITRATION OF RATE DISPUTES INVOLVING PERFORMING RIGHTS SOCIETIES; ACCESS TO REPERTOIRE. Section 504 of title 17, United States Code, is amended to include a new subsection allowing for binding arbitration between music users and performing rights societies to determine fair fees for music performances. In cases of infringement involving licensed musical works, the defendant can admit prior use. In cases of infringement involving licensed musical works, a performing rights society can request court annexed arbitration to determine fair fees for music performances. The arbitrator will decide the full amount owed by the defendant for past use of music, not exceeding a fair and reasonable license fee. Additionally, the arbitrator may determine a fair fee for music performance using part of the licensed music for up to 5 years. Performing rights societies and organizations must provide free online access to their music repertoires, including details like the title of the work, author information, copyright status, and artists who performed the work. Additionally, certain actions related to music licensing disputes must be referred to arbitration under the amended Section 652 of title 28, United States Code. Actions for infringement of the right granted in section 106(4) of title 17 involving a licensed nondramatic musical work by a performing rights society may be referred to arbitration if the defendant disputes the license fee demanded.
