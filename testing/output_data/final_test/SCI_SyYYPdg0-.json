    "content": "We leverage the natural compositional structure of images to learn object segmentation with weakly labeled images. By developing a generative model that decomposes images into layers, we can remove objects and still produce natural-looking images. This approach outperforms baselines in automatically learning object segmentation from images labeled only by scene. In this paper, a novel approach is developed to automatically learn object segmentation from images labeled only by scene category. By generating counterfactual images and training a model to remove objects while maintaining perceptual realism, object segmentation is achieved. A stochastic layered model is used to decompose images into layers for this purpose. The model is trained to reconstruct input images by combining layers in different orders, while still appearing realistic even when layers are randomly permuted or removed. It automatically learns to isolate objects in different layers, leading to improved segmentation performance with weakly labeled data. Additionally, a small amount of densely labeled data further enhances performance. Our approach utilizes a small amount of densely labeled data to enhance performance in object segmentation. The model can generate scenes behind objects, allowing for the removal of specific image regions. This method capitalizes on natural compositional structures in images and can be applied to other signals like audio. The paper discusses related work, presents the auto-encoding method for images, showcases experiments on semantic segmentation, and concludes with future plans to release code, data, and models. In this paper, the authors propose a method for image segmentation that leverages the observation that removing random patches from an image results in unnatural images. They aim to segment objects in images without requiring pixel-wise labeled data, unlike previous methods that rely on manual supervision.

The authors propose a method for image segmentation that does not require pixel-wise labeled data. They leverage layered models to segment images without human supervision, decomposing images into separate layers for segmentation. This approach differs from previous methods that require manual supervision and can work across multiple images. Our work involves randomly dropping image layers to encourage semantic segmentation, inspired by emergent representations in neural networks.

The approach includes dropping image layers to encourage segmentation, inspired by emergent representations in neural networks. Our method involves using layered models to automatically generate object segmentation in images without the need for labeled data. We follow an encoder-decoder setup to encode images into a latent code and decode it into image layers. The neural networks generate masks and foreground images to be combined with previous layers, ensuring validity with activation functions. The base case is the background layer. The recursion process in the generation model G K (z) involves adding layers with a certain probability to create a final image. The model is trained to place objects in each layer to maintain perceptual realism. Additional stochasticity is introduced by randomly permuting foreground layers to specialize in objects without enforcing a specific order. The model randomly permutes foreground layers before composing the counterfactual. Each layer specializes in different objects without attaching semantics. The generator is trained to fool the discriminator using generative adversarial networks. The network can automatically learn object decomposition and boundaries. The network can learn object decomposition and boundaries by inferring latent codes through an encoder trained to reconstruct codes from sampled scenes. This strategy aims for a more semantic reconstruction rather than pixel-wise accuracy. The parameters of neural networks D, E, and G are learned jointly to optimize the process. To optimize the parameters of neural networks D, E, and G jointly, we use a min-max objective with alternating minimization and maximization steps. The objective is similar to a generative adversarial network but includes an encoder E. By training on unlabeled images within a scene category, the model learns to auto-encode images and generate realistic images even when layers are randomly removed. The emergent masks of the layers are used for semantic segmentation, resulting in K different masks that can be manually inspected and named. The network architecture used for semantic segmentation prediction involves an encoder with 3 layers of convolutions and a latent vector size of 64 x 4 x 4. The decoder mirrors this architecture with up-convolutions. Training is done with Adam optimizer and includes batch normalization and different activation functions for each component. For object discovery experiments, the model was trained with Adam using a learning rate of 0.0002 and beta 0.5, and for finetuning, a learning rate of 0.00002 was used. The training involved 2 epochs over the dataset for scene categories, with 5 foreground layers and a layer inclusion probability of 0.4. Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the model's performance, including quantitative analysis of layer classification and qualitative decomposition of images into semantic layers. The experiments focused on segmenting objects in bedrooms and kitchens from the LSUN dataset BID29, containing a total of 3,033,042 images. The dataset consists of over 3 million images of bedrooms and kitchens, which are used to train separate models. Images are randomly cropped and scaled for training. Evaluation is done using images and labels from the ADE20K dataset. Training and validation datasets are created for bedrooms and kitchens with a limited number of examples due to annotations availability. Bedrooms and kitchens were chosen as they are the largest scene categories in the LSUN dataset with sufficient labeled examples. For each object category in a scene, binary masks are created from the ADE20K dataset and paired with corresponding images. Labels are combined to form ground truth maps, such as defining beds as a combination of beds, pillows, and comforters. Kitchen appliances are defined as microwaves, ovens, dishwashers, stoves, and sinks. The model is evaluated against baselines using pixel-wise binary classification, with the mask representing the model's confidence in the pixel belonging to the specified category. Experiments are run on scene categories, with average precision reported as the metric. The left image shows successful object mask segmentation, while the right image displays failure cases. The model can segment images without supervision better than baselines and can be fine-tuned with a little labeled data for further improvement. Precision-recall curves show good precision with low recall, indicating accurate segmentations. Layers specialize in certain object categories, with some masks working well for specific objects but not others. The model can segment images without supervision better than baselines and can be fine-tuned with a little labeled data for further improvement. Performance improves with more labeled data. Object decomposition automatically emerges in the model, leading to better segmentation. The model can segment images without supervision, outperforming baselines, and can be fine-tuned with minimal labeled data for better results. Object decomposition naturally occurs in the model, enhancing segmentation quality. The average precision for each layer is computed on the isolated training set in ADE20K, with the best-performing layer selected. Precision-recall curves are graphed for different objects, showing that each mask tends to capture a single object. Mask 5 performs best for bed objects, while mask 4 excels for window objects. Comparisons are made with baselines that lack pixel-level annotations, such as random guessing and autoencoder training with specific parameters. Our model with stochastic compositions outperforms baselines in object segmentation. We experiment with different patch sizes and cluster centers, consistently showing superior performance. Ablation studies reveal that each layer learns to segment different objects independently. After experimenting with different patch sizes and cluster centers, our model showed superior performance in object segmentation. We found that initializing each stream similarly led to a drop in performance, indicating the importance of diverse outputs. By incorporating pixel-level human labels, we improved performance through semi-supervised learning. Additionally, we finetuned masks on the ADE20K training set for each object class and calculated average segmentation for each object category as a baseline. Our approach provides better initialization for supervised segmentation than baselines, outperforming naive priors estimated with labeled data. The model can be trained with much fewer examples in the semi-supervised setting, as shown in our finetuning experiments. Performance varies with the size of the labeled data, with supervised outperforming scratch initialization even with 20% of the training data. The model can be trained with fewer examples, showing performance close to supervised models for the window object class. Layer decomposition visualization shows different layers reconstructing objects and masks for semantic segmentation, enabling graphics applications like de-occluding objects in images. Images are built up layer by layer, showing original input, partial reconstructions, added layers, and layer masks. The visualization of layer decomposition in the model reveals that as the generative model improves, layers can be removed to reveal objects behind them. The model learns to create realistic counterfactual images by capturing various semantics such as lighting and textures. This approach can be beneficial for automatically learning semantic compositions of natural data like images or audio."
