    "content": "The \"Competitive Service Act of 2015\" provides additional appointing authorities for competitive service. The \"Competitive Service Act of 2015\" amends Section 3318 of title 5, United States Code, to provide other appointing authorities during a 240-day period for selecting individuals for appointments to positions in the same occupational series as the original position. The \"Competitive Service Act of 2015\" allows appointing authorities to share a certificate of eligibles for similar grade level positions. Selection must comply with subsection (a) and can be made without additional posting. Internal notice is required before selecting an individual. Before selecting an individual for a position, the appointing authority must provide internal notice, allow employees to apply for up to 10 business days, and review their qualifications. This process does not limit any collective bargaining obligations of the agency. Title 5, United States Code, is amended to allow appointing officials to select applicants from the highest quality category or a merged category if fewer than 3 candidates are in the highest category. Other appointing officials can also select applicants under certain regulations. The certification of eligibles can be shared with another appointing authority if the original position announcement allowed it. Selection of an individual must comply with specific requirements and may not require additional posting under section 3327. Before selecting an individual for a position, the appointing official must provide internal notice to employees, allow up to 10 business days for them to apply, and review their qualifications. This process must comply with any collective bargaining obligations. The subsection limits collective bargaining obligations for agencies under chapter 71. An appointing official cannot pass over a preference eligible unless specific requirements are met. Technical and conforming amendments are made to sections 3319(c)(2) and 9510(b)(5) of title 5. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management must issue a rule within a year to implement the amendments."
