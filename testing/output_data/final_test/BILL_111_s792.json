    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Improvement of the National Program of Cancer Registries Act\". The National Program of Cancer Registries, established in 1992, has enabled all 50 states to maintain functioning cancer registries. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have improved central cancer registries and set standards for data quality. Statewide registries collect data on cancer rates using electronic records, especially laboratory data. The States lack resources to access all records of healthcare providers for cancer registries, hindering the identification of patient characteristics and treatment. Laboratories do not consistently collect essential data on cancer patients, such as occupation and treatments, impeding the determination of cancer causes. The National Program of Cancer Registries has set standards for data collection but lacks crucial information. The Act aims to enhance the National Program of Cancer Registries by improving data collection standards and ensuring confidentiality while allowing data sharing for public health purposes. AMENDMENTS TO THE NATIONAL PROGRAM OF CANCER REGISTRIES. The text chunk discusses amendments to the National Program of Cancer Registries, specifically focusing on enhancing data collection for various forms of cancer by including information on industrial or occupational history using a standardized approach. The National Program of Cancer Registries is being amended to include data collection on education levels, payment sources for cancer costs, and alcohol and tobacco use history among individuals with cancer. Additionally, data collection standards are being established by the Secretary through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will develop standards for data collection for State cancer registries, create interoperability and security standards for data exchange between cancer registries, and provide a basic electronic collection tool for standardized data collection. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will develop standards for data collection for State cancer registries and ensure coordination with other federally-supported registry programs to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in data collection. Authorization is given to appropriate $100,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2013 to carry out the Act."
