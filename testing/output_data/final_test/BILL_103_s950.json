    "content": "The \"Small Business Assistance and Credit Crunch Relief Act of 1993\" includes provisions such as capital requirement flexibility, regulatory impact analysis for new banking regulations, review of provisions affecting small banks, real estate appraisals, Truth in Lending Act, Community Reinvestment Act, and a paperwork reduction study. The Congress acknowledges the importance of credit availability for small businesses to grow, create new jobs, and purchase equipment. A credit crunch is hindering small businesses from accessing capital, exacerbated by unnecessary federal banking regulations. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms such as \"appropriate Federal banking agency\", \"bank\", \"insured depository institution\", \"savings association\", \"regulatory impact analysis\", and \"small bank\" as institutions with total assets of less than $400,000,000. Section 38(a)(2) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act is amended to require prompt corrective action by Federal banking agencies and the Corporation for resolving issues in insured depository institutions, considering factors like management expertise and recent earnings history. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act is amended to require prompt corrective action by Federal banking agencies and the Corporation for resolving issues in insured depository institutions, considering factors like management expertise, recent earnings history, asset quality, and potential disruption to the local economy. SEC. 5. New federal banking regulations require regulatory impact analysis. New federal banking regulations mandate a regulatory impact analysis before any new regulation can be implemented by a Federal banking agency. The analysis must show that the benefits of the regulation outweigh the costs, including specific considerations for small banks. The definition of a \"new\" regulation includes those promulgated, modified, amended, or reissued after the enactment of the Act. Federal banking agencies must consider the impact of proposed regulations on the national economy, consumers, small businesses, small banks, other financial service users, and new paperwork requirements. When reviewing the benefits of a regulation, agencies must consider benefits to the public, taxpayers, and the overall safety of the banking system. Additionally, agencies should consider easing burdens on small banks in their regulatory impact analysis. The agency should include provisions in the proposed regulation to ease the regulatory burden on small banks, with special compliance considerations. The regulatory impact analysis must estimate the number of small banks and businesses affected by the regulation. SEC. 6. REVIEW OF STATUTORY AND REGULATORY PROVISIONS AFFECTING SMALL BANKS. Each appropriate Federal banking agency must review all statutory and regulatory provisions affecting small banks, analyzing their purposes, effectiveness, alternatives, compliance costs, and impact on credit availability in the United States. The appropriate Federal banking agency must review laws and regulations affecting small banks, analyzing their impact on credit availability. If a determination is made, the agency must recommend suspending laws and regulations that affect small banks. The appropriate Federal banking agency may recommend suspending laws, regulations, or guidelines if they have already achieved their goal, are not as effective as other options, have compliance costs outweighing benefits, or negatively impact credit availability in the US. The appropriate Federal banking agency can suspend federal regulations or guidelines if deemed necessary, with publication in the Federal Register and becoming effective after 30 days, unless a shorter period is justified. Consultation with various agencies is required, and notification must be provided. The appropriate Federal banking agency can suspend regulations or guidelines with notification to relevant committees. However, they cannot recommend suspending laws or regulations essential for the safe operation of depository institutions or those prohibiting discrimination in financial services. The appropriate Federal banking agency can suspend regulations or guidelines related to monetary policy or enforcement proceedings/supervisory actions for specific institutions or parties. SEC. 7 amends the threshold level for real estate appraisals to be not less than $250,000. SEC. 8 adds conditions for credit transactions involving banks or savings associations with assets less than $400,000,000 and consumers with specific income or net worth criteria. SEC. 9 pertains to the Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 is amended to reduce paperwork burden for small banks and prevent denial of deposit facility applications based on compliance with the Act for institutions with assets under $400,000,000. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 is amended to reduce paperwork burden for small banks by adding a new section. The bank received an 'Outstanding' rating on its last evaluation for meeting community credit needs. \"SEC. 809. SMALL BANKS.\" Regulated financial institutions with an 'Outstanding' rating and total assets under $400,000,000 are exempt from documentation requirements, except for new regulations that will reduce paperwork within 30 days of enactment. The appropriate Federal financial supervisory agency will disclose specific criteria for an insured financial institution to secure an 'Outstanding' rating within 30 days of enactment. A regulated financial institution with 'Substantial Noncompliance' rating for 2 or more consecutive years and total assets under $400,000,000 will be subject to a civil penalty. The insured financial institution must not exceed $20,000 and enter into a written agreement with the Federal financial supervisory agency to improve credit needs in the local community. SEC. 10. PAPERWORK REDUCTION STUDY. Federal banking agencies must review the impact of the Act on internal policies and recommend if the Act should be extended. SEC. 11. SUNSET PROVISION. The Act and its amendments will be in effect for 3 years from enactment."
