    "content": "The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that world food prices increased dramatically in the first half of 2008, then fell by nearly 50% in the second half. FAO warns that the recent decline in food prices does not solve the world's food problems, as vulnerable populations still face challenges like high food input costs, poor infrastructure, low agricultural investments, and climate change affecting crop output. In the first half of 2008, higher food prices and poor food supplies in Africa led to social unrest, deepened poverty, and worsened food insecurity. FAO identified 34 countries needing help to feed their populations due to various factors causing food crises. This report focuses on how high food prices impact health in countries with dramatic price increases, with FAO estimating 848 million undernourished people globally in 2006. The 2007 report highlighted that high food prices led to 75 million more people facing hunger, with a total of 923 million undernourished. The World Food Program warned that 10 million people could die annually from hunger or related diseases, with half being children. Malnourished individuals are more susceptible to diseases, and malnourished children may experience stunted growth and learning difficulties. Malnourished individuals, both children and adults, face stunted growth, learning difficulties, and health issues. Acute hunger, accounting for 10% of hunger-related deaths, occurs during disasters or conflicts, while chronic hunger affects about 90% of the undernourished population. Higher food prices endanger the acutely hungry by limiting food access. Higher food prices can lead to the chronically hungry withdrawing children from school, decreasing intake of nutritious foods, and engaging in behaviors that worsen health and deepen poverty. U.S. food aid mainly targets the acutely hungry, while broader global health concerns related to food insecurity affect the impoverished. The World Bank estimates that in 2005, 1.4 billion people lived below the average poverty line found in the poorest developing countries ($1.25 per day) and a further 1.2 billion lived between $1.25 and $2.00 per day. Poor people struggling to feed themselves and their families tend to survive off of diets that are nutritionally deficient, leading to malnourishment and increased susceptibility to disease, especially in children. According to UNICEF, under-nutrition is a leading cause of death among children and mothers. Studies show that malnourished children are more likely to die from infectious diseases, with a higher risk for those who are severely underweight. Malnourishment also increases the likelihood of death from diseases like measles and severe diarrhea. Experts are concerned that rising prices may lead impoverished families to cut back on health and education spending. Rising food prices may lead families to reduce spending on health and education, increasing maternal and child mortality rates. Poor parents may prioritize food over school fees, impacting children's education and nutrition. Global food prices, though moderated, still push people deeper into poverty, especially in food-importing countries with limited resources. Estimates suggest that millions of people have fallen into poverty due to food price increases, leading to a new wave of hunger. Industrialized countries benefited the most from the spikes in food prices, while developing countries saw minimal increases in food production. Food production increased minimally in 2007 and barely in 2008, with poor farmers in developing countries not benefiting from food price spikes due to higher input prices. Factors hindering food production included export taxes and controls. Despite lower food prices, poor farmers remain vulnerable to poverty and hunger, leading to rural inhabitants moving to urban areas for better economic opportunities. Population growth is the main driver of urban population increase, leading to a decrease in rural workers for crop harvesting. This results in inconsistent food supplies. Poor farmers moving to urban areas often end up in slums with overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, lacking access to basic services like electricity and healthcare. The use of traditional biomass fuels in slums contributes to air pollution and health issues. Air pollution in urban slums leads to severe health issues like pneumonia, cholera, typhoid fever, and malaria. Overcrowded slum conditions increase vulnerability to diseases such as tuberculosis, meningitis, and polio. Urban slum growth is outpacing planned urban areas, with an estimated one billion people living in slums in 2005. The number of slum dwellers is projected to reach two billion by 2030, making up about 40% of the world's urban population. In Africa and Asia, slum dwellers constitute the majority of the urban population. Despite the growth in urban poor and slum populations, food security programs are mainly focused on rural areas. Rising food prices can impact children's access to education, leading families to withdraw children from school temporarily or permanently if prices remain high. Children seeking extra income are vulnerable to exploitation due to lack of education. Children who lack education and skills are at risk of exploitation, engaging in activities like shining shoes, begging, bartending, and selling food. High food prices can hinder children's learning abilities, perpetuating the cycle of poverty and hunger. Undernutrition during pregnancy and infancy has long-term effects on cognitive development. The lack of sufficient nutrients during brain development can lead to irreversible damage, affecting cognitive development. Stunting in preschool children has been linked to cognitive and behavioral delays. Around one-third of children under five in developing countries exhibit stunting, with iodine deficiencies decreasing average IQ in over 60 countries. Iron deficiencies impair mental development in children and lead to childbirth deaths. Poor nutrition weakens the immune system, making HIV/AIDS progression faster. Malnutrition increases the risk of HIV transmission from mother to baby and reduces the effectiveness of ARV medication. Studies have shown that individuals with HIV require more energy and protein than non-infected adults. Malnourished patients starting ARV therapy have a higher risk of death. HIV/AIDS prevalence in Africa threatens food security, especially in rural areas where farming is essential. Food consumption drops by 40% in HIV-affected households, leading to increased expenses on food due to lower crop yields. HIV-affected households face challenges in food security, leading to increased expenses on less nutritious food. Urban adults affected by HIV often return to rural areas when seriously ill, worsening food security there. Women and girls are particularly vulnerable during food shortages due to social and economic factors. Impoverished women may resort to transactional sex to feed their families. The U.S. government provides international aid through USAID and USDA to address hunger, with a focus on humanitarian food assistance. Most U.S. food aid is allocated to emergency relief, provided to organizations like WFP and PVOs. Non-emergency food aid is distributed through PVOs, cooperatives, and intergovernmental organizations. The U.S. government provides international aid through USAID and USDA to address hunger, focusing on humanitarian food assistance. Food aid is allocated to emergency relief through organizations like WFP and PVOs. About 70% of donated food aid for development is sold or monetized to finance projects, sparking debate on its efficacy. Some PVOs support monetization, while others and U.S. trading partners oppose it, citing negative impacts on local producers and markets. USAID and MCC implement responses to hunger and undernutrition through non-food aid programs, supporting agricultural productivity and health sectors. Title II of the Food for Peace Act authorizes USAID to donate U.S. agricultural products. In FY2007, USAID allocated $1.8 billion for emergency food relief and $348 million for development projects. PVOs monetized 74% of the commodities received for their development projects. Food aid supports various programs including health and nutrition monitoring in Uganda. The McGovern-Dole program provides commodities, cash, and technical assistance for school feeding and nutrition programs in developing countries, with USAID focusing on micro-nutrient supplementation, infant and young child feeding, and addressing undernutrition in the first two years of life to prevent irreversible damage. Preventing severe malnutrition is more effective than addressing it after symptoms appear. USAID's programs add vital immune-building micronutrients to processed foods and fund research on biofortified crops. These programs are integrated with interventions like safe water and sanitation. It is unclear if the fortification programs are integrated with non-emergency food aid projects. USAID's nutrition programs aim to prevent malnutrition-related deaths in infants and children by promoting safe infant feeding practices, including exclusive breastfeeding. They also work on integrating nutrition interventions with HIV/AIDS programs. USAID invests about $30 million annually in nutrition initiatives, such as Vitamin A supplementation and food fortification. The Integrated Enhanced Agricultural Productivity and Rural Incomes project, launched in 2002, focuses on improving agricultural productivity and incomes in several African countries. In East, West, and Southern Africa, IEHA projects aim to raise smallholder producers' productivity and incomes. USAID allocated approximately $47 million in FY2006 and $200 million in FY2007 for IEHA activities to support programs in multiple countries and regional missions. GAO criticized USAID for not integrating IEHA activities with other agricultural development programs or U.S. food aid efforts. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was established in 2004 to support U.S. commitment to reducing poverty and hunger through market-oriented policies. MCC focuses on agricultural development, education, enterprise, governance, health, and trade capacity building in countries with good governance and economic growth. MCC funding surpasses USAID assistance in some countries affected by high food prices. For example, in FY2007, USAID provided $15.4 million in total development assistance to Ghana, with $7.6 million allocated to agriculture, while MCC's Compact with Ghana was significantly higher. In contrast, the Millennium Challenge Compact with Ghana allocated $241 million to agricultural and rural development investments over five years, urging better coordination between USAID and MCC. Congressional responses to the global food crisis focused on expanding humanitarian food aid and long-term interventions, with the Administration supporting increased food aid and local food purchases. U.S. Department of Agriculture and USAID outlined a three-pronged approach at a U.N. conference on the global food crisis. The U.S. Government's three-pronged approach to address high food prices includes expanding humanitarian aid, increasing agricultural productivity in at-risk regions, and promoting agricultural trade and investment. Congress allocated $2.25 billion for food aid in FY2008, with additional funding for emergency food aid, food-related development assistance, and international disaster relief. The $400 million allocated for FY2008 and FY2009 aims to improve agricultural productivity, alleviate supply chain issues, and promote market-based systems. Some funds may be used to purchase agricultural commodities locally. USAID plans to restore support for agricultural research, including through the CGIAR consortium. The Administration requested $1.24 billion for FY2009 food aid spending. The Senate proposed funding of $7 million for the Global Crop Diversity Trust, $29 million for research support programs, up to $30 million for biotechnology research, and $150 million for a new USAID account to address hunger and malnutrition in developing countries, particularly in Africa and Asia. The funds are intended to improve crop yields, respond to food shortages, and increase the number of agriculture specialists in the field. International organizations advocate for greater support for long-term food security to prevent future crises. Some experts advocate greater support for medium- and long-term food security to prevent future crises and reduce the need for emergency food aid. Donors must collaborate to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and combat hunger, poverty, and improve health. The MDGs include halving extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equality, reducing child and maternal mortality, combating diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability, and providing safe drinking water. Advancements in MDGs 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are threatened by chronic hunger and persistent poverty. Factors affecting child mortality include income levels, maternal health, and access to healthcare services. FAO expects only Latin America and the Caribbean to halve their hungry population by 2015, with challenges in other regions like sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Efforts need to be increased to meet Millennium Development Goals for hunger. The High-Level Task Force on Global Food Security Crisis was established by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to address the global food price challenge. It includes heads of U.N. agencies, the World Bank, IMF, and FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf. The Task Force developed a Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA) to tackle the food crisis and its indirect impacts on health. The Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA) addresses the global food crisis by focusing on immediate needs of vulnerable populations and long-term food security. It includes actions such as enhancing emergency food assistance, boosting smallholder farmer food production, adjusting trade policies, and developing an international biofuels consensus. The CFA also calls for expanding social protection systems, sustaining smallholder farmer-led food availability growth, improving international food market accessibility, and managing macroeconomic implications. The IMF, World Bank, and U.N. agencies implement the Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA) to address food insecurity. The World Food Program (WFP) provides emergency food aid and safety net assistance, while FAO and the World Bank support medium-term interventions. The IMF facilitates long-term solutions with balance of payments provisions and budget assistance. The World Bank and IMF provide financial assistance to help countries affected by food and fuel price increases. They also support long-term agricultural development to improve food security through investments in research, infrastructure, and post-harvest management. Experts suggest increasing investment in agriculture while also supporting health interventions to address hunger and poverty. Supporters advocate for increased investment in basic health care as an effective way to address hunger-related illnesses. The 110th Congress focused on legislation to tackle the global food crisis, shifting towards sustainable solutions and increasing investments in agricultural research. The 111th Congress is expected to introduce legislation to support agricultural development and improve food security. The 111th Congress may consider health needs of those affected by food insecurity, particularly the impoverished facing high food prices. Undernourished populations are at risk of preventable diseases, with potential to save lives through increased nutrition interventions. UNICEF estimates that cost-effective interventions could prevent 63% of childhood deaths, including breastfeeding, vaccinations, and treatment of pneumonia. Scaling up coverage in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa could save 600,000 children annually at a cost of $600 million. Advocates call for greater support for nutrition programs. Advocates argue for increased funding of $200 million annually to enhance the effectiveness of U.S. nutrition programs in addressing the global food crisis. A study in Haiti showed that preventative nutritional support reduced undernutrition rates compared to aid given after diagnosis. Limited funds lead USAID to focus more on treating severe malnourishment than prevention. In the 110th Congress, bills like H.R. 2844 and S. 3529 aimed to increase resources for global nutrition programs, but neither received further action. Functional roads are crucial for distributing food assistance and helping farmers transport produce to market, especially in developing countries where many roads are unpaved. The World Bank estimates that only 14% of roads in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) are paved, with rural roads in southern African countries being only 5% paved. Unpaved roads require frequent costly repairs or rebuilding, hindering reliable and equitable food delivery. Poorly maintained roads in Sudan and Ethiopia have led to food aid accumulation in cities, complicating efforts to reach remote rural areas. Sealed roads are essential for improving community health and ensuring access to essential services. Sealed roads are critical for access to emergency medical care and maintaining a regular supply of medical supplies in rural areas. The World Bank found that 87% of Malawians live in rural areas, but 96.6% of doctors work in urban health facilities, citing issues like insufficient health equipment and lack of professional development opportunities. Supporters urge Congress to increase support for MCC's infrastructure investments in Africa, which have totaled $4.2 billion and include road and bridge construction and port upgrades. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) funds projects in Africa for road and bridge construction, port upgrades, water management, soil conservation, irrigation development, and land tenure security. Critics argue that MCC has not efficiently spent the funds allocated by Congress, leading to a temporary halt in new compact agreements to evaluate the program's effectiveness. The committee cut funding to the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) to $254 million in FY2009 due to concerns about \"few tangible results\" and \"analytical errors.\" Despite criticisms, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has been praised for its achievements in health infrastructure. Health experts urge Congress to support health systems in poor countries, including addressing HIV/AIDS and malnutrition. Proponents push for the African Health Capacity Investment Act of 2007 to improve healthcare capacity in Africa. U.S. efforts in health, hunger, and foreign assistance programs lack coordination. Critics argue that U.S. foreign assistance programs, including global health efforts, lack coordination, reducing their effectiveness. Ambassador Mark Dybul suggested that improving efficiency could reach 20-40% more people with the same funding. Calls for reform and coordination in international health assistance have been made, including proposals for a cabinet-level official to oversee all global health and development programs. In the 111th Congress, efforts are expected to improve foreign assistance efficiency. The World Food Program responds to global food crises by providing humanitarian aid to millions in need. WFP relies on voluntary contributions, with the US contributing 44% of commodity aid in 2007. The United States contributes 44% of commodity food aid to the World Food Program. WFP allocates over 80% of its cash to local and regional purchase of food aid commodities to save on costs and support local farmers. In 2008, WFP directed a $214 million food security assistance package to 14 countries and regions affected by high food prices. The World Food Program launched Purchase for Progress (P4P) to help small farmers access markets in 21 countries over the next five years. The initiative received funding from various organizations, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, and the government of Belgium. P4P aims to improve small farmers' productivity through the use of improved seeds and farm management techniques. The World Food Program's Purchase for Progress (P4P) initiative received funding from various organizations, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the government of Belgium. P4P aims to increase the incomes of 350,000 farmers in pilot projects. UNICEF focuses on nutrition security during emergencies, supporting infant and child feeding, and providing micronutrients. UNICEF launched the Low Birth Weight Prevention Initiative to improve the nutritional status of pregnant women and prevent low birth weight in infants. The program provides multi-micronutrient supplements and is piloted in 11 countries. UNICEF also reaches vulnerable children through Learning Plus schools, offering services like school feeding, HIV/AIDS education, and deworming treatments. WHO focuses on health and nutrition surveillance systems, monitoring vulnerable populations, and supporting nutrition interventions. WHO supports Member States in managing severe malnutrition, promoting exclusive breastfeeding, improving access to micronutrient supplements, delivering primary health care services, promoting food hygiene, and ensuring access to safe and nutritious foods during disruptions. A task force at WHO headquarters integrates programs related to nutrition, health systems, health security, environment, family and community health, and health action in crises. Additionally, WHO assists in mobilizing resources through the Consolidated Appeal Process and the Central Emergency Response Fund. The Food and Agricultural Organization collects and disseminates data on agriculture and advises governments on agricultural issues. FAO collects, analyzes, and disseminates data on agriculture, advises governments on agricultural policy, provides development assistance, and hosts meetings for policymakers. In June 2008, FAO and other members of the High-Level Task Force held a Food Security Summit in Rome to mobilize donor support for measures to address the global food crisis, recommending increased support for food aid and safety net programs. Attendees urged donors to provide aid for agricultural inputs in the short term and increase support for agriculture development in the medium and long terms. The Food Security Summit in Rome called for increased support for agriculture development and investments in scientific research to improve agricultural technologies. Donors committed $18.4 billion in resources to address the world food crisis, with the United States, World Bank, and WFP pledging significant amounts over the next two years. France and the Islamic Development Bank also made extended commitments to provide financial aid over five years. The Food Security Summit in Rome called for increased support for agriculture development and investments in scientific research. Donors committed $18.4 billion to address the world food crisis, with the United States, World Bank, and WFP pledging significant amounts over the next two years. France and the Islamic Development Bank also pledged $1.5 billion each over five years. FAO launched the Initiative on Soaring Food Prices (ISFP) with an $18 million budget in five countries, aiming to help farmers boost production through improved access to seeds and fertilizers. The ISFP has expanded to 54 countries, providing external financing for agricultural inputs to increase food production and farmers' incomes. The Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) was launched in June 2002 by African Ministers of Agriculture, FAO, and NEPAD to improve Africa's agriculture sector, food security, and trade balance. The plan focuses on improving land management, water control systems, rural infrastructure, and trade-related capacities to sustainably increase output and encourage reliable food production. The CAADP aims to enhance Africa's agriculture sector by improving land management, water control systems, rural infrastructure, and trade-related capacities. This includes investments in roads, storage, markets, and input supply networks to boost countries' capacity for trade negotiations. The plan also aims to increase food supply, reduce hunger, raise rural incomes, expand employment opportunities, and enhance agricultural research and technology dissemination. NEPAD estimates it will cost nearly $250 billion to implement the plan by 2015, with African governments providing about half of the funds. Members committed to implementing CAADP by allocating at least 10% of their national budgets to agricultural and rural development within five years, aiming for a 6% growth rate in the agricultural sector. Increased investments would revitalize the agricultural sector, target small-scale farmers, involve the private sector, focus on human capacity development, and address constraints like soil fertility and inadequate infrastructure. The African Union reported that some countries have met the 10% budget allocation and seen agricultural sector growth, with ongoing efforts to increase government spending on agriculture. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) was created in 1977 in response to a global food crisis. IFAD provides low-interest loans and grants to developing countries for projects focusing on poverty reduction among rural populations. In light of the current food crisis, IFAD plans to support projects in 26 countries identified by the FAO as experiencing food shortages, using $200 million from existing funds to purchase agricultural inputs like seeds and fertilizers. IFAD will use $200 million from existing funds to purchase agricultural inputs for projects in 26 countries identified by FAO. The funds will not be used for emergency relief or social safety nets. IFAD works with World Bank, FAO, WFP, and regional development banks for project implementation. World Bank focuses on safety net assistance and food production in response to the global food crisis. The World Bank's activities in response to the global food crisis focus on safety net assistance, food production, and advising countries on high food prices. They provide loans through the International Development Association to least developed countries with no interest charges and long repayment periods. The Bank's initiatives include school feeding, food for work, conditional cash transfers, and agricultural production. They have conducted rapid needs assessments in African countries and established the Global Food Response Program to provide assistance to needy countries. The program has approved $137 million in funding for 16 countries and earmarked an additional $429 million for programs in 13 more countries. The World Bank plans to provide up to $6 billion in agricultural loans by 2009, with increased lending to Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. In its 2008 World Development Report, the Bank outlined key elements for fostering agricultural growth in developing countries, including incentives for food production, improving public goods quality, and strengthening institutions for rural farmers. The World Bank proposes policy prescriptions to improve food security, including easing export restrictions, providing regular annual appropriation to the WFP, and recommendations for the international community. The IMF provides loans through its Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility to countries impacted by high commodity prices, enabling them to pay for food and fuel import bills. About 10 countries, mostly in Africa, have raised the possibility of acquiring additional financing to cover the import costs of higher food prices. The IMF recommends targeted social assistance as the best initial policy response to higher food prices. The IMF recommends targeted social assistance as the best initial policy response to higher food prices. Other temporary measures such as tax or tariff cuts on food products are also available. The IMF offers financing instruments to help countries overcome food-related balance of payments strains, including stand-by arrangements. Some experts caution that IMF lending terms are more onerous for developing country borrowers than World Bank-IDA lending terms. IMF loans for countries severely affected by higher food prices carry a 0.5% interest rate repayable over 5 \u00bd to 10 years. The Fund has provided food-related support to several countries and signed new financing agreements with others."
