    "content": "The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 was passed by Congress to ensure that federally insured banking institutions provide sufficient credit in their local areas. The Act requires regulators to assess if banks are meeting local credit needs and issue CRA credits accordingly. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 requires banks to meet local credit needs by engaging in qualifying activities in LMI areas. Regulators issue CRA credits based on performance ratings, impacting regulatory approval for various banking actions. Congress addressed concerns about the geographical mismatch between deposit-taking and lending activities. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 aims to ensure banks meet local credit needs, especially in LMI areas, by using deposits for lending. Concerns included banks using local deposits for out-of-state and international lending instead of addressing local credit needs like housing and small businesses. Congressional action was also motivated to discourage redlining practices, where banks refuse credit to certain neighborhoods or applicants based on location. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) applies to banking institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC, such as national banks and savings associations. It does not apply to credit unions, insurance companies, or securities companies. The CRA is administered by the OCC, Federal Reserve, and FDIC through Regulation BB, requiring regulated institutions to meet credit needs in designated assessment areas, including LMI neighborhoods, in a safe and sound manner. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) impacts lending activity and has sparked public debate. Concerns include banks prioritizing lending in LMI communities over more profitable opportunities, potentially leading to higher-risk lending and financial instability. Some attribute risky lending practices before the 2007-2009 recession to CRA compliance. Enforcement of CRA objectives is criticized for not compelling banks to increase financial services in LMI areas. The report discusses how banks receive performance ratings on their CRA examinations, which may indicate weak enforcement. It analyzes the difficulty in linking bank lending decisions to CRA incentives due to the lack of specific benchmarks. The report highlights challenges in linking banks' loan portfolios to CRA enforcement without explicit benchmarks. Banks may not receive CRA credit for all loans to LMI customers, especially higher-risk ones. Financial market innovations have made it harder to geographically link financial activities for CRA consideration. Policy discussions on modernizing the CRA are also summarized. The federal banking regulators conduct regular examinations of banks to assess if they meet local credit needs in designated assessment areas by issuing CRA credits for qualifying activities. Regulation BB outlines criteria for determining assessment areas based on geographical definitions, including a bank's main office, branches, and surrounding areas where loans are originated. Assessment areas must include at least one metropolitan statistical area or contiguous political area. Regulation BB requires assessment areas to include at least one metropolitan statistical area or contiguous political subdivision. Banking regulators review banks' assessment area delineations for compliance with CRA requirements. Some banks may devise strategic plans for compliance, such as wholesale and limited purpose banks serving specialized clients. Limited purpose banks, which do not serve retail clients, offer a narrow product line and apply for designation as wholesale banks. They are evaluated under tailored strategic plans for CRA examination. Banks can develop pre-defined CRA performance goals and submit them for public input before approval by regulators. Regulation BB provides banks with various options for qualifying CRA activities, including lending, community investments, and low-cost services for LMI areas. This can include investing in CDEs, supporting MWLIs, and serving as a joint lender for loans originated by MWLIs. Banks can engage in various activities to qualify for CRA credits, such as serving as a joint lender for loans, providing financial literacy education to LMI communities, opening branches in designated areas, offering low-cost education loans, and providing international remittance services. Regulators award CRA credits based on a bank's activities within its assessment area, using tests for lending, investment, and services to determine its overall composite CRA rating. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) uses lending, investment, and service tests to assess a bank's performance in meeting local credit needs. The lending test evaluates mortgage, small business, small farm, and consumer loans. The investment test looks at community development investments, while the service test examines retail service delivery. The lending test is considered the most important, awarding banks the most points. Banks receive fewer credits for investments than for direct loans under the lending test. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) uses lending, investment, and service tests to evaluate a bank's performance in meeting local credit needs. Banks are assessed based on their capacity, constraints, and business strategies, as well as demographic and economic data. The CRA examination was customized in 1995 to account for differences in bank sizes and business models, with bank size definitions revised in 2005 to include small, intermediate small, and large banks. Small banks are defined as having less than $1.284 billion in assets as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar years. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) evaluates banks based on lending, investment, and service tests. Small, intermediate small, and large banks are defined based on their assets. Small banks have less than $1.284 billion in assets, intermediate small banks have between $321 million and $1.284 billion, and large banks have $1.284 billion or more. Regulators review loan-to-deposit ratios, lending practices, borrower diversity, geographical distribution of loans, and complaint resolution. Direct lending in primary markets qualifies for CRA credit under the lending test. Investments in secondary lending markets qualify for CRA credit under the investment test. Secondary market investors can assume default risk by purchasing entire loans or investing in pooled loan securities. Direct ownership or purchasing debt securities are alternative methods for facilitating lending. Banks can receive CRA consideration for making loans to LMI individuals guaranteed by a federal agency. In 2005, the CRA expanded activities that qualify for credit to encourage banks to make public welfare investments, including public welfare investments that benefit LMI individuals and community development investments. Examples of qualifying activities include providing housing, services, or jobs primarily for LMI individuals. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) expanded activities for banks to make public welfare investments, including those benefiting low- to moderate-income (LMI) individuals and community development investments. Banks can engage in activities like promoting affordable housing, financing small businesses, and revitalizing LMI areas to meet the Public Welfare Investment (PWI) requirements. The Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 increased the allowable investment limit in a single institution for national banking associations and state banks. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) allows banks to invest in public welfare activities, benefiting low- to moderate-income individuals and community development. CDIs that benefit a bank's designated assessment area may qualify for CRA credit, including underserved and distressed rural areas and designated disaster areas. The 2005 revisions expanded the definition of CDIs to include more banking activities eligible for CRA credits. Banks can receive full CRA credits for making CDI loans directly in their assessment areas. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) allows banks to invest in public welfare activities, benefiting low- to moderate-income individuals and community development. CDIs that benefit a bank's designated assessment area may qualify for CRA credit. The CRA was revised in 1989 to require descriptive CRA composite performance ratings that must be disclosed to the public. Grades of Outstanding and Satisfactory are acceptable; Satisfactory ratings in both community development and retail lending are necessary for a composite Satisfactory. Large banks must receive a sufficient amount of points from the investment and service tests to receive CRA credits. Banks must meet certain criteria to receive an Outstanding rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Regulators consider CRA ratings when evaluating requests for activities like mergers or acquisitions. Poor ratings can lead to denied applications, but improvements can be made for resubmission. Covered institutions must display CRA notices and publicly share their performance records. The CRA is not evaluated by a single federal agency, and its effectiveness was studied by the Federal Reserve in 2000. The study found an increase in lending to LMI families but could not directly attribute it all to the CRA due to advancements in underwriting. Difficulty linking bank lending outcomes directly to the CRA is examined, considering questions about the subjectivity of CRA examinations. Questions have been raised about the effectiveness of CRA examinations in measuring a bank's ability to meet local credit needs, with regulators assessing the quality and quantity of CRA compliance subjectively. The innovativeness and complexity of qualified loan products and investments, as well as how banks serve underserved customer groups, are factors considered in CRA evaluations. Regulators have discretion in awarding points for CRA-qualifying investments based on their judgment of innovativeness, as no formal definition has been established. Without specific definitions or quotas, CRA examinations may be subjective. Most banks receive Satisfactory or better ratings, with approximately 97% or more receiving Satisfactory or Outstanding ratings. The effectiveness of CRA examinations in measuring a bank's ability to meet local credit needs has been questioned. Regulators assess CRA compliance subjectively, considering factors like innovativeness and how banks serve underserved customer groups. Since the passage of the CRA, innovations in credit evaluation have improved credit availability for both high credit quality and credit-impaired individuals. Nontraditional loan products allow borrowers to have lower regular payments. Credit-impaired borrowers may face higher interest rates to compensate for greater credit risk. Nontraditional loan products with initially low interest rates may lead to higher-risk lending, as borrowers expect their financial situation to improve. Regulators are cautious about awarding CRA credit for these loans due to concerns about discriminatory or predatory practices. Regulators focus on both prudential regulation and consumer protection in monitoring banks' activities. Regulators monitor loan disclosures, pricing practices, and lending activities to ensure fair treatment of borrowers and prevent discriminatory or predatory behavior. They discourage high-risk lending practices like subprime mortgages and payday loans to avoid large concentrations of risky loans on bank balance sheets. In September 2006, banking regulators issued restrictive guidance on subprime lending, warning about the risks of nontraditional mortgage loans. A study found that banks subject to the CRA originated only 6% of high-cost loans to lower-income borrowers in their assessment areas. Banks received little or no CRA credit for subprime mortgage lending to lower-income borrowers. Federal regulators offered CRA consideration for helping mitigate effects of distressed subprime mortgages. Various workout arrangements for LMI borrowers were eligible for favorable CRA consideration. Dodd-Frank Act requires lenders to consider consumers' ability to repay before extending mortgage credit. Originating qualified mortgages is one way for lenders to comply with the Act. Lenders must originate qualified mortgages (QMs) that meet specific requirements to comply with regulations. QMs cannot have negative amortization features, interest-only payments, or excessive fees. Borrowers' debt-to-income ratios should not exceed 43%. QM originations provide legal protections for lenders if proper underwriting procedures are followed. Banks may be hesitant to offer non-QM loans due to the legal safeguards of QMs. Federal banking regulators stated that banks focusing on QM loans will not face negative CRA evaluations, but no CRA consideration will be given for non-QMs. The federal banking regulators are cautious about using the CRA to promote lending with legal risks. Banks are interested in offering small dollar cash advances but are discouraged from payday lending. Legislation like the Credit Card Act of 2009 restricted subprime credit card lending. Regulators expressed concerns about deposit advance products resembling payday loans due to high costs and borrower default risks. The final supervisory guidance discouraged banks from offering high-cost consumer financial products, leading many to discontinue deposit advances. Legislative and regulatory efforts aim to discourage banks from offering such products, reducing their likelihood of receiving CRA consideration. Customers may turn to nonbank institutions for higher-cost products if banks do not offer them. It is challenging to determine if banks' decisions are driven by CRA incentives, profit motives, or both. Compliance with CRA does not mandate unprofitable, high-risk loans. Banks may make financial decisions based on profit or CRA incentives, but it is difficult to determine the driving factor. Compliance with CRA does not require unprofitable, high-risk loans. Banks increased holdings of municipal bonds in 2009, which could be for reasons unrelated to CRA. Banks increased their investments in securities like municipal bonds and Small Business Investment Corporations (SBICs) following the 2007-2009 recession. This was influenced by factors such as higher yields in securities markets, a favorable tax incentive, and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) incentive. Following the 2007-2009 recession, U.S. banks sought higher-yielding lending opportunities due to historically low interest rates, leading to increased investments in securities like municipal bonds and SBICs. Subordinate financiers provide mezzanine capital or equity, requiring higher returns as they are repaid after senior lenders. Banks are generally not allowed to act as subordinate financiers unless investments promote public welfare, making CRA incentives for community development financing activities like SBIC investments potentially easier to attribute. Between June 2016 and June 2017, over 1700 U.S. bank branches closed, especially in rural and low-income areas, raising concerns about banks meeting their CRA lending obligations. Banks prioritize locations with high core deposit potential, aligning with CRA requirements for assessment areas. It is challenging to determine if banks' increased SBIC financing is driven by profit motives or CRA incentives. The Federal Reserve noted an increase in branches per capita in 2017 compared to two decades ago, making it difficult to determine if branch closures are to avoid CRA compliance or attract core deposits. The U.S. Department of Treasury recommended modernizing CRA in 2018 due to technological advancements impacting assessment areas. The Treasury recommended revisiting the approach for determining banks' assessment areas due to technological advancements like internet and mobile banking. They suggested establishing clearer standards for CRA-qualifying activities and expanding the types of loans, investments, and services that qualify for CRA credit to encourage banks to engage in more diverse activities. The Treasury recommends increasing the timeliness of CRA examinations and incorporating performance incentives for more efficient lending activities. Consistent treatment of loans and investments is advised to encourage banks to make more long-term loans. The OCC released an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in August 2018 to seek comments on modernizing the CRA process. The OCC released an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) to seek comments on modernizing the CRA framework, exploring quantitative metric-based evaluation, redefining assessment areas, expanding qualifying activities, and reducing regulatory burden. The comment period closed with 1584 comments received. The Federal Reserve and FDIC did not join the OCC in releasing the ANPR, but the Federal Reserve hosted symposiums to gather feedback on CRA reform from the banking industry. Some banking industry comments suggested the need for consistency in CRA examinations to facilitate compliance. Tailoring may be necessary for determining assessment areas that reflect each bank's business models, especially for those using technology. Community and consumer groups emphasized the importance of addressing issues in underserved communities, such as banking deserts. Examples of CDI activities that qualify for consideration under the CRA investment test are provided in this appendix. Banks and credit unions use participation loans to jointly provide credit, with the loan originator retaining a larger portion and selling smaller portions to other institutions. This allows for CRA investment credit consideration by purchasing a participation, thus sharing default risk in LMI neighborhoods. Loan participations allow multiple banks to share default risk, benefiting LMI borrowers. CRA consideration is possible if participating banks have overlapping assessment areas, except for designated disaster areas. State and local government bonds fund public projects and community development, with tax-exempt interest for nonbank holders to encourage investment in infrastructure and community development. Banks no longer have a tax incentive to purchase municipal bonds due to legislative actions in the 1980s. However, they still consider the profitability of holding these loans and receive CRA investment consideration when purchasing state and local municipal bonds for public and community development projects. Secondary market financial products like mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) and real estate investment trusts (REITs) have been developed to help banks participate in lending activities eligible for CRA consideration. MBS and multifamily MBS are pools of mortgage loans secured by residential properties. CRA-MBSs consist of loans from specific geographic areas for CRA consideration. REITs pool mortgages, MBSs, and real estate investments for investors to purchase shares in. Banks can invest in mortgage REITs and MBS REITs that are eligible for CRA consideration. An example is the Community Development Trust REIT. The Community Development Trust REIT is a CRA-qualified investment for banks. The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund promotes economic development for distressed communities by certifying banks, credit unions, and venture capital funds as designated CDFIs. These institutions focus on serving the financial needs of economically distressed individuals and areas. Some CDFI banks struggle to borrow funds and provide loans to economically distressed consumers due to a lack of loan level data, making them vulnerable to liquidity shortages. They primarily rely on funding their loans with net assets. CDFI net assets, acquired through awards or grants, are used to fund loans, making it less expensive than borrowing. Banks can receive CRA credit by investing in CDFIs, allowing them to make equity investments under PWI authority. Basel III NPR allows for preferential capital treatment for these investments, incentivizing banks to fund CDFIs. Banks often provide funds to CDFIs through EQ2s, which are debt instruments with a continuous rolling maturity. EQ2s are viewed as a profitable opportunity for banks to invest in specialized financial institutions and receive CRA consideration. Small Business Administration supports small businesses' access to capital through various means, including issuing loan guarantees. The Small Business Administration (SBA) facilitates equity financing for small businesses through its Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program established in 1958. SBICs licensed by the SBA provide debt and equity financing, along with educational resources for eligible businesses. Banks can participate by providing funds to SBICs, which then invest in small businesses, potentially earning CRA investment consideration for the banks. Community banks invest in SBICs for profit potential and long-term relationships with business clients. Banks can invest in SBICs under PWI authority if adequately capitalized, but investments still receive risk-based capital treatment. SBIC assets, like CDFIs, are illiquid and cannot be sold in secondary markets. Proper due diligence is required for equity investments to mitigate the risk of losing principal. The low-income housing tax credit program encourages affordable rental housing development and rehabilitation. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program was established in 1986 to promote the development and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing. Tax credits issued by the government can be bought and sold like financial assets, allowing owners to reduce their tax liabilities. Banks can use a formula to reduce their federal tax liabilities by providing credit or equity contributions for affordable housing construction. Additionally, banks may receive CRA-qualified investment credits for financing affordable rental housing. Banks can receive CRA-qualified investment credits for financing affordable rental housing. Once designated as a Community Development Entity (CDE), a corporation or partnership can apply for New Markets Tax Credits (NMTCs) to encourage capital investments in low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities. CDEs, including CDFIs and SBICs, are eligible to compete for NMTCs allocated by the CDFI Fund. Equity investments obtained by CDEs in exchange for NMTCs must be used for loans, technical assistance, or eligible community investment activities. For-profit CDEs can provide NMTCs to investors in exchange for equity investments, allowing investors to reduce tax liabilities over time. Banks can use NMTCs to reduce tax liabilities by investing in nonprofit CDEs and for-profit subsidiaries, potentially earning CRA credit if investments are made within their assessment area. This allows banks to obtain NMTCs from their investments and lower tax liabilities over time."
