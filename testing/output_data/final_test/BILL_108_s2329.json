    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn Crime Victims' Rights Act.\" It amends Title 18 of the United States Code by adding a new chapter on Crime Victims' Rights. The \"Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn Crime Victims' Rights Act\" adds a new chapter on Crime Victims' Rights to Title 18 of the United States Code. Crime victims have rights including protection from the accused, notice of public proceedings, the right to be heard, confer with the government attorney, restitution, proceedings free from delay, and fair treatment. The \"Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn Crime Victims' Rights Act\" ensures crime victims are treated with fairness, dignity, and privacy in court proceedings. The court must guarantee victims' rights, and government officials must make efforts to notify and protect crime victims. In cases of conflict between the prosecutor and the victim, the victim's rights prevail. The prosecutor must advise the crime victim of any conflict of interest and direct them to appropriate legal assistance. Notice of release may be withheld if it endangers anyone's safety. The crime victim, their representative, and the government attorney can assert rights under the Act, but the accused cannot benefit from it. In cases with multiple victims, the court may find it challenging to address all their rights. If the number of crime victims makes it impracticable to give all victims the rights in this chapter, the court will create a procedure to implement these rights. A Federal court denying a crime victim's right can be challenged through a writ of mandamus. The Government can appeal a district court's denial of a crime victim's right in a criminal case. In no case shall a failure to afford a right under this chapter provide grounds for a new trial. Nothing in this chapter authorizes a cause of action for damages. The term 'crime victim' refers to a person directly harmed by a Federal offense. Legal guardians or representatives may assume the rights of a crime victim who is under 18, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased. The defendant cannot be named as such guardian or representative. The Attorney General will establish regulations to enforce crime victims' rights and ensure compliance by officials. This includes setting up an administrative authority to handle complaints and mandating training for Department of Justice employees. The Attorney General will establish regulations to enforce crime victims' rights, including disciplinary sanctions for employees who fail to comply with Federal law. The final decision on complaints will be made by the Attorney General with no judicial review. The Attorney General will make the final decision on complaints with no judicial review available to the complainant. SEC. 3. INCREASED RESOURCES FOR ENFORCEMENT OF CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS.
