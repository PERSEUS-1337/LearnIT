    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Aviation Research and Competitiveness Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that for every dollar increase in US aircraft shipments internationally, the economy output increases by $2.30 and nearly 35,000 jobs are created for every $1 billion of aircraft shipments. Advanced aviation technologies developed by FAA and DOD have applications in security, safety, capacity, communications, and air traffic control. Military aviation program cuts will negatively impact civil aviation programs. FAA research programs have potential applications in both civil and military aviation. Joint technology development programs are essential. Joint technology development programs between the Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration, and industry can transfer skills and technologies from defense to civilian aviation. This collaboration could phase out Defense Department contributions over 5 years, allowing the defense industry to transition to civilian aviation and produce necessary technology. SEC. 3. JOINT AVIATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. The Administrator and the Secretary will establish a joint program for research on aviation technologies for military and civil use, focusing on satellite communications, airport and airplane security, environmentally friendly technologies, and aviation safety. Contracts and grants under this program will be administered jointly using specified procedures. The Administrator and the Secretary will establish a joint program for research on aviation technologies for military and civil use, focusing on satellite communications, airport and airplane security, environmentally friendly technologies, and aviation safety. Contracts and grants under this program will be administered jointly using specified procedures, including an integrated acquisition policy for contract and grant requirements and technical data rights that facilitate collaboration among the Department of Defense, the Federal Aviation Administration, and industry. The Administrator and the Secretary will establish a joint aviation research plan focusing on satellite communications, airport and airplane security, environmentally friendly technologies, and aviation safety. Within 180 days of enactment, the Administrator and Secretary, with input from the advisory committee, must submit a national aviation research plan to Congress outlining research and development goals for advancing aviation technologies over a 5-year period starting in fiscal year 1993. The plan aims to enhance public and private aviation technology, involve private defense contractors in civilian sector transition activities, and transfer government-developed technologies to the private sector to boost economic competitiveness. The national aviation research plan, to be submitted to Congress within 180 days of enactment, will outline research and development goals for advancing aviation technologies over a 5-year period starting in fiscal year 1993. The plan includes detailed objectives, cost estimates, manpower levels, project schedules, and a 5-year schedule for decreasing Federal contribution and increasing private sector contributions for research and development programs. Additionally, it specifies the portion of the Federal contribution that each agency will provide. The national aviation research plan will be updated annually to reflect changes in global aviation technologies and US competitiveness. SEC. 5. JOINT ADVISORY COMMITTEE. Within 90 days of enactment, an Joint Aviation Research Advisory Committee will be established by the Administrator and the Secretary. The committee, consisting of up to 20 members, will provide advice on the aviation research program and assist in preparing the aviation research plan. Members must not be employees of the Federal Aviation Administration or the Department of Defense. The Joint Aviation Research Advisory Committee will consist of up to 20 members who are qualified in aviation research. The majority of members will be from industry, with representation from universities, corporations, associations, and other government agencies. A chairperson, knowledgeable in military and civil aviation research, will be designated. Subordinate committees may be established to provide advice on specific research areas. The Administrator will provide support staff and necessary services for the advisory committee to carry out its purposes. The termination of the advisory committee is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, \"advisory committee\" refers to the Joint Aviation Research Advisory Committee, and \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Defense."
