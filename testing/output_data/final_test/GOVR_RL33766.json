    "content": "The 2005 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission recommendations became binding in November 2005. Business Plans were created for each recommendation by the military departments and defense agencies. These plans detail actions, timing, costs, and environmental remediation. This was the fifth BRAC round since 1988, occurring alongside DOD transformation efforts and redeployment. The Business Plan approach was devised by Secretary Wynne to aid in coordinating the implementation of the 2005 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission recommendations. It serves to allocate resources, prioritize tasks, and ensure coordination among military departments and defense agencies. The plan outlines necessary steps, estimated time-frames, and costs associated with carrying out the recommendations, without providing detailed planning. Detailed planning can be found in associated documentation referenced in the plans. Secretary Wynne issued guidelines for Business Plan preparation in two memoranda, outlining major headings and necessary data in detail. Each plan should include recommendations from the commission's final report, steps to satisfy the recommendations, a list of DOD organizations to be moved, and a timetable for the movement. The Business Plans for BRAC implementation include details on organization movement, installation closure schedules, estimated costs and savings, necessary military construction, environmental studies, real property disposal, DOD agency involvement, and financial estimates. The term \"Business Plan\" was chosen to emphasize the financial aspects and movement plans outlined in each recommendation. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld aimed to make DOD operations more cost-effective by adopting commercial business models. Business Plans were created to implement cost savings for personnel programs, infrastructure, and equipment modernization. Secretary Wynne utilized private enterprise practices to assign BRAC Commission recommendations. Secretary Wynne assigned BRAC Commission recommendations to military departments or defense agencies based on resource allocation. The responsible entity prepares and executes the corresponding Business Plan, considering the location receiving resources for realignment. For example, in recommendation #131 for co-locating military agencies at Quantico, the Department of the Navy was tasked with developing the Business Plan. The Department of the Navy was assigned to develop Business Plans for BRAC Commission recommendations. These plans were not meant to be circulated outside DOD but may become publicly accessible once the FY2008 budget proposal is submitted to Congress. The plans will support DOD's allocation of BRAC funding and estimated budgets, with data likely included in Budget Justification Documents. BRAC 2005 had unique recommendations that exceeded previous rounds. The 2005 BRAC recommendations were complex and unprecedented, exceeding all prior rounds combined. The process required centralized control for planning and resource allocation, while implementation remained decentralized for the military departments. The DOD believed that coordination in developing Business Plans would be beneficial, aiming for efficiency and problem resolution before implementation. Business Plans cover planning through FY2011, with updates required biannually to align with budget requests and execution. Post-FY2011 actions, like post-closure use, are not included in the plans. The DOD views Business Plans as dynamic documents that may change based on operational priorities and resource availability. Each military department assigns responsibility for plan preparation to a subordinate organization. The plan is reviewed and approved by the Secretary of the Air Force or delegate before implementation. The Business Plans are reviewed and approved by the Secretary of the Air Force or his delegate before being submitted to the Installation Capability Council (ICC) at DOD for further review and approval. The ICC, chaired by the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment, consists of senior executives and military officers. The approved plans are then forwarded to the department's higher-echelon Infrastructure Steering Group (ISG) for final review and approval by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. Each Business Plan is also reviewed by the ISG Executive Secretariat for compliance with the BRAC Commission's intent. The review assesses if the Business Plan aligns with the BRAC Commission's intent. 219 out of 237 required plans have been approved, with 3 sent back for further analysis. 15 plans still need action, 12 of which are for joint bases. DOD is developing Joint Base Implementation Guidance. The DOD is developing Joint Base Implementation Guidance for the establishment and operation of combined bases. 12 plans for joint bases are pending approval, while 3 plans involve Army-run chemical munitions depots that may not meet the six-year deadline for closure due to international treaty obligations."
