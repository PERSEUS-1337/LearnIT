    "content": "Autoencoders learn compressed representations by encoding information to reconstruct data. They can interpolate by mixing characteristics from two datapoints. A regularization procedure improves the realism of interpolated outputs by fooling a critic network. This regularizer enhances interpolation and produces more effective latent codes for downstream tasks. Latent codes from autoencoders can improve downstream tasks by uncovering dataset structure without explicit labels. These codes disentangle important factors of variation, making them useful for representation learning and pre-training other networks. Autoencoders can be used for probabilistic or generative modeling by imposing a prior on the latent space. They have shown the ability to interpolate and extrapolate beyond training data, indicating a learned latent space structure. Interpolation is useful for creative applications and indicates the autoencoder's ability to produce semantically meaningful combinations of data points. Interpolation between points in latent space can reveal semantic similarities, as shown in a visualization. A smooth interpolation suggests nearby points are semantically similar, while discontinuities may result in a less useful representation. Autoencoders that interpolate well could provide a good learned representation for downstream tasks. In this paper, a regularization strategy is introduced to improve interpolations in autoencoders. A synthetic benchmark is developed to measure \"semantically meaningful interpolations,\" and common autoencoders are evaluated on this task. The importance of good interpolation for a useful representation is confirmed. The regularizer introduced in this paper improves interpolation in autoencoders, leading to enhanced representation learning performance on downstream tasks. A unified codebase is provided for various autoencoders, including the proposed regularizer. Autoencoders consist of an encoder and decoder trained simultaneously to minimize distance between input and output. Interpolating with an autoencoder involves using the decoder to decode a mixture of two latent codes, typically combined via a convex combination. Spherical interpolation was experimented with but did not show significant differences in practice. Adjusting the interpolation parameter alpha from 0 to 1 produces a sequence of datapoints that transition from being semantically similar to one input to the other. The concept of \"semantic similarity\" is problem-specific. The notion of \"semantic similarity\" in interpolations is discussed, emphasizing the importance of realistic and smooth morphing between endpoints. A regularizer is proposed to ensure interpolated points appear indistinguishable from real data reconstructions, leading to improved performance on downstream tasks. The critic network BID12 predicts mixing coefficients in interpolations of data points to improve performance on downstream tasks. It constrains \u03b1 to [0, 0.5] and the autoencoder is trained to deceive the critic by optimizing its parameters. The critic approximates an \"adversarial divergence\" between reconstructions and interpolants. The critic network minimizes a loss function involving interpolations and a scalar hyperparameter. The second term in the loss function acts as a regularizer to ensure the critic outputs 0 for non-interpolated inputs and is exposed to realistic data. This term stabilizes the convergence of the autoencoder and allows for consistent hyperparameters and architectures across datasets. The autoencoder's loss function is modified with a regularization term to fool the critic into thinking interpolated inputs are non-interpolated. This Adversarially Constrained Autoencoder Interpolation (ACAI) successfully produces indistinguishable interpolated points from reconstructed data. The loss function in ACAI encourages smooth interpolations and improved representation learning performance. It differs from LS-GAN by being a regularizer for autoencoders and having the critic regress the interpolation coefficient \u03b1. The critic only sees reconstructions or interpolants, aiming to make interpolated points realistic. ACAI aims to improve the quality of autoencoder output by discouraging degradation in interpolation, without imposing a specific structure on the latent space. It focuses on better interpolation behavior rather than distinguishing between \"real\" and \"fake\" data like GANs. This approach tests if encouraging smooth interpolations leads to better representations for downstream tasks. Autoencoders focus on learning useful representations and interpolating effectively. Defining interpolation relies on \"semantic similarity,\" aiming for smooth morphing between characteristics of data points. The goal is for decoded points to traverse the underlying manifold smoothly. Autoencoders aim to interpolate effectively by smoothly traversing the underlying data manifold. A benchmark task with a known data manifold is introduced to quantify interpolation quality. Various autoencoders are evaluated on this benchmark, with ACAI showing significantly improved performance and superior interpolations. The goal is to define a task where a \"correct\" interpolation is unambiguous, allowing for quantitative evaluation of different autoencoders' interpolation abilities. In the task of autoencoding 32 \u00d7 32 grayscale images of lines, the data manifold is defined by a single variable \u039b representing the angle of the line. A valid interpolation smoothly adjusts \u039b from x1 to x2 along the shortest path on the data manifold. The goal is to have intermediate points in the interpolation look realistic and provide semantically meaningful morphing. The evaluation metrics proposed for the task of autoencoding grayscale images of lines are Mean Distance and Smoothness. Mean Distance measures the average distance between interpolated points and real datapoints, while Smoothness evaluates the line angles' linear trajectory between start and endpoint. These metrics aim to assess the realism and smoothness of the generated interpolations on a synthetic benchmark dataset. In evaluating autoencoders on a synthetic benchmark for interpolation, the quality of interpolation is measured explicitly. Different autoencoder structures and objectives are tested on the lines task to assess their interpolation abilities. The goal is to quantitatively evaluate standard autoencoders' interpolation behavior, with results summarized in table 1. The base model for autoencoders involves mapping input data through a bottleneck layer to a latent code and back to a reconstructed input using neural networks. The encoder includes convolutional and average pooling layers, while the decoder consists of convolutional and nearest-neighbor upsampling layers. The model is trained simultaneously with respect to the input data. For experiments on the synthetic \"lines\" task, a latent dimensionality of 64 was used in the autoencoder model. Despite the one-dimensional nature of the data manifold, a larger latent code was employed to mimic realistic scenarios. The baseline autoencoder achieved the worst Mean Distance score among all studied models, with comparable Smoothness. Reasonable interpolations were observed, but the intermediate points were often unrealistic. In this study, a denoising autoencoder approach was used by BID44, where a corrupted version of the input data is fed into the model to learn the data manifold. Additive isotropic Gaussian noise was applied to the input data, with a hyperparameter \u03c3 set to 1.0 yielding the best results. The denoising autoencoder often produced \"data-space\" interpolation. The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) introduces a constraint on the latent code distribution, enforcing a KL divergence loss term between the approximate posterior and prior. VAEs use log-likelihood for the reconstruction loss, resulting in a combined loss function. The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) uses a combined loss function to maximize a lower bound on the likelihood of the training set. This likelihood-based generative model allows for sampling novel data points by first sampling z \u223c p(z) and then computing g \u03c6 (z). Backpropagation through sampling from q(z|x) is feasible via the \"reparametrization trick\". Various modifications have been proposed to improve VAE performance on downstream tasks. The VAE was able to effectively model the data distribution and accurately reconstruct inputs. However, the interpolation behavior did not follow a smooth path, resulting in a good Mean Distance score but a poor Smoothness score. The Adversarial Autoencoder proposes an alternative way of enforcing structure on the latent code. The Adversarial Autoencoder introduces a critic network to predict the origin of latent codes, diverging from traditional VAE methods. This approach, known as the \"Wasserstein Autoencoder,\" allows for arbitrary priors but sacrifices probabilistic interpretation for a minimax game optimization. The Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE) introduces a critic network for optimizing a minimax game, requiring a prior, critic structure, and training scheme. A spherical Gaussian prior is used for simplicity, with a critic architecture of two dense layers with 100 units each. The AAE produces smooth interpolations but may exhibit degraded quality in the middle. The Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) was introduced as an alternative training method. Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) introduced by van den Oord et al. in 2017 trains discrete-latent autoencoders using a learned codebook. The encoder produces a continuous hidden representation z, mapped to its nearest neighbor in a codebook for reconstruction by the decoder. The encoder minimizes reconstruction loss using the straight-through gradient estimator BID2 and a commitment loss term to encourage encoder outputs to move closer to their nearest codebook entry. Codebook entries are updated as an exponential moving average of continuous latents at each training iteration. The VQ-VAE training procedure involves updating codebook entries as an exponential moving average of continuous latents at each iteration. Interpolation in VQ-VAE involves mapping continuous latents to their nearest codebook entries, but this method produced poor interpolations in a lines task. Adversarial regularizer was proposed to improve interpolations, using a critic architecture equivalent to the encoder on the lines benchmark. The critic architecture, equivalent to the encoder, was trained with hyperparameters \u03bb and \u03b3 set to 0.5 and 0.2. The performance was not very sensitive to their values. ACAI achieved the best Mean Distance and Smoothness score among the autoencoders considered, producing realistic and smooth interpolations. The ACAI model has shown success in generating realistic and smooth interpolations. Results have been discussed for synthetic lines, MNIST, SVHN, and CelebA datasets with varying latent dimensionalities. Most autoencoders produce smooth interpolations, except for VQ-VAE which works better with lower latent dimensionality. The VAE and denoising autoencoder tend to produce blurry interpolations, while AAE and ACAI generate more realistic ones. The focus now shifts to evaluating if improved interpolation leads to better performance in supervised learning and clustering tasks by enhancing latent space representations. The text discusses the evaluation of latent representations in autoencoders through classification and clustering experiments. It also mentions using a single-layer classifier to assess the quality of the learned representation. The evaluation procedure involves testing different autoencoders by training a single-layer classifier alongside the autoencoder using the latent representation as input. Results show significant performance gains using ACAI compared to baseline autoencoder, particularly on SVHN dataset with a latent dimensionality of 256. ACAI outperformed other models with an accuracy of 85.14%. ACAI showed the best accuracy on MNIST and SVHN datasets, while performance was similar to the denoising autoencoder on CIFAR-10. Using ACAI's learned representation provided a significant benefit in classification tasks. Clustering in the latent space of an autoencoder can reveal important data structures in an unsupervised manner. Clustering in the latent space of an autoencoder involves separating latent codes into distinct groups without labels. K-Means clustering is applied to evaluate clusterability, with PCA whitening used to normalize variance. Multiple runs of K-Means with different initializations are conducted to choose the best clustering. Evaluation is done using labeled data without using labels for training or clustering. The text discusses clustering in the latent space of an autoencoder using K-Means algorithm. The clustering accuracy is evaluated without labels for training or clustering. Results show ACAI achieved the best performance on MNIST and SVHN datasets. No results are reported for CIFAR-10 due to near-random clustering accuracy. The paper also explores interpolation in autoencoders and introduces Adversarially Constrained Autoencoder Interpolation (ACAI).

In the evaluation process, a length-N interpolation between x1 and x2 is created by mixing their latent codes using a coefficient \u03b1. Closest true datapoints are found for each intermediate image along the interpolation by matching them to a collection of line images with evenly spaced angles. The notion of \"intermediate points look realistic\" is captured by computing certain metrics.

The smooth interpolation involves unwrapping angles to avoid discontinuities and defining a measure of smoothness based on angle changes. The autoencoder models studied in the paper share a common architecture and training procedure. The encoder in the architecture consists of convolutional layers followed by average pooling, with doubling of channels before each pooling layer. The latent representation is obtained after two additional convolutions. The decoder includes convolutional layers with leaky ReLU nonlinearities and nearest neighbor upsampling. For the \"lines\" task, the blocks are repeated 4 times for a latent dimensionality of 64, while for real datasets, the blocks are repeated 3 times for a latent dimensionality of 256. The VAE architecture includes convolutional layers with leaky ReLU nonlinearities and upsampling. The number of channels is halved after each upsampling layer until reaching the target resolution. Two additional convolutions are performed to generate the desired colors. The VAE produces realistic samples but lacks high-quality interpolations. Interpolation behavior for different autoencoders is shown in figures 6 to 11."
