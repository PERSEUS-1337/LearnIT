    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Fair Treatment of Airline Passengers Act\". It includes findings related to airline passenger treatment. The Congress finds that United States airline traffic is increasing significantly, with domestic passengers carried by US air carriers nearly tripling since 1978 to over 660 million annually. The number of flights has also been steadily increasing. However, this growth has led to a rise in delays, cancellations, and customer dissatisfaction with air carrier service, as reported by the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration. Delays increased by 90 percent and cancellations by 104 percent between 1995 and 2000, with over 1 in 4 flights affected, totaling approximately 163 million passengers. The number of flights with significant taxi-out times at major US airports increased drastically between 1995 and 2000. Chronic delays were observed for certain flights, especially during peak periods at busy airports, with a high percentage arriving late in December 2000. Consumer complaints about airline travel have also seen a significant increase. Consumer complaints about airline travel have nearly quadrupled since 1995, with air carriers receiving between 100 and 400 complaints for every one filed with the Department of Transportation. Despite the increase in complaints, resources devoted to handling these complaints have sharply declined, with staffing at the Department of Transportation office responsible for airline customer service complaints dropping from 40 in 1985 to just 17 in 2000. In June 1999, the Air Transport Association and its member airlines agreed to an Airline Customer Service. The Department of Transportation Inspector General reviewed the airlines' implementation of the Airline Customer Service Commitment. Despite some positive changes, there are still significant issues with communication about flight delays and cancellations. Air carriers need to improve reliability by reducing over-scheduling, late or canceled flights, and lost baggage. Further steps should be taken to enhance the Airline Customer Service Commitment and consumer protections for air passengers. SEC. 3. FAIR TREATMENT OF AIRLINE PASSENGERS. \"Airline passengers have the right to know on-time performance and cancellation rates for consistently-delayed or canceled flights when making reservations or purchasing tickets. This information must be disclosed by the air carrier without being requested, based on the most recent month's data available.\" The air carrier must disclose on-time performance for each flight on their website and provide timely information to passengers about delays, cancellations, and diversions. Within 6 months of the Fair Treatment of Airline Passengers Act, air carriers must establish a pre-departure notification system to provide timely information on delays, cancellations, and diversions. This system should include the cause of the delay and the carrier's best estimate of the departure time for delayed flights. Additionally, carriers offering flight status information via phone or website must ensure it reflects the most current updates. The Fair Treatment of Airline Passengers Act requires air carriers to establish a notification system for informing passengers of flight cancellations or delays. Carriers must also coordinate with airports to ensure accurate flight information on public monitors. The Fair Treatment of Airline Passengers Act mandates that air carriers with frequent flyer programs must improve the transparency of reporting on award redemption. This includes disclosing the success rates of award redemptions for free tickets or upgrades, as well as the availability of seats for awards on top flights. The Fair Treatment of Airline Passengers Act requires air carriers to disclose information regarding overbooking, including informing passengers about oversold flights, compensation for denied boarding, and the criteria and procedures for involuntary denied boarding. The Fair Treatment of Airline Passengers Act mandates air carriers to report mishandled baggage statistics, including the percentage of mishandled bags, the number of mishandled bags, and the average time for bag delivery after a passenger's claim. This requirement does not apply to small air carriers with less than 30 passenger seating capacity. The Fair Treatment of Airline Passengers Act requires air carriers to develop and adopt a customer service plan within 6 months of enactment, incorporating the Airline Customer Service Commitment provisions and submitting it to the Secretary of Transportation. The Fair Treatment of Airline Passengers Act mandates air carriers to post their contract of carriage on their website, notify customers about its availability, and promptly update any modifications in their customer service plan. Additionally, within 6 months of the Act's enactment, air carriers must develop a Quality Assurance and Performance Measurement System in consultation with the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation. Within 6 months of the Fair Treatment of Airline Passengers Act, air carriers must establish a quality assurance and performance measurement system for customer service and an internal audit process for compliance. Each carrier must submit these systems to the Secretary of Transportation for approval. Additionally, carriers must enhance their customer service plans to offer certain services to customers purchasing tickets at ticket offices or airport counters. The Fair Treatment of Airline Passengers Act requires air carriers to establish performance goals to minimize mishandled baggage incidents and offer the lowest eligible fare to customers. A small air carrier exception is in place for carriers with aircraft seating capacity of 30 passengers or less. Civil penalties have been amended to include additional sections, and a conforming amendment has been made to the chapter analysis for chapter 417 of title 49, United States Code. SEC. 4. REQUIRED ACTION BY SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION. The Fair Treatment of Airline Passengers Act mandates air carriers to establish performance goals for baggage handling and fare pricing, with exceptions for small carriers. Civil penalties have been updated and a conforming amendment has been made to the relevant chapter analysis. Within 6 months of enactment, the Secretary of Transportation must establish a uniform check-in deadline, update baggage mishandling reporting, and increase denied boarding compensation. The Secretary must review and modify air carriers' treatment regulations within 1 year to ensure enforceability and promote the purposes of the Act. This includes modifying existing regulations to reflect the Act and relevant sections of title 49, United States Code. The Secretary must review and modify air carriers' treatment regulations within 1 year to ensure enforceability and promote the purposes of the Act, including establishing minimum standards for air carrier performance with respect to customer service issues. The Department of Transportation must review and modify air carriers' service commitments, including the lowest available fare offer, enforceable obligations, choice of forum in legal disputes, and reporting of complaints to improve customer service standards. The Department of Transportation will review and modify air carriers' service commitments, including lowest available fare offer, enforceable obligations, choice of forum in legal disputes, and reporting of complaints to improve customer service standards. Within 1 year, the Secretary will establish regulations to implement the requirements of this subsection. Improved enforcement of air passenger rights will prioritize areas identified for improvement by the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation. The Secretary of Transportation must consult with the Inspector General when enforcing the provisions of the Act."
