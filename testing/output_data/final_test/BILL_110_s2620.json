Permitting maintenance of fiscal year 2007 FMAP for last 2 calendar quarters of fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2008 FMAP for first 3 quarters of fiscal year 2009.\" In fiscal year 2009, there is a 2.95 percentage points increase in FMAP for certain quarters. Additionally, there is an increase in the cap on Medicaid payments to territories for specific quarters in fiscal year 2008 and 2009. In fiscal year 2009, the FMAP for certain quarters increased by 2.95 percentage points. The cap on Medicaid payments to territories also increased for specific quarters in fiscal year 2008 and 2009. The FMAP for States, territories, and American Samoa will each be increased by 5.90 percent under the Social Security Act. The FMAP increases apply only to title XIX of the Social Security Act and do not apply to certain payments under titles IV or XXI of the Act. States are eligible for increased FMAP or cap amounts under specific conditions related to Medicaid eligibility under the Social Security Act. Eligibility must not be more restrictive than it was in effect on January 1, 2008. States that have restricted eligibility after this date can still qualify for increased FMAP or cap amounts in the first calendar quarter. In the first calendar quarter, States can qualify for increased FMAP or cap amounts if eligibility is reinstated without being more restrictive than on January 1, 2008. This does not affect a State's flexibility with benefits offered under the State Medicaid program. Certain States requiring political subdivisions to contribute to the non-Federal share of expenditures must comply with the State Medicaid plan. Under section 1902(a)(2) of the Social Security Act, States cannot require political subdivisions to pay a higher percentage of non-Federal share of expenditures during specific quarters in fiscal years 2008 and 2009. The term \"FMAP\" refers to the Federal medical assistance percentage, and \"State\" is defined as per title XIX of the Social Security Act. This section is repealed as of October 1, 2009."
