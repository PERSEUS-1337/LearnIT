    "content": "The Act titled \"Wildlife Corridors Conservation Act of 2010\" establishes a National Fish and Wildlife Habitat and Corridors Information Program. Within 6 months of enactment, the Secretary of the Interior will establish a National Fish and Wildlife Habitat and Corridors Information Program with States and Indian tribes. The program aims to support the development of a database for habitat and corridors, aid in climate impact modeling, and enhance wildlife action plans at the state and tribal levels. The National Fish and Wildlife Habitat and Corridors Information Program will establish a comprehensive database of geospatial information on fish and wildlife habitat and corridors, utilizing consistent protocols and existing State and tribal databases. The National Fish and Wildlife Habitat and Corridors Information Program aims to establish a comprehensive database of geospatial information on habitat and corridors. This database will be used by decision-makers to prioritize adaptation strategies, assess impacts of development, and mitigate negative effects on fish and wildlife habitats. The National Fish and Wildlife Habitat and Corridors Information Program aims to establish a comprehensive database of geospatial information on habitat and corridors. This includes developing management strategies to enhance the ability of native species to migrate or respond to shifting habitats within existing habitats and corridors. The Secretary, in cooperation with States and Indian tribes, will develop a Habitat and Corridors Information System containing maps, data, and descriptions of fish and wildlife habitat and corridors. The Habitat and Corridors Information System will include maps and descriptions of habitat shifts in response to climate change, prioritize natural resources adaptation strategies, and assess impacts of energy development and water transmission. The Habitat and Corridors Information System aims to assess and manage impacts of energy development, transportation, and other land use projects on habitats and corridors. It also focuses on developing strategies to enhance the ability of species to migrate or adapt to shifting habitats. Additionally, it establishes a process for updating maps and information as landscapes and wildlife populations change. The Habitat and Corridors Information System aims to monitor and evaluate the efficacy of the system, identify gaps in habitat information, support collaborative research and planning of habitats and corridors by various stakeholders. The Habitat and Corridors Information System aims to incorporate biological and geospatial data on species and corridors affected by energy development and transmission plans, based on the best scientific information available. It also identifies and prioritizes key parcels of non-Federal land critical to wildlife habitat and migration corridors. The Secretary may provide financial and technical support to States and Indian tribes. The Habitat and Corridors Information System provides support to States and Indian tribes for activities that aid in the development and implementation of the System. The Secretary, in collaboration with States and tribes, recommends incorporating System information into existing State and Federal plans to prevent habitat fragmentation, promote landscape connectivity for wildlife movement, and minimize impacts of energy and development. The Geospatial Interoperability Framework is a strategy used by the National Biological Information Infrastructure to manage geospatial and biological data. The Secretary of the Interior is referred to as the Secretary in this section. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out these activities. Authorization of $1,000,000 in appropriations is granted to the Secretary of the Interior for implementing the Geospatial Interoperability Framework. SEC. 3. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS REGARDING INDIAN TRIBES. The Act reaffirms the Federal trust responsibility to Indian tribes and exempts certain information from disclosure under FOIA if it pertains to human remains or cultural items of significance to Indian tribes. The Secretary of the Interior may apply Public Law 93-638 in the implementation of this subpart. SEC. 4. WILDLIFE CORRIDORS STEWARDSHIP AND PROTECTION PROGRAM. The Secretary of the Interior will transfer funds to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to establish a Wildlife Corridors Stewardship and Protection Grant Program for projects related to wildlife corridor stewardship and protection. Administrative expenses may be transferred in advance without regard to when they are incurred. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act allows for project proposals to be submitted by various entities for funding under the Program. The Foundation, in consultation with the Secretary, will select projects that have a significant impact on wildlife species of greatest conservation need by enhancing management and stewardship. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act establishes a program to enhance and protect important wildlife corridors identified by State or Federal agencies. The Federal share of project costs funded under the Program is limited to 50 percent, with non-Federal funds not derived from Federal grants. Administrative expenses are capped at 5 percent or $100,000 annually. A Wildlife Corridors Stewardship and Protection Fund is established in the Treasury. The \"Wildlife Corridors Stewardship and Protection Fund\" is established to receive donations and appropriations for wildlife corridor stewardship. The Secretary of the Interior can accept donations for this purpose. SEC. 5 amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act to include wildlife corridors in public lands management. SEC. 6 updates the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Act to consider important wildlife corridors in resource planning. SEC. 7 addresses transportation programs. The Secretary of Transportation may require states to consider wildlife movement in highway construction projects to improve safety, reduce wildlife mortality, and support ecological connectivity. This includes incorporating wildlife crossings in projects funded by Federal assistance under title 23, United States Code. The Secretary of Transportation may require states to consider wildlife movement in highway construction projects funded by Federal assistance under title 23, United States Code. This includes incorporating wildlife crossings in the projects, utilizing the best available data for decision-making. SEC. 8. AGRICULTURAL CONSERVATION PROGRAMS. The text amends a special rule involving payments for foregone income under the Food Security Act of 1985. The Secretary may prioritize practices promoting residue management, nutrient management, air quality management, invasive species management, pollinator habitat, animal carcass management technology, pest management, or wildlife corridor management. The Food Security Act of 1985 is amended to encourage the development of pollinator habitat and stewardship of wildlife corridors in conservation programs. The Secretary may prioritize practices benefiting pollinators and wildlife corridors identified by a State."
