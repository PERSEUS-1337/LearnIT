    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Saving America's Pollinators Act of 2013\". Pollination services are crucial for agriculture, valued globally at over $125 billion and $20-30 billion annually in the US. One-third of North American food relies on honey bee pollination, including 95 types of fruits. Colony collapse disorder incidents have been increasing, with some beekeepers losing all their operations. US beekeepers lost 45.1% of colonies during the winter of 2012-2013. Honey bee survivorship estimates are concerning according to Department of Agriculture scientists. Recent studies have shown that the use of neonicotinoid insecticides is linked to the decline of pollinators and their health. These insecticides cause various harmful effects on pollinators, including impaired behavior, weakened immunity, and increased susceptibility to diseases. Additionally, it has been found that even a single corn kernel coated with a neonicotinoid can be toxic enough to kill a songbird. A neonicotinoid coated kernel can be toxic enough to kill a songbird. In June 2013, over 50,000 bumblebees died from exposure to neonicotinoids on Linden trees. The European Union suspended the use of neonicotinoids on agricultural crops due to their hazards to bees. SEC. 3. Urgent regulatory response for honey bee and pollinator protection. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must suspend the registration of certain neonicotinoid insecticides for use on bee attractive plants until it is determined that they will not harm pollinators. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must suspend certain neonicotinoid insecticides for use on bee attractive plants until it is proven they will not harm pollinators, including native bees, honey bees, birds, bats, and other beneficial insects. Additionally, a field study meeting specific criteria must be completed to evaluate residue effects on managed and native pollinators. New registrations for seed treatment, soil application, and foliar treatment that may harm pollinators will not be issued. The Secretary of the Interior, in coordination with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, will monitor the health and population status of native bees in various habitats to protect their long-term viability. The Secretary of the Interior, along with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, will monitor native bee health and population status in different habitats to ensure their long-term viability. This includes assessing ornamental plants, residential areas, and landscaped areas, identifying causes of unusual bee mortality, and submitting annual reports to Congress and the public."
