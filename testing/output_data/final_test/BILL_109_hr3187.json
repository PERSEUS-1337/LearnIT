Congress recognizes the importance of coastal and estuarine areas as vital habitats for commercial fish and shellfish, coastal birds, natural plant communities, flood control, and pollutant filtration. These areas also offer recreational and educational opportunities for activities such as hunting, fishing, boating, swimming, bird watching, and wildlife observation. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 acknowledges the national significance and ecological vulnerability of these areas to human activities. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 recognizes the ecological vulnerability of coastal and estuarine areas to human activities. It establishes a Federal-State partnership to protect natural reserves and manage growth in these areas. The National Estuarine Research Reserve system relies on designated areas for long-term protection, education, and research critical to conservation efforts. Intense development pressures drive the need for tools to protect and conserve important coastal and estuarine areas, including restoration of ecologically degraded areas for recreational purposes. Federal-State-nongovernmental organization pilot projects have significantly helped coastal and estuarine systems. Enhanced protection efforts can be coordinated at various levels including Federal, State, regional, and local. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 is amended to establish a coastal and estuarine land conservation program. The Secretary will establish a Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program in collaboration with various government entities to protect important coastal and estuarine areas with significant ecological, historical, and economic values from conversion to other uses. The Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program, administered by the National Ocean Service, provides grants to coastal states with approved plans to acquire property that aligns with coastal zone management and estuarine research reserve goals. The Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program provides grants to coastal states for property acquisition aligned with coastal zone management and estuarine research reserve goals. Acquisition must be from willing sellers, and funds are allocated through a competitive grant process. Governors of coastal states coordinate the establishment and implementation of the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program. Participating states identify conservation needs, evaluate property impacts on working waterfronts, and applicants must provide information on values to be protected and management activities planned for the land. The Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program awards funds based on need and ability to leverage funds among various entities. Applications must align with a coastal state's plan and prioritize lands with ecological value. The Secretary consults with federal agencies and experts in land acquisition when developing guidelines. The Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program allows eligible coastal states and National Estuarine Research Reserves to allocate grants for land acquisition in cooperation with nongovernmental entities and Federal agencies. The Secretary must develop performance measures for program evaluation and require matching funds for grants. The Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program allows grants for land acquisition with a maximum federal share of 75 percent, which can be waived by the Secretary for underserved communities or those with limited funding sources. The Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program allows grants for land acquisition with a maximum federal share of 75 percent, which can be waived by the Secretary for underserved communities or those with limited funding sources. Other federal funds can be used to cover project costs, subject to matching requirements. Non-Federal match for a project can include the value of land or a conservation easement acquired within 3 years prior to the project application. The non-Federal match for a project can include the appraised value of land or easement at project closing. Costs for land acquisition, management planning, remediation, restoration, and enhancement can also be used as match if incurred within the grant period. Up to $5,000,000 can be provided for a regional watershed protection demonstration project meeting program requirements. The curr_chunk outlines criteria for leveraging land acquisition funding, involving partnerships, creating conservation corridors, protecting habitat under threat, enhancing protected areas, and serving as a model for future projects. It also reserves funds for the National Estuarine Research Reserve. The curr_chunk specifies that at least 15 percent of funds must benefit National Estuarine Research Reserve acquisitions, with a limit of 5 percent for administrative costs. Grant recipients must provide assurances for acquired property management. The Secretary may require that the property be held in perpetuity by the grant recipient or another designated public agency, managed in a manner consistent with the Program's purposes, and if sold, funds equal to the correct value must be returned for redistribution. The term 'conservation easement' includes various forms of deeds where the grantee acquires all rights, title, and interest. The grantee acquires all rights, title, and interest in a property, except those expressly reserved by the grantor at the time of purchase. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2007 through 2011 is provided for the implementation of this section. SEC. 4. Assistance from other agencies amended to include Federal agencies and qualified persons for carrying out this section."
