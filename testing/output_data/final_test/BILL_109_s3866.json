Low savings and high debt levels are serious issues for many nearing retirement. Americans are living longer, yet most retire before 65. Research shows many are unprepared for retirement, with only 42% calculating savings needed in 2005. Only 53% of working Americans have any form of retirement planning. Research indicates that only 53 percent of working Americans have pension coverage, with 3 out of 4 older women receiving no income from employer-provided pensions. There are 4 basic sources of retirement income security: social security benefits, pensions and savings, healthcare insurance coverage, and necessary earnings from working during retirement. The limited timeframe for midlife and older individuals to assess their financial circumstances has immediate impact on Americans nearing retirement age. Over the next 30 years, the number of older individuals in the United States is expected to double to nearly 75,000,000, with long-term care costs skyrocketing. Financial exploitation is the largest category of abuse against older individuals, with this population comprising over half of all telemarketing victims. Incidents of identity theft targeting individuals over 60 increased from 1,821 victims in 2000 to 21,084 victims in 2004, an 11-fold increase. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

The goal is to enhance financial knowledge, reduce financial abuse and fraud, including telemarketing, mortgage, pension fraud, and identity theft. Eligible area entities must submit an application with a plan for continuing the programs after the subgrant expires. In awarding subgrants, a national entity must prioritize partnerships and effective programs previously funded. An eligible area entity receiving a subgrant cannot use more than 5% for administrative costs. Performance measures must be developed to evaluate programs funded by subgrants. The national entity awarding subgrants must evaluate programs based on performance measures to judge effectiveness, identify best practices, assess replicability, and measure behavioral change and asset accumulation of participants. This evaluation must be submitted to Congress annually. The national entity awarding subgrants must submit a report to the Secretary detailing the status of the subgrant program, programs funded with subgrant funds, and the evaluation results of such programs.
