The Act \"Tinnitus Research for Military Health Improvement Act\" highlights the prevalence and impact of tinnitus on members of the Armed Forces, especially those exposed to blast injuries. Tinnitus is the leading service-connected disability for returning members, affecting performance and situational awareness during combat. Improving screening for tinnitus before and after deployment is crucial, as it may not be easily noticeable. There is a demonstrated link between tinnitus, post-traumatic stress disorder, and traumatic brain injury, highlighting the need for better treatment options. Improving treatment and prevention of tinnitus is crucial for members of the Armed Forces at risk of injury from high-decibel equipment or explosive devices. Establishing a Center of Excellence for the Study of Tinnitus is important for improving treatment and prevention, especially for members of the Armed Forces at risk of injury from high-decibel equipment or explosive devices. The Secretary of Defense will establish Centers of Excellence for studying tinnitus at military installations in the US where high sound activities occur. The responsibilities include enhancing treatment for Armed Forces members with tinnitus and conducting research to prevent, treat, and cure the condition. The Secretary of Defense will establish Centers of Excellence for studying tinnitus at military installations to coordinate research activities with the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury. A tinnitus data registry will be established for Armed Forces members affected by tinnitus and other neurological conditions to enhance scientific progress in treatment. The Secretary of Defense will submit annual reports to Congress on the center's activities, and $7,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2011 through 2016. SEC. 4 amends section 1074f(b) of title 10, United States Code to include aural screenings for members of the Armed Forces, including an assessment of tinnitus. This applies to deployed or returning members 30 days after enactment. SEC. 5 establishes a grant program to encourage tinnitus research. The Secretary of Defense will establish a grant program to fund research on tinnitus and peripheral neurological conditions at eligible institutions with expertise in the field. The Secretary of Defense will establish a grant program for tinnitus research. Eligible institutions can apply for grants up to $2,500,000 per fiscal year. The Secretary will review applications with tinnitus experts and submit an annual report to Congress on the research conducted by grant recipients. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the program. Authorization of Appropriations: $10,000,000 authorized for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2016. The Secretary of Defense will examine ways to enhance aural protection for military members in combat and submit a report to Congress within a year. Additionally, an Executive Agent for Tinnitus will be appointed. The Secretary of Defense will appoint an Executive Agent for Tinnitus within 90 days of the Act's enactment. This official will coordinate tinnitus-related functions among military departments as specified in Directive 5101.1. The Secretary of Defense will ensure support for this initiative in accordance with the directive. The Defense Department must provide support and resources to the executive agent designated under Directive 5101.1 to carry out their roles and responsibilities. The term \"executive agent\" is defined in Directive 5101.1 as well."
