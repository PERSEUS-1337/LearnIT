    "content": "PROTECTION OF NATURAL AND HISTORIC FEATURES OF CLOSED OR REALIGNED MILITARY INSTALLATIONS. Protection of natural and historic features at closed or realigned military installations includes the identification and transfer of exceptional areas and facilities in consultation with the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture. The Secretary transfers areas to the National Park System or National Forest System upon request. If no request is made, the area is transferred to the State or local government for preservation. After fulfilling transfer requirements, all departments are notified. The Secretary of Defense can transfer property or facilities within the Department of Defense to other departments or instrumentalities without reimbursement, with priority given to those willing to pay fair market value. Fair market value is based on the use of the property in 1988. This provision takes precedence over other laws regarding the disposal or transfer of real property at military installations to be closed or realigned. Before any action is taken with respect to the disposal or transfer of real property at a military installation to be closed or realigned, the Secretary of Defense must identify all areas and facilities of exceptional natural or historic character in consultation with other specified officials. Areas and facilities at a military installation of exceptional natural or historic character can be transferred to the National Park System or National Forest System upon request. If no request is made, the area or facility can be transferred to the State or local government for preservation as a recreational site without reimbursement. The Secretary of Defense can transfer property or facilities at a military installation to other departments or entities within the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard, with or without reimbursement, after meeting certain requirements. Additionally, before disposing or transferring any real property at a closed or realigned military installation under certain laws, areas of exceptional natural or historic character must be identified. Areas and facilities at a military installation of exceptional natural or historic character can be transferred to the National Park System or National Forest System without reimbursement. If no request is made, the property can be transferred to the State or local government for maintenance. The transfer of areas and facilities at a military installation of exceptional natural or historic character to the National Park System or National Forest System can be done without reimbursement if the State or local government agrees to maintain and preserve the site as a park, historic site, or recreational site."
