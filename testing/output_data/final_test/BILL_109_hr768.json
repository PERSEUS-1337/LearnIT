    "content": "The \"Family Life Education Act\" may be cited as the short title. The findings section is included in the Act. The Congress finds that various medical associations and organizations support comprehensive sexuality education, including information on abstinence and contraception. Scientific reports emphasize the importance of providing young people with knowledge about contraception to prevent teen pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, and other STDs. Research shows that comprehensive sexuality education, including contraception discussion, helps teenagers delay sexual activity and use contraceptives. It respects diverse values and beliefs, complements family education, and provides accurate information on puberty, marriage age, contraception, and STD/HIV prevention for American teens. Teen pregnancy rates are decreasing, but there are still 750,000 to 850,000 teen pregnancies annually, with 75-90% being unintended. Improved contraceptive use contributed to 75% of the decrease in teen pregnancy between 1988 and 1995, while increased abstinence accounted for 25%. Over 80% of Americans believe young people should have information on abstinence and protection from unplanned pregnancies and STDs. US teens acquire around 4,000,000 sexually transmitted infections yearly, with at least one in three sexually active individuals contracting an STD by age 24. An average of two young people in the United States are infected with HIV every hour. African Americans and Hispanic youth are disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Nearly 50% of AIDS cases among 13- to 19-year olds were among African Americans, while Hispanics comprised 20% of reported adolescent AIDS cases. Assistance is provided to reduce teen pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, and other sexually transmitted diseases, and to support healthy adolescent development. Each eligible State is entitled to receive a grant for family life education programs on abstinence and contraception to prevent teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. The programs must be age-appropriate, medically accurate, non-religious, emphasize abstinence as the best prevention method, and provide information on health benefits. The family life education program includes information on contraceptives, barrier methods, STD prevention, family communication, decision-making skills, and the effects of alcohol and drug use on decision-making. The State can use a grant for family life education to conduct activities that help young people gain knowledge about adolescence, sexual and reproductive health, male responsibility in decision-making, and develop healthy attitudes towards various subjects. The grant for family life education aims to promote healthy life skills, self-esteem, interpersonal skills, and prepare young people for adult life through education and career success. The sense of Congress is that States are encouraged, but not required, to provide matching funds. The effectiveness of family life education programs funded under section 3 will be evaluated nationally to determine their impact on delaying sexual initiation and preventing adolescent pregnancy. States are encouraged, but not required, to provide matching funds. The national evaluation of family life education programs funded under section 3 will assess their effectiveness in preventing adolescent pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, increasing contraceptive knowledge and behaviors, and identify best practices. A report on the evaluation results must be submitted to Congress by March 31, 2011, with yearly interim reports. Individual state evaluations are also encouraged for grant receipt. The State must agree to evaluate family education programs funded under section 3 to determine their effectiveness in delaying sexual initiation, preventing adolescent pregnancy, and sexually transmitted diseases. The evaluation must be conducted by an external, independent entity. The State must agree to evaluate family education programs funded under section 3 to determine their effectiveness in preventing sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, and increasing contraceptive knowledge and behaviors. Additionally, not more than 10 percent of the grant can be used for the evaluation. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The term \"eligible State\" refers to a State that submits an application for a grant under section 3 as required by the Secretary. \"HIV/AIDS\" is defined as the human immunodeficiency virus, including acquired immune deficiency syndrome. \"Medically accurate\" information is supported by research and recognized by leading medical organizations.
