The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin, connecting the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean, includes five large sub-basins and the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area. With over 15,000,000 people, it is one of the most densely populated river basins in the country. The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin is densely populated with over 15,000,000 people. A dedicated program is needed for effective communication and cooperation among various entities. The New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary is a complex natural harbor affected by freshwater inputs from several rivers. The Mohawk River, along with the Hudson, Passaic, and Raritan Rivers, contributes freshwater to the Hudson River Estuary. The Mohawk River is connected to the Erie Canal, impacting the health of both rivers. Flooding in the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin has caused significant damage, emphasizing the need for improved monitoring and floodplain management strategies. Improved floodplain management strategies based on understanding the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin's hydrology can enhance community safety and resilience to flood events. Climate change is leading to sea level rise along the eastern US coastline, increasing vulnerability to storm surge and flooding in the region. Various programs from Federal, State, regional, and local organizations support subwatersheds in the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin. Collaboration among New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut through organizations like the Delaware River Basin Commission has a history of successful resource management efforts. The impacts of recent hurricanes highlight the need for basin-wide planning to address water management challenges. Measures such as protecting wetlands, using green infrastructure, and upgrading water treatment facilities are essential to reduce the impacts of extreme weather events and maintain water quality. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" is a concise statement defining terms within a document or legislation. In this Act, \"Basin State\" refers to New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont. \"Grant program\" is the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin grant program. \"Hudson-Mohawk River Basin\" includes the drainage area of specific rivers into the New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary. \"Restoration and protection\" involves habitat conservation for fish and wildlife. The term \"restoration program\" refers to the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin program under section 4. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. \"Water resources\" include all surface and ground waters in the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin. The restoration program is established under section 4. The Secretary shall establish the \"Hudson-Mohawk River Basin Restoration Program\" within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The program will involve drawing on existing and new management plans, coordinating with various entities, and implementing water resources activities in the Basin. The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin Restoration Program involves collaboration with Basin States, advisory committees, local governments, and institutions to address environmental, economic, and cultural issues related to water resources. It supports science-based restoration and protection activities and establishes a grant program. The Secretary will consult with Federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, in implementing the program. The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin Restoration Program involves collaboration with various stakeholders, including federal agencies, Basin States, public agencies, institutions of higher education, and other parties determined by the Secretary. The program aims to address environmental, economic, and cultural issues related to water resources through science-based restoration and protection activities. The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin Restoration Program aims to address water resource management, conservation, and habitat restoration. It involves coordinating activities among federal, state, and local entities to improve water quality and support fish and wildlife habitats. The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin Restoration Program aims to sustain and enhance water management for flood mitigation, benefit fish and wildlife habitat, improve public access and recreation, facilitate strategic planning for natural systems resilience, engage the public through outreach and education, and increase scientific capacity for coordinated restoration and protection activities. The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin Restoration Program focuses on coordinated restoration and protection activities, maintaining an inventory of historic and cultural resources, promoting communication and collaboration among organizations involved in water resource management in the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin. The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin Restoration Program focuses on grants and assistance for restoration and protection activities in the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin. The Secretary will establish the \"Hudson-Mohawk River Basin Grant Program\" to provide competitive matching grants and technical assistance to eligible entities for activities outlined in section 4(d). Criteria will be developed to ensure funded activities align with program goals and Basin-wide strategy priorities. The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin Grant Program will provide competitive matching grants and technical assistance for activities aligned with program goals and Basin-wide strategy priorities. The Federal share of project costs shall not exceed 80%, while the non-Federal share can be provided in cash or in-kind contributions. The Secretary must submit annual reports to Congress on the implementation of the Act, detailing funded projects. $25,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2017 to 2023, with at least 75% allocated for grants and technical assistance."
