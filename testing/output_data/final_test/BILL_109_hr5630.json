    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Iraq Congressional Oversight Enhancement Act\". Congress acknowledges the enactment of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002, the commitment of US Armed Forces to combat operations in Iraq, the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime, the allocation of funds for Iraq's relief and reconstruction, and the transition of authority to the Coalition Provisional Authority. On November 6, 2003, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense and for the Reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan, 2004 (Public Law 108-106) was enacted into law, providing $18.4 billion for the relief and reconstruction of Iraq. On June 28, 2004, the new Iraqi government gained sovereignty, followed by the successful election of the first interim National Assembly on January 30, 2005. The National Assembly appointed an interim government and drafted a constitution. The draft constitution was approved by the Iraqi people in a referendum. The National Strategy for Victory in Iraq was issued. The first permanent National Assembly was elected, and a cabinet was named, excluding the Minister of Defense. On June 7, 2006, Iraq's National Assembly approved the individuals nominated for Minister of Defense, Minister of Interior, and National Security Advisor, completing the formation of Iraq's first permanent democratic government. SEC. 3. STATEMENTS OF POLICY. Congress expresses support for the dedication and sacrifice of US Armed Forces, civilian personnel, Coalition countries, and Iraqi patriots in promoting democracy and stability in Iraq. Congress recognizes the challenges and achievements in the political, security, infrastructure, and economic development of Iraq, supports the formation of a democratic government, and acknowledges the President's National Strategy for Victory in Iraq. Congress expresses concern about insurgent attacks on US and Coalition Forces, ethnic and sectarian violence, and the influence of politically-aligned militias in Iraq. Congress urges the Government of Iraq to promote a market-based economy, increase private-sector employment, attract investment opportunities, and allocate funds for national infrastructure development. The National Strategy for Victory in Iraq lacks specific benchmarks in political, security, and infrastructure areas. Congress acknowledges the need for benchmarks in Iraq's political, security, infrastructure, and economic development to signal victory and allow for the redeployment of US Armed Forces. This includes referencing reports on stability and security in Iraq submitted by the Secretary of Defense. Congress requests a report outlining security, economic, and Iraqi Security Force training standards and goals with a timetable. It acknowledges previous reports on US Policy in Iraq and the measures taken to support the military mission. Congress is concerned about the lack of comprehensive content, information, data, and analysis in the reports regarding stability and security in Iraq. They emphasize the need for a consolidated report from the President that meets the requirements of relevant laws. Congress urges reports on the mission in Iraq to cover political, security, infrastructure, and economic development aspects at various levels of government. It is Congress's duty to oversee military operations like Operation Iraqi Freedom. The report on the mission in Iraq should cover political, security, infrastructure, and economic development aspects at different government levels, as Congress oversees military operations like Operation Iraqi Freedom. The President must submit a report to Congress within 90 days of this Act's enactment, consolidating requirements from previous laws and defining measures for the National Strategy for Victory in Iraq. The President must submit a report to Congress every 120 days after enactment, detailing specific measures for Operation Iraqi Freedom's completion and effectiveness of programs towards strategic objectives. The President must provide updates to Congress every 120 days after the initial report on Operation Iraqi Freedom until its completion. The updates may include adjustments to measures or benchmarks based on changing circumstances in Iraq, with detailed justifications required for any changes made. The report required by subsection (a) and updates of the report required by subsection (b) must provide content, data, information, and analysis on the challenges associated with political, security, infrastructure, economic development, and governance capacity building in Iraq at various levels of government. It should also include a comprehensive all-source intelligence analysis of Iraq. The report required by subsection (a) and updates of the report required by subsection (b) shall be transmitted in unclassified form but may contain a classified annex."
