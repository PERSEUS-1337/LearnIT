    "content": "The JOBS Act, enacted in 2012, aims to boost corporate capital formation by amending federal securities laws. The 113th Congress is considering legislation to amend certain provisions of the JOBS Act, focusing on exempting savings and loan holding companies from reporting requirements and expediting SEC rulemaking on raising capital through securities laws. The House passed H.R. 701 (McHenry) on May 15, 2013, which expands the amount companies can raise through Regulation A, exempting them from registering securities offerings with the SEC. This report discusses securities registration and disclosure requirements, modifications made by the JOBS Act, criticisms of the JOBS Act's amendment to Regulation A, and legislation in the 113th Congress to amend Regulation A in the JOBS Act. The Securities Act of 1933 requires registration with the SEC to offer securities to the public. Registration includes a prospectus for purchasers and supplemental information for public inspection. Section 7 of the Act outlines the required information in the registration statement. The Securities Act of 1933 requires registration with the SEC for offering securities to the public, including specific business details, shareholders, debt, and assets. Section 10(a) of the Act specifies prospectus requirements, with exemptions for certain transactions like private placements and intrastate offerings. The SEC can exempt securities classes if in the public interest and under $5 million. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 covers various areas, including ongoing regulations. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires issuers with securities traded on a national exchange or over $1 million in assets and a certain number of shareholders to register with the SEC. Registered companies must file detailed reports, including annual and quarterly reports, containing all material information for investors. The JOBS Act addresses the decline in the U.S. IPO market and the difficulty small businesses face in obtaining traditional bank financing. It introduces the concept of emerging growth companies (EGCs) with relaxed disclosure and accounting requirements for firms with up to $1 billion in annual revenue. Under federal securities law, companies meeting EGC criteria can benefit from exemptions like Rule 506, allowing them to raise money without registering with the SEC. The JOBS Act permits EGCs to advertise their offerings to accredited investors through general solicitation. Crowdfunding is a fundraising method where money is raised through small individual contributions from a large number of people, often facilitated by the internet and social media. Donors may receive items in return for their funding. The JOBS Act created an exemption allowing crowdfunding companies to sell securities to individuals, subject to investment limitations. Regulation A exempts small businesses from registration requirements if securities issued do not exceed $5 million in a 12-month period. The SEC has yet to finalize rules for crowdfunding under the JOBS Act. Title IV of the JOBS Act, known as Reg A+, increases the offering limit to $50 million over a year from the previous $5 million. Securities offered under Reg A+ may be exempt from state securities law regulation if sold to \"qualified purchasers\" or on a national securities exchange. Proponents believe Reg A+ can enhance capital availability for smaller firms. After the passage of the JOBS Act's Title IV, Reg A+ was introduced to increase the offering limit to $50 million, aiming to expand capital availability for smaller firms. However, concerns have been raised about whether the expanded Reg A will attract new issuers due to additional costs and time required for state securities regulatory reviews. State securities regulators argue that these requirements could deter companies from taking advantage of Reg A+. The JOBS Act requires the SEC to issue rules for disclosures in Reg A offerings, including delivery of offering statements and issuer information. The SEC can impose rules for investor protection, such as filing offering statements with audited financials. Regulations will define the new offering limit and other details. The JOBS Act requires the SEC to issue regulations for Reg A offerings, including defining qualified purchasers. H.R. 701 aims to set a deadline for implementing Reg A+ rules by October 31, 2013. Representative Patrick McHenry states the bill codifies the intended deadline for Regulation A under the JOBS Act. Nearly 19 months after the JOBS Act was signed into law, a biotech industry trade group known as BIO spoke about the implications of delayed SEC rulemaking on Regulation A. Delays at the SEC have blunted the potential impact of capital formation reforms in the law. BIO applauds Rep. McHenry for introducing legislation to speed up the implementation of this important provision, which will provide a new source of capital for emerging biotech companies to fund the development of cures and breakthrough medicines. In March 2013, SEC Chair Mary Jo White testified about pursuing Reg A rulemaking quickly due to workload challenges from Congressionally mandated rulemakings related to the JOBS Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. SEC officials prioritize rulemaking based on statutory deadlines but face resource constraints. The SEC is facing an unprecedented level of work due to Congressionally mandated rulemakings related to the JOBS Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. Despite completing 80 percent of the required tasks, there are still many rulemakings and studies to be done, particularly those related to systemic risk. The SEC acknowledges missed deadlines but is focused on getting the rules right. The SEC is facing a heavy workload due to rulemakings mandated by the JOBS Act and Dodd-Frank Act. Despite missing deadlines, the agency is prioritizing completing the rules accurately. Congressional leaders have criticized the SEC for not having enough resources to fully implement the Dodd-Frank Act. The letter to then-SEC Chair Elisse Walter criticized the agency's slow pace in rulemaking for the Dodd-Frank Act and the JOBS Act. It questioned the agency's use of resources for discretionary rules on political expenditures, despite claims of inadequate resources for required rulemaking. The SEC staff was considering recommending mandatory disclosure of political expenditures. SEC commissioner Daniel Gallagher highlighted the challenges faced by the agency in managing its workload and prioritizing statutory rulemaking requirements. He emphasized the importance of avoiding regulatory distraction caused by external mandates, such as those from Congress, to ensure focus on core responsibilities. The SEC faces challenges in managing its workload and prioritizing statutory rulemaking requirements. Commissioner Daniel Gallagher stresses the need to avoid regulatory distractions from external mandates to focus on core responsibilities. The SEC must make decisions on prioritizing and sequencing rulemakings, giving effect to mandates, and pursuing certain mandates that align with its statutory mission. The agency's agenda is shaped by legislation like Dodd-Frank and the JOBS Act. The SEC's workload management and prioritization of rulemaking face challenges. Legislation like Dodd-Frank and the JOBS Act shape the agency's agenda. The Commission's scatter-shot priorities may undermine its core mission of investor protection and market efficiency. The impact of potential legislation on SEC's rulemaking, such as RegA+, remains uncertain. The legislation could prompt the SEC to prioritize certain rulemaking over others, signaling the importance of specific rulemaking tasks. The SEC's workload management and prioritization of rulemaking face challenges due to legislation like Dodd-Frank and the JOBS Act. The impact of potential legislation on SEC's rulemaking, such as RegA+, remains uncertain. Historically, banks and BHCs were required to register securities with the SEC if they had total assets exceeding $10 million and 500 or more shareholders. Title VI of the JOBS Act raised the shareholder registration threshold with the SEC from 500 to 2,000. The JOBS Act raised the shareholder registration threshold with the SEC from 500 to 2,000 and increased the upper limit for deregistration from 300 to 1,200 for financial entities. This reform aims to help community banks raise capital more easily and reduce regulatory burdens, allowing them to focus on serving their customers and communities. Banks and BHCs can increase shareholders while remaining unregistered private banks or voluntarily deregister if already registered. Benefits of being unregistered include resource and cost savings from reduced reporting burdens. Unregistered institutions still need to file call reports and BHCs must submit FR Y-6 reports. They are not required to file certain 1933 Act reports with the SEC or other regulatory authorities. This saves time and training for personnel in various departments. Deregistered banks and BHCs can save costs by eliminating SEC reporting obligations, leading to potential savings in accounting, legal, insurance, and compliance expenses. Shareholders may benefit financially from these cost savings. Unregistered institutions can list their shares on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board without the need for registration under the 1934 Act. Banks and BHCs can have their shares traded on the OTCBB by providing necessary reports and notices. Trading on the OTCBB can help mitigate loss in equity liquidity, although stocks traded there are less liquid than those on major stock exchanges. Certifying officers of registered companies are required to certify completeness and accuracy of company information. Unregistered entities are not required to certify the completeness and accuracy of company filings under the 1934 Act, unlike registered companies whose officers can be held personally liable for false certifications. This lack of certifying obligations may benefit bank shareholders, but it could also lead to potential reductions in shareholder information and a greater risk of bank fraud that could harm shareholders. Officials from the Council of Institutional Investors express concerns that unregistered entities can avoid disclosing material information to the public through the SEC, potentially leading to increased bank fraud and harm to bank shareholders. The Independent Community Bankers of America argue that SEC registration is unnecessary as other regulators already oversee bank safety and soundness. Deregistration can lead to a lack of public information about a corporation's operations, potentially causing shareholder perception problems due to a perceived lack of transparency. Experts argue that there is redundancy between SEC-required disclosures and financial regulatory disclosures for depository institutions. After the passage of the JOBS Act, privately-held banks and BHCs took advantage of Title VI to reduce shareholder ownership registration triggers and raise capital without registering with the SEC. SNL Financial found that 101 out of 208 publicly traded banks deregistered after the JOBS Act, potentially reducing available capital from stock buybacks. After the passage of the JOBS Act, 101 banks deregistered, representing a significant increase in deregistrations. Two bills, S. 872 and H.R. 801, aim to extend the Act's provisions to SLHCs. H.R. 801, sponsored by Representative Stephen Womack, aims to provide flexibility for savings and loans to raise capital without SEC regulations. The Independent Community Bankers of America supported legislation to correct a key shortcoming in Title VI's differential treatment of banks and thrifts. Thrift holding companies, subject to the same oversight and regulation as banks, should be afforded the benefits of higher shareholder registration and deregistration thresholds under the JOBS Act. Some empirical research has examined the financial impact on community banks who deregistered under the JOBS Act. One study found that, on average, the legislation resulted in higher net bank income and lower pretax expenses. However, banks also experienced lower pretax income and equity capital. Another study compared banks that deregistered before and after the JOBS Act, finding a real impact on their financial situation. The JOBS Act had a positive financial effect on community banks that deregistered in response to the act's shareholder threshold change. A study suggested extending the act's deregistration threshold to SLHCs and further liberalizing cutoffs for banks and BHCs with more than 1,200 shareholders of record."
