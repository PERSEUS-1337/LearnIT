FINDINGS.\" The Congress finds that the National Park Service administers Federal parks to conserve scenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife for future generations. The Federal Aviation Administration manages safe airspace use, and specific National Park Service lands in Hawaii include Kaloko-Honokohau, Kalaupapa, Pu'u honua o Honaunau, and Pu'u Kohola Heiau National Historical Parks. National Historical Park, Pu'u Kohola Heiau National Historic Site, Haleakala National Park, and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park are managed for wilderness preservation, protecting natural, cultural, historical, and wildlife resources, and promoting public enjoyment. Haleakala and Hawaii Volcanoes National Parks are designated as International Biosphere Reserves by the United Nations for their significant scenery and plant and animal communities. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is also a designated World Heritage Site for the importance of Mauna Loa and Kilauea Volcanoes. The National Park Service manages lands with a minimum altitude requirement for aircraft to reduce auditory and visual intrusion, potential hazards to wildlife, and safety risks for pilots and passengers. Collaboration between the Federal Aviation Administration and National Park Service is needed to address these issues. To reduce low-flying aircraft over National Park Service land, comply with the 1,500 feet AGL minimum altitude, avoid noise-sensitive areas, and respect standoff distances from primary visitor use areas. SEC. 2. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE RESPONSIBILITIES. The Director of the National Park Service is responsible for identifying areas where low-flying aircraft may impact resources and developing a reporting system for documenting instances of low-flying aircraft over National Park Service lands. The National Park Service is developing training programs and materials with the Federal Aviation Administration to recognize and report low-flying aircraft. They will also hold quarterly meetings with affected pilots to discuss resource management objectives. The Federal Aviation Administration is responsible for overseeing aviation activities. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration is responsible for communicating with pilots about low-flying aircraft in specified areas and investigating instances of pilot deviations from requested minimum altitudes. The Federal Aviation Administration is responsible for designating flight-free and visitor use areas in National Park Service lands to reduce incidents, communicating with the Department of Defense on military aircraft operations, sharing investigation results with the National Park Service, and seeking support from aviation groups. Enlisting aviation groups to spread awareness about low-altitude aircraft issues over National Park Service areas and participating in meetings to address the problem. SEC. 4. FLIGHT RESTRICTION DESIGNATIONS. Prohibition on Aircraft Operations Over Noise Sensitive Areas includes specific locations like national parks and designated wilderness areas in Hawaii where operating an aircraft is unlawful. Prohibition on aircraft flying below 1,500 feet over National Park System lands in Hawaii, with enforcement under section 40103 of title 49, US Code. Exceptions may be granted by the Federal Aviation Administrator. The Federal Aviation Administration may grant exceptions from prohibitions on aircraft flying below 1,500 feet over National Park System lands in Hawaii in emergencies or for safety reasons. Pilots will be notified of these restrictions through FAA publications. SEC. 5. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION AND NATIONAL PARK SERVICE JOINT RESPONSIBILITY. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Director of the National Park Service are jointly responsible for assessing aircraft impacts on human, cultural, and natural resources beyond what is specified in section 4. They also prepare informational materials for pilots to understand National Park Service concerns. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Park Service collaborate on managing resources and addressing overflight issues over public land areas. They share information on conducting scientific studies to understand the impact of aircraft operations on affected resources. SEC. 6. APPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN REGULATIONS TO CERTAIN SIGHTSEEING FLIGHTS: Parts 91 and 135 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, apply to nonstop sightseeing flights within a 25-mile radius of the airport."
