    "content": "The \"Historic Tax Credit Improvement Act of 2015\" increases the rehabilitation credit for certain small projects. The \"Historic Tax Credit Improvement Act of 2015\" increases the rehabilitation credit for smaller projects by substituting '30 percent' for '20 percent' in subsection (a)(2) with a maximum credit of $750,000 for all taxable years. The term 'smaller project' refers to a qualified rehabilitated building with rehabilitation expenditures under $3,750,000 and no prior credits in the last two years. Progress expenditures cannot be included in the credit calculation. The amendment made by this section applies to periods after the enactment of this Act, following rules similar to section 48(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. SEC. 3. Allowance for the transfer of credits for certain small projects. Allowance for the transfer of credits for smaller projects under Section 47(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows taxpayers to transfer a portion of the credit for a smaller project with certification requirements. The transferability of a certificate issued under Section 47(e) of the Internal Revenue Code allows taxpayers to transfer credits to another taxpayer, with specific information required for the transfer process. The transferability of a certificate issued under Section 47(e) of the Internal Revenue Code allows taxpayers to transfer credits to another taxpayer, with restrictions on multiple transfers and specific tax treatment for the transferee. No deduction is allowed for consideration paid by the transferee, but the transferee can claim the credit in their taxable year. The taxpayer claiming a credit by transferring it to another party must follow recapture rules and provide information reports as required by the Secretary. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for implementing this paragraph. The amendments in this section will apply after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 4 amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the types of buildings eligible for rehabilitation by adjusting the adjusted basis. This amendment will apply to taxable years after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 5 reduces the basis adjustment for rehabilitation property. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to adjust the rehabilitation credit and coordination with basis adjustment for eligible properties. Only 50% of the credit and recapture amount will be taken into account. This applies to taxable years after the Act's enactment. The lessee must include 50% of the allowable credit under section 38 in their gross income over the shortest recovery period applicable under section 168 for the property leased. SEC. 6. SPECIAL RULES FOR DISPOSITIONS OF STATE HISTORIC TAX CREDITS. This section adds a new section to the Internal Revenue Code regarding the disposition of state historic tax credits. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code addresses the treatment of State historic tax credits when transferred or refunded. It states that the net proceeds from such transactions do not count as income for the taxpayer, and the basis of the property receiving the credit is reduced accordingly. The reduction in basis is first applied against the land's basis. The adjusted basis of property receiving State historic tax credits is reduced in three steps: first against the land's basis, second against the basis of any building not treated as a qualified rehabilitation expenditure, and third against the remaining basis in the property. Additionally, adjustments are made to the basis of a partner's interest in a partnership or stock in an S corporation. Adjustments made under this subsection affect the basis of property held by the partnership or S corporation. Taxpayers can elect to include the net proceeds of certain allocations, dispositions, or refunds as income, with specific conditions and regulations set by the Secretary. The transfer or allocation of State historic tax credits does not affect the amount of qualified rehabilitation expenditures for the rehabilitation credit. Basis adjustments and transfers do not trigger early disposition rules for investment credit property recapture. State Historic Tax Credits are defined for this purpose. State historic tax credits are defined as credits against State or local tax liabilities for property rehabilitation expenditures, which can be allocated, disposed, or refunded under State laws. State historic tax credits can be transferred or disposed of after the enactment of this Act. Modifications regarding tax-exempt use property and eliminating functionally related properties are also addressed. The amendment to Section 47 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows functionally related buildings to be treated as separate certified historic structures for the rehabilitation credit. This amendment applies to applications received after the enactment of the Act."
