    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"One Percent Spending Reduction Act of 2014\". Congressional findings and purpose are outlined in the Act. Congress finds that the fiscal crisis faced by the Federal Government demands immediate action due to the dramatic growth in spending and debt in recent years, which threatens economic and national security. Federal spending has increased from 18% to over 20% of GDP since 2001, with total Federal debt exceeding $17 trillion and projected to rise to $27 trillion by 2024. Interest payments on this debt will soon escalate, making budget balancing a critical issue. The purpose of this Act is to address the fiscal crisis by quickly balancing the Federal budget, reducing spending annually until it matches projected revenues, and reforming entitlement programs. Federal revenues are set to increase to 18% of GDP, in line with the average over the past 40 years. Without reform, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and health-related spending will consume all tax revenues. Reforming entitlement programs is essential for long-term fiscal stability and balance. Establishment and enforcement of spending caps under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, with the addition of a new section on establishing outlay caps. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 establishes spending caps, including outlay caps for fiscal years 2015 to 2017, and sets aggregate outlays based on GDP for fiscal year 2018 onwards. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 sets spending caps and aggregate outlays based on GDP for fiscal years. Sequestration may be ordered to eliminate excess outlay amounts. For fiscal years 2015 through 2017, the term 'excess outlay amount' refers to the difference between total projected Federal outlays and the outlay cap. For fiscal year 2018 and beyond, it is the amount by which total projected Federal outlays exceed the outlay cap. Sequestration may be implemented to address excess outlay amounts. Each year, the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget issue sequestration preview reports in August, with the final report from the Office of Management and Budget and Presidential order for spending reductions issued in October. If the August 20 report by the Office of Management and Budget projects a sequestration, the Committees on the Budget of the Senate and the House of Representatives may report a resolution directing committees to change existing law for spending reductions necessary to meet outlay limits. No exempt programs apply to this section or any sequestration order issued under it, except for payments for net interest. Payments for net interest are exempt from spending reductions under sequestration. If a bill causing excess outlays is enacted after November 14, the excess outlay amount for the next fiscal year will be increased by that breach. Conforming amendments to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 include setting forth estimates for aggregate projected outlays for budget years 2015 through 2017. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 exempts interest payments from spending reductions under sequestration. Final sequestration reports must include information on outlay caps and reductions required for each budget year. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 exempts interest payments from sequestration. Reports must include estimates of sequesterable budgetary resources, outlays, and effects on outlays for direct spending programs. Enforcement measures are added to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. \"Enforcement procedures are added to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\" The text prohibits bills that breach the current outlay cap. Waivers require a two-thirds vote in the Senate and House. The House requires a two-thirds vote to consider a rule that waives certain provisions. SEC. 4. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS: The table of contents in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 are amended to include new enforcement procedures and establishing outlay caps.\n\nSEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE: This Act and its amendments apply to fiscal year 2015 and beyond, including necessary reports and calculations for implementation in fiscal year 2015."
