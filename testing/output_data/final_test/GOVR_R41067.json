    "content": "On April 20, 2008, Fernando Lugo, a former Roman Catholic bishop, was elected President of Paraguay, ending six decades of one-party rule. His victory was seen as a positive step towards strengthening the country's fragile democracy and breaking away from its history of authoritarian leadership and corruption. Paraguay's political environment has been shaped by its turbulent history, including a significant loss of territory and population in the War of the Triple Alliance. In the late 19th century, a two-party political system emerged in Paraguay with the Colorado Party and the Liberal Party. The Colorado Party dominated from 1887 to 1904, followed by the Liberal Party until 1940. The Chaco War with Bolivia from 1932-1935 weakened political institutions. The military took control in 1940, leading to authoritarian rule. The Colorado Party regained power in 1946, solidifying its control through various means. General Alfredo Stroessner staged a coup in 1954. During General Alfredo Stroessner's 35-year rule in Paraguay, known as the Stronato, he established a repressive military dictatorship, systematically harassing and persecuting political opponents. His regime, supported by the military and the Colorado Party, isolated Paraguay from the international community. The Stroessner military dictatorship ended in 1989, leading to a challenging political transition due to the country's authoritarian past. After the end of General Alfredo Stroessner's repressive military dictatorship in 1989, Paraguay faced a challenging political transition due to its authoritarian past. Despite adopting a new constitution in 1992 and electing its first civilian president in 1993, Paraguay's democracy struggled with periods of instability, including a military coup attempt, political assassinations, and presidential resignations. Corruption remained a significant obstacle to democratic consolidation and economic development. President Nicanor Duarte Frutos (2003-2008) implemented measures to combat corruption, such as increasing penalties for tax evasion, improving tax revenue collection, enhancing government spending oversight, and cracking down on contraband and counterfeit goods. Members of the Supreme Court were removed due to corruption allegations. In 2008, Paraguay elected former bishop Fernando Lugo as president, seen as a chance to strengthen democratic transition. Lugo faces the challenge of gaining control over the government bureaucracy still dominated by the Colorado Party. In the 2008 Paraguayan presidential election, three major candidates were Blanca Ovelar of the Colorado Party, Fernando Lugo backed by the Patriotic Alliance for Change, and Lino Oviedo of the National Union of Ethical Citizens. Lugo focused on empowering the poor, agrarian and health reform, and fighting corruption. He also aimed to renegotiate hydroelectric power supply treaties with Brazil and Argentina. Lugo's coalition won the election with 40.8% of the vote, followed by Blanca Ovelar with 30.6% and Oviedo with 21.9%. International observers praised the successful conduct of the elections. Lugo, elected in 2008, aimed to fight corruption and reduce inequality. His election raised hopes among Paraguay's poor majority, but his coalition fractured in 2009. The PLRA, a key party, left the coalition, with Vice President Franco accusing Lugo of treason. President Lugo faced challenges in fulfilling his electoral promises, leading to questions about his leadership abilities and the possibility of impeachment. A scandal involving paternity claims further weakened his credibility, but some argued that it may not have a significant impact in a culture valuing virility. President Lugo faced challenges in his first year in office, with limited success in working with an opposition congress. His reform agenda was hindered by a splintered electoral coalition, lack of political skills, and a culture of corruption. His popular support dwindled, with only 18% approval in a December 2009 poll. Calls for impeachment grew as he entered his second year in office. Calls for impeachment of President Lugo increased in his second year in office, but the opposition in Congress lacks the majority needed to impeach him. In November 2009, Lugo changed military leadership for the fourth time, citing concerns about pro-coup sentiment, although he later denied any coup plot. Pressure to improve security mounted after a businessman was kidnapped by a guerrilla group with reported links to the military. In January 2010, Paraguay's Vice President called for increased security measures in response to a businessman's kidnapping by a guerrilla group. The businessman was released unharmed after a ransom was paid. President Lugo vowed to bring the kidnappers to justice and improve security in the area where the group operates. Despite opposition, Lugo has had political successes, focusing on reducing inequality through social and health reforms, including expanding cash transfer programs. President Lugo's efforts to reduce poverty included expanding the conditional cash transfer program, increasing benefits for poor families, and negotiating higher payments from Brazil for hydro-electric power from the Itaip\u00fa Dam. The dam, a joint project between Brazil and Paraguay, generates electricity that Paraguay mostly sells to Brazil until 2023 when the treaty expires. In July 2009, Brazil agreed to triple the price it paid Paraguay for energy from the Itaip\u00fa Dam and included financing for transmission lines to Asunci\u00f3n. The new agreement aimed to support President Lugo amidst political challenges. The Paraguayan Congress approved the deal, but it awaited ratification from the Brazilian Congress. The agreement would increase Paraguay's income from the dam to $360 million and was expected to be approved by the Brazilian Congress in 2010. President Lugo of Paraguay has maintained good bilateral relations with the United States, receiving support for anti-corruption efforts and economic growth. The US has provided over $60 million in funding for programs in Paraguay, including assistance from the Millennium Challenge Corporation. Collaboration between the two countries also extends to anti-narcotics efforts. President Lugo of Paraguay has friendly relations with President Ch\u00e1vez but has not joined the leftist political alliance ALBA. Paraguay is a member of Mercosur and has opposed Venezuela's full membership in the customs union. Paraguay has opposed Venezuela's full membership in the customs union due to animosity towards Ch\u00e1vez in the Paraguayan Congress. Paraguay, similar in size to California, has a population of 6.9 million people of mixed Spanish and Guaran\u00ed Indian descent. The economy, heavily reliant on agriculture, grew by 6.8% in 2007 but remains one of the poorest countries in Latin America. Paraguay's GDP growth is closely tied to its larger neighbors, Brazil and Argentina. Paraguay's economy, heavily reliant on agriculture, experienced a sharp contraction in 2009 but is projected to return to growth in 2010. Former President Duarte implemented reforms that helped the economy rebound, including anti-corruption initiatives. The economy heavily depends on traditional agricultural exports like soybeans, cotton, and meat. Paraguay's economy heavily relies on traditional agricultural exports such as soybeans, cotton, and meat, which make up approximately 20% of GDP and employ a quarter of the workforce. The industrial sector is underdeveloped, with a small manufacturing sector producing goods like agricultural products, leather, textiles, ADP machine parts, and tobacco. The service sector is dominated by communications, benefiting from strong FDI and electricity production from the Itaip\u00fa hydropower plant.

The service sector is dominated by communications, benefiting from strong FDI and electricity production from the Itaip\u00fa hydropower plant. The country's informal sector is large, estimated to be twice the size of the formal sector, leading to higher actual unemployment and underemployment rates. Poverty rates have slightly decreased from 61% in 2001 to 58.2% in 2008. Remittances from Paraguayans living abroad have significantly contributed to economic growth, reaching $800 million in 2008. The commercial sector heavily relies on importing goods from the US and Asia for re-export, with many goods not declared at customs, leading to a loss in tax revenue. Counterfeit trade is also a significant issue. Increased government enforcement of taxes and custom laws is impacting the underground economy in Paraguay, but challenges remain. The Congress delayed the implementation of a personal income tax, affecting social expenditures and land reform plans. The fiscal deficit was raised by the majority in Congress, leading to accusations of sabotaging the President's policies. Opposition in Congress continues to prevent the implementation of the personal income tax. President Lugo's efforts to address income inequality and land reform have been hindered by opposition in Congress, delaying the implementation of key policies. Despite this, Lugo has maintained orthodox macroeconomic policies, leading to positive economic growth. His appointment of finance minister Dionisio Borda, known for fiscal reform, signals a commitment to macroeconomic stability. Stricter fiscal controls have increased tax revenue, strengthening Paraguay's economy. Relations with the United States remain strong. The United States and Paraguay have good relations, cooperating on counternarcotics and counterterrorism efforts. The U.S. strongly supports Paraguay's democracy and economic reforms. U.S. imports from Paraguay were $78.4 million in 2008, with exports over $1.6 billion, mainly machinery. Intellectual property rights protection is a U.S. concern, with efforts made by the Duarte government. The United States Trade Representative highlights ongoing issues in Paraguay related to border security and legal enforcement. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed in 2003 to strengthen intellectual property rights protection, with subsequent extensions in 2007 and 2009. U.S. foreign assistance to Paraguay increased to $26.1 million in FY2009, including funds for health and economic growth. The Obama Administration's FY2010 request allocated $13.9 million in assistance, with a focus on global health and development. In FY2009, the United States provided $2.1 million for Global Health and Child Survival, $5.8 million in Development Assistance, $425,000 for International Military Education and Training, $750,000 for Foreign Military Financing, $500,000 for International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement assistance, and $4.3 million for a Peace Corps program in Paraguay with 200 volunteers. Additionally, Paraguay received $6.69 million in Section 1207 funding from the Department of Defense to support democratic consolidation and reduce violence during its transition to multi-party democracy. In May 2006, Paraguay signed a $34.65 million Threshold Program agreement with the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) to strengthen the rule of law and business transparency. The program reduced the time to start a business by half. In May 2009, a second two-year MCC Threshold program for $30.3 million was signed to support anti-corruption efforts in law enforcement, customs, health care, and judiciary. Additionally, Paraguay received $7.4 million in debt relief under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act in 2006. Paraguay received $7.4 million in debt relief under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act in exchange for conserving and restoring tropical forests in the southeastern region. The country is a major transit point for illegal drugs, particularly marijuana, with the Chaco region and the tri-border area being key locations for drug trafficking. The United States has been assisting Paraguay in counternarcotics efforts by providing training, equipment, and technical assistance to strengthen the National Anti-Drug Secretariat (SENAD) and combat money laundering and corruption. SENAD in Paraguay made progress against narcotics trafficking in 2008 with record marijuana seizures, but cocaine seizures decreased. President Lugo aims to reduce Paraguay's drug transit status. SENAD agents are unarmed civil servants, as the Senate rejected a bill to arm them. Budget constraints, weak laws, and corruption limit SENAD's effectiveness. After President Evo Morales expelled the U.S. DEA from Bolivia in 2008, some agents were sent to Paraguay in 2009. Bills were introduced in the U.S. Congress to extend trade preferences to Paraguay under the ATPDEA. The U.S. lost eligibility for the program in 2008 due to anti-narcotics cooperation issues. The United States is concerned about illicit activities in the tri-border area of Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil, where money laundering, drug trafficking, arms smuggling, and trade in counterfeit goods are prevalent. The region lacks surveillance and has weak law enforcement, leading to local corruption. The U.S. has worked with the TBA countries on counterterrorism issues through the \"3+1\" regional cooperation mechanism and provided anti-terrorism and anti-money-laundering support to Paraguay. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) investigated trade-based money laundering in the region in 2006. The United States has assisted the Paraguayan government in developing a Trade Transparency Unit to detect customs fraud, money laundering, and terrorism financing. U.S. Treasury officials have conducted workshops to involve the banking sector in anti-money laundering efforts. The U.S. embassy in Asunci\u00f3n provided training for local investigators and prosecutors to combat terrorism links. Concerns have been raised about Hezbollah and Hamas raising funds through illicit activities in the region, but there is no confirmed information according to the State Department's terrorism report for 2008. The 2008 terrorism report stated that Paraguay lacks strong anti-money laundering and terrorist financing legislation, despite improvements in money laundering laws. The country's judicial system and police force are seen as ineffective and corrupt. Legislation to prosecute money laundering and terrorism was delayed, and effective terrorist financing laws are crucial for Paraguay to meet international obligations. Paraguay's efforts to address illicit activity in the TBA were hindered by a lack of resources and corruption within customs, police, and the judiciary. With U.S. support, progress was made against money laundering, including raids on illegal exchange houses. The United States provided assistance in training judges, prosecutors, and police in investigation techniques critical to money laundering and terrorist cases. Paraguay made progress on counterterrorism legislation in 2009, with the passing of a measure modifying the anti-money laundering law. The bill empowers the Secretariat for the Prevention of Money Laundering in several ways. The Secretariat for the Prevention of Money Laundering (SEPRELAD) in Paraguay has been elevated to the level of a ministry reporting directly to the President. It now has increased powers to require Suspicious Transaction Reports from a wider range of financial institutions and to audit them for anti-money laundering procedures. Additionally, there have been attempts to criminalize terrorism-related offenses, but objections from human rights organizations led to the withdrawal of proposed legislation in December 2009. Paraguayan authorities are optimistic that a modified initiative may pass later in 2010, despite concerns that it may threaten international human rights protection and undermine freedom of assembly and speech."
