This new part allows for the establishment of Small Business Start-Up Savings Accounts to encourage entrepreneurship. The \"Incentivize Growth Now In Tomorrow's Entrepreneurs Act of 2015\" introduces Small Business Start-Up Savings Accounts, which are exempt from taxation but subject to unrelated business income taxes. These accounts are trusts created for qualified start-up expenditures by designated beneficiaries, meeting specific requirements. No contributions accepted unless in cash, limited to $10,000 or compensation amount. Trustee must be a bank or meet requirements. No investment in life insurance contracts, no commingling of trust funds. The trust assets cannot be commingled with other property except in a common trust fund or common investment fund. Qualified start-up expenditures are defined as per section 195 and include the taxpayer's share of such expenditures in an entity where they hold stock or interest. However, this term does not apply if the business has more than 50 full-time employees in a taxable year. The tax treatment of distributions is outlined in section 72. Distributions for qualified start-up expenditures are not included in gross income if the expenses exceed the distributions. The tax code allows for exclusion of distributions related to qualified start-up expenditures from gross income, based on the ratio of expenses to total distributions. No deductions, credits, or exclusions are permitted for these expenditures if they are already excluded from income. Excess contributions can be returned before the tax return due date. Excess contributions to small business start-up savings accounts can be distributed before the tax return due date, accompanied by the net income attributable to the excess contribution. Excess contribution refers to any contribution exceeding the allowable amount for the taxable year.

Transfer of an individual's interest in a small business start-up savings account to a spouse or former spouse under a divorce or separation instrument is not taxable. After the transfer, the account is treated as belonging to the spouse. If a surviving spouse becomes the designated beneficiary of a small business start-up savings account after the account beneficiary's death, the account will be treated as if the spouse were the account beneficiary. In other cases where someone else acquires the account beneficiary's interest due to death, the account will no longer be considered a small business start-up savings account.
