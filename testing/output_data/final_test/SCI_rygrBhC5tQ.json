    "content": "Humans learn complex skills by building on previously acquired skills and transitioning between them. To enable machines to do the same, a method is proposed to learn transition policies that connect primitive skills for sequential tasks without manual rewards. Proximity predictors are introduced to train these policies efficiently by rewarding proximity to suitable initial states for the next skill. The method is tested on challenging tasks like bipedal locomotion and robotic arm manipulation, showing improved performance over traditional methods. Transition policies allow for effective composition of complex skills with existing primitive skills, while the induced rewards from the proximity predictor enhance training efficiency by providing more detailed information compared to sparse environment rewards. The environments, primitive skills, and code are made public for further research at https://youngwoon.github.io/transition."
