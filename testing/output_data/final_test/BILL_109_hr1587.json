This attestation must confirm that the employer advertised the position on a designated internet-based job database. State employment security agencies require employers to post job openings on 'America's Job Bank' for 14 days. Employers must provide documentation of job postings and received resumes. The Secretary of Labor will verify this information with procedures established in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security. Employers submitting false documentation will face penalties, including ineligibility to file petitions for nonimmigrant workers for 3 to 10 years.
