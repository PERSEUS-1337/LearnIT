    "content": "The report provides information on U.S. military base closures and realignments, including data on domestic bases and costs/savings. From 1976 to 1988, few domestic bases were closed due to restrictions, but in 1988, the first of four base realignment and closure commissions was established. These commissions made 499 recommendations, with 451 requiring action. The term \"base closure\" is often used loosely and may not always involve a base. The term \"base closure\" is used loosely and imprecisely, as it may involve a \"facility,\" \"mission,\" or \"function\" rather than a traditional base. Military installations can vary in size and function, with multiple activities housed on a single installation. A BRAC recommendation may impact various activities without fully closing an installation, and closures may involve relatively small facilities. The Department of Defense has approximately 5,000 properties worldwide, ranging from small facilities to major military bases like Nellis air force base. There are 588 installations listed on their website, excluding minor activities and smaller properties, divided into U.S. installations and international ones. The 527 U.S. installations are categorized as major, minor, and \"other\" by the Army, Air Force, and Navy based on different criteria. Major installations have 5,000 or more personnel, minors have 1,000-5,000, and \"other\" have 300-1,000. The Air Force categorizes based on wing or squadron size, while the Navy uses battlegroup homeport locations and other factors. The 1995 BRAC commission report stated that there were 505 BRAC actions, not 534 as initially reported. The General Accounting Office (GAO) reported that the four BRAC commissions made 499 recommendations, but only 451 required action due to changes by later commissions. This discrepancy makes it challenging to determine the exact number of BRAC actions. The BRAC recommendations have included closures, realignments, disestablishments, relocations, and redirections. The closing of all 451 BRAC installations is expected to be completed by the end of FY2001. However, disposing of the closed property is expected to take many more years, with environmental clean-up standards causing delays. The Department of Defense has adopted interim leases to expedite the process. The Department of Defense provides statistics on major closures and realignments, with a total of 97 identified. The baseline figure for major bases is 495, including BRAC and non-BRAC bases. Two remaining BRAC major bases, McClellan AFB, CA, and Roslyn Air Guard Station, NY, are scheduled to close in fiscal year 2001. The domestic base structure was reduced by 15% after the 1993 closures were added to previous rounds. The Department of Defense estimated that adding the 1995 closures to previous ones would reduce the domestic base structure by approximately 21%. They have been urging Congress to authorize additional base closure rounds to free up funds for new weapon systems and increase training and readiness of the armed forces. Many authorities on defense policy agree with this assessment. Some authorities agree with the Department of Defense's assessment that closing overseas bases would result in a 26% reduction in overall base structure. Concerns also exist about the potential need for reconstitution to increase military capability in the face of a powerful enemy. In mid-1997, Secretary of Defense William Cohen called for two new rounds of base closures and realignments to continue the process of closing underutilized facilities. Despite DOD pressure, most Members of Congress were reluctant to support authorization of new base closure legislation at that time, citing grass-roots opposition and President Clinton's involvement in previous base closure decisions. The House of Representatives showed stronger opposition compared to the Senate. In the Senate, proponents of new base closure rounds attempted to attach an amendment to the FY1999 defense authorization bill but failed. The base closing issue was revived at the outset of the 106th Congress, with legislation introduced to authorize two new rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2003. The Clinton Administration also included provision for two more rounds in 2001 and 2005 in its budget for FY2000. The FY2000 defense authorization bill rejected proposals for new base closings by Senators McCain and Levin. The Department of Defense announced plans to seek authority for base closures starting in 2003, citing a strong national economy and assuring that politics would not interfere. The Pentagon endorsed the BRAC process as an effective tool for making difficult decisions. Senator John McCain and Senator Carl Levin proposed two additional rounds of base closures and realignments in 2003 and 2005 to address the estimated 23% excess infrastructure costing at least $3.6 billion a year. However, their initiative was rejected by a vote of 35 to 63. In the 107th Congress, they reintroduced a bill (S. 397) for the same purpose. Senators McCain and Levin reintroduced bill S. 397 for two new rounds of base closures in 2003 and 2005. Taxpayers for Common Sense supported the initiative, estimating savings of up to $21 billion by 2015. Analyzing costs and savings of BRAC closings shows initial higher costs turning into savings later on. The Department of Defense is facing challenges in accurately determining data involving savings from base realignments and closures. Difficulty in locating original cost and savings estimates has complicated matters, with DOD, Congressional Budget Office, and General Accounting Office addressing these issues. Source: GAO's analysis of DOD data. (12) Department of Defense submitted a report in April 1998 on the estimated costs and savings for the first four rounds of closures. The Department of Defense submitted a report in April 1998 on the estimated costs and savings for the first four rounds of closures. The report stated that the savings from the shutdown of bases and facilities during BRAC's rounds would exceed initial estimates, allowing for increased spending on modernization and transformation of forces while maintaining readiness levels. The report highlighted the challenges in accurately determining savings and emphasized the need for estimating savings produced by management reforms, consolidations, and reorganizations. The DOD report estimated net total savings of about $14 billion from the four BRAC rounds through 2001, with annual savings projected to be around $5.6 to $5.7 billion. The savings include one-time costs and recurring savings starting the year after completion of each round. Total savings through 2001 consist of various factors affecting DOD installations and budgets. The DOD estimated net total savings of $14 billion from the four BRAC rounds through 2001, with annual savings projected at $5.6 to $5.7 billion. Total savings include one-time costs and recurring savings after each round. The Congressional Budget Office reviewed DOD's 1998 report and found estimates of savings consistent with their own, acknowledging firm measures of BRAC savings requested by Congress. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) acknowledged that firm measures of BRAC savings requested by Congress do not exist as they are avoided costs, not actual expenditures. DOD can only estimate savings rather than measure them. CBO also noted that DOD was unable to locate some requested data, including original cost and saving estimates given to BRAC commissions. The General Accounting Office submitted its review of DOD's report on November 13. The General Accounting Office reviewed DOD's report on BRAC savings, noting that precise accounting is difficult due to data limitations. Despite initial costs, substantial long-term savings are expected from military base closures. The Department of Defense has repeatedly emphasized the need to close military bases due to excess capacity, seeking authority from Congress for new closure rounds in 2003 and 2005. Failure to close unneeded bases could impede resource allocation and cost the Pentagon $20 billion in the future. Congress' actions will determine the potential $3 billion in annual savings from base closures. The Pentagon is pushing for new base closure rounds to save money, with Congress's actions crucial in achieving future savings. The high cost of maintaining excess base capacity burdens the Department of Defense, making base closure a top priority. Members of Congress may be more willing to authorize new closure rounds after the 2000 presidential election. The argument against new base closure rounds due to perceived abuse in handling air force bases under the Clinton Administration is now largely moot. Congress has a brief window of opportunity to establish a new base closure commission before dwindling support and possible rejection if delayed closer to the 2004 election."
