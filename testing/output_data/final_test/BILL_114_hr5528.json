    "content": "The \"Simplifying the Application for Student Aid Act\" changes certain provisions in the Higher Education Act of 1965 related to student aid. It mandates the use of data from the second preceding year and adjusts the calculation of annual percentage for Federal Pell Grants. Additionally, it simplifies the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The \"Simplifying the Application for Student Aid Act\" amends Section 483 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require the electronic version of FAFSA forms to be available on mobile devices within 180 days. Applicants can save data and submit their FAFSA through this tool. The Secretary will conduct consumer testing to ensure that the electronic FAFSA forms and mobile technology tool are user-friendly for students and families, including current and prospective college students, family members, and experts in financial aid processes. The Secretary aims to simplify the FAFSA process by allowing applicants to use the IRS data retrieval tool to transfer data, reducing the need for manual entry and enhancing data accuracy for calculating expected family contributions. The Secretary aims to simplify the FAFSA process by using technology to automatically populate forms with IRS data and direct applicants to relevant questions. The current data retrieval tool can be utilized by single taxpayers, married taxpayers filing jointly, and married taxpayers filing separately. The Secretary will continue to explore using IRS data to streamline the application process. The IRS can generate an expected family contribution without student or taxpayer action. The Secretary reports on FAFSA simplification efforts and access needs. $3,000,000 from Department of Education funds will be used for this Act and its amendments. No additional funds are authorized by this Act for carrying out its amendments. The House of Representatives passed the Act on July 11, 2016. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
