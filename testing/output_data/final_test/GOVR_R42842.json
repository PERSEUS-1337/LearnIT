The meetings result in a joint Leaders' Declaration outlining commitments to liberalize trade and investment regimes. The United States often holds bilateral meetings with selected leaders during this event, even if the President does not attend. During the APEC Leaders' Meeting in Vladivostok, Secretary Clinton met with representatives from Japan, Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. A planned meeting with Hong Kong's Chief Executive was canceled. Prior to the meeting, she also met with Indonesia's President and China's President. The Joint Leaders' Declaration focused on advancing trade, strengthening food security, establishing reliable supply chains, and promoting cooperation for innovative growth. The declaration reaffirmed APEC's commitment to regional economic integration and the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific. The APEC Leaders' Declaration at the Vladivostok meeting highlighted progress on trade agreements, including a model chapter on transparency. It also emphasized tariff reduction for environmental goods and called for implementation of declarations on food security. Leaders committed to combat illegal wildlife trade and promote more reliable supply chains in the Asia-Pacific region. The APEC Leaders' Declaration at the Vladivostok meeting emphasized progress on trade agreements, including transparency and tariff reduction for environmental goods. The United States delegation focused on lowering tariffs on 54 categories of environmental goods to 5% or less by 2015, aiming for a 10% improvement in supply-chain performance. The declaration also committed to developing non-discriminatory innovation policies to involve small enterprises and women in technological innovation. The APEC members agreed to lower tariffs on 54 categories of environmental goods to 5% by 2015. The United States focused on goods related to environmental issues. Leaders pledged to strengthen energy security by promoting energy efficiency and cleaner sources of sustainable energy. The APEC leaders reaffirmed their commitment to reduce energy intensity by 45% by 2035 and agreed to increase the use of natural gas, invest in energy infrastructure, and cooperate in nuclear energy. They also acknowledged the challenge of ensuring a secure food supply and pledged to boost sustainable agricultural production, improve technology, enhance agricultural trading systems, and combat illegal fishing. Secretary Clinton pushed for stronger measures by APEC members to combat illegal wildlife trade after her trip to Africa. APEC leaders focused on food security and sustainable agriculture, building on previous declarations like the Niigata Declaration and the Kazan Declaration. These declarations aimed at sustainable development in the agricultural sector and promoting investment, trade, and markets. The APEC ministers emphasized sharing agricultural technology, harmonizing regulations, and improving food access for vulnerable groups. They highlighted the damage from overfishing and called for sustainable marine ecosystem management. The 18th Leaders' Meeting in Yokohama aimed for a robust community through innovative growth. The 2012 Leaders' Declaration stressed the inclusion of SMMEs and women in fostering innovation in the Asia-Pacific region. APEC members agreed to pursue various aspects of promoting innovative growth. The APEC Leaders' Declaration in 2010 set a goal of improving supply chain performance by 10% by 2015. Discussions at the recent meeting focused on identifying and addressing \"chokepoints\" in supply chains, promoting greener and more efficient supply chains, and improving export consolidation. APEC members agreed to conduct comprehensive supply chain performance assessments in preparation for next year's Leaders' Meetings. During the recent APEC meeting, leaders discussed reducing trade barriers and enhancing trade facilitation. They reaffirmed their commitment to rollback protectionist measures and agreed to increase transparency in trade regulations. APEC will continue capacity building initiatives and exchange best practices to promote secure trade. Past APEC efforts to lower technical barriers to trade have positively impacted intra-regional trade. Barriers to trade and facilitating trade have significantly impacted intra-regional trade and investment. A study by APEC's Economic Committee showed a notable improvement in ease of doing business in APEC economies between 2009 and 2011. This improvement exceeded APEC's target and was part of efforts to promote trade liberalization. The role of APEC in U.S. trade policy and its interaction with TPP negotiations shifted during President Obama's first term. The TPP was presented as a model for establishing a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific. Investment liberalization in the region is a key focus for APEC members, who are exploring alternative regional integration models like ASEAN+3 and ASEAN+6. The annual APEC Leaders' Meeting serves as a platform for TPP negotiating nations to update other members on trade talks progress. The 2012 Leaders' Declaration directs APEC ministers to consider regional undertakings, potentially including the TPP, as a step towards an eventual FTAAP. TPP negotiations have caused some tension among APEC members, with differing views on its impact. The FTAAP has been a source of tension among APEC members, with differing views on its importance and relationship to the TPP. The 2009 Leaders' Declaration mentioned exploring pathways to the FTAAP without explicitly mentioning the TPP, while the 2010 Declaration was more explicit about the FTAAP's role in APEC's regional economic integration agenda. Leaders committed to concrete steps towards realizing the FTAAP as a comprehensive free trade agreement building on ongoing regional undertakings. APEC aims to contribute to the development of the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) by focusing on sectoral initiatives like investment, services, e-commerce, and trade facilitation. While APEC emphasizes FTAAP, the US prioritizes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Secretary Clinton emphasized the importance of the TPP during a press conference in Vladivostok, highlighting it as central to America's economic vision in Asia. Critics have questioned the value of APEC and its annual Leaders' Meeting, with suggestions that the US could be represented by the Secretary of State or Vice President in the future. The Obama Administration is consulting with Indonesia, next year's APEC host, to set dates for the Leaders' Meeting so that the President can attend. Congress will continue to have an active interest in APEC's major meetings and any resulting commitments. Funding must be appropriated for the U.S. share to support APEC's operations and initiatives. At this year's Leaders' Meeting, APEC members pledged to reduce tariff rates on environmental goods to below 5% by 2015. The United States may need to adjust tariff rates on environmental goods to comply with APEC commitments. Congress provided funding for APEC-related activities, with President Obama requesting an increase for FY2013. APEC-related activities involve multiple federal departments and agencies. In Fiscal Year 2013, APEC activities involve 17 federal departments and agencies focusing on regulatory reform, Customs procedures, anti-corruption efforts, and transportation security. The 113th Congress will be asked for funding for APEC activities, including key issues discussed in Vladivostok. A table lists 54 categories of goods in the APEC agreement to lower tariff rates to 5% or less by 2015. Categories with peak tariff rates above 5% are highlighted."
