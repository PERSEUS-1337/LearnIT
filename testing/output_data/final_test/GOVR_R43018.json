These technologies have enhanced communication, but also raised concerns about adapting existing laws and regulations to new electronic platforms. This report analyzes Member use of Twitter and Facebook as electronic communication mediums. It provides an overview and background of each platform and examines usage patterns during a two-month period in 2011. The report acknowledges the dynamic nature of technology adoption and emphasizes that conclusions drawn from the data may not be easily generalized. Members of Congress now have more communication options available, including e-mail, websites, social networking sites, and other electronic-based methods. The rise of electronic communication has changed how Members of Congress interact with constituents. Traditional methods are still used, but new technologies like email, websites, blogs, YouTube, and social media are increasingly popular. In 2011, the House received over 243 million emails, while the Senate received 83 million. Postal mail to Congress has decreased by over 50%. Electronic communication has also reduced the cost of reaching constituents compared to traditional mail. Twitter, created in 2006 by Jack Dorsey, is a web-based social networking service that allows users to send short messages called \"Tweets.\" Users can post thoughts on various topics, and it is used by individuals and organizations to state opinions, promote events, and announce products and services. Legislative branch entities like the U.S. Government Accountability Office and the Library of Congress actively use Twitter for communication. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), Library of Congress (LOC), and Government Printing Office (GPO) use Twitter for communication. Restaurant Associates, the House's food service vendor, also utilizes Twitter to announce daily specials and events under the user name \"@ushrcafes.\" Twitter's 140 character limit allows for quick transmission of information globally, enabling instant communication without physical limitations. Users can follow others to read their Tweets on the Twitter homepage. Following another Twitter account allows for instant access to Tweets, useful for finding specific information or understanding the activities of the person or group being followed. Facebook, launched in 2004, is the world's largest social networking service, providing personalized profiles and pages for users to post pictures, videos, and messages. Users can post pictures, videos, and messages on Facebook, where other users can comment. Profiles can be limited to approved friends. Users can become fans of pages by clicking \"like,\" and the page's activity appears on their newsfeed. Newsfeeds are personalized with friends' activities and fan page content. Profiles have timelines capturing posts, and friends can also post on timelines with user permission. This report analyzes Member use of Twitter and Facebook, including usage proportions, frequency, and content. Data was collected from Representatives and Senators' social media accounts from August to October 2011, with additional data collected in January 2012. Custom scripts were used to gather account-specific information. The data for Twitter and Facebook usage by Members was collected in January 2012, with a total of 47,004 cases analyzed - 30,765 Tweets and 16,239 Facebook posts. Researchers created coding categories and tested for reliability. Tweets or posts could be coded into multiple categories. The analysis covers two months of Member activity on Twitter and Facebook. Results cannot predict future behavior due to various caveats, including the structural similarity of Member posts and the dynamic nature of technology adoption. As of January 24, 2012, 78.7% of Members of Congress had official Twitter accounts. Members of Congress had official Twitter and Facebook accounts, with 78.7% on Twitter and 87.2% on Facebook. Adoption of social media increased over two years, with 38% on Twitter in 2009 compared to 78.7% in 2012. Party affiliation influenced adoption, with a higher percentage of Republicans on Twitter in both 2009 and 2012. In 2012, 56% of Twitter-registered Members were Republican and 44% were Democrats. House Republicans had the highest adoption rate for Twitter and Facebook in the 112th Congress. Senate Republicans also had higher adoption rates than Senate Democrats. Members sent a total of 30,765 Tweets and posted 16,239 times on Facebook during the study period. During the study period, Members posted 16,239 times on Facebook, averaging over 504 Member Tweets and 266 Member Facebook posts per day. Senators had higher daily averages than House counterparts. House Republicans led in Tweets (48%) and Facebook posts (54%), followed by House Democrats. Senate Republicans posted more frequently than Senate Democrats, with Independent Senators contributing as well. The total percentage of social media posts by chamber and party offers insight into congressional social media usage. The disparity in social media usage between Senate and House Members is evident, with a higher number of Senators compared to House Members. To normalize the analysis, the average number of posts per day by chamber and party affiliation is shown in Table 1. The top 20% of Members on Twitter and Facebook account for over half of all posts, while the bottom 20% contribute minimally. This distribution is illustrated in Figure 3, highlighting the disproportionate social media messaging by a select group of Members. In Congress, social media messaging is disproportionately used by a small group of Members, showing variation in how they incorporate social media into their public communications strategy. Member Tweets and Facebook posts were categorized into seven major message categories, including position taking, district or state, official congressional action, policy statement, media, personal, and other. Each post was coded into relevant categories to analyze content. The categories for categorizing Member Tweets and Facebook posts included \"Official Congressional Action,\" \"Position Taking,\" \"Media,\" and \"District or State.\" Posts could not be categorized as both position-taking and a policy statement. Members expressed their positions on policy or political issues through social media. In September, the Obama Administration rolled out 338 final rules of red tape at a cost of $10 billion, raising questions about promises to cut red tape. Don't Ask, Don't Tell officially ended in December 2010, with a Representative sharing the story of a gay soldier. Representatives and Senators use social media to discuss trips, events, and town hall meetings in their districts or states. A Town Hall in #Fairfield at 6 PM focused on creating #JobsNow. Representatives and Senators use social media to discuss official congressional actions, public policy, and references to President Obama's spending cuts and the American Jobs Act. Obama proposes to pay for the American Jobs Act. Representative or Senator tweets about upcoming media appearances or links to external websites. Mention of a news report on possible USEC layoffs. Labor Day op-ed on job creation efforts. Personal life updates or opinions unrelated to Congress work. #Rangers playoff game update. Meeting with alma mater president. Miscellaneous entries not fitting other categories. The most common Member Tweets and Facebook posts were \"position-taking\" posts, accounting for 41% of Tweets and 39% of Facebook posts. District or state Tweets and posts followed, making up 26% of Tweets and 32% of Facebook posts. Official action and policy statements were also common categories. Members of Congress are increasingly using Twitter and Facebook to directly communicate with constituents and others. Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook offer Members of Congress a new way to interact with constituents and gather real-time information for decision-making. This allows for reaching beyond their geographic constituency to connect with like-minded groups and potentially influence policy decisions. Social media allows for \"surrogate representation\" by Members of Congress from non-geographic constituent groups, potentially altering their representational strategies. Members are mindful of their official social media communication's impact on reelection efforts and are adapting by dedicating more staff to handle social media as part of their messaging and communications strategy. This shift in resource allocation is crucial in the current budget climate. The use of social media by Members of Congress is changing their representational strategies, leading to a shift in resource allocation towards social media. Concerns have been raised about adapting existing laws and regulations to electronic communications, such as the franking privilege. The differences between electronic communications and traditional mail raise questions about the applicability of the franking model to social media. The rapid evolution of electronic communications, such as social media, poses challenges for policymakers in applying existing regulations like the franking model. Policymakers may need to adopt more general structures for social media regulation to accommodate future technological advancements."
