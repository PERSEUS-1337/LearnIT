    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the strong link between mental wellness and academic success, emphasizing the importance of early detection and treatment of mental illness in improving school outcomes. Approximately 20 percent of children are affected by mental health issues, with 80 percent going undiagnosed and untreated, leading to negative impacts on academic achievement. Students facing stressors like violence, trauma, and poverty are disproportionately affected by mental health challenges. California educators lack preparedness in addressing pupil mental health challenges, hindering instruction. The State Department of Education identifies inadequate service referral and inconsistent mental health policies as barriers to students accessing support. Several initiatives are in place to improve early identification and referral of students for mental health support, including projects funded by the California Mental Health Services Authority and the State Department of Education. However, there is currently no standardized referral protocol to guide schools and local agencies in addressing student mental health concerns. The State Department of Education, through Project Cal-Well and its Student Mental Health Policy Workgroup, aims to provide leadership and guidance to address pupil mental health concerns. The Legislature intends to develop evidence-based referral protocols for schools, districts, and education programs to voluntarily use. The State Department of Education, in collaboration with various stakeholders, is developing model referral protocols for addressing pupil mental health concerns. The State Department of Education is developing model referral protocols for addressing pupil mental health concerns. These protocols are designed for voluntary use by schools, districts, and teacher preparation programs, and include timely referrals, support processes, culturally appropriate approaches, and involvement of parents. They aim to be adaptable, evidence-based, and easy to use by school staff. The State Department of Education is developing model referral protocols for addressing pupil mental health concerns. The protocols aim to be clear and easy to use, differentiate referral processes for various populations, and ensure school employees stay within their scope of practice. The department will make these protocols available on its website for educational institutions to access. The State Department of Education is developing model referral protocols for pupil mental health concerns. The protocols will be available within two years of receiving funds for implementation."
