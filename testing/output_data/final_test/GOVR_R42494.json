    "content": "The Education for Homeless Children and Youth Program (EHCY) ensures equal access to education for homeless children and youth. It is the only federal program focused on this group, providing funding through ESEA Title I-A set-asides. Reauthorization may be considered by the 113th Congress. This report outlines the program's purposes, funding history, issues with ESEA Title I-A set-asides, and data on LEAs receiving EHCY grants. The report discusses ESEA Title I-A set-asides for homeless students, data on LEAs receiving EHCY grants, characteristics of homeless students, and proposed changes to EHCY in the 112th Congress. It also includes information on the number and percentage of homeless students by state and legislation impacting EHCY in the 110th-111th Congresses. EHCY grants ensure homeless children have equal access to education. In SY 2010-2011, 3,651 LEAs out of 16,290 received EHCY grants. States must submit plans for identifying homeless children, ensuring their participation in food programs, and addressing issues like transportation and immunization. EHCY grants are allocated to SEAs based on Title I-A grants, with minimum funding levels set. ED reserves funds for outlying areas and the Department of Education. The law authorizes funding for homeless children and youth services, with states able to reserve up to 25% of funds for state activities. \"Minimally funded\" states can reserve up to 50%. Remaining funds are subgranted to LEAs based on need and application quality. LEAs can use the funds for transportation costs and other activities. The funds can be used for transportation costs, tutoring, evaluations for homeless students, professional development for school personnel, referral services for health needs, early childhood education, retention services, mentoring programs, record-related costs, parent education, coordination between schools and service agencies, violence prevention counseling, and domestic violence activities. The McKinney-Vento Act allows funds to be used for various services such as violence prevention counseling, addressing domestic violence, adapting school space, providing school supplies, and emergency assistance for homeless students. Each state must have an EHCY coordinator and each LEA must appoint a local EHCY liaison. The state coordinator is responsible for implementing the state's plan for homeless children's education, while the local liaison may also coordinate other federal programs. Homeless students are enrolled in public schools, including preschools, with progress monitored by the state. Reports are submitted to the Secretary of Education as needed. Technical assistance is provided to LEAs, and coordination is facilitated between the SEA and various entities serving homeless children and their families. Local EHCY liaisons enroll homeless students, ensure equal opportunities for success, provide necessary services, and make referrals for healthcare and other services. The Education for Homeless Children and Youth (EHCY) program provides referrals to health care, dental, mental health services, and other appropriate services for homeless students. It also informs parents about educational opportunities, ensures transportation rights, disseminates public notices, and mediates enrollment disputes. Funding for EHCY increased from $35.0 million in FY2001 to $50.0 million in FY2002, but was lower than the authorized amount of $70,000,000 for FY2002. Funding continued to increase from FY2003-FY2005 before decreasing. Funding for the Education for Homeless Children and Youth (EHCY) program increased from $35.0 million in FY2001 to $50.0 million in FY2002, then continued to increase in FY2003-FY2005. However, it decreased to $61.9 million in FY2006 and FY2007. Regular appropriations have remained at approximately $65 million since FY2009. In addition to regular appropriations, the EHCY program received $70 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5) funds in FY2009. ARRA funds were distributed to states and LEAs for the same local activities as the regular EHCY program. In FY2009, ARRA funding for the Education for Homeless Children and Youth program was distributed to states based on their share of enrolled homeless students. States could award subgrants competitively or by formula. Funding reserved for state activities had to come from regular EHCY program allocations, not ARRA funds. The NAEHCY report in 2010 analyzed the use of ARRA funds by LEAs for homeless students, based on a survey of 2,200 LEAs. The funds were used for academic support, transportation, outreach, and collaboration with community organizations. Many districts received funding for the first time to support homeless students, allowing them to implement procedures and programs for their identification and enrollment in school. The NAEHCY report in 2010 analyzed the use of ARRA funds by LEAs for homeless students, with a 76% increase in LEAs receiving EHCY grants. Homeless children and youth are automatically eligible for ESEA Title I-A services, and LEAs must reserve funds to provide services for homeless students not attending Title I-A funded schools. Under this part, Title I-A funding can be used to provide educationally related support services to homeless children who do not attend participating schools. The funding can also be used to provide tailored services for homeless students attending Title I-A schools, including items like clothing to meet school dress requirements. Title I-A funding can be used to provide educationally related support services to homeless children, including clothing to meet school dress requirements. However, Title I-A funds cannot be used for transportation to the school of origin for homeless students. Formerly homeless students may be transported to or from their school of origin using Title I, Part A funds in certain circumstances. Data on the amount of Title I-A funding set aside for homeless students is not nationally available. Some states require LEAs to report this information, but the Department of Education does not mandate it. In SY2009-2010, 22% of LEAs received EHCY subgrants, accounting for 71% of all enrolled homeless students. The reported number of enrolled homeless students was 939,903, but this data only includes those in school, not the total homeless population. In SY2009-2010, 939,903 homeless students were enrolled, increasing to 1,056,794 in SY2010-2011. The total number of enrolled homeless students declined by 2% between SY2008-SY2009 and SY2009-2010, but increased by 13% between SY2009-2010 and SY2010-2011. California's data collection procedures impacted the decline in enrollment. Between SY2006-2007 and SY2008-2009, the number of homeless students rose from 679,724 to 956,914, with economic downturn being a major factor. In SY2010-2011, there was greater awareness of homelessness and the foreclosure crisis, improved outreach, and identification efforts, and an increase in factors affecting mental or physical health. California, New York, Texas, and Florida accounted for 42% of total homeless student enrollment. Forty-four states reported an increase in homeless student enrollment, while nine states reported a decrease. States are required to report on homeless children enrolled in public preschool programs. In SY2010-2011, 33,433 preschoolers were enrolled in public preschool programs, with 30,955 in SY2009-2010 and 36,308 in SY2010-2011. Reporting on homeless preschoolers is challenging. States must report on the primary nighttime residence of homeless students, including shelters, doubled-up situations, unsheltered conditions, and hotels/motels. In SY2010-2011, doubled-up situations accounted for 72% of homeless students. During SY2010-2011, doubled-up situations were the primary nighttime residence for 72% of homeless students, followed by shelters (18%), hotels/motels (5%), and unsheltered conditions (5%). LEAs receiving EHCY grants must provide additional data on homeless students, including information on subpopulations served and academic achievement. This data includes English language learners, children with disabilities, unaccompanied youth, and migratory children and youth. During the three-year period between SY2008-2009 and SY2010-2011, the percentage increase in homeless students served varied for different subgroups. LEAs with EHCY subgrants report on the number of homeless students tested annually for proficiency in reading and mathematics. However, there is a lack of comparable data on academic performance of homeless students across states. As of SY2010-2011, academic performance data was required to be reported for homeless children enrolled. In SY2010-2011, academic performance data was required for homeless children in all LEAs, not just those with EHCY grants. Data from earlier years are not comparable. 71% of students in grades 3-8 and 15% of high school students took reading and math tests. 52% of grades 3-8 and 49% of high school students met state reading standards, while 51% of grades 3-8 and 44% of high school students met math standards. Legislation changes to EHCY are discussed for possible reauthorization by the 113th Congress. The 113th Congress proposed changes to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) in 2011. The Senate HELP Committee bill and the House Education and Workforce Committee bills aimed to reauthorize the Education for Homeless Children and Youth (EHCY) program. The House Education and Workforce Committee bill (H.R. 3989) and The Homeless Children and Youth Act of 2011 (H.R. 32) addressed EHCY issues such as funding, transportation, ESEA Title I-A set asides, school selection process, services for preschool students and unaccompanied youth, and access to education. The EHCY program faces concerns about insufficient funding to meet the educational needs of homeless children and youth. Despite an 11% increase in homeless student enrollment from SY2008-2009 to SY2010-2011, EHCY appropriations have remained stagnant. Funding increases for federal programs like EHCY may be unlikely due to limited federal resources. The Senate HELP Committee bill proposed authorizing necessary funds for fiscal year 2012 and the following 6 years, while the House Education and Workforce Committee bill (H.R. 3990) also addressed EHCY issues. The House Education and Workforce Committee bill (H.R. 3990) proposed funding for fiscal year 2013 and subsequent years, with increases tied to inflation. Transportation is a significant barrier for homeless student enrollment, with limited funds available. Data from a survey in Washington state illustrates the potential costs of transporting homeless students. The majority of homeless student trips in Washington state cost school districts from just under $3 to over $40 per one-way trip, compared to an average of $.67 for the general student population. Transportation by school bus accounted for 38% of rides, with costs ranging from $4.24 to $53.79 per trip. Disputes among LEAs over cost allocation can delay enrollment of homeless students in their school of origin. The ESEA reauthorization aims to address issues related to transportation for homeless students to their school of origin. The Senate HELP Committee bill and the House Education and Workforce Committee bill included new language allowing the use of ESEA Title I-A funds for this purpose. LEAs are responsible for determining the amount of funds set aside for transportation costs. The amount of ESEA Title I-A funds set aside for homeless students varies across LEAs, leading to inadequate set-asides. A survey by NAEHCY found that 67% of liaisons indicated their district set aside funds, 23% did not, and 11% were unsure. The Senate HELP Committee bill proposed new provisions under ESEA Title I-A to address this issue. The Senate HELP Committee bill proposed new provisions under ESEA Title I-A to address the issue of inadequate set-asides for homeless students. It included requirements for needs assessments based on the number of homeless children and youth identified in the previous year, collaboration with other agencies, and expanded allowable uses of funds, such as funding for local liaisons and transportation to the school of origin. The House Education and Workforce Committee bill (H.R. 3989) also included similar provisions for ESEA Title I-A set-asides for homeless students. The ESEA reauthorization prohibits segregating homeless students from non-homeless students, except for emergencies or temporary services. Some argue against segregation, stating homeless students perform better academically in the same schools. The Senate HELP Committee bill and the House Education and Workforce Committee bill (H.R. 3990) aim to continue prohibiting the segregation of homeless students from non-homeless students, with limited exceptions for certain schools. The House bill also includes increased reporting requirements for the Secretary's report on separate schools. Both the Senate HELP Committee bill and the House Education and Workforce Committee bill (H.R. 3990) would require the LEA to presume that keeping a homeless student in the school of origin is in the student's best interest, unless the parent or guardian disagrees. Factors related to the impact of mobility on achievement, education, health, and safety of homeless children and youth must be considered in making this determination. If the LEA decides it's best for the student to attend a different school, they must provide the decision in writing and include information on appeal rights in a parent-friendly format. The House Education and Workforce Committee bill (H.R. 3990) and the Senate HELP Committee bill proposed changes to the definition of \"school of origin\" for homeless students. The Senate bill allowed parents to appeal to the SEA if dispute procedures were exhausted, requiring the LEA to enroll the student and provide transportation to the school of origin during the dispute resolution. Additionally, the bill expanded the issues subject to dispute. The EHCY program mandates that each LEA appoint a homeless liaison, with concerns raised about insufficient time for duties. Proposed bills require training for liaisons and school personnel, emphasizing the need for knowledge and time to fulfill responsibilities. The House Education and Workforce Committee bill (H.R. 3990) requires the Office of Coordinator for EHCY to effectively carry out its duties. It also mandates state coordinators to annually report data on homeless children and youth. Identifying homeless preschoolers is challenging due to their age and lack of compulsory attendance laws. While they have equal access to public preschool programs under EHCY, placement is limited by the availability of programs. The Senate HELP Committee bill aims to address the barriers homeless preschoolers face in accessing education. It includes provisions to prioritize enrollment of homeless preschoolers in state-funded preschools and coordinate their educational needs with local liaisons. However, immediate enrollment is not mandatory. The term 'unaccompanied youth' refers to those not in the physical custody of a parent or guardian, covered by protections for homeless youth. Outreach to these youth is challenging as they often do not stay in shelters and fear being identified. They may have run away from difficult situations and struggle to find basic needs. Many worry about attending school due to safety concerns involving child welfare or law enforcement. Providing safe and welcoming school programs is crucial for these youth. Advocates suggest that creating safe and welcoming school programs can benefit unaccompanied youth by offering flexibility in their schedules and diverse learning opportunities like vocational education. Promising approaches include providing mentors, coordinating with other agencies to meet basic needs, and implementing policies for credit recovery. Proposed bills aim to ensure these youth are enrolled and have equal academic opportunities as other students. Both the Senate HELP Committee bill and the House Education and Workforce Committee bill aimed to protect unaccompanied youth by ensuring they are informed about their rights to apply for financial aid independently. They also included provisions for homeless students to participate in educational programs without delay, receive credits for previous coursework, and not be hindered by overdue fines or fees. The Homeless Children and Youth Act of 2011 aimed to amend HUD's definition of homelessness to include children and families verified as homeless through federal programs, making them eligible for services. The Homeless Children and Youth Act of 2011 aimed to amend HUD's definition of homelessness to include children and families verified as homeless through federal programs, making them eligible for services. An amendment introduced by Senator Franken would have provided services for foster children and youth by changing the definition of homeless in the EHCY. This change would have made newly identified individuals and their families eligible for HUD housing assistance services without detailed criteria or funding cap restrictions. Services would have been based on local providers' needs assessments. The amendment proposed changes to the Education for Homeless Children and Youth (EHCY) definition of homeless, aiming to improve access to education and related services for foster children and youth. Both the HELP Committee bill and H.R. 3990 sought to increase cooperation across agencies and establish privacy requirements to protect homeless children's information. Both the Senate HELP Committee bill and the House Education and Workforce Committee bill (H.R. 3990) proposed extending the time for states to submit required information for an EHCY grant to 120 days. The Senate bill also aimed to reduce the state set-aside to 20% of the state allocation or $85,000, expand the time for issuing school enrollment guidelines, require the Secretary's report on homeless children and youth to be published every two years, and allow funds to be reserved for emergency assistance if appropriations exceeded $70 million. The House Education and Workforce Committee bill (H.R. 3990) proposed removing the clause requiring an LEA to maintain fiscal effort at a specified percentage in its application. Several bills in the 110th-111th Congresses aimed to increase programs and services for homeless students, including the Homeless Emergency and Rapid Transition to Housing Act. The HEARTH Act (P.L. 111-22) amended and reauthorized HUD homeless programs under the McKinney-Vento Act, expanding the definition of homeless. The definition used by ED for the EHCY program remains broader. Eligibility under the HEARTH Act is allowed in limited circumstances for children and youth meeting EHCY criteria or other federal programs. HUD defines a \"long-term period\" as at least 60 days for those experiencing homelessness. In the final regulation, HUD defines a \"long-term period\" as at least 60 days for those experiencing instability, evidenced by frequent moves. Factors contributing to unstable housing include chronic disabilities, substance addiction, histories of abuse, and barriers to employment. The HEARTH Act includes new requirements for Continuum of Care applicants to receive funds. The new requirements for Continuum of Care (CoC) applicants to receive funds include collaborating with LEAs to identify homeless families, considering educational needs when determining shelter placements, obtaining certification for housing/services, and ensuring children are enrolled in school. The reauthorization of the HEAD Start Act strengthened these requirements. The Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007 strengthened requirements for homeless preschoolers, ensuring automatic eligibility for Head Start and Early Head Start. The Higher Education Opportunity Act prioritized services for homeless students in TRIO and GEAR-UP programs, allowing for tailored programs for at-risk groups, including homeless youth. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act included provisions for supporting at-risk students, including homeless youth. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act (P.L. 110-84) allows verified homeless and unaccompanied youth to be considered independent for financial aid, removing the need for parental information. This helps students facing obstacles to attend college due to costs. Verification of independent status can be done by specific authorities."
