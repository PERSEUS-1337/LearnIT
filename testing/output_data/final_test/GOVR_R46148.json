    "content": "Relations between Iran and the United States have been confrontational since 1979, following Iran's Islamic Revolution. The U.S. views Iran's policies as a threat to its interests, especially its support for armed groups and nuclear program. The Trump Administration withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran and imposed \"maximum pressure\" by designating IRGC-QF as a terrorist organization, ending sanctions exceptions for Iranian oil, and deploying more military assets to the region. Tensions between Iran and the United States escalated in 2019, with Iran attacking commercial ships, downing a U.S. drone, and reducing compliance with the JCPOA. In December 2019, a rocket attack in Iraq killed a U.S. contractor, leading to retaliatory airstrikes on Iran-backed Iraqi armed group Kata'ib Hezbollah. On December 31, 2019, supporters of Kata'ib Hezbollah and other Iran-backed Iraqi militias attacked the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. No U.S. personnel were harmed, but Secretary of Defense Mark Esper deployed an additional infantry battalion in response to the increased threat levels. President Trump blamed Iran for the attack and threatened consequences. On January 2, 2020, the U.S. military killed IRGC-QF Commander Major General Qasem Soleimani in a defensive action, citing his responsibility for the deaths of Americans and coalition forces. The statement cited Soleimani's responsibility for the deaths of Americans and coalition forces, his approval of the embassy blockade in Baghdad, and his plans to attack American diplomats and servicemembers in Iraq and the region. Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike at Baghdad International Airport, along with other Iranian and Iraqi figures. He was a powerful and influential figure in Iran, second only to Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i, and head of the IRGC-QF responsible for Iran's external military operations. The death of Soleimani, a key figure in Iran's external military operations, is expected to have a significant impact on Iran's capabilities. Some view him as crucial to Iran's regional hegemonic efforts, while others believe he was just executing government policy. U.S. officials claim Soleimani posed a direct threat and was planning an imminent attack, though some Members of Congress dispute this. President Trump and Secretary Esper have conflicting views on the evidence presented regarding Soleimani's involvement in planning attacks on embassies. Some Members of Congress have challenged the rationale for the strike, questioning the Administration's claim of deterring future Iranian aggression. The killing of Soleimani is seen as a more significant response compared to previous actions taken to deter Iran, which have been deemed ineffective. The killing of Soleimani is seen as an attempt to alter Iran's decision-making calculus following the December 27 rocket strike. Iran's leaders have vowed revenge, with large crowds attending funeral processions for Soleimani in Iran. His death is expected to strengthen hardliners in advance of legislative elections in February 2020. Iran launched ballistic missiles targeting Iraqi military bases with U.S. forces, causing no casualties. President Trump downplayed the attack, while Iranian officials gave mixed messages about the strike. Iran launched ballistic missiles targeting Iraqi military bases with U.S. forces, causing no casualties. Javad Zarif tweeted that Iran \"took & concluded proportionate measures,\" while Supreme Leader Khamene'i tweeted that \"such military actions are not enough.\" Debate remains about whether Iran intended to inflict casualties in the attack. Chairman of the Joints Chief of Staff Army General Mark Milley and Secretary Pompeo have said that Iran did have that intention. Possible Iranian retaliatory measures could include mobilizing militias it supports to attack U.S. forces deployed in Iraq, Syria, and/or Afghanistan. The confrontation with Iran could lead to unconventional attacks in Europe or South America, cyber attacks, or other responses. There is a risk of Iran breaching the JCPOA and causing further escalation. Secretary Pompeo warned of potential Iranian retaliation against American forces, but also mentioned reduced risk after Soleimani's death. Iranian options may be limited due to domestic unrest following the downing of a civilian airliner. International Airlines passenger flight crashed in Tehran, killing all 176 on board. Iranian government initially blamed mechanical failure but later admitted the plane was shot down by a Russian-made missile due to \"human error.\" This led to protests in Tehran and condemnation from various countries. President Trump warned Iranian leaders about the world watching. In May 2018, President Trump signed a memorandum ceasing U.S. participation in the JCPOA and imposing unilateral economic sanctions on Iran. In January 2020, new sanctions were announced to restrict international trade with Iran in various sectors. Senior Iranian regime officials and 17 Iranian metals producers, mining companies, and partners in China and the Seychelles were sanctioned for their involvement in Iran's metal trade. The sanctions can also target individuals and entities in third countries that support Iran's construction, mining, manufacturing, and textile sectors. Foreign financial institutions could face restrictions. Iranian officials and entities involved in Iran's metal trade were sanctioned. Foreign financial institutions could also face restrictions, including being denied the means to operate in the United States. Iran has exceeded limits on its nuclear activities, leading to increased sanctions. Iran announced the final step in reducing its commitments under the JCPOA. Iran has stated it will continue to cooperate with the IAEA and abide by the JCPOA's monitoring provisions. If sanctions are lifted, Iran is willing to resume its commitments under the agreement. Iranian President Rouhani mentioned a chance for negotiations in the next two months. Iran's support for armed factions in the region is carried out by the IRGC-QF. Iran's IRGC-QF, formerly led by Soleimani, supports regional allies with weaponry including anti-tank systems, rockets, and missiles. Estimates of Iran's material support vary widely, with the State Department claiming over $16 billion spent since 2012 on supporting allies in Syria, Iraq, and other regions. Iran supports its allies in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen, with Hezbollah being described as Iran's primary terrorist proxy group. Iran provides Hezbollah with significant funding, training, and weapons, including thousands of rockets and missiles. Israeli officials are concerned about Iran assisting Hezbollah in developing indigenous rocket technology. Iran has been providing technical assistance, training, and financial support to the Syrian government and pro-regime Shia militias since the violence in Syria began in 2011. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has sanctioned Iranian entities for their involvement in assisting the Syrian government in its crackdown on protestors. Iran has also facilitated the travel of Shia militia fighters from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan to Syria, providing them with armored vehicles, artillery, and drones. Additionally, Iran has given Syria billions of dollars in credit for purchasing oil, food, and other goods. In mid-2019, the United States imposed sanctions on Iranian ships involved in oil shipments to Syria. Iran supports armed groups in Iraq, including designated terrorist organizations. The 115th and 116th Congresses have considered imposing sanctions on Iran-aligned Iraqi groups. On January 3, 2020, the State Department designated Asa'ib Ahl al Haq as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. On January 3, 2020, the State Department designated the AAH as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and two of the group's leaders, Qa'is Khazzali and his brother Laith, as Specially Designated Global Terrorists under E.O.13224, as amended by E.O. 13886. Iraqi militia forces have vowed revenge against the United States and some have called for a measured approach, disavowing attacks on non-military targets. Iranian leaders have vowed a strong response to the killing of Soleimani and Muhandis, denying responsibility for recent attacks on the U.S. Embassy. Iran has intervened militarily in Iraq in the past, including airstrikes against ISIS and missile attacks on Kurdish groups. They have also provided support to Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Shia Houthi rebels are fighting Saudi Arabia and its coalition in support of the Yemeni government. Iran is accused of providing ballistic missiles to the Houthis. The Houthis are seen as a potential proxy for Iran to project power in the Arabian Peninsula. The U.S. believes Iran is prolonging Yemen's civil war to exert influence. In December 2019, the U.S. offered up to $15 million in support. In December 2019, the U.S. government offered up to $15 million for information on Yemen-based IRGC-QF leader Abdul Reza Shahla'i. A strike or raid targeting Shahla'i in Yemen on January 3, 2020, was reportedly unsuccessful. U.S. officials confirmed the operation on January 10, raising questions about the justification for Soleimani's killing. Iran is accused of supporting various regional groups, including Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Al Ashtar Brigades, and the Afghan Taliban. Iraqi officials protested U.S. airstrikes on KH personnel as a violation of sovereignty. Iran-linked militias and PMF units attacked the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, causing damage and setting buildings on fire. Iraqi officials restored order, but tensions remained high with threats to expel the U.S. from Iraq by force. The airstrike that killed Soleimani also took out KH founder Abu Mahdi al Muhandis, reshaping relationships among Iran-aligned Iraqi militias. The U.S. airstrike on Iran-aligned Iraqi militias led to calls for foreign military forces to leave Iraq, with Prime Minister Adel Abd al Mahdi condemning the strike as a violation of Iraqi sovereignty. The Council of Representatives voted to withdraw Iraq's request for international military support and remove all foreign forces from the country. Iraq's Prime Minister condemned U.S. airstrikes as a breach of sovereignty and requested foreign military forces to leave. The Council of Representatives voted to withdraw Iraq's request for international military support and investigate the airstrikes. Prime Minister Abd al Mahdi reiterated Iraq's desire to avoid war and maintain cooperative relations with the U.S. Secretary Esper stated that there has been no decision made to leave Iraq. Prime Minister Abd al Mahdi asked Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to send delegates to Iraq to discuss the parliament's resolution on foreign troop withdrawal. The State Department clarified that any delegation would focus on strengthening the strategic partnership, not troop withdrawal. Secretary Pompeo disputed the characterization of their conversation and emphasized the training mission in Iraq to support security forces and counter ISIS. The resignation of Prime Minister Abd al Mahdi in December 2019 has initiated a political transition in Iraq, leading to discussions on appointing a caretaker government, electoral reforms, and upcoming elections in 2020. This transition period reopens contentious issues for debate and negotiation as Iraqi leaders navigate through domestic and international developments. Negotiations in Iraq are influenced by domestic and international developments, including the fate of foreign military support and U.S.-Iran-Iraq relations. Leaders in Kurdistan endorse foreign military support but may hesitate to challenge Baghdad's authority. Prime Minister Abd al Mahdi met with Kurdish leader Barzani, sparking speculation about his re-nomination. In 2014, Iraq requested international assistance to combat the Islamic State. The invitational letters from Iraq have been the diplomatic basis for the presence of U.S. and international military forces in Iraq since 2014. Bilateral agreements set terms for foreign forces deployment, with U.S. troops contributing to Operation Inherent Resolve governed by diplomatic notes agreed to in 2014. Former envoy Brett McGurk mentioned a one-year cancelation clause in the U.S.-Iraq diplomatic notes. Iraqi Prime Minister holds executive authority to amend or revoke requests for military assistance. The Iraqi Prime Minister has the authority to amend or revoke requests for international assistance without needing approval from legislators. Discussions have taken place between Prime Minister Abd al Mahdi and Secretary of State Pompeo regarding the future of U.S. presence in Iraq. President Trump has threatened sanctions if U.S. troops are forced to withdraw on unfriendly terms, potentially leading Iraq to strengthen ties with Iran, Russia, or China. Iraqi leaders may move closer to Iran, Russia, or China as they seek relief from U.S. sanctions on Iran. The Trump Administration has granted temporary permissions for transactions with Iran, but the exemption is set to expire in February 2020. Administration officials are preparing to implement sanctions if necessary. Sanctions under IEEPA target U.S.-based assets and transactions with designated individuals, sending a significant signal to the international community. The President has broad authority to curtail without declaring a national emergency. The President has broad authority to curtail foreign assistance, defense sales, and entry of Iraqi nationals into the U.S. Since Soleimani's death, some international training forces have withdrawn from Iraq, and U.S. operations have been temporarily paused for force protection. U.S. operations in Iraq were temporarily paused for force protection measures. The Islamic State group in Iraq was reported to be solidifying and expanding its command structure but had not increased capabilities in areas where the Coalition was present. IS fighters were regrouping in remote areas with little security presence, unable to conduct large-scale attacks. Iraqi Security Forces and other groups continued clearance and counterterrorism missions across Iraq with or without U.S. and coalition support. Iraqi Security Forces, supported by U.S. and coalition forces, lack personnel for remote terrain patrols. The Counterterrorism Service has improved its operations, but many ISF units still rely on coalition assistance for intelligence and target identification. CJTF-OIR reports that ISF commands are hesitant to clear ISIS insurgents without Coalition air cover. The ISF relies heavily on Coalition forces for air cover, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance in clearing ISIS insurgents from difficult terrain. Despite ongoing training, ISF commanders continue to request Coalition assets instead of using their own systems, indicating a persistent reliance on external support. This reliance could leave room for IS and other armed groups to exploit weaknesses in ISF capabilities, potentially leading to a reemergence of threats in Iraq and neighboring countries. The U.S. and coalition training efforts in Iraq have shifted to a train-the-trainer and Iraqi ownership approach under the Reliable Partnership initiative. Following the Soleimani killing, training efforts were temporarily suspended, leading some countries to announce plans to withdraw forces. This could accelerate the transition to greater Iraqi ownership of training efforts and prompt an international reassessment of Iraq's needs. Following the pause in counter-IS operations in Iraq after Soleimani's death, concerns have been raised about the potential for the Islamic State to reconstitute itself in the region due to the absence of ongoing U.S. counterterrorism pressure. U.S. forces in Syria have faced conflicts with Iran-backed militia forces, with strikes conducted against these groups in both Syria and Iraq. Hezbollah in Iraq and eastern Syria, in response to an attack by the group on U.S. forces in Kirkuk. U.S. personnel in Syria may be vulnerable to additional attacks by Iran-backed forces. President Trump submitted a notification to Congress regarding the Soleimani drone strike, but the contents were classified by the Trump Administration, drawing criticism from Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized the decision to classify the notification regarding the Soleimani drone strike as \"highly unusual.\" National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien asserted that the 2002 AUMF provided the President authority to direct the strike against General Soleimani in Iraq. The 2002 AUMF was enacted prior to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, authorizing the President to use the military to enforce UN Security Council resolutions and defend national security against Iraq. The Obama Administration also used the 2002 AUMF for military action against ISIS after 2014. The 2002 AUMF authorized military action in Iraq and Syria, with the Trump Administration arguing it allows for force to establish stability and address terrorist threats. The State Department also stated in 2019 that the 2002 AUMF permits military action against Iran to protect U.S. and partner forces engaged in counterterrorism operations. The 2002 AUMF authorizes military action in Iraq and Syria to establish stability and address terrorist threats. The Trump Administration argues it allows force to protect U.S. and partner forces. Reaction to the Soleimani drone strike is divided, with some praising it as a blow to Iran's operations and others criticizing it for risking armed conflict and instability in the Middle East. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has decried the decision. Some Members, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, criticized the President's failure to consult Congress before the strike on Iran. Senators Tim Kaine and Richard Durbin introduced a resolution to remove US forces from hostilities against Iran, stating that the President lacks specific authority for military action. The War Powers Resolution (P.L. 93-148; 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1543(a)(1)) directs the President to remove U.S. armed forces from hostilities with Iran within 30 days of enactment. Representative Ilhan Omar introduced H.J.Res. 82, identical to S.J.Res. 63, which requires the removal of U.S. forces engaged in hostilities without specific congressional authorization. Senator Kaine introduced an amended version of his original proposal, S.J.Res. 68, on January 9, 2020. The new version directs the President to \"terminate the use of U.S. armed forces for hostilities\" with Iran instead of \"remove\" them. This change aims to avoid potential changes in current deployments, including possible withdrawal of U.S. armed forces in Iraq. The amended proposal also removes references to Trump Administration statements and policies regarding Iran. Additionally, Representative Ro Khanna introduced H.R. 5543 on January 7 to prohibit funding for U.S. military force against Iran. Representative Khanna introduced H.R. 5543 with 47 cosponsors on January 7, stating that no existing law can authorize military force against Iran without specific authorization. Senator Sanders introduced a similar bill, S. 3159, while Senator Jeff Merkley introduced S.J.Res. 64 on January 8, specifying limitations on the use of military force against Iran. The post-September 11, 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force may be seen as a basis for military action against Iran. Representative Elissa Slotkin introduced a resolution to end the use of US Armed Forces in hostilities with Iran, emphasizing the need for congressional approval and transparency in decisions regarding military force. The resolution introduced by Senator Tom Udall and debated in the House aims to restrict the President's ability to engage in hostilities with Iran without specific congressional authorization, citing concerns about escalating conflict and the need for constitutional oversight. The House voted to adopt H.Con.Res. 83 by a 224-194 roll call vote, which will now move to the Senate for consideration by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The resolution aims to restrict the President's ability to engage in hostilities with Iran without specific congressional authorization. The Senate will vote on H.Con.Res. 83 within three days of referral, which aims to limit the President's military actions in Iran without congressional approval. This resolution follows a process outlined in the War Powers Resolution to terminate unauthorized military force use. The Supreme Court has ruled legislative vetoes as unconstitutional in the past. The Supreme Court has ruled legislative vetoes as unconstitutional in the past, stating that all \"legislative acts\" must adhere to Article I, \u00a77 requirements. The constitutionality of Section 5(c) resolutions regarding congressional reversal of executive branch actions remains unsettled. Congress has not delegated military force decision-making authority to the President, but can formally disapprove unauthorized use of force. The War Powers Resolution asserts that only Congress, not the President, has the authority to introduce U.S. armed forces into hostilities, except in cases of defense against an armed attack. The constitutionality of congressional reversal of executive branch actions through Section 5(c) resolutions is still uncertain. The War Powers Resolution asserts that only Congress, not the President, has the authority to introduce U.S. armed forces into hostilities. A joint resolution like S.J.Res. 63 was introduced to direct the President to cease action against Iran under Section 1013 of the Department of State Authorization Act. This separate process allows Congress to expedite consideration of a joint resolution that would require the President's approval. The War Powers Resolution emphasizes Congress's authority to introduce U.S. armed forces into hostilities. A joint resolution like S.J.Res. 63 could expedite consideration, requiring the President's approval. This provision avoids the legislative veto issue but may face a presidential veto, necessitating two-thirds majorities in both Houses. Congress aimed to prevent such situations when enacting the War Powers Resolution to maintain its role in deciding military conflicts. Secretary Pompeo noted increased safety for U.S. personnel in the Middle East after Soleimani's removal. Following the removal of Soleimani from the battlefield, Secretary Pompeo emphasized the ongoing risks in the Middle East and stated that the United States is preparing for them. Measures include strengthening diplomatic facilities and deploying additional forces, such as the Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force, to reinforce the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. This Task Force is capable of providing compound defense through various operations. The State Department is deploying additional forces, including the Marine Security Guard detachment, to reinforce security at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. General Milley expressed confidence in the embassy's security, warning potential threats that they will \"run into a buzzsaw.\" Analysts emphasize the need to mitigate risks to U.S. personnel worldwide due to Iran's past attacks. The Principal Officer, Regional Security Officer, and Emergency Action Committee, supported by Bureau of Diplomatic Security personnel, evaluate threats and implement security policies at overseas posts. Analysts suggest special consideration for threats like kidnapping or attacks on \"soft targets.\" The State Department may close or change the status of posts based on evolving threat assessments. In September 2018, the U.S. Consulate General in Basrah, Iraq, was placed on ordered departure due to the Iranian threat. The killing of Soleimani has implications for Israel, as they are already engaged in low-level conflict with Iran, including cross-border exchanges of fire and Israeli air strikes on Iran-linked targets in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq. Israel has raised concerns about Iranian transfers of precision-guided rockets to groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon. The killing of Soleimani has raised concerns for Israel's national security due to Iran's presence in Syria and support for groups like Hezbollah. Israel Defense Forces are on high alert, with missile defense systems in place. The United States Embassy issued a travel advisory for rocket fire threats, but Israeli officials doubt Iran would target them. Prime Minister Netanyahu praised President Trump for the action, emphasizing the right to self-defense for both countries. Israel and the United States both assert their right to self-defense. Concerns exist about potential retaliation from Iran against Jewish targets globally, citing past attacks in Argentina and Bulgaria linked to Hezbollah and Iran. Differences over Iran have strained U.S.-European relations, with the EU opposing the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA but sharing concerns about Iran's ballistic missile program and support for terrorism. French, German, and UK leaders released a joint statement condemning recent events. Minister Boris Johnson and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg condemned recent attacks on coalition forces in Iraq and expressed grave concerns about Iran's destabilizing behavior. They called for de-escalation, urged Iran to refrain from further violence, and emphasized the importance of combatting the Islamic State. They also called on Iran to reverse measures inconsistent with the JCPOA. European countries, including Germany, have expressed concern about Iran's destabilizing behavior and called for de-escalation. They are significant contributors to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and the NATO training mission in Iraq, both of which suspended operations after the Soleimani strike. European nations have also criticized Iran for alleged plots to assassinate dissidents in Europe, with the U.S. State Department reporting an increase in Iranian-sponsored terrorist attacks in Europe. In response to Dutch allegations linking Iran to assassinations of Dutch nationals, the EU imposed sanctions on Iran's Intelligence ministry. The EU imposed sanctions on Iran's Intelligence ministry and two operatives for sponsoring terrorism. The US deployed additional military forces in the region as a defensive measure. On December 31, 2019, the US deployed an infantry battalion to Kuwait, with additional forces to follow. A task force of US Special Operations Forces and the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit were also deployed to the Middle East. Additionally, six B-52 bombers were sent to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean for potential operations in Iran. The key national security priority for the United States is effectively competing with China and Russia, as outlined in key Trump Administration documents. This may require a shift in resources away from countering violent extremist groups in the CENTCOM area of responsibility towards Europe and Asia. General Kenneth McKenzie noted that the 2018 National Defense Strategy will reduce U.S. force posture in the Central Region. The National Defense Strategy (NDS) will reduce U.S. force posture in the Central Region and realign resources to higher priority goals. This shift presents a challenge to USCENTCOM's deterrence capabilities, requiring new concepts and stronger relationships with partners. Reduced U.S. presence may allow competitors to increase influence. Iran remains a central challenge despite strategic reprioritization. General McKenzie emphasized Iran as the most significant threat in the U.S. CENTCOM AOR, requiring innovative techniques for deterrence. Some question the feasibility of reprioritizing threats away from the region, while others argue that despite Iran's challenges, China and Russia pose greater strategic priorities. Dynamic Force Employment is suggested for rapid shifts in military assets. The deployment of U.S. military assets to the CENTCOM AOR could impact the availability of forces for other theaters and contingencies. U.S. expeditionary operations rely on a network of American bases in allied and partner countries. The deployment of U.S. troops in allied and partner countries raises sovereignty concerns for host nations. Recent events like the Soleimani strike and Iranian counter-strikes could complicate negotiations on U.S. forward bases globally. The U.S. has a history of engaging in irregular conflicts with Iran. Iran engages in hybrid and irregular warfare, collaborating with proxies to achieve its objectives and project power outside its borders. The extensive network of nonstate partners is a cornerstone of Iranian national security strategy, leading the United States to view Iran as a threat to national security and a destabilizing force in the region. Iran utilizes nonstate partners to project power and influence outside its borders, engaging in hybrid and irregular warfare to undermine the interests of the United States and its allies. Concerns arise over the lack of preparation by U.S. forces for this type of warfare, which may become a prominent feature in strategic dynamics globally. The lack of preparation by U.S. forces for hybrid and irregular warfare is a concern, as it may become a prominent feature in strategic dynamics globally. Some worry that the State Department is not adequately organized and resourced to effectively counter such tactics from adversaries."
