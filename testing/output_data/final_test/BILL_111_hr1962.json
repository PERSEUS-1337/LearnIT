Congress acknowledges the United States' leadership in human spaceflight for nearly 50 years, fostering collaborations with other countries, including former adversaries, through peaceful space missions. The International Space Station (ISS) represents a significant achievement in these partnerships, with NASA leading the effort to involve foreign partners in its construction and operation. The US has been the primary investor in the ISS, contributing billions of dollars to its development. The United States has invested billions of dollars in developing and transporting components for the International Space Station. National Security Presidential Directive 49 emphasizes the importance of space capabilities to US national interests and outlines the country's commitment to preserving its rights and freedom of action in space. The International Space Station is nearing completion, with remaining construction missions scheduled to be concluded in 2010. The crew size will increase to 6 for full utilization of laboratories and research facilities in a microgravity environment. Routine access to the Station is crucial for capitalizing on our investment. NASA was directed in January 2004 to honor international commitments, retire the Space Shuttle by 2010, and develop the Constellation System for travel beyond low Earth orbit. The Constellation System, including the Orion crew exploration vehicle and Ares launch vehicle, was approved by Congress in 2005. Other nations are also investing in space capabilities, posing a threat to US influence. The United States faces a 5-year gap in accessing the International Space Station, leading to heavy reliance on Russia for crew and cargo transport services unless Space Shuttle operations are extended beyond 2010. This dependence on foreign providers threatens US influence in space affairs. The United States should not rely on Russia for transporting American astronauts into space due to divergent views and actions by Russia, including opposition to US missile defense plans and arms sales to US adversaries. In 2006, Russia sold billions of dollars worth of weapons to Venezuela, potentially violating the Monroe Doctrine and Cold War norms. Russia has a history of supplying advanced arms technology to anti-American regimes like Iran. Additionally, Russia's delays in fulfilling commitments to the International Space Station have forced NASA to transfer funds to complete critical modules. Russia's past failures in fulfilling commitments to the International Space Station, including diverting resources to keep the Mir Space Station operational, should caution the United States against increased reliance on Russian space services in the future. The United States should not rely on Russia for space access due to past issues. Billions have been invested in the International Space Station for valuable research that could lead to medical advancements and better understanding of Earth's climate. Scientists believe the microgravity environment in space can aid in developing new drugs and therapies. The Space Station will monitor stratospheric gases and investigate ozone chemistry. NASA's plan for crew transport to the International Space Station lacks necessary redundancies, relying solely on Russian Soyuz spacecraft after 2010 until the Orion spacecraft is operational in 2015. NASA's lack of a backup plan for space access is concerning. The United States needs a better approach for transporting American astronauts to space, as relying on Russian vehicles lacks a backup plan. The Space Shuttle is a proven domestic source of space transport that can provide assured access to the International Space Station for crew and cargo transport. By flying 2 Shuttle missions per year during the human spaceflight program flight gap, we can eliminate the need to rely on Russian crew rotation services for the ISS, leading to cost savings. NASA may save money by extending Space Shuttle operations and avoiding retention bonuses for critical space workers. However, additional costs could arise from recruitment incentives for new workers and contract cost increases, as many workers at the Kennedy Space Center are contractors. NASA acknowledges the workforce gap at the Kennedy Space Center, where many critical space workers may lose their jobs during the transition to the Constellation program. To retain skilled workers, NASA could continue operating the Space Shuttle at a reduced flight requirement and integrate workers into the Orion program. NASA faces challenges in recruiting and retaining senior-level engineers for the next generation of human space flight systems. NASA is extending space shuttle operations. NASA will conduct at least 2 Space Shuttle missions annually for crew transport instead of using Russian services until 2015, Orion is operational, or a US commercial capability is certified. Additional funding may be appropriated for this purpose. NASA will report to Congress within 90 days on the costs and actions needed to extend the Space Shuttle program. By March 31, 2011, NASA will explore operational efficiencies, including possibly retiring one orbiter and reducing design changes to ensure safe operations. NASA will report to Congress on the costs and actions needed to extend the Space Shuttle program, including changes to software systems, reducing orbiter and payload configuration operations, and maximizing shared personnel with other NASA programs. Conflicts in resource allocation between the Space Shuttle and Constellation programs will be identified in advance with recommendations for mitigation. NASA will report to Congress on the funding needed to expedite the schedule of the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle and the Ares I Crew Vehicle, including additional funding required. Authorization of appropriations is also included to achieve the goals outlined in the report."
