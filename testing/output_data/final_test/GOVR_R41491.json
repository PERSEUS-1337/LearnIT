This led to the suspension of evictions and post-foreclosure closings in 23 states for review. Employees from major servicers like GMAC Mortgage, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Wells Fargo have been deposed in foreclosure contests. Following GMAC Mortgage's announcement of potential issues with foreclosure procedures, major mortgage servicers like J.P. Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo have been deposed in foreclosure contests. Concerns were raised regarding the knowledge of individuals involved in foreclosures, proper execution of assignments and sales of mortgages, notarization of legal documents, and meeting requisites for foreclosure. Three other major mortgage servicers temporarily halted foreclosure sales in 23 states, known as \"judicial foreclosure states.\" Bank of America Home Loans announced a temporary foreclosure sale freeze in all 50 states, including nonjudicial foreclosure states. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac directed mortgage servicers to review procedures for handling defaults, but did not require a halt in foreclosure sales or evictions. Bank of America announced a temporary foreclosure sale freeze in all 50 states, including nonjudicial foreclosure states. GMAC Mortgage and Ally Financial are resuming foreclosures after reviewing and remediating files. Regulatory responses and investigations by state Attorneys General are ongoing. The Attorneys General of all 50 states and the Obama Administration's Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force are investigating potential violations of federal laws related to foreclosure proceedings. Some states have raised evidentiary standards in response to deficiencies in the process. Servicers claim that any issues are procedural, not substantive, and do not believe anyone has been wrongfully foreclosed upon. Procedural defects in paperwork could undermine the legitimacy of the foreclosure process. The foreclosure process is under scrutiny for potential procedural issues that could impact the legitimacy of foreclosures and raise questions about true ownership of mortgages. Rectifying these problems may cause delays in completing foreclosures, even for properties where foreclosure is inevitable. There is uncertainty surrounding the events leading up to the housing market crash. The housing market crash has led to legal disputes and uncertainties in the mortgage market process. Delays in foreclosures are expected due to procedural issues and complexities in the secondary mortgage market. The housing market crash has caused legal disputes and uncertainties in the mortgage market process, with delays in foreclosures expected due to procedural issues in the secondary mortgage market. The report focuses on potential errors hidden by procedural problems and their legal impact on homeowners, lenders, and other market participants. These issues could also lead to violations of securities laws for financial institutions involved in mortgage-backed securities. The housing market crash has led to legal disputes and uncertainties in the mortgage market, with potential errors in mortgage-backed securities causing financial institutions billions in legal claims. The federal government's involvement in the mortgage market, through programs like TARP and Making Home Affordable, adds complexity and conflicting interests. The federal government's involvement in the mortgage market, through programs like TARP and Making Home Affordable, has led to legal disputes and uncertainties. The government has used funds from the Housing and Economic Recovery Act to purchase mortgage-backed securities from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with the Federal Housing Finance Agency acting as conservator. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation also holds interests in mortgage assets as conservator and receiver over failed banks and thrifts, impacting the government directly in mortgage-related legal disputes. The mortgage market involves making payments to lenders for a period of time, with lenders having a security interest in the property. This security interest is recorded in a deed of trust or mortgage. Each state has laws governing how security interests in real property should be recorded. Land recordation systems date back to colonial times and require companies to physically record security interests in real property with the register of deeds office in the county where the property is located. Failure to properly record an interest does not invalidate the homeowner's obligations under the mortgage. Originating lenders may retain their interest in the mortgage for the life of the loan, but in recent years, this practice has become less common. In recent years, it has become common for originating lenders to sell or assign their interest in mortgages to other financial institutions for securitization purposes. Ownership of mortgages can change hands multiple times, with many being sold to government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) or special purpose vehicles (SPVs) like Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits (REMICs) for favorable tax treatment. These SPVs become the holders of both the note and security interest in the mortgage. During the housing boom, originating lenders sold millions of mortgages to other banks, GSEs, and special purpose vehicles for securitization. Mortgages are typically originated, assigned, securitized, and recorded with various interests exchanged at each step. Mortgage servicers interact with homeowners on behalf of mortgage holders, whether the mortgages are securitized or not. During the housing boom, the sale of mortgages to other banks, GSEs, and securitizers created challenges in complying with local land recordation laws. To address this, the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) was created to electronically track mortgage assignments, allowing for easier recording of ownership changes. MERS is named as \"mortgagee of record in nominee capacity\" to simplify the process, even though it does not hold a beneficial interest in the deed. MERS, as nominee, tracks ownership changes electronically instead of at the local deeds office. Its documentation and processes are crucial in determining mortgage ownership for the foreclosure process. The use of MERS raises legal questions about its standing to initiate foreclosures and the sufficiency of recording MERS as mortgagee. Trustees and servicers act as agents for mortgage holders, with potential conflicts of interest in securitized mortgages. Affiliates of major servicers may have interests in underlying mortgages. The four largest servicers (Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup) own second liens on primary-lien mortgages held in trusts they service. Trustees and servicers have specific roles outlined in a pooling and servicing agreement (PSA). Trustees handle clerical duties for investors, while servicers interact with homeowners and earn revenue from a percentage of the mortgage principal. Servicers manage borrower payments and address delinquencies or defaults. Loss mitigation and foreclosure proceedings are carried out by servicers for delinquent borrowers on securitized and non-securitized mortgages. PSAs dictate the rules for servicers in engaging in loss mitigation efforts. Foreclosure processes are more streamlined and cost-effective for servicers compared to loss mitigation efforts, which are tailored to individual borrower characteristics. State laws govern the foreclosure process for mortgage holders. The foreclosure process for residential properties is governed by state law, with procedures varying across states. Some states use a judicial foreclosure process, while others allow for nonjudicial foreclosure under certain circumstances. Homeowners can involve courts in a nonjudicial foreclosure, but there are procedural hurdles. Judicial foreclosure is allowed in most states, but nonjudicial processes are more common. To foreclose on a residential property through a judicial process, the foreclosing party must file a court action and prove the validity of the mortgage and the borrower's default. Evidence such as the original promissory note and deed of trust can be submitted, or affidavits can be used in some states as proof of the valid mortgage. In foreclosure cases, mortgage holders can provide sworn affidavits stating possession of original documents or copies, signed in the presence of a notary. These affidavits are crucial evidence for courts to determine borrower default and outstanding obligations. In foreclosure cases, mortgage holders provide sworn affidavits as evidence. If the criteria are met and the borrower has no valid defenses, the court confirms foreclosure and sets a sale date. The property is auctioned, with a minimum bid set by the mortgage holder. If no bids exceed the minimum, the property reverts to the mortgage holder. Homeowners can contest foreclosure by raising defenses. In contested foreclosures, homeowners can challenge the foreclosure by raising defenses, such as questioning the mortgage holder's legal standing due to improper execution of mortgage interest assignments. Legal standing is crucial in foreclosure actions, especially with the frequent sale and assignment of mortgage interests in the secondary market, leading to potential errors in execution. State laws vary on who can bring a foreclosure action, but legal standing is a common challenge in contested foreclosures. In foreclosure actions, legal standing is crucial as the mortgage holder has the right to foreclose on the property. Challenges often arise over the plaintiff's actual mortgage holder status, especially when documentation of sale or assignment is missing or deficient. If a homeowner can show deficiencies in the chain of title, the court may dismiss the action or give the plaintiff time to prove standing. In foreclosure cases, a plaintiff's standing is essential. If a case is dismissed, the plaintiff may have to restart the legal process, causing delays. Homeowners can challenge the foreclosure by proving the plaintiff failed to meet state laws' notice and procedural requirements. This includes providing notice of default, the method of service, timing of service, and information in the notice. The foreclosure process varies by state, with details such as the right to cure, outstanding balance, and defenses like disputing late fees. While these defenses may not stop foreclosure entirely, they could lead to a reduced balance, delayed sale, or potential options for the homeowner. This could also impact any deficiency judgment pursued by the mortgage holder. Nonjudicial foreclosures, allowed under state law, are pursued by mortgage holders through a \"power of sale\" clause in the deed of trust. Homeowners must actively contest nonjudicial foreclosures in court, often requiring a court injunction to temporarily halt the process. Bond posting may be necessary for an injunction to be granted. Courts may waive the bond requirement for an injunction, but individuals must show evidence of irreparable harm and likelihood of winning the case. Mortgage servicers must meet foreclosure criteria and follow state laws, with power of sale foreclosures being faster and less costly than judicial foreclosures. Power of sale foreclosures are faster and less costly than judicial foreclosures. In judicial foreclosure states, sworn affidavits are required as evidentiary support, signed by a mortgage servicer employee attesting to personal knowledge of the foreclosure facts. Notary publics certify affidavits but do not verify underlying facts. Notary publics certify affidavits by verifying the identity of the signer and the time of signing, rather than the accuracy of the facts. Courts rely on these sworn affidavits as they lack the capacity to investigate each statement. Recent depositions have raised doubts about the authenticity of some affidavits submitted in foreclosure cases. During depositions, it was revealed that thousands of foreclosure files went through GMAC Mortgage and Chase Home Finance departments monthly. Employees signed affidavits, sometimes relying on outside attorneys for accuracy verification. Notarization of affidavits was done without witnessing signatures, raising doubts about authenticity. Cottrell relied on outside attorneys to draft affidavits and her staff to fill in numbers. She reviewed files herself if staff raised concerns, otherwise spending less time on accuracy. Notaries were present when she signed affidavits, raising questions about authenticity. The deposition raised concerns about whether affidavits were properly notarized and met evidentiary standards for court filing. Procedural issues in mortgage servicers may lead to similar deficiencies. State laws requiring personal knowledge in affidavits and proper notarization serve fraud prevention purposes. Mortgage servicers should adhere to these standards. Mortgage servicers must follow legal procedures when foreclosing on a borrower's home to prevent fraud. Improper affidavits could lead to perjury charges and sanctions. Notary publics and attorneys could face penalties for not following state laws. However, these issues do not necessarily mean the facts in the affidavit are untrue or that the foreclosure is invalid. In judicial foreclosure proceedings, new affidavits can be submitted if improperly signed or notarized. Serious charges may arise if affidavits were purposefully forged or contained lies to cover up defects in the foreclosure process, potentially leading to civil or criminal fraud charges under state and federal law. Elements of criminal fraud include a material misstatement with the intent to defraud. For an employee of a mortgage servicer to be guilty of criminal fraud, the misstatements must be material and made with the intent to defraud. The extent of substantive problems in foreclosure cases, such as multiple entities claiming to be mortgage holders, is unclear. Anecdotal evidence suggests substantive problems in foreclosure cases, including properties foreclosed upon where homeowners own the title free and clear, entities claiming valid title to foreclosed properties, and issues with documentation and internal protocols. These problems could affect both judicial and nonjudicial foreclosure states due to paperwork issues in mortgage assignments and sales departments. The use of the judicial system in foreclosure states may make it easier for documentation issues to come to light. Substantive problems in uncontested foreclosures could raise uncertainty about the legal chain of title, potentially impacting the market for foreclosed properties. If a foreclosing entity cannot establish clear title, the foreclosure process may be significantly delayed. Demonstrating proper title may require redoing paperwork for each assignment or sale. Title issues may arise in the chain of title due to gaps, business closures, or disputes over ownership. This can affect the ability to sell properties and lead to concerns about valid mortgages and security interests. Title insurance can help alleviate these fears for buyers. Some title insurers are concerned about potential problems with securing title insurance on properties, leading to delays in completing the foreclosure process. Inadequate mortgage documentation and internal controls make financial institutions vulnerable to fraud. Delays will incur administrative costs and possible legal penalties for mortgage holders and servicers. Some borrowers may benefit from delays in the foreclosure process, allowing them to stay in their homes longer. However, most individuals are likely to lose their homes eventually due to documentation and procedural deficiencies. These issues also create uncertainty over property titles, discouraging investment in foreclosed properties. Loan servicers could face significant costs if the documentation problem prolongs the foreclosure process. The uncertainty surrounding mortgage market participants' deficient documentation and internal protocols in loan processes may worsen historically high foreclosure rates, straining the judicial system and financial institutions. Moody's review of major servicers' bond ratings highlights potential risks, but the FDIC's loan modification programs suggest a positive outlook if housing markets recover. The economic and legal repercussions of deficiencies in mortgage origination, assignment, securitization, and foreclosure processes are expected to have long-lasting effects."
