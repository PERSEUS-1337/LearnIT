    "content": "The United States Congress and administrations have long supported the European Union for democracy and economic partnership. The EU, with 28 members, began in the 1950s to promote peace and prosperity in Europe. Despite the Cold War's end, the US sees the EU as vital for security and prosperity. Both face challenges like terrorism, weapons proliferation, and cyber-security. The United States and the European Union face various challenges such as countering terrorism, weapons proliferation, cyber-security, and economic downturns. Proponents argue that close ties are necessary as both sides have collaborated on security issues in the Balkans and Afghanistan, law enforcement cooperation post-9/11, and managing Iran's nuclear ambitions. Past cooperation has also improved the world trading system. The US and EU share a significant trade and investment relationship. The US and EU share a significant trade and investment relationship, accounting for over 50% of global GDP. Despite challenges like the Eurozone crisis, they generate over $5 trillion in sales annually and employ 15 million workers. However, conflicts have arisen over foreign policy and trade issues, such as the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In the aftermath of the Iraq crisis, the United States aimed to improve relations with the EU, leading to a reduction in tensions over key issues like Iran and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Despite lingering differences in areas such as data privacy and trade disputes, observers note a renewed sense of cooperation in U.S.-EU relations, particularly in trade and economic policy. This cooperation is exemplified by the creation of a joint High Level Working Group in 2011 to enhance trade and investment and reduce regulatory barriers. The High Level Working Group (HLWG) released a report in 2013 recommending the U.S. and EU pursue a comprehensive trade agreement. President Obama announced negotiations for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) in his State of the Union speech. Congress generally supports the initiative, but challenges are expected in regulatory and intellectual property rights negotiations. The U.S. and EU have a history of cooperation on political and economic issues. Members of Congress and the European Parliament aim to strengthen ties and collaborate further. The EP, directly elected, is a key EU institution. Relations between the U.S. House of Representatives and the EP date back to 1972. Congress initially saw the European Community as an economic entity for trade agreements. The European Parliament (EP) was initially seen as an institution with limited visibility and authority by the U.S. Congress. The first congressional visits to Brussels focused on trade-related issues such as agriculture subsidies and steel tariffs. These visits led to the formation of the United States-European Community Interparliamentary Group, which facilitated regular meetings between Members of the House and Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). Over time, the focus of these meetings shifted towards foreign policy issues related to the Cold War and European integration. In the mid-1980s, the responsibility for arranging U.S.-EP meetings shifted to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Former Representatives Lee Hamilton, Tom Lantos, and Benjamin Gilman played key roles in increasing the relevance of the Congress-EP exchange, focusing on the implications of the end of the Cold War and the evolving EU. Formal institutional cooperation was established in 1999. Formal institutional cooperation between the U.S. Congress and the European Parliament was established in 1999 through the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD). Key milestones in their evolving relationship include the creation of the Transatlantic Policy Network (TPN) in 1992, the New Transatlantic Agenda (NTA) in 1995, the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) in 2007, and the opening of the European Parliament's Liaison Office (EPLO) in 2010. The TPN, formed in 1992, aimed to foster regular dialogue and maintain close relationships between EU and U.S. politicians, corporate leaders, think tank experts, and academics. The Transatlantic Policy Network (TPN) was founded in 1992 to facilitate dialogue and strengthen the partnership between the United States and the EU. It provided a platform for Members of Congress and MEPs to discuss specific issues, coordinate actions, and find transatlantic solutions. TPN continues to support this dialogue today through programs like \"Transatlantic Week\" in Washington, led by Members of Congress and MEPs such as James Ellis and Peter Skinner. The launch of the NTA in 1995 aimed to transition the US-EU relationship from consultation to joint action. Despite the emphasis on enhanced parliamentary links, implementation of the NTA was slow. Implementation of the New Transatlantic Agenda (NTA) was slow, including the decision to involve parliamentary leaders. After four years of little progress, the U.S. House and the European Parliament formalized the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue in 1999 to enhance parliamentary ties between the EU and the U.S. In November 1999, the U.S. House officially changed the name of the Congress-EP interparliamentary group to the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) to enhance legislative involvement in U.S.-EU relations. Since then, efforts have been made to reinforce the role of legislatures in the transatlantic relationship. Since 1999, resolutions have been passed in Congress and the Parliament to enhance the transatlantic partnership, calling for closer dialogue between legislatures and policymakers. Efforts were made to support the development of a transatlantic market by 2015, with legislators aiming for a more substantive role in U.S.-EU relations. Since 1999, resolutions in Congress and Parliament aimed to strengthen transatlantic partnership through closer dialogue between legislators. Efforts were made to develop a transatlantic market by 2015, with a focus on enhancing U.S.-EU relations. The establishment of a new subcommittee and caucus in the House provided platforms for focused discussions on transatlantic issues among interested legislators, aiming to promote contact and cooperation. Since 1999, organizations like TPN, the German Marshall Fund, the Atlantic Council, and others have played a more active role in promoting transatlantic cooperation. They hold briefings, host conferences, and publish reports to enhance the U.S.-EU partnership and increase knowledge among Members of Congress and the European Parliament. Despite efforts to strengthen ties between Congress and the European Parliament, the exchange between the U.S. House and the EP remains little known or understood, disappointing some Members and officials. Previous interactions, such as Speaker Jim Wright attending a meeting in Madrid in 1987, have not been widely recognized. In 2007, German Chancellor Angela Merkel proposed enhancing transatlantic trade cooperation by reducing barriers between the U.S. and EU, building on previous initiatives to strengthen relations between the U.S. House and the European Parliament. The April 2007 U.S.-EU Summit adopted a Framework for Advancing Transatlantic Economic Integration, establishing the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) to reduce regulatory barriers and promote trade and investment between the United States and Europe. The TEC includes ministerial-level appointees and legislators in its advisory group to facilitate regulatory cooperation. The TEC established an advisory group drawing upon existing transatlantic dialogues like TABD, TACD, and TLD. Lack of knowledge about TLD led to surprise when it was invited to join. White House did not inform House leadership or TLD chairs about their new role. The TLD was given a new responsibility to represent Congress and the European Parliament in transatlantic economic integration. Supporters believed success required strong commitment from both entities. Advocates wanted more engagement from Congress and the Parliament in the integration process. Giving TLD a role in the TEC would allow legislators to provide oversight and express concerns before negotiations progressed too far. Advocates believed that Congress and the European Parliament could play a crucial role in regulatory cooperation and convergence. The Lisbon Treaty would grant the EP more decision-making authority over trade-related issues. Groups like the Transatlantic Business Dialogue and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reached out to Congress and the European Parliament to involve them in the TEC process. Advocates from various business groups reached out to Congress and Parliament to enhance economic and regulatory specificity in the transatlantic debate. Reports from think tanks outlined the parameters for regulatory cooperation, emphasizing the influential role of legislatures. The business community urged Congress to engage in the transatlantic economic dialogue, leading to support for the U.S.-EU High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth. The Group on Jobs and Growth is working to recommend ways to stimulate the transatlantic economy. Efforts to increase awareness about economic and regulatory issues have impacted how Congress views the U.S.-EU legislative relationship. This has led to a desire for expanded dialogue between the European Parliament and Congress. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership is also being considered. The European Parliament opened a liaison office in Washington in 2010 to promote closer relations with Congress. This initiative stemmed from a proposal in 1984 by then-EP President Klaus Haensch to establish direct collaboration between MEPs and Congress members. The goal is to achieve \"co-equality\" with the U.S. Congress. In 2006, MEP Elmar Brok proposed establishing a permanent post in Washington for the European Parliament to maintain contact with the U.S. Congress. In 2009, the EP adopted a resolution emphasizing the need for closer cooperation between the U.S. Congress and the EP on legislative initiatives. The European Parliament adopted a resolution in 2009 to establish a parliamentary office in Washington for closer cooperation with the U.S. Congress. In 2010, the EPLO was officially opened with Piotr Nowina-Konopka as its first Director, succeeding by Antoine Ripoll in 2012. The EPLO in Washington, led by Mr. Antoine Ripoll, aims to build a network of staff for cooperation on legislative and political issues. It has expanded to over ten staff, including experts in foreign policy and trade from the EP's Directorate-General. The EPLO in Washington, led by Mr. Antoine Ripoll, aims to build a network of staff for cooperation on legislative and political issues, including international development, trade, and domestic policy. The EPLO provides a steady stream of contact and information on the work of the Parliament to Congress, with regular briefings on key issues in the U.S.-EU relationship. Future briefings will cover topics such as data privacy and cybersecurity. The EP resolution also suggested the U.S. Congress consider setting up its own liaison office in Brussels. The U.S. Congress has shown support for closer cooperation with the European Parliament, including the idea of establishing a congressional liaison office in Brussels. However, Congress as a whole has not shown significant interest in this proposal. The European Parliament's interest in working with the U.S. Congress as a co-equal legislative partner has been driven by the Lisbon Treaty, which increased the EP's power within the EU. The treaty expanded the EP's role in the legislative process, budgetary decisions, and international agreements. The Lisbon Treaty increased the European Parliament's decision-making authority over international agreements by majority vote. In 2010, the EP rejected a U.S.-EU terrorist finance tracking agreement but eventually approved a new accord with strengthened data privacy protections for EU citizens. The European Parliament approved a new U.S.-EU Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreement in April 2012, addressing concerns about data privacy. In response to U.S. surveillance revelations in 2013, the EP established a special working group to investigate implications for EU citizens' privacy rights. The NSA programs and spying allegations could impact EP approval of future U.S.-EU information-sharing accords. The U.S.-EU SWIFT accord is up for renewal in 2015, and the PNR agreement in 2019. EP approval is needed for the U.S.-EU data privacy and protection agreement (DPPA) under negotiation since 2011. U.S. policymakers recognize the EP's growing importance in U.S.-EU relations and suggest stronger ties with Congress. U.S. Vice President Biden addressed the EP in 2010. In 2010, U.S. Vice President Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton acknowledged the EP's influence. U.S. Ambassador Kennard emphasized the need to strengthen the relationship between Congress and the EP. The President of the Parliament met with U.S. leaders in 2012 to bolster relations between the legislative bodies. Past instances of legislation affecting U.S.-EU tensions have been noted. EP has impacted U.S.-EU tensions, with conflicts arising over various legislative measures such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, REACH regulations, hedge fund regulation, and the EU's carbon tax on airlines. The EU's emissions trading system (ETS) has caused tensions between the U.S. and EU. Experts suggest more consultation between the U.S. Congress and the European Parliament to avoid conflicts. An \"early warning\" system is proposed to alert both bodies of potential legislative issues. Areas for cooperation include financial services, regulatory issues, and energy security. Greater consultation and coordination are needed in areas such as energy security, cyber-security, and intellectual property rights (IPR). The European Parliament rejected the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) in July 2012, which aimed to enhance IPR protection and address online trademark and copyright infringement. Concerns were raised about ACTA being too vague and potentially infringing on civil liberties like Internet free speech. The United States negotiated ACTA as an executive agreement, bypassing congressional approval. The rejection by the European Parliament prevents the EU and its member states from ratifying the agreement in its current form. The European Parliament rejected the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) in July 2012 due to concerns about civil liberties. Discussions between the EP and Congress are suggested to avoid conflicts on IPR issues. The Parliament approved negotiations on a new U.S.-EU trade agreement, indicating its intention to be actively involved in the trade debate. The EP will need to approve any U.S.-EU trade accord for it to take effect. During meetings in late 2012 and early 2013, Congress and the European Parliament discussed the potential trade agreement TTIP. The TTIP was a key issue at the TLD meeting in Dublin in 2013, with plans for further discussions at upcoming meetings. Suggestions have been made to enhance cooperation between the two institutions. Some suggest a new institutionalized structure for managing Congress' relationship with the EP, while others believe enhancing the existing TLD is sufficient. U.S. skeptics question the need for a stronger Congress-EP relationship, citing differences in legislative processes. The differences in legislative processes between the U.S. Congress and the European Parliament are a key issue in considering their ability to work together on common interests involving legislation. In the U.S. Congress, any Member can introduce legislation, which is then referred to committees based on jurisdiction. In the European Union, legislation is proposed by the European Commission and then submitted to the Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The European Commission is the originator of EU legislation, coordinating the legislative process between the two legislatures could be difficult. The Commission may take up to six months to decide on submitting legislation in response to the European Parliament's request, and developing the actual legislative proposal could take up to one year or longer. Coordination is required to have legislation run parallel in both legislatures. The legislative process in the EU involves coordination between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. Legislation must have its legal basis in EU treaties or secondary legislation, and must cite the treaty article it is based on. The Parliament's rules of procedure determine the legislative procedure to be followed. Coordination for simultaneous consideration of legislation in both legislatures requires strong political commitment. The European Parliament's legislative process involves the designation of a competent committee to consider proposed legislation, with a rapporteur appointed to draft a report. The report is discussed and voted on by the committee, then considered in a plenary session of the entire Parliament for possible amendments before being put into effect. The European Parliament adopts its position on proposed EU legislation, which must also be approved by the Council of Ministers. Differences exist in legislative roles between the Parliament and Congress, as seen in the U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement renewal process. The SWIFT accord was negotiated as an executive agreement within existing U.S. law, bypassing the need for U.S. Congress consideration. The European Parliament had a legislative role in approving the U.S.-EU PNR accord, negotiated as a U.S. executive agreement. Congress did not have a role in this process. In May 2011, Congress introduced resolutions supporting the 2007 version of the PNR accord to strengthen the Administration's negotiating position with the EU. The differences between U.S. and EU policymaking processes raise questions about the value of stronger Congress-EP relations. Closer ties between Members of Congress and their EP counterparts could help inform each other and influence outcomes, especially in matters like SWIFT or PNR. The potential Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership could test the effectiveness of this relationship. The creation of the TEC and the appointment of the TLD to its Advisory Group raised the visibility of the TLD, but it remained relatively unknown in the U.S. Congress compared to the European Parliament. The European Parliament's liaison office has increased visibility on Capitol Hill for the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD), but it still lacks influence in promoting the Congress-Parliament partnership due to structural differences. The TLD's joint meeting with the House Ways and Means Committee on a U.S.-EU trade agreement had significant participation, but more visibility is needed within Congress for the TLD to become more influential. The European Parliament (EP) adopts a resolution proposing interparliamentary delegations at the start of each new Parliament. There are currently 41 delegations in the EP, with the largest being the Delegation for Relations with the United States (D-US) consisting of 61 MEPs. Delegation seats are allocated to political groups based on their size in the EP. The European People's Party (EPP) is the largest political group in the European Parliament (EP) with 19 seats in the Delegation for Relations with the United States (D-US). The Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD) group, the smallest in the EP, has three seats in the D-US. The EPP selected Elmar Brok as chair of the D-US in 2009, and Christian Ehler replaced him in 2012. The EP representation in the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) is led by a Steering Committee from the D-US delegation. The Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) is coordinated by 10 MEPs who chair various EP standing committees. The Steering Committee ensures broad MEP representation at TLD meetings and reports to the D-US. Over 20 MEPs attend the semi-annual TLD meetings. The USTLD, on the U.S. side, is one of 13 Parliamentary and Commission Groups in Congress, with representation only from the House. Unlike the NATOPA, the USTLD is not statutorily authorized but receives funds annually for its activities. The USTLD, unlike the TLD, has no specified number of participants and no mandated Speaker appointment. The USTLD's chair and vice chair were traditionally appointed by the chair and ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In the 113th Congress, Representative Mario Diaz-Balart was appointed as Chair by the Speaker, and Representative Jim Costa was appointed as Vice Chair by the Minority Leader and ranking Member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Other USTLD delegates are not formally nominated. The USTLD lacks formal nomination of delegates and has struggled with inconsistent participation. There is no Steering Committee to plan meetings or encourage member involvement. Suggestions have been made to involve the EU Caucus, but little association currently exists between the two groups. Concerns remain about the USTLD's ability to attract members without increased formality. The USTLD faces challenges in attracting and maintaining a broad group of Members due to a lack of formal structure and inconsistent participation. This hinders the development of personal relationships between legislators, essential for open exchanges of views and legislative coordination. MEPs have noted that TLD sessions do not always provide them with good U.S. contacts for regular discussions on mutual interests. The USTLD faces challenges in attracting and maintaining a broad group of Members due to a lack of formal structure and inconsistent participation. MEPs have noted that TLD sessions do not always provide them with good U.S. contacts for regular discussions on mutual interests. The U.S. Congress and the EP differ in staffing for the TLD, with the U.S. side having three principal staffers serving as the \"U.S. secretariat\" for the TLD. The staff of the USTLD are part of the House Foreign Affairs Committee structure and provide support for security and foreign policy-related discussions. The USTLD staff, part of the House Foreign Affairs Committee structure, support security and foreign policy discussions at TLD meetings. However, key economic and regulatory issues on the U.S.-EU agenda do not fall under the Committee's jurisdiction, leading to a disconnect in focus during TLD sessions. Experts note that topics like financial services, transport security, cyber-security, and trade, discussed at TLD meetings, are not within the Foreign Affairs Committee's purview. Many experts believe it is challenging for Foreign Affairs Committee staff to cover a wide range of issues from Russia to toy safety while also participating in U.S.-EU negotiations. Hiring additional staff with expertise in non-foreign policy matters may be necessary for the TLD to effectively address various issues. Regular communication between USTLD staff and other entities seems lacking despite these non-foreign policy matters dominating TLD meeting agendas. The EUTLD secretariat, staffed by five permanent EP staff, coordinates TLD operations and relations with Canada and the G-8. TLD Administrators from EP standing committees facilitate communication with the TLD secretariat and promote coordination of views. The D-US in the EP falls under the Directorate-General for External Policy. The Directorate-General for External Policy supports EP committees on Foreign Affairs, Development, and International Trade, as well as EP delegations. There have been calls for closer cooperation between Congress and the EP, including the suggestion of a transatlantic parliamentary assembly, but this proposal has not found support in the U.S. Congress. Several ideas have been proposed to strengthen the Congress-Parliament partnership, especially with discussions on a potential transatlantic economic and trade agreement. While the European Parliament has been proactive in pursuing a closer relationship, the U.S. Congress has not fully embraced the idea. However, there are potential options to deepen relations in the future. Several possible options for enhancing Congress-Parliament cooperation are discussed, with suggestions for a new structure on the U.S. side to oversee relations. Some argue for existing structures to be utilized more effectively, potentially elevating the status of the USTLD. The USTLD could be elevated by authorizing it through a House resolution, appointing delegates at the start of each Congress. The delegation size could be set at 15 members, with potential for 5 additional seats for interested Members. The USTLD delegation could be appointed for a full two-year term, with representation from various House committees. The Congressional Caucus on the EU may serve as the umbrella organization for Congress-EP relations, with USTLD delegates drawn from the Caucus. Substitutes from the Caucus could attend sessions in place of USTLD delegates. The Speaker or Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee could identify specific issues for the USTLD to focus on. The USTLD, in conjunction with the EUTLD, should establish political and economic committees or working groups to focus on specific issues. Former Representative Cliff Stearns suggested transport security, financial markets, and agriculture as key issues, with cyber-security later added. This step was seen as a move towards more productive TLD sessions. Establishing working groups in conjunction with the EUTLD was suggested to focus on specific issues like transport security, financial markets, and agriculture, with cyber-security later added. The working groups would allow Members and MEPs to focus on areas of interest or expertise, with chairs reporting on topics discussed during TLD meetings. Interactivity between members would be promoted through video conferences and meetings to facilitate year-round communication. The EP began implementing this structure in preparation for the June 2011 TLD meeting. The USTLD did not appoint members to working groups suggested by the EUTLD in December 2011 and June 2012. Some observers emphasized the importance of flexibility in addressing emerging issues between TLD sessions. The USTLD did not appoint members to working groups suggested by the EUTLD in 2011-2012, focusing on different areas than the TEC. The working group concept did not succeed in strengthening the TLD's role as an advisor to the TEC. It is uncertain if this model will be sustained due to difficulties in implementation. The joint TLD/House Ways and Means Committee meeting in November 2012 focused on the U.S.-EU High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth and a possible transatlantic trade agreement. Proponents suggest introducing more Members of Congress and MEPs to TLD work. Hiring dedicated USTLD staff in the House is also being considered. The USTLD staff could potentially join the Speaker's Office of Interparliamentary Affairs to coordinate TLD activities and develop relationships with committees. Supporters advocate for House authorization and a more active role for the Speaker in appointing U.S. delegates to enhance the TLD's standing, while skeptics question the political will needed for such changes. Since its launch in 1999, the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) has faced challenges due to the lack of a single committee with jurisdiction over all transatlantic issues. The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, which oversees the political relationship, has limited authority on economic and trade issues discussed in TLD meetings. Hiring additional staff for the TLD is unlikely given the current political and budgetary climate, and there are doubts about House leadership's receptiveness to such changes. Former MEP Jonathan Evans, chair of the EUTLD from 2004 to 2009, realized the TLD structure was not optimized for its new regulatory responsibilities. Some delegates were knowledgeable in foreign policy but lacked expertise in domestic policy and technical regulatory matters. This posed challenges in addressing issues like accounting standards, supply chain security, copyright protection, and medical device certification. The TLD structure faced challenges in addressing regulatory responsibilities such as accounting standards, supply chain security, copyright protection, and medical device certification. Delegates needed to catch up on specialized economic and regulatory issues, potentially hindering their focus on broader transatlantic policy matters. It was uncertain if House or EP committees would defer to the TLD for guidance on relevant issues within their jurisdictions. Evans suggested improving direct committee-to-committee contact and developing mechanisms for tapping into committee expertise. The TLD faced challenges in addressing regulatory responsibilities like accounting standards, supply chain security, copyright protection, and medical device certification. EP committees play a crucial role in EU legislation adoption, with the views of rapporteurs being key. The EP has 20 standing committees and one special committee. Committee jurisdictions in the EP and U.S. Congress are defined differently. Evans suggested improving committee-to-committee contact and tapping into committee expertise. The Senate Agriculture Committee handles child nutrition legislation, while the House Education and Workforce Committee is responsible for it in the House. Child nutrition programs in the EP are managed by the Environment Committee. Evans and others suggest establishing an information-sharing process between the TLD and standing committees, especially on the U.S. side. The European Parliament has addressed the TLD-committee relationship by requiring representation from most standing committees and appointing a \"TLD Administrator\" to act as a liaison between committees and the TLD. Some experts suggest closer links between the TLD and standing committees in each legislature, advocating for direct collaboration through video conferences, joint hearings, and delegation visits. Cooperation was seen as beneficial in areas like agriculture during the reauthorization of the U.S. Farm Bill and the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. The EU's Common Agricultural Policy and related issues like farm subsidies and regulations were seen as politically important on both sides of the Atlantic. While there was some initial contact between U.S. and EP agriculture committees, there was no substantive follow-up for coordination. The addition of financial services regulation and cyber-security as TLD interests could provide new opportunities for collaboration. The TLD may have new opportunities to coordinate with U.S. and EP committees on legislation, particularly in relation to the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. A committee-to-committee meeting between MEPs and the House Ways and Means Committee discussed the TTIP, with the Chair of the EUTLD also present, potentially establishing a role for the TLD in U.S.-EU trade discussions. The TLD may play a role in U.S.-EU trade discussions, seen as a test for closer cooperation between Congress and the EP. Proponents emphasize the importance of involving committees with jurisdiction over U.S.-EU agenda issues in the TLD to provide guidance on matters like consumer product safety and transatlantic jobs and growth initiatives. Supporters argue for stronger coordination between the TLD and standing committees to enhance committee input in setting meeting agendas and promoting dialogue with the European Parliament. Limited input from U.S. committees has hindered progress on TLD initiatives and its annual input to the TEC. Developing closer TLD coordination with standing committees would require sustained effort by the USTLD chair. Establishing direct committee-to-committee contact to improve legislative coordination between the TLD and the EP in Congress may face challenges, including concerns about prioritizing transatlantic relationships over constituents' interests and the importance of personal relationships in coordinating legislative initiatives. Developing such relationships across the Atlantic is uncertain, and some Members of Congress may be hesitant to pursue this option. Most Members of Congress have shown less interest in establishing closer committee coordination with the European Parliament compared to their counterparts. No standing committee in the House has appointed staff to act as liaisons with the EP or the USTLD. Regular meetings between EPLO and USTLD chairs could facilitate sharing insights and information on legislative activities. EP staffers in Washington could update Members and staff on legislative matters. The EPLO has started implementing a communication approach to update US Members and staff on legislative proposals in the EP. This option is seen as cost-effective and could enhance contact among TLD delegates. However, some doubt its effectiveness in strengthening the Congress-EP relationship and question its ability to involve a broader range of committee staff regularly. Individual meetings between EPLO and congressional staff continue, but more formal workshops or seminars are being considered. Continuing formal workshops or seminars hosted by the EPLO for a larger staff audience, including TLD and committee staff, to discuss issues before both the Parliament and Congress may be useful. Senior congressional staff could be designated as congressional \"fellows\" and seconded to the EP for a short-duration rotation, providing staff exposure to the Parliament and facilitating continuous information exchange. Issues such as housing and per diem costs would need to be determined by Congress. Establishing a fellowship exchange program for U.S. congressional staff at the European Parliament (EP) could create a cadre of staffers with firsthand knowledge of the EP and personal contacts within the institution. This could strengthen the relationship between Congress and the EP. However, rotating staff on a short-term basis may not allow enough time to build sustainable relationships with EP counterparts. Establishing a fellowship exchange program for U.S. congressional staff at the European Parliament (EP) could enhance long-term institutional ties between Congress and the EP. The EP has already initiated exchange programs with Republican and Democratic staff, which have been successful in providing insights into how each institution works. Establishing a fellowship exchange program for U.S. congressional staff at the European Parliament could enhance long-term institutional ties. This program involves seconding a staffer to a Democratic Member's office for a few weeks to learn about Congress operations and focus on specific issues. Another example is EP staff spending time in a House office to understand legislation development. Formalizing this model through the TLD could involve opening a congressional liaison office in Brussels and deploying U.S. staff to work with the European Parliament daily. This option raises questions about logistics, hiring, and reporting structures within Congress. Establishing a congressional liaison office in Brussels could enhance legislative consultation and cooperation between Congress and the European Parliament. U.S. staff deployed to Brussels would closely follow events in the Parliament, potentially leading to greater relations between the two bodies. Establishing a congressional liaison office in Brussels could improve cooperation between Congress and the European Parliament. U.S. staff in Brussels would monitor EP events closely, fostering relationships with MEPs and promoting dialogue on key issues. Critics argue that without broader political commitment from Congress, strengthening ties with the EP may be challenging. Establishing a congressional liaison office in Brussels would require significant logistical and financial considerations. Some worry about setting a precedent for similar offices in other countries and potential constitutional questions. Proponents advocate for closer ties between Congress and the European Parliament. Supporters propose establishing a Congressional Commission on the EU to monitor EU legislation, evaluate its impact on the US, and serve as a liaison with the EP and other EU institutions. Modeled after the US Helsinki Commission, it would have equal representation from the House and Senate, hold hearings, and rotate leadership between the two chambers each Congress. A Congressional Commission on the EU is proposed to monitor EU legislation, evaluate its impact on the US, and serve as a liaison with the EP and other EU institutions. H.Con.Res. 2 suggests creating this Commission with staff in Washington and office space near the EP in Brussels. Advocates believe it would enhance the Congress-EP relationship and U.S.-EU partnership, but some question its effectiveness compared to existing mechanisms. The proposed Congressional Commission on the EU would monitor EU legislation, assess its impact on the US, strengthen the Congress-EP relationship, and improve committee-to-committee relations between the two bodies. Critics argue that the lack of wider congressional interest in closer cooperation with the EU makes this option premature. Some analysts question the need for a new Commission on the EU, suggesting that current structures could already fulfill its proposed functions. They also doubt the willingness of the Senate to participate and believe that enhancing the current Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) and increasing direct contact between standing committees may render the Commission redundant. Additionally, concerns exist about garnering necessary support for the proposed Commission in the current U.S. political climate. The Senate's potential involvement in strengthening ties between the U.S. Congress and the European Parliament through the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) has been a topic of discussion. Senator Jeanne Shaheen has shown interest in exploring Senate participation in the TLD, but there are no current plans to establish a Senate version of the TLD. Some suggest that the House EU Caucus could engage with the Senate to enhance collaboration. Some experts believe that the Senate should be more involved in the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) to strengthen ties with the European Parliament. Suggestions include inviting Senate staff to Caucus meetings or creating a Senate EU Caucus for joint meetings with the House counterpart. Concerns have been raised about the Senate's exclusion from the TLD discussions despite its important role in the transatlantic relationship and regulatory oversight. The TLD does not have a mechanism to include the Senate in its discussions, and the TEC Advisory Group cannot solicit Senate opinion. The TLD, as currently structured, cannot claim to speak on behalf of the Senate. Progress in resolving this issue is unclear, but one option could be for the USTLD chair to consider creating a way to include the Senate as a TEC advisor. The USTLD chair may consider creating a Congressional TEC Working Group to involve Senate members in the TEC process and enhance Congress-Parliament relations. It is uncertain how interested Senators are in engaging with the European Parliament and establishing closer ties with MEPs. The European Parliament values its partnership with the U.S. Congress. The European Parliament values its partnership with the U.S. Congress and has opened a legislative liaison office in Washington. The EP seeks closer legislative cooperation with Congress, but some Members are not as interested due to differences in legislative powers and mandates. The Transatlantic Legislative Dialogue (TLD) and the U.S. Congress have different legislative powers and mandates. The TLD's involvement in regulatory cooperation with the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) initially raised its visibility in Congress, but there has been little additional interest since then. Questions remain about the roles of Congress and the European Parliament in promoting transatlantic economic integration and regulatory cooperation. Despite the growing power of the European Parliament (EP) within the EU, questions about closer ties with the U.S. Congress remain unanswered. Some original advocates for this relationship are no longer in Congress, and outside organizations are less enthusiastic. Advocates believe addressing concerns about the Transatlantic Legislative Dialogue (TLD) could strengthen Congress-Parliament cooperation for transatlantic relations. The United States and the EU have begun negotiations on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership during the 113th Congress, which could enhance Congress-EP cooperation. Efforts to strengthen the relationship between Congress and the European Parliament will require sustained political commitment and consideration of various options. Many believe it is worth pursuing and anticipate a more robust USTLD leadership to improve relations between the two bodies. The chart compares European Parliament committees with U.S. House and Senate committees, grouped by subject areas based on competencies. Not all EP committees have a congressional equivalent, and EP special committees are not included. The chart is illustrative and not exhaustive due to the complexities of the U.S. committee system. Committees are listed alphabetically."
