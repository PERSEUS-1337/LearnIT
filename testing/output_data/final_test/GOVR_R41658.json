    "content": "Since 1783, over 100 memorials have been authorized in the District of Columbia, with Congress establishing criteria for commemorative works in 1986. Special memorial commissions were given authority to select locations and approve designs, with private organizations also authorized to choose sites with presidential approval. By the mid-20th century, a general process for creating commemorative works was in place. The Commemorative Works Act was passed by Congress in 1986 to guide the creation of memorials in the District of Columbia. This report examines the process of proposing, approving, and constructing memorials in the district, including the criteria and steps involved. The Commemorative Works Act of 1986 guides the creation of memorials in the District of Columbia. President George Washington chose the location for the permanent seat of government in the District of Columbia in 1790. After ordering surveys, Washington chose the confluence of the Potomac River and Anacostia Rivers as the capital site. Major L'Enfant was tasked with designing the federal city, including spaces for the President's house and the Capitol Building. His plan emphasized creating a federal precinct with no single center for the government. Major L'Enfant's vision for the federal capital emphasized a decentralized layout with dispersed centers connected by communication routes. He aimed for a community where members lived and worked separately, symbolically separating Congress, the President, and the Supreme Court. This design reflected the principles of separation of powers in the Constitution. The original boundaries of the District of Columbia extended beyond the federal city depicted in Figure 1. A 10-mile square, created from land ceded from Maryland and Virginia, it also included much of modern-day Alexandria, Virginia, and Arlington County. In 1846, Congress passed legislation returning Alexandria to Virginia after determining it was not necessary for the purpose of the District. In 1900, a new comprehensive plan for Washington, DC was developed to celebrate the city's 100th anniversary. Led by Senator James McMillan, the Senate Park Commission was created to review and create this plan, focusing on public buildings, parks, and recreational spaces. The McMillan Commission plan aimed to connect and enhance existing parks in Washington, DC, focusing on the design of the city and the National Mall. The plan sought to return the monumental core of the city to the original intent of L'Enfant's designs, addressing the need for new public buildings and memorials while restoring unity of design. The McMillan Commission plan aimed to restore unity of design in Washington, DC by formulating principles for future structures and creating monuments within the federal landscape. It laid the foundation for further development in the District of Columbia over the next 100 years, emphasizing design features of the federal core including the National Mall, Federal Triangle, Lincoln Memorial, and the Ellipse. The Commemorative Works Act (CWA) was enacted in 1986 to guide the creation of memorials in the District of Columbia, preserving the integrity of the L'Enfant and McMillan plans for the Nation's Capital and ensuring public use of open space. The Commemorative Works Act (CWA) of 1986 ensures that future commemorative works in areas administered by the National Park Service and the Administrator of General Services in the District of Columbia are appropriately designed, constructed, and located to reflect lasting national significance. It defines commemorative works as structures or features designed to perpetuate the memory of individuals, groups, events, or elements of American history. The CWA does not apply to military properties or land under the jurisdiction of the Smithsonian. The Commemorative Works Act of 1986 governs the establishment of commemorative works in the National Capital Region of the National Park System. Representative William Hughes introduced H.R. 4378 for this purpose, addressing the need to balance different uses of park land for commemorative works. The Commemorative Works Act of 1986, introduced by Representative William Hughes, aims to balance commemorative works on National Park land with other activities. Representative Bruce Vento supports the bill, emphasizing the importance of creating lasting national significance in future commemorative works. He connects the placement of these works to the L'Enfant and McMillan plans for the District of Columbia, highlighting the city's planned design embodying American ideals. The Park Commission supports the McMillan plan for the District of Columbia, emphasizing the importance of preserving open space and balancing uses of public lands. Representative Michael Strang highlights the need to place commemorative works within the city's design. H.R. 4378, aimed at limiting insignificant works in D.C., passed the House and was referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. H.R. 4378 was referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The bill was debated and passed by both the Senate and House, with amendments, before being signed into law as the Commemorative Works Act by President Ronald Reagan on November 14, 1986. The Commemorative Works Act (CWA) was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan on November 14, 1986. It contained 10 sections covering purposes, definitions, congressional authorization for memorials, creation of the National Capital Memorial Commission, conditions for memorial placement, site design, construction permits, temporary memorial site, and administrative provisions. Congress realized by 1991 that many sponsor groups were unable to complete memorial construction within the allocated time period. Legislative authority for commemorative works expired within five years of enactment, unless a construction permit was issued. The Commemorative Works Act was enacted in 1986 to authorize commemorative works on public space in D.C. A bill was introduced to extend the deadline for completing these works from five to seven years due to difficulties in meeting the deadline. Representative Wayne Allard argued for the extension, stating that the Act has been successful in ensuring only important works are constructed. The Commemorative Works Act, enacted in 1986, aimed to ensure high-quality construction of important works. Congress underestimated the time needed for approvals and funding. H.R. 3169 was passed by the House and Senate, signed into law by President George H.W. Bush on December 11, 1991. An extension was proposed by Representative Nancy Johnson in H.R. 2947 to allow nine years for completion. The Committee on Natural Resources reported amendments to extend legislative authority for the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Foundation, Women in Military Service for America Memorial, and National Peace Garden. Representative Bruce Vento explained the rationale for extending authorities of the memorials and amending the Commemorative Works Act. H.R. 2947, introduced by Congresswoman Nancy Johnson, now extends authorization for three commemorative works. H.R. 2947 extends authorization for three commemorative works in the Nation's Capital, including the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial, Women in Military Service for America Memorial, and National Peace Garden. The legislation grants a 10-year extension for completion of the projects, with no further extensions allowed. Various technical amendments to the Commemorative Works Act are also included in the bill. The House passed H.R. 2947, which includes technical amendments to the Commemorative Works Act requested by the National Capital Memorial Commission. The bill adds provisions on accountability for fundraisers to maintain public trust. The Senate referred the bill to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which reported further amendments, including restoring a provision for developing fundraising standards and suspending fundraising authority for non-compliance. The Senate passed H.R. 2947 with amendments, including removing a provision allowing the Secretary to suspend fundraising activities for excessive expenses. The committee expects the National Park Service to develop guidelines for memorial organizations on managing administrative costs and fundraising fees to prevent future issues. The Park Service will monitor fundraising activities of memorial organizations closely, applying provisions of H.R. 2947 to all commemorative works. Congress aims to preserve L'Enfant and McMillan visions for the National Mall to prevent overbuilding. Senate Committee held oversight hearing on monuments and memorials in DC in March 2000. The National Park Service, District of Columbia, and Committee of 100 testified on proposed amendments to the CWA, based on a study by various agencies. J. Carter Brown emphasized the need for a new \"reserve\" area on the National Mall with a building moratorium to protect it from new memorials. The proposed reserve would serve as a no-build zone to preserve the central precinct despite pressures for new additions. In the 107th Congress, Senator Chuck Hagel introduced S. 281, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Education Act, which aimed to create a Reserve on the National Mall and prohibit new memorials within its boundaries. However, the bill was not further considered by the Senate. In the 108th Congress, Representative Richard Pombo reintroduced the issue with H.R. 1442, authorizing the design and construction of the Vietnam Visitor Center and amending the CWA to create a Reserve. The CWA was amended to create a \"reserve\" area on the National Mall through P.L. 108-126, establishing a building moratorium. No new commemorative works are allowed in the Reserve unless authorized prior to P.L. 108-126. Placement of commemorative works in Area I and Area II must have historical significance to the United States and American people. Sponsor groups are typically prohibited from using federal funds for design. Groups sponsoring monuments and memorials often rely on donations from the public, corporations, and foundations to raise funds. Donors, especially corporate and foundation donors, may request recognition for their contributions. Donor recognition can be on-site or off-site, with on-site recognition being at the monument location and off-site recognition elsewhere. This recognition can impact the sponsor groups' ability to raise necessary funds. Donors for monuments and memorials may seek recognition for their contributions, which can be on-site or off-site. Policies on recognizing donations vary for works authorized under the CWA and non-CWA projects. The CWA initially prohibited on-site donor recognition but exemptions have been made, such as for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center was granted permission to recognize donors, and a bill was introduced to allow donor acknowledgements at projects authorized under the Commemorative Works Act. The bill would retroactively apply to memorials dedicated after January 1, 2010. Stephen Whitesell supported on-site recognition of donors, stating that the ban on donor recognition has proven impractical. The CWA ban on donor recognition has been deemed impractical due to the need for funding new memorials. Donor recognition with limitations is supported for effective fundraising, but permanent recognition is not. H.R. 2395 was not further considered after a subcommittee hearing in 2013, but its language was included in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2015. The CWA was amended to allow donor recognition inside ancillary structures or as part of a landscape feature at the commemorative work. The acknowledgment for commemorative works must be paid for by the sponsor and approved by the Secretary of the Interior or the Administrator of General Services. It should be limited to a statement recognizing the contribution, displayed according to guidelines for up to 10 years, freestanding, and not affixed to any landscape feature or museum object. The Commemorative Works Act of 1986 outlines the placement of commemorative works in areas managed by the National Park Service and General Services Administration in the District of Columbia. The National Park Service has a 24-step outline for creating commemorative works, including initiation, legislation, site selection, design approval, fundraising, construction, and dedication. Groups can request extensions for completing memorial creation. Most commemorative works in DC since 1986 have been sponsored by various groups. Since 1986, most commemorative works in the District of Columbia have been sponsored by non-governmental groups. Sponsors must find a congressional sponsor to introduce legislation for creating a commemorative work. The Commemorative Works Act specifies that no commemorative work can be established in DC without Congress authorization, with specific requirements for military works and works commemorating events, individuals, or groups. Military works must commemorate a war or major military conflict officially ended for at least 10 years, excluding limited engagements or specific military units. The Commemorative Works Act specifies that legislation for creating a commemorative work must wait until after the 25th anniversary of the event, death of the individual, or death of the last surviving member of the group. The legislation typically includes authorization to establish the work, payment of expenses, and deposit of excess funds. Once introduced, the legislation is referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Additional legislation is required to designate a commemorative work in Area I. Legislation is needed to designate a commemorative work in Area I, with specific details on the group authorized to establish the memorial and the individual or group to be honored. The legislation typically includes the general location of the memorial but not a specific site. For example, authorization was given for a memorial to President John Adams and his family in the District of Columbia. Legislation authorizes the establishment of a commemorative work in Area I to honor former President John Adams. The sponsor is responsible for accepting contributions and covering all expenses related to the memorial's design and construction. A donation equal to 10 percent of the construction cost is required for perpetual maintenance and preservation. Federal funds are prohibited for such projects. The Council is responsible for accepting contributions and paying expenses for the establishment of a memorial. No federal funds can be used for this purpose. Excess funds raised are directed to the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service for deposit with the National Park Foundation. After the expiration of the authority for the commemorative work, any remaining funds are to be transmitted to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit. Congress may extend the legislative authority for a commemorative work, with a seven-year completion period unless a construction permit is obtained. Administrative extensions can be granted if design approvals are in place. Design approvals have been received from the National Capital Planning Commission and 75% of the required funds have been raised for a commemorative work. Congress can extend the legislative authority for such works, as seen with the Adams Memorial Foundation's extensions in 2009 and 2010. Amendments to the legislative authority may be made to comply with specific regulations. Based on design approvals and fundraising progress, the Secretary or Administrator may recommend a commemorative work location in Area I or Area II of Washington, DC. If the work is deemed historically significant, placement in Area I requires Congressional approval within 150 days. If not approved, the work may be located in Area II. The CWA divides Washington, DC into three sections for memorials: the Reserve, Area I, and Area II. Congressional approval is required for monument location in each area. The Reserve, from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, prohibits new commemorative works to preserve the Mall's integrity. The Reserve, from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, prohibits new commemorative works to preserve the Mall's integrity. Area I is designated for significant historical memorials, with specific boundaries outlined. The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial is the only work authorized prior to 2003 eligible for placement within the Reserve. Area I, encompassing Roosevelt Island, National Park Service land in Virginia, the 14th Street Bridge area, and Maryland Avenue, S.W., is designated for significant historical memorials. The Secretary of the Interior or the Administrator of General Services can recommend a memorial in Area I, with Area II reserved for subjects of lasting historical significance. If a recommendation for Area I is not enacted into law within 150 days, the sponsor must consider sites in Area II. Area II encompasses all sections of the District of Columbia and its environs not part of the Reserve or Area I. The House Committee on Resources and Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources seek the views of the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission for commemorative works legislation. The Secretary or the Administrator consult the commission before recommending a location for a commemorative work. For example, the approval of the Vietnam Women's Memorial location required compliance with specific legislation. The Act approved in 1988 authorizes the Vietnam Women's Memorial Project to establish a memorial honoring women who served in the Armed Forces during the Vietnam era. It is recommended to place the memorial within the Vietnam Veterans Memorial site in the District of Columbia. The Senate and House of Representatives approve the location of a memorial honoring women who served in the Armed Forces during the Vietnam era in area I of the District of Columbia. Memorial planners will hire a designer and work with the National Park Service for approval. The development of a concept for a memorial in the Fine Arts sector involves consultation with the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission. The chosen designer presents plans to various entities for review, guided by criteria established by the CWA. Final designs are completed in coordination with NPS or GSA, with federal funds not typically used for the project. The Commemorative Works Act allows sponsor groups to raise funds for creating memorials, as federal funds are not usually used for this purpose. However, Congress has sometimes provided funds for specific projects, such as $10 million for the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial in 2005. The Act outlines criteria for obtaining a construction permit, including approval of site and design. The Commemorative Works Act outlines criteria for obtaining a construction permit, including approval of site and design by relevant authorities, consultation with preservation experts, submission of construction documents, proof of sufficient funds, and donation for perpetual maintenance. Once a permit is issued, memorial construction can begin, followed by a dedication and transfer ceremony to NPS or GSA. President George W. Bush dedicated the World War II Memorial in 2004, praising the skill, vision, and patience it took to create the monument. He honored the heroic and gallant efforts of World War II veterans, emphasizing the enduring tribute the memorial represents to their sacrifices. President Bill Clinton, represented by Attorney General Janet Reno and Secretary of Commerce Norman Mineta, recognized the importance of the National Japanese-American Memorial to Patriotism during World War II. The dedication ceremony honored the patriotism of Japanese-Americans and served as a reminder of the injustices faced during the war. Clinton emphasized the need to remember the lessons of the Japanese-American internment camps and the inspirational patriotism displayed in the face of adversity. Since the passage of the CWA in 1986, Congress has authorized 33 memorials to be constructed on federal lands in the District of Columbia or its environs. Among the individuals recognized have been Francis Scott Key, George Mason, and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Groups commemorated have included Black Revolutionary War Patriots, Victims of Communism, and Ukrainian Famine-Genocide Victims. Events memorialized include the Korean War, World War II, and Dr. Since the passage of the Commemorative Works Act in 1986, Congress has authorized 33 memorials in the District of Columbia. Memorials have been dedicated to individuals like Francis Scott Key, George Mason, and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., as well as groups such as Black Revolutionary War Patriots and Victims of Communism. Events like the Korean War and World War II have also been memorialized. The Act contained provisions for memorial authorization, creation of the National Capital Memorial Commission, site design, and other administrative details. The National Park Service outlined a 24-step process for establishing memorials in the Nation's Capital. The National Park Service outlined a 24-step process for establishing memorials in the Nation's Capital, which includes seeking assistance from the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission, drafting a bill with a Member of Congress, and obtaining design approval and funding for construction. The process for establishing memorials in the Nation's Capital involves drafting a bill with a Member of Congress, obtaining design approval, and funding for construction. The bill is passed by Congress and signed into law by the President, giving the memorial sponsor 7 years to begin construction. The sponsor then organizes the entity responsible for the memorial and starts planning. The sponsor may also request authorization to consider sites in a specific area. The Secretary seeks NCMAC advice on memorial placement in Area I. Congress notified of historical significance for legislation consideration. Memorial sponsor works with NPS to identify potential sites in Area II. NPS submits recommended site to NCPC and CFA for approval. After site approval by NCPC and CFA, the design process begins with the sponsor selecting a designer or initiating a design competition. The sponsor then refines the design concept in consultation with NPS, SHPO, NCPC, and CFA before submitting it for approval. The sponsor refines the preliminary design based on comments from NCPC, CFA, and SHPO before submitting the final design to NPS for approval. The memorial design team then completes final drawings and specifications in coordination with NPS, followed by fundraising and submission of final documents and funds to NPS. NPS issues a construction permit on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, marking the start of construction. The sponsor begins construction and prepares operation, maintenance, and preservation plans for the memorial's dedication. The process to create a commemorative work in the District of Columbia involves various entities like the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission, U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, National Capital Planning Commission, and District of Columbia Historic Preservation Office. Each entity plays a role in advising on policy and procedures for the operation, maintenance, and preservation of memorials. The U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, established in 1910, consists of eight members who meet regularly to review memorial proposals in Washington, DC. They provide recommendations to the Secretary and Congress on conformance to the Commemorative Works Act and serve as a resource for those looking to establish memorials in the area. During the House debate on the Library, Representative McCall argued for a permanent entity to govern art in Washington, citing the haphazard development of art in the city. Representative Tawney opposed the creation of a Commission of Fine Arts, stating it would be an abdication of power by Congress. The House debated on legislative power and the appointment of commissions for public building construction in the District of Columbia. H.R. 19962 passed the House and was referred to the Senate, where the bill was amended to give the commission authority to advise on art matters. The bill gave the Commission of Fine Arts authority to advise on art matters when required by the President or Congress. The Senate passed the bill with amendments, leading to a conference committee report and eventual approval by Congress and President William Howard Taft in 1910. The Commission was initially tasked with advising on the location and selection of statues, fountains, and monuments in the District of Columbia. The Commission of Fine Arts, comprised of seven judges appointed by the President, expanded its duties to include selecting models for federal statues, fountains, and monuments. The National Capital Park and Planning Commission, established in 1924, implements the McMillan Plan for Washington, D.C. It focuses on preserving water flow, preventing pollution, and conserving natural scenery in the area. The National Capital Planning Commission, formerly known as the Commission of Fine Arts, was established in 1924 to preserve forests and natural scenery in Washington, D.C. In 1952, Congress expanded the commission's geographic boundaries and renamed it to reflect its new regional mission. The National Capital Planning Commission was established in 1924 to preserve natural scenery in Washington, D.C. The commission's responsibilities include collaboration with the Regional Planning Council on various subjects such as viaducts, subways, monuments, public reservations, airports, and population distribution. The commission consists of 12 members appointed by the President, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, and regional officials. The National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) in Washington, DC collaborates with various agencies and committees to guide and approve monument and memorial creation processes. It operates under multiple laws for planning in the National Capital Region, including the National Capital Planning Act and other related acts. Additionally, State Historic Preservation Officers oversee historic preservation activities in the District of Columbia. State Historic Preservation Officers administer the national historic preservation program at the State level, review National Register of Historic Places nominations, maintain data on historic properties, and consult with Federal agencies. The American Battle Monuments Commission was created in 1923 to erect memorials for American forces in Europe. The American Battle Monuments Commission has the authority to design, construct, and maintain American cemeteries in foreign countries and military memorials where US armed forces have served since 1917. They also oversee the creation of permanent US military monuments and markers by other organizations and individuals. Additionally, the commission has been involved in creating memorials within the United States, such as the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C."
