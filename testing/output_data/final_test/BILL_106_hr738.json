    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Taxpayer Oversight of Surplus Property Act\". Congress finds that the provisions in Public Law 94-519 established a system to ensure fair and equitable allocation of Federal surplus personal property to eligible recipients, including law enforcement agencies, school systems, medical institutions, libraries, homeless assistance providers, and units of local government. The benefits of the Federal personal property utilization and donation program are measured in terms of money saved by recipients. Members of Congress and State and local officials have a duty to oversee the distribution of Government property to ensure accountability to taxpayers. The current system for donating surplus Federal property is ineffective due to prioritizing foreign entities over the needs of US taxpayers. New legislation is needed to address this issue. New legislation is needed to prioritize domestic use transfers of excess personal property to Federal agencies over property transfers through foreign assistance programs. SEC. 3. Priority given to state and local governments for transfer of nonlethal excess supplies from the Department of Defense. Section 2547 of title 10, United States Code is amended to allow nonlethal excess supplies of the Department of Defense to be made available to states, local governments, territories, or possessions for humanitarian relief purposes upon request. The President may also authorize the supplies for humanitarian purposes before they are given to a state or local government. Nonlethal excess supplies of the Department of Defense can be provided to states, local governments, territories, or possessions for humanitarian relief in response to natural disasters. Section 607 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to allow the transfer of property for environmental protection in foreign countries. The Administrator of General Services must determine that there is no Federal or State use requirement for the property under any other provision of law before the transfer can occur. Additionally, confiscated property can be transferred to foreign countries. The Administrator of General Services will review statutes on surplus personal property disposal and donation, submitting a report to Congress within 180 days. The report will assess program effectiveness, property amounts, and types administered in the past two fiscal years. Legislative recommendations for integrating and consolidating programs under a single Federal authority will also be included."
