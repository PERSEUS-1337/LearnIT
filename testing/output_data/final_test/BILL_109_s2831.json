The attorney for the United States must provide timely notice of a demand for documents. Nondisclosure of information must be weighed against the public interest in disclosure and newsgathering. There must be reasonable grounds to believe a crime has occurred and the information sought is critical to the investigation. The subpoena cannot be used to obtain peripheral or nonessential information. SEC. 5. COMPELLED DISCLOSURE AT THE REQUEST OF CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS. SEC. 5.
