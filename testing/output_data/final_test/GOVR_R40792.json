The Agriculture appropriations bill provides FDA's annual funding, which includes direct appropriations and user fees. The bill specifies funding for FDA's major program areas and agency-wide support areas. The appropriations committees authorize collections and spending from specific funds for activities related to FDA, including mammography quality standards and export certification. The standard appropriations procedure involves congressional passage of 12 annual regular appropriations acts, with FY2010 following this process. In previous years, Congress had passed omnibus or consolidated appropriations legislation due to not completing the standard process. In FY2009, Congress provided appropriations for FDA in the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009. The President presents a budget request to Congress in February each year. The FDA Justification of Estimates highlights program-level details and special initiatives. Analysts cannot track exact changes over time due to varying topics discussed. The FY2010 FDA budget request of $3.178 billion is 19% higher than the previous year, with increased funding for food and medical product safety activities. The President's request is detailed by major program areas in Table 3, following appropriations from previous years. Appropriations committees in the House and Senate have subcommittees that handle FDA funding. The process involves subcommittees considering issues, holding hearings, and marking up bills for full approval. The subcommittee considers issues, holds hearings, and marks up a bill for full committee consideration. The full House and Senate committees review the bill, make amendments, and pass it. If there are differences between the House and Senate bills, a conference committee is formed to reconcile them. The final conference bill must be approved by both chambers before being sent to the President for signing. On June 23, 2009, the full Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 2997.
