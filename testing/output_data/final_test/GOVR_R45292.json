Originally Salvadoran-focused, it now includes other Central and South American immigrants. Members engage in revenue-generating activities and have ties in Central America. Legislation in the mid-1990s increased deportations. Legislation in the mid-1990s increased deportations of foreign nationals with criminal convictions from the United States to Central America, including the Northern Triangle countries. Some of these deportees, possibly affiliated with MS-13, helped establish gang ties in their home countries, contributing to the spread of U.S. gang culture in Central America. Law enforcement, media, and policymakers have shown interest in MS-13 due to its violent criminal activities. MS-13's organizational structure consists of loosely organized cells or \"cliques\" with ties to specific territories. These territories serve as recruitment hubs and sources of illicit income. Some cliques operate as part of larger programs, especially in areas like Los Angeles and El Salvador. The U.S. MS-13 structure is relatively diffuse, with cliques in cities like Los Angeles and El Salvador. Attempts to consolidate power and exert control over cliques have been debated. Leaders in El Salvador have tried to direct U.S. activities, but may have little influence. FBI estimates have shown consistent domestic size since 2005. Since 2005, the FBI estimated MS-13 gang membership in the United States to be around 10,000 members. Federal law enforcement has stopped providing regular estimates of gang membership, including MS-13, with the FBI removing references to total gang members from its website in June 2018. MS-13 members are involved in various local and transnational criminal activities such as drug distribution, robbery, and human trafficking, which support the gang's finances and territorial control. MS-13 is known for violent criminal activity, which serves both internal and external purposes. This violence helps with recruitment, discipline, and establishing territory and control. Recent reports link MS-13 to a wave of violent crimes, including murders in Long Island, NY. Authorities estimate that 38% of murders in Suffolk County since 2016 were attributed to MS-13. Federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York have indicted two dozen MS-13 members for crimes including 15 murders, assaults, arson, and drug distribution. The indictments also include charges related to high-profile killings. Some suburban areas have seen an increase in MS-13 members in county jails, with a 20% increase in Montgomery County, MD, a 32% increase in Prince William County, VA, and a doubling in Fairfax County, VA. Gang crime is primarily handled by state and local law enforcement. Federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, DEA, ATF, and ICE, are involved in investigating gang crimes like MS-13 due to the cross-jurisdictional nature of gang activity. The FBI leads anti-gang initiatives within the Department of Justice, focusing on violent gangs. The FBI leads anti-gang initiatives through Violent Gang Safe Streets Task Forces, targeting violent gangs and crimes. These task forces involve federal, state, and local law enforcement officers investigating crimes like racketeering, drug conspiracy, and firearms violations. Additionally, the FBI has transnational partnerships to combat gangs, including the Transnational Anti-Gang Task Force (TAG) initiative. The FBI leads anti-gang initiatives through Violent Gang Safe Streets Task Forces, targeting violent gangs and crimes like racketeering, drug conspiracy, and firearms violations. The Transnational Anti-Gang Task Force (TAG) initiative focuses on MS-13 and the 18th Street gang, with task forces in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. TAG units facilitate intelligence sharing and training for local law enforcement in countering gang threats. Operation Regional Shield in September 2017 charged over 3,800 gang members with various crimes across the United States and Central America. The FBI's TAG units were involved in investigating crimes such as murder, arson, racketeering, and conspiracy to distribute marijuana in Central America. In the United States, over 70 individuals, including 17 MS-13 members, were charged with various crimes on Long Island, NY. The National Gang Intelligence Center (NGIC) was established in 2005 to coordinate intelligence information from federal, state, and local policing agencies to support law enforcement investigations. ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) has a National Gang Unit (NGU) within the Department of Homeland Security to deter and disrupt domestic gang operations. ICE HSI's National Gang Unit (NGU) focuses on deterring and disrupting domestic gang operations, including transnational criminal gangs, prison gangs, and outlaw motorcycle gangs. Operation Community Shield, launched in 2005, aims to dismantle transnational criminal gangs, with 796 MS-13 gang members and associates arrested in FY2017. In the same year, HSI made 4,818 criminal arrests related to gang activity and administratively arrested 5,225 gang members and associates. Operation Community Shield targeted MS-13, resulting in 267 arrests in FY2017. Of these, 214 were in the US, with 93 arrested for criminal violations and 121 for immigration violations. Other federal initiatives like the OCDETF program could also address gang threats like MS-13. Attorney General Sessions has prioritized countering MS-13 within the OCDETF program, despite some questioning its alignment with traditional OCDETF targets. Developing a clear understanding of MS-13 is crucial for effective policy responses, as it is described as both a street gang and a transnational criminal organization. Leveraging law enforcement tools and resources is essential to combat their illicit activities. The federal government defines a gang as an association of three or more individuals who collectively identify themselves with a group identity to engage in criminal activity. This definition helps in understanding MS-13 and shaping policy responses to combat their criminality. The federal government defines a gang as an association of three or more individuals engaging in criminal activity. The gang may use violence or intimidation to further its objectives, possess certain characteristics, and seek to control a particular location or region. This definition excludes traditional organized crime groups like La Cosa Nostra. The Department of Justice (DOJ) defines a \"criminal street gang\" as an ongoing group of 5 or more persons with primary purposes of committing federal felonies involving controlled substances, violent felonies, or conspiracies. MS-13 is cited as a prominent example of such a gang operating in the United States. Its members have been involved in a series of felony crimes affecting interstate or foreign commerce in the past five years. The Obama Administration released the Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime in July 2011, highlighting transnational organized crime as a national security concern. Transnational organized crime involves individuals operating across borders for power, monetary gains, and influence through illegal means, protected by corruption, violence, and transnational structures. Transnational organized criminals operate in various structures like hierarchies, clans, networks, and cells, committing a range of crimes. They engage in conspiratorial activities, using violence or threats to intimidate, exploiting international differences, seeking influence in government and commerce through corrupt means, and prioritizing economic gain from both illegal and legitimate ventures. Transnational criminal organizations, such as MS-13, engage in a variety of serious criminal activities including drug trafficking, kidnapping, human smuggling, and murder. The Treasury Department can sanction these organizations, and federal law enforcement has been directed to combat them more effectively. Federal enforcement efforts target transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) and criminal gangs, including street gangs. Drug distribution is a common source of income for both TCOs and gangs, with TCOs focusing on wholesale-level distribution and gangs on retail-level distribution. MS-13 is primarily involved in local drug sales, which are a significant revenue source for the gang. MS-13's retail-level drug sales are crucial for the gang's revenue stream. They have ties with transnational drug trafficking organizations to facilitate drug flow in the US. The gang's involvement in criminal activities like drug distribution blurs the lines between gangs and TCOs, as both have similar motivations for power and economic gain. MS-13 focuses on establishing and maintaining identity while engaging in violent criminal behavior. The MS-13 gang focuses on identity, community, and turf rather than money. There are inconsistencies in how it is conceptualized by federal agencies and researchers, with debates on whether it is a transnational criminal organization. Some argue it has evolved into one, pointing to its involvement in drug production and trafficking in Central America, while others disagree citing its structure and criminal capacity. Some argue that MS-13 has not reached the level of a transnational criminal organization due to its focus on identity, community, and turf rather than profit. There is debate on whether categorizing MS-13 as a TCO or a gang is necessary for developing effective policies to counter the group. The debate over categorizing MS-13 as a gang or a transnational criminal organization (TCO) is fueled by the lack of clear distinctions in federal definitions. Federal law enforcement focuses on investigating and prosecuting crimes committed by MS-13 members rather than their affiliation. The blurred lines between criminal gangs and TCOs make it challenging to categorize MS-13 definitively as one or the other, raising questions about the necessity and feasibility of making such distinctions. The debate over categorizing MS-13 as a gang or a transnational criminal organization (TCO) is fueled by the lack of clear distinctions in federal definitions. Understanding the specific mentality of each gang type is integral to disruption and dismantlement. Federal resources are oriented towards countering TCOs and gangs, with a mix of enforcement and prevention resources allocated to thwarting gangs. The debate over categorizing MS-13 as a gang or a transnational criminal organization (TCO) is fueled by the lack of clear distinctions in federal definitions. Different conceptualizations of MS-13 implicate different resources available for law enforcement initiatives and prevention efforts. Defining MS-13 as a criminal street gang or a TCO may affect federal investigations and prosecutions of gang members. The debate over categorizing MS-13 as a gang or a transnational criminal organization (TCO) may impact federal investigations and prosecutions of gang members. Authorities can prosecute members of gangs or TCOs under various criminal statutes. Understanding the scope of the MS-13 threat involves questions about its growth in numbers and territory. The NGIC has previously estimated the number of gangs and members in the United States. The National Gang Report has not provided estimates on the number of gangs and gang members in the United States since 2011. There is a debate on whether federal law enforcement should maintain a centralized database on gang membership. Federal agencies collect information on gangs, but do not have databases exclusively for this purpose. The FBI and ICE databases contain information on gang membership, but are not limited to gangs. The FBI's National Gang Intelligence Center (NGIC) has access to databases from various agencies for centralized information sharing on gang-related data. It is unclear if NGIC officials have automatic access to all agency databases. Law enforcement agencies can also access gang-related information through the FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC), which contains 21 files for querying and submitting data. The NCIC database contains 21 files, including a gang file with information on violent gangs. Policymakers may have questions about how gang intelligence is collected, file completeness, data removal, query frequency, and information usage. DHS maintains databases for gang-related information, such as the Investigative Case Management system used by HSI special agents and ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations personnel. The Investigative Case Management (ICM) system is used to manage immigration cases for criminal prosecution and civil immigration enforcement. It allows agents to link records, documents, and notate gang membership/affiliation. Another system, the Enforcement Integrated Database (EID), contains information related to investigations, arrests, and removals primarily conducted by ICE and CBP. EID records are accessed through software applications like EAGLE, which processes biometric and biographic information of arrested persons. The NGIC was established to coordinate intelligence information on gang activity from federal, state, and local policing agencies. Reviews from oversight bodies have critiqued areas for improvement in federal enforcement initiatives against violent gangs like MS-13. Policymakers may be interested in how databases containing gang membership information are used by ICE and other law enforcement partners. The NGIC, established to coordinate gang activity intelligence, lacks a centralized database as directed by Congress. Criticisms include the organization's inability to effectively share gang intelligence with other law enforcement agencies. DOJ and DHS have implemented most GAO recommendations on countering gangs, but one remains outstanding. One of GAO's recommendations from a report remains outstanding, as DOJ could not develop a department-wide performance measure for anti-gang efforts due to differences in agency missions. Policymakers may need to assess changes in federal agencies' approaches to combat violent gangs like MS-13. The link between MS-13 and unaccompanied alien children entering the US has drawn attention from various stakeholders. Central America's issues with government legitimacy and criminal activity, particularly involving gangs like MS-13, are driving unauthorized migration to the United States. Reports show that many Central American migrants, including unaccompanied children, are fleeing gang-related violence. Concerns have been raised about MS-13 exploiting the U.S. Southwest border to bring gang members into the country. MS-13 may recruit vulnerable unaccompanied children (UAC) from Central America to join their ranks in the United States. In FY2017, CBP apprehended 228 MS-13 affiliated individuals out of 310,531 not lawfully present in the U.S. Additionally, 41,435 UAC were apprehended at the U.S. Southwest border, but it is unclear if any were affiliated with MS-13 upon arrival. Regarding UAC gang affiliation, estimates suggest that around 5,000 individuals apprehended since October 2012 had \"confirmed or suspected gang affiliations,\" with 159 (3%) being UAC. Among these, approximately 56 UACs were linked to MS-13. It is challenging to determine if an MS-13 member arrived in the U.S. as a UAC and joined the gang later. The reasons for immigrant youth joining MS-13, whether voluntarily for a sense of community or under coercion to avoid gang consequences, remain unclear. Policymakers overseeing federal efforts to counter gang activity are interested in determining and tracking UAC gang membership and affiliation, as well as understanding the organizational structure, size, and criminality of MS-13. Developing a clear conceptualization of the gang may help in assessing law enforcement tools and techniques to gather and share gang-related information, conduct anti-gang enforcement initiatives, and respond to evolving threats posed by MS-13 and its affiliates."
