    "content": "The President signed the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2007 into law, which funded several agencies including the Department of Veterans Affairs. The resolution provides $32.7 billion for the Veterans Health Administration for FY2007, with increases in various areas such as medical services and research. The FY2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Act does not authorize VA to implement fee increases as proposed by the Administration. Congress increased funding for the Defense and Veterans' Brain Injury Center due to concerns about brain injuries from IED attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan. The final funding level for this program will be determined in the conference version of the Military Construction, Military Quality of Life, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies. The Defense and Veterans' Brain Injury Center received $10.7 million out of $19.6 million appropriated for the Blast Injury Prevention program in FY2006. Congress increased funding for the blast injury program to $19.6 million, including money for treatment and research. In FY2007, the Administration requested $7 million for the program, with $4.9 million allocated for the Defense and Veterans' Brain Injury Center. In FY2007, the Senate approved $19 million for the Defense and Veterans' Brain Injury Center, but the funding was later dropped from the final Department of Defense Appropriations Act. The Appropriations Resolution, 2007 (H.J.Res. 20, P.L. 110-5) does not specify funding for the Defense and Veterans' Brain Injury Center, but it is expected to be funded at the FY2007 requested level. The Department of Veterans Affairs offers various benefits and services to eligible veterans, including disability compensation, education, medical care, and burial benefits through different administrations. The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) oversees veterans cemeteries, grants for state cemeteries, and headstones. VA's budget includes mandatory and discretionary funding for various benefits and services, with a focus on health care. VHA operates the largest integrated health care system in the nation. The VA's health care system is organized into 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) with management authority delegated to VISNs. Medical care funds are allocated based on the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) system. VHA provides care directly to veterans through its hospitals, nursing homes, and rehabilitation centers. VHA operates numerous healthcare facilities including hospitals, nursing homes, and outpatient clinics. They also provide care through independent providers and practitioners. In FY2005, VHA served around 4.9 million unique veteran patients, with an estimated increase in caseload for FY2006 and FY2007. The total number of unique patients is estimated to increase by approximately 45,000 in FY2007, reaching 5.5 million. Outpatient visits are projected to increase to 58.5 million in FY2007. VHA spends around 61.7% of its medical care obligations on outpatient care and is associated with training physicians and other healthcare professionals. In FY2005, VHA trained thousands of medical students, nursing students, and allied health residents in VA medical centers. The report tracks VHA's FY2007 appropriations, funding levels for FY2006, and the Administration's budget proposal for FY2007. It also provides an overview of eligibility for VA health care and enrollment processes. Prior to eligibility reform in 1996, all veterans were technically eligible for some care, but actual provision was based on available resources. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 established two eligibility categories and required VHA to manage care through an enrollment system based on priorities. VA does not provide automatic entitlement to medical care for every veteran. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 established two eligibility categories for VA healthcare, prioritizing care for veterans with service-connected disabilities, former prisoners of war, and those exposed to toxic substances. VA was authorized to establish a patient enrollment system to manage access to healthcare for these \"core\" veterans. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 established two eligibility categories for VA healthcare, prioritizing care for veterans with service-connected disabilities, former prisoners of war, and those exposed to toxic substances. P.L. 104-262 required the establishment of a national enrollment system to manage the delivery of inpatient and outpatient medical care, with discretion given to the Secretary to determine its operation. The provision of health care to veterans was dependent upon available resources, as clarified by the Committee report accompanying P.L. 104-262. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 established two eligibility categories for VA healthcare, prioritizing care for veterans with service-connected disabilities, former prisoners of war, and those exposed to toxic substances. Veterans can apply for enrollment by completing the Application for Health Benefits (VA Form 10-10EZ) at any VA medical center or clinic, and once enrolled, they do not have to re-apply annually. Veterans in Priority Group 5 based on income must submit a new VA Form. Veterans enrolled in Priority Group 5 based on income must submit a new VA Form 10-10EZ annually with updated financial information to show inability to pay for necessary care. Eligibility for VA health care is primarily based on veteran's status from military service, requiring active-duty status and an honorable discharge. Certain service requirements apply for eligibility, but veterans discharged due to service-connected disabilities are exempt. Reservists called to active duty and completing their term are also eligible. Reservists and National Guard members called to active duty and completing their term are exempt from the 24-month active duty requirement for VA health care eligibility. They may also receive service-connection for injuries incurred during duty. National Guard members are not granted service-connection for injuries, heart attacks, or strokes that occur during state-ordered duty. Veterans are categorized based on service-connected disabilities or income levels, with Priority Groups 1-6 receiving high priority care from the VA. Veterans eligible for priority care from the VA include those with service-connected disabilities, former POWs, Purple Heart recipients, catastrophically disabled veterans, World War I veterans, those exposed to hazardous agents during active duty, and those with income below a VA means test threshold. VA considers applicants' income, net worth, and health insurance coverage to determine priority category and copayment requirements for nonservice-connected care. The VA may bill payers for treatment of conditions not related to military service. Veterans in Priority Group 7 or 8 have nonservice-connected medical conditions and higher incomes. VHA is funded through various appropriations accounts, including medical care and research. The Department of Veterans Affairs receives funding for medical care, research, and administration. Congress appropriates funds for construction of medical facilities. In FY2004, Congress changed VHA's appropriations structure to improve oversight. Funding for VHA is divided into four accounts: medical services, medical administration, medical facilities, and medical and prosthetic research. The Department of Veterans Affairs receives funding for medical care, research, and administration. Congress appropriates funds for construction of medical facilities. Funding for VHA is divided into four accounts: medical services, medical administration, medical facilities, and medical and prosthetic research. The medical administration account covers expenses for hospital administration, billing, legal services, and procurement. The medical facilities account includes expenses for facility maintenance, construction, leases, and services like laundry and food. VA researchers investigate veteran-centric health topics such as mental health treatment and rehabilitation for limb loss. The Department of Veterans Affairs receives funding for medical care, research, and administration. Funding for VHA is divided into four accounts: medical services, medical administration, medical facilities, and medical and prosthetic research. VA researchers investigate veteran-centric health topics such as mental health treatment, rehabilitation for limb loss, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury, and organ transplantation. The VHA has the authority to bill some veterans and health care insurers for nonservice-connected care to help defray the cost of delivering medical services to veterans. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) allowed the VA to retain funds in the Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF) for medical services for veterans. The act also authorized changing billing from \"reasonable costs\" to \"reasonable charges\" to increase third-party collections. In FY2004, there was a proposal to consolidate medical collections accounts into the MCCF. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005 granted VA permanent authority to deposit funds from various accounts into MCCF for medical services for veterans. MCCF collections increased by 56% from $1.2 billion in FY2002 to almost $1.9 billion in FY2005, with first-party collections representing 41% of total MCCF collections in FY2005. During the past year, Congress considered appropriation measures to fund VHA, including bridging shortfalls for FY2005 and additional funding for FY2006. The House passed H.R. 2528, appropriating $28.8 billion for VHA under the MilQual appropriations bill. The House passed H.R. 2528, appropriating $28.8 billion for VHA. The Administration announced increased medical care costs for FY2005, leading to a request for additional funding for FY2006. The President submitted a supplemental request totaling $2.9 billion to address shortfalls and funding needs. The conferees of the Department of the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies, Appropriations bill, 2006 provided $1.5 billion in supplemental appropriations for VA medical services for FY2005. The FY2006 Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill was signed into law on August 2, 2005 (P.L. 109-54), appropriating approximately $33.5 billion for VHA. The House and Senate adopted the conference report making appropriations for Military Quality of Life, Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies for FY2006. The MilCon-Qual-VA Appropriations Act, signed into law on November 30, 2005, appropriated $29.1 billion for VHA, including funds for medical services, administration, facilities, and research. Congress designated $1.2 billion as an emergency requirement. President Bush designated $1.2 billion in emergency funding for veterans' health care. Congress responded by attaching the reallocation request to the FY2006 Defense Appropriations bill, which included $225.2 million for VA medical services, $198.2 million for medical equipment lost during hurricanes, and $27.0 million for Avian Flu preparation. Additionally, $24.9 million was allocated for general operating expenses. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006, included funding for general operating expenses, national cemetery cleanup, construction major projects, and construction minor projects. A supplemental appropriations request in 2006 allocated $19.8 billion for hurricane recovery in the Gulf Coast, with $600 million designated for rebuilding the VA Medical Center in New Orleans. The Congress provided $75.0 million out of $368 million for advance planning and design of the VA Medical Center in New Orleans. The estimated cost for construction of a new VA Medical Center was $636 million. The House passed a bill providing $550 million for the project. The House-passed bill provides $550 million for rebuilding the VA Medical Center in New Orleans, with the Senate passing a bill providing $623 million for construction projects, including $561 million for the new VA Medical Center. The Senate Appropriations Committee designated $62.0 million for land cleanup in Gulfport, MS, and approved $430 million for VHA medical services in FY2006, including funds for mental health care and readjustment counseling services for veterans. The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery, 2006 allocated $586 million for construction projects, including $550 million for a new VA medical center in New Orleans and $36 million for cleanup in Gulf Port. However, it did not include the $430 million for VHA medical services as initially proposed. The 2006 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery included a provision to rescind $198.2 million from the medical services account and reappropriate it under a different law. The President's FY2007 budget proposal requested $32.7 billion for VHA, with increases for medical services, administration, facilities, and research. The budget request includes legislative proposals to focus VA's health care resources on core veterans. The House Budget Committee reported $36.9 billion for VA's discretionary programs, mainly for medical care, with an increase of $795 million over the President's recommendation. The recommended amount does not include enrollment fees or increased drug copayments for certain veterans. H.Con.Res. 376 and S.Con.Res. 83 propose budget allocations for VA programs for FY2007, with a focus on increasing funding for medical services and research. The House adopted H.Con.Res. 376, calling for $74.6 billion, while the Senate passed S.Con.Res. 83 with $74.8 billion allocated. The Senate added $823 million for VA Medical Services and $28 million for medical and prosthetic research. The House Committee on Appropriations approved $37.8 billion for mandatory programs in the Military Construction, Military Quality of Life, and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill for FY2007. The bill provided $32.7 billion for VHA, including $25.4 billion for medical services and designated $2.8 billion for specialty mental health care. The MilCon-Qual appropriations bill for FY2007 allocated $600 million for specialty mental health care, including funding for PTSD treatment and the establishment of 10 new Community-Based Outpatient Clinics. Additionally, $3.3 billion was provided for medical administration and $3.6 billion for medical facilities, with $412 million allocated for medical and prosthetic research. The committee recommended $599 million for VA construction projects in H.R. 5385, which was $83 million less than the President's request. Funding was not provided for certain construction projects, including refurbishment of operating rooms at the Columbia, Missouri VA medical center and the Spinal Cord Injury Center at the Milwaukee, Wisconsin VA medical center. The committee recommended $599 million for VA construction projects in H.R. 5385, $83 million less than the President's request. Funding was not provided for certain low priority projects, including the Spinal Cord Injury Center in Milwaukee and the VA medical center in Denver due to cost increases. The Administration opposed the funding reduction, stating it would slow CARES projects aimed at modernizing VA healthcare infrastructure. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported out its version of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for FY2007, including funding for the upgrade and modernization of VA research facilities. The committee expressed concerns about inadequate research space and the need for upgrades to ventilation, electrical supply, and plumbing systems. The bill did not include fee increases as requested by the Administration's budget proposal for VHA. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 5385 provided $32.7 billion for VHA, with $28.7 billion allocated for medical services, representing significant increases over previous funding levels. The bill also merged the medical administration account into the medical services account to enhance management flexibility. The Senate bill for H.R. 5385 allocated $3.6 billion for medical facilities and $412 million for medical and prosthetic research. Unlike the House-passed version, the Senate bill did not earmark funding for mental health care programs, but expressed interest in progress made with Centers of Excellence for mental health and PTSD. The VA was directed to expand outpatient blind rehabilitation services. The Senate adopted an amendment to provide up to $18 million for additional mental health care services for combat veterans through Vet Centers. The committee expressed concern about the lack of proper screening for Traumatic Brain Injury in returning veterans and encouraged the VA to establish a separate screening program in coordination with Polytrauma Centers. The committee directed the VA to establish a separate education and diagnosis screening program for VA medical centers and Vet Centers to help veterans, especially those in the National Guard and Reserves, adjust to deployments and transition home. They recommended utilizing a DOD program focused on goals, family strengthening, and communication to assist veterans and their families in dealing with the transition from active duty to civilian life and call up to active duty for National Guardsmen and Reservists. The committee recommended establishing separate education and diagnosis screening programs for veterans to assist with deployments and transition to civilian life. The Senate-approved version of H.R. 5385 provided $682 million for VA construction projects, including funding for CARES projects and increasing the threshold for major medical facility projects. The VA Secretary was authorized to carry out medical facility construction projects and leases with appropriated funds. The committee expressed concern about construction delays and directed VA to provide reports. Report language also requested a report on the Orlando, Florida, VA Medical Care Facility. Congress appropriated $25 million in FY2004 for the Orlando facility, but no progress has been made. The Senate Appropriations Committee urged VA to include $28.5 million in the FY2008 budget for a nursing home and adult day care center at the Beckley VA Medical Center in West Virginia. The Senate Appropriations Committee urged VA to include $28.5 million in the FY2008 budget for a nursing home and adult day care center at the Beckley VA Medical Center in West Virginia, and $3.6 million for planning and design work for the renovation and expansion of outpatient care facilities at the Martinsburg VA Medical Center. The committee criticized the Administration's fee proposals for VHA, stating that it was not responsible budgeting. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed VA not to submit a budget with assumed fees and copayments until authorized by Congress. The FY2007 budget for VHA was funded at $32.7 billion, $3.3 billion above FY2006, and $14.7 million above the President's request. The VHA budget for FY2007 includes funding increases for medical services, administration, and facilities. The Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution provides additional funding for medical and prosthetic research. P.L. 110-5 allocates funds for VA construction projects, including CARES projects. The FY2007 enacted amount slightly exceeds the President's request, with proposed legislative changes aimed at improving the VA health care system. The President's budget request for FY2007 includes proposals to refocus the VA health care system on priority veterans, such as those with service-connected conditions and lower incomes. The proposals include an annual enrollment fee of $250 for Priority 7 and 8 veterans, an increase in pharmaceutical copayments, and billing veterans for nonservice-connected conditions. The President's budget request for FY2007 includes proposals for a $250 enrollment fee for Priority 7 and 8 veterans based on income thresholds. Priority Group 7 veterans have incomes above $26,902 and below the HUD geographic means test level, while Priority Group 8 veterans have incomes above $26,902 and above the HUD test amount. The HUD test is set at a local level, like county or city, determining the veteran's priority group placement. In FY2007, the President proposed a $250 enrollment fee for Priority 7 and 8 veterans based on income thresholds. Congress did not approve this fee despite the wide variation in annual incomes of veterans in these groups. The House Veterans Affairs Committee did not support the enrollment fee, citing concerns about veterans assuming a greater share of healthcare costs in the VA system. The Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee does not support legislative proposals for veterans to assume a greater share of healthcare costs in the VA system. The Administration's proposal includes increasing pharmacy copayments for Priority Group 7 and 8 veterans from $8 to $15 for nonservice-connected conditions. The Administration proposed increasing pharmacy copayments for Priority Group 7 and 8 veterans from $8 to $15 for nonservice-connected conditions, but did not receive approval from Congress. Veterans in Priority Groups 2-8 currently pay $8 for a 30-day supply of medication. The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act of 1999 authorized VA to increase medication copayment amounts and establish annual caps to prevent financial hardship for veterans enrolled in Priority Groups 2-6. The Veterans Health Administration increased medication co-payments to $8 for a 30-day supply starting January 1, 2006, with an annual cap of $960 for veterans in Priority Groups 2-6. Veterans in Priority Groups 7 and 8 have no cap. The proposed increase in pharmacy co-payments for Priority Groups 7 and 8 veterans from $8 to $15 was not approved by Congress. VA estimates that the changes would generate revenue and savings, resulting in a decrease in appropriations for FY2007. Two recent studies suggest that veterans may be impacted by increased pharmaceutical copayments, leading to cost-related adherence problems and medication cost pressures. VA patients had lower rates of adherence problems compared to Medicare or uninsured patients, and were less likely to report detrimental consequences of medication cost pressures. Another study found that medication cost could be prohibitive for veterans with copayment obligations, potentially affecting their use of antidepressant medication. The Administration is requesting Congress to amend VA's statutory authority by eliminating the practice of reducing copayment debts with third-party health insurance collections. This proposal aims to align VA with the DOD health care system for military retirees and the private sector. Congress authorized VA to collect payments from third-party health insurers for veterans with nonservice-connected disabilities in 1986, establishing copayments for this care. VA is currently authorized to collect from third-party health insurers to offset the cost of medical care for veterans with nonservice-connected conditions. The VA is proposing to stop reducing copayment debts with third-party health insurance collections for veterans with nonservice-connected disabilities. Currently, VA bills insurance providers for medical care and places veterans' copayment obligations on hold for 90 days. If no payment is received within 90 days, the veteran is billed for the full copayment amount. If insurers reimburse VA after the 90-day period, VA incurs additional costs for processing refunds. The VA is proposing to change its policy on copayment debts for veterans with nonservice-connected disabilities. Currently, VA bills insurance providers for medical care and delays veterans' copayment obligations for 90 days. If insurers reimburse VA after this period, VA incurs additional costs for processing refunds. The Government Accountability Office reports that using third-party insurance collections to satisfy copayment debt has led to reduced cost recoveries and increased administrative expenses. Under the new proposal, VA would bill and collect copayments from patients regardless of any amounts recovered from their private health insurance plan. The VA is proposing to change its policy on copayment debts for veterans with nonservice-connected disabilities. Currently, VA bills insurance providers for medical care and delays veterans' copayment obligations for 90 days. Under the new proposal, VA would bill and collect copayments from patients regardless of any amounts recovered from their private health insurance plan, contributing approximately $31.0 million toward VA's collections."
