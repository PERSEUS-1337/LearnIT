    "content": "DISALLOWANCE OF DEDUCTION FOR CERTAIN OIL CLEANUP COSTS. This section adds a new rule to the Internal Revenue Code disallowing certain oil cleanup costs as deductible expenses. No deduction allowed for most discharge costs, with exceptions for small spills under 36,000 gallons and facilities with completed cleanup certified by EPA. The taxpayer must have completed cleanup and terminated all operations involving oil at the facility to be exempt from liability for oil discharge costs. The term 'applicable discharge costs' refers to costs related to oil discharge, including removal, prevention, mitigation, liabilities for damages, fines, penalties, and cost assessment. The text discusses the definition of 'oil discharge' and the inclusion of compensation received for costs where deductions are disallowed. It also mentions the prohibition against offsetting deductions with net operating loss. The deduction allowed under this section cannot reduce taxable income below the amount disallowed under section 280I. Adjustments will be made to subsection (b)(2) to accommodate this limitation. The amendments in section 280I disallow certain oil cleanup costs, effective for costs paid after the enactment of the Act. Section 198 allows for expense treatment for expenditures to reduce the risk of oil spills. The taxpayer can deduct qualified oil facility expenditures as expenses not chargeable to capital account. These expenditures are for reducing the risk of oil discharge and must be certified by the EPA. The taxpayer can deduct qualified oil facility expenditures for reducing the risk of oil discharge, as long as they are certified by the EPA. Definitions for \"discharge\" and \"oil\" are provided in relevant acts. Expenditures to reduce risks of oil spills are subject to amendments that apply to expenses incurred after the enactment of this Act."
