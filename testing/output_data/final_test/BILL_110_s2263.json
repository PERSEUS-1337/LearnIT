    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Mine Communications Technology Innovation Act\". Congress acknowledges the challenges in integrating tracking and communications systems in mines, especially underground ones, due to technical limitations such as radio signal absorption by coal. This severely limits the availability of communication equipment for miners in emergencies. Communication equipment in mines is limited, requiring the development and integration of multiple systems. Technology needed for mine safety is lacking due to industry challenges and slow approval processes. Accelerated research is necessary for the quick integration of next-generation technology to protect miners. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is well-positioned to accelerate the development of mining tracking and communications technology, including consensus mining communications standards. They have a history of working with industry to invest in high-risk research with national benefits and building partnerships to drive next-generation technology. The National Institute of Standards and Technology collaborates with various stakeholders to develop standards and technologies for interoperable wireless telecommunications and information systems, including mine communications systems. The Mine Communications and Tracking Research and Development Program Authorization is outlined in Section 3. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will establish a program for research, development, and demonstration of best practices and technology for mine communications and tracking systems. Coordination with Federal agencies and industry will focus on areas promising for miner safety, with optional emphasis on systems for emergency situations and coal mines, especially deep underground ones. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will establish a program for research, development, and demonstration of mine communication and tracking systems. This includes systems for deep underground coal mines, with coverage in all areas, hybrid wireless and infrastructure systems, 2-way voice communication, emergency and routine communication, integration with existing systems, and validation tests for performance standards. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will work with industry and Federal agencies to develop industry standards for underground mine communications, addressing frequency bands, interoperability, and interference prevention. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology for fiscal years 2009 and 2010, derived from amounts authorized under the America COMPETES Act."
