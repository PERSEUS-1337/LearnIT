    "content": "The Act titled \"Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2016\" increases rates of disability compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation. Effective December 1, 2016, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will increase dollar amounts for disability compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation. This includes adjustments for wartime disability compensation, additional compensation for dependents, clothing allowance, and dependency and indemnity compensation to surviving spouses. The dollar amounts for disability compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation will be increased by the same percentage as Social Security benefits effective December 1, 2016, with rounding to the next lower whole dollar amount. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may adjust disability compensation rates for certain individuals, and the adjusted rates will be published in the Federal Register. Transportation of deceased veterans to veterans' cemeteries is addressed in Section 3. The Secretary may pay for transportation of deceased veterans for burial in national cemeteries, with costs not exceeding transportation to the nearest cemetery with available burial space. The term 'covered veterans' cemetery' is defined as a veterans' cemetery where a deceased veteran can be buried, owned by a State or tribal organization. Amendments are made to Section 2308 of the title to include this definition and make necessary changes to the section heading and table of sections. Expansion of eligibility for headstones, markers, and medallions for Medal of Honor recipients. Section 2306(d) of title 38, United States Code is amended to provide headstones, markers, or medallions signifying Medal of Honor recipient status for deceased individuals upon request. If a headstone, marker, or medallion was previously provided without this designation, it will be replaced upon request. Deceased individuals who served in the Armed Forces on or after April 6, 1917, are eligible for a headstone, marker, or medallion if they were awarded the Medal of Honor, even posthumously. SEC. 5 expands the Presidential Memorial Certificate Program to include individuals eligible for burial in a national cemetery under specific conditions. SEC. 6 addresses burial plots at Arlington National Cemetery for individuals awarded the Medal of Honor. The Secretary of the Army reserves 100 in-ground burial plots at Arlington National Cemetery for deceased Medal of Honor recipients. This reservation will end once a report on the cemetery's capacity is submitted to Congress, including recommendations for future actions. The Secretary of the Army is considering actions to prevent reaching maximum capacity at Arlington National Cemetery, such as redefining eligibility criteria and exploring expansion opportunities beyond current boundaries. SEC. 7. PILOT PROGRAM ON DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS VETERAN ENGAGEMENT TEAM EVENTS. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will conduct a three-year pilot program called \"Veteran Engagement Team events\" starting from October 1, 2016. These events will be held at least once a month in 10 regional offices to engage with veterans. During the pilot program, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will hold Veteran Engagement Team events at least once a month in 15 regional offices to assist veterans with disability compensation and pension claims. Events will occur during normal business hours. The Veteran Engagement Team events are held monthly at 15 regional offices, with events occurring at different locations at least 50 miles from any regional office. A sufficient number of personnel are available to assist with claims, including physicians and veteran service representatives. Veterans service organizations have access to provide assistance, and veterans unable to complete claims at events are informed of next steps. The Secretary coordinates with veteran organizations and agencies to select community-based locations for Veteran Engagement Team events. Physicians cannot be permanently transferred for event staffing, and salaries for work at events are paid from available funds. The Secretary may coordinate with various entities to host Veteran Engagement Team events at minimal costs and accept services from non-Department physicians without compensation for medical opinions. Additionally, customer satisfaction surveys will be conducted as part of the pilot program. The Secretary will collect and analyze information on customer satisfaction of veterans who received assistance at Veteran Engagement Team events. Reports on the program's implementation and effectiveness, including completed claims, reasons for incomplete claims, and customer satisfaction analysis, must be submitted to Congress annually. The Secretary will collect and analyze information on customer satisfaction of veterans who received assistance at Veteran Engagement Team events, including information collected under subsection (e)."
