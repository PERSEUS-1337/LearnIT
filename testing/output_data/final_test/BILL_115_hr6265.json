Exemptions allow expedited screening for injured or disabled military members and veterans, as outlined in title 49, United States Code. SEC. 3. RISK MODIFIED SCREENING. The Transportation Security Administration will start a pilot program within 60 days of this Act to implement a risk modified screening protocol for lanes other than TSA PreCheck. The program will segment passengers based on risk and conclude within 120 days. A report on the program's findings will be submitted to relevant committees within 30 days of its conclusion. The Transportation Security Administration will implement a risk modified screening protocol for low-risk passengers at checkpoints, considering factors like airport risk level, space availability, and passenger throughput. The program will be evaluated for effectiveness before potential deployment at more checkpoints. The Transportation Security Administration will establish a working group to inform the piloting and development of plans for deploying a risk modified screening protocol for low-risk passengers at checkpoints. The Transportation Security Administration will establish a working group to develop a risk modified screening protocol for low-risk passengers at checkpoints, ensuring maximum security effectiveness and efficiency. The Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to this working group. SEC. 4. CONGRESSIONAL REPORTS. The Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration will provide quarterly briefings to specific congressional committees on the implementation of a trusted traveler program for TSA PreCheck security screening lanes. Upon certifying that only trusted travelers can use these lanes, a written certification will be submitted to the committees. The briefings on the trusted traveler program for TSA PreCheck lanes will end when a written certification is submitted confirming only trusted travelers can use the lanes. After the TSA Administrator certifies that only trusted travelers can use PreCheck lanes, the Inspector General will assess for violations of security measures in the following years. Additionally, there will be an expansion of the PreCheck program. The TSA Administrator will develop a long-term strategy to increase enrollment in the TSA PreCheck Program and expand trusted traveler programs. This includes partnering with air carriers and incorporating promotion opportunities in the reservation process. The TSA aims to expand the PreCheck Program by including individuals with specific security clearances or law enforcement backgrounds, offering mobile enrollment for identity verification, and minimizing travel to enrollment centers. The TSA is expanding the PreCheck Program by increasing enrollment centers, collocating with passport and security ID facilities, and enhancing enrollment platforms like kiosks and laptops. The TSA is exploring ways to incentivize enrollment in the PreCheck Program for children aged 12-18, families of five or more, private sector entities with enrollment centers, and businesses reimbursing employees for application costs. They are also considering combining the PreCheck Program with other trusted traveler programs. The House of Representatives passed the document on September 4, 2018, with Karen L. Haas as the Clerk."
