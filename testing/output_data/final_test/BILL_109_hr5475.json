    "content": "The Act titled \"HSA Accessibility and Portability Act of 2006\" promotes accessibility and affordability of coverage in the small group market. Section 2711 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to allow health insurance issuers to elect an alternative to the guaranteed issue requirement for small employers. The amendment allows health insurance issuers to choose an alternative to guaranteed issue for small employers, ensuring continuation of coverage for eligible individuals. The health insurance issuer must provide continuation of coverage to individuals and dependents after they no longer qualify as eligible individuals, at a rate not exceeding 150 percent of the standard individual rate in the state. The issuer must also provide information to the Secretary to monitor the impact of the election on access to and affordability of health insurance coverage in the small group and individual markets. The text chunk discusses the requirements for small employers denied health insurance coverage and the rates charged for coverage under a specific subsection. An election can only be made for coverage consisting of a high deductible health plan and a contribution to a health savings account. A report must be submitted at least 6 months before the end of the 5-year period. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress on the impact of the subsection on health insurance coverage in the small group and individual markets. Recommendations on extending or expanding the subsection must be included. The subsection will not apply to small employers' elections made after the 5-year period described in the report. The Secretary must report to Congress on the impact of the subsection on health insurance coverage in small group and individual markets. If the Secretary recommends not extending the subsection, it will still apply to elections made before the end of the 5-year period."
