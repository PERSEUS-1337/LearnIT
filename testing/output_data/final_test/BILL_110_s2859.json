    "content": "The Act is titled \"Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act Amendments of 2008\". Congress finds that confusion and restrictive interpretations of privacy laws hinder the transfer of information that could prevent tragedies like the Virginia Tech shootings. The purpose of the Act is to clarify federal education privacy law and allow for information sharing between on-campus and off-campus healthcare providers. The Virginia Tech Review Panel recommended clarifying how FERPA applies to medical records for treatment purposes and suggested amending federal privacy laws to include \"safe harbor\" provisions. The Commission recommended provisions to protect individuals from losing Federal education funding for making necessary disclosures to protect health or safety. They also suggested amending FERPA to allow educational institutions to disclose information in emergencies and facilitate off-campus student treatment. Research shows that mental disorders often start in youth, with half of cases beginning by age 14 and three quarters by age 24. In 2004, CDC reported 4,316 suicides among young adults aged 15-24, the third leading cause of death in this age group. An additional 5,074 suicides were reported among those aged 25-34, the second leading cause of death in this age group. Depression, mental illness, and suicide are prevalent on college campuses, with 44% of students feeling too depressed to function and 9% seriously considering suicide in 2006. Delays in getting treatment for mental disorders were found to be pervasive and lengthy. In 2006, a survey found that 60% of individuals with mental disorders received no treatment, with delays in treatment lasting nearly a decade. Additionally, campus shootings at Virginia Tech and Northern Illinois universities have brought attention to the issue of mental illness and violence in schools, with the Virginia Tech shooting resulting in 32 deaths, the deadliest school shooting in US history.
