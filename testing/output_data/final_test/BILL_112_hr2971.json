    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lincoln Legacy Infrastructure Development Act\". Congress finds that the current funding needs for transportation infrastructure are estimated to be $225-340 billion per year through 2055, while actual spending is significantly lower. Additionally, a large number of bridges in the US are considered structurally deficient, and there are funding discrepancies in the Highway Trust Fund. Congress has also transferred a significant amount of general revenue to address these issues. Congress transferred $34.5 billion in general revenue to the Highway Trust Fund from 2008 to 2010 to maintain solvency. However, projections show that outlays from 2011 to 2021 will exceed revenues by $120 billion. The Congressional Budget Office predicts the Fund will face challenges in 2012, while the US Chamber of Commerce warns of potential $336 billion in lost growth due to transportation network deterioration. Private-public partnerships are seen as crucial in addressing these issues. Private-public partnerships are crucial for addressing transportation infrastructure shortfalls. Infrastructure experts estimate over $400 billion available for private-sector investment. 29 States and 1 United States territory have laws enabling these partnerships. State and local governments can use innovative financing methods for all infrastructure modes. SEC. 3. FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS. Section 111(b) of title 23, United States Code is amended to address vending machines and blind vending facilities. The Secretary is prohibited from imposing surcharges on blind vending facilities, and licensed blind vendors are given priority without limitations under the Lincoln Legacy Infrastructure Development Act. In section 129(a)(3) of title 23, United States Code, federal funds can now be used for toll roads, bridges, tunnels, and ferries for highway or transit transportation projects. Section 166(a) is amended to require at least 2 occupants per vehicle for HOV facilities. In cases of degraded HOV facilities or slow traffic speeds, states must require a minimum of 3 occupants per vehicle for HOV facility use. Additionally, a value pricing pilot program under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 is amended to include more states. The text chunk discusses amendments to various transportation programs, including increasing the number of occupants required for HOV facility use and changing the time frame for the Express Lanes Demonstration Program. Amendments to transportation programs include changes to HOV facility occupancy requirements and the Express Lanes Demonstration Program timeframe. 1604(c) of the SAFETEA-LU is amended by redesignating paragraphs and updating references to the Lincoln Legacy Infrastructure Development Act. SEC. 4. INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE. Section 603(b) of title 23, United States Code, is amended to remove and redesignate paragraphs for secured loans and lines of credit. Section 608(a) is also amended to increase funding for fiscal years 2012 through 2017. Section 603(b) of title 23, United States Code, is amended to remove and redesignate paragraphs for secured loans and lines of credit. Funding for fiscal years 2012 through 2017 is increased to $7,500,000. SEC. 5. Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program. In the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program, eligible activities are expanded to include projects benefiting high-speed rail and development phase activities such as planning, feasibility analysis, and environmental review. Credit risk requirements are also adjusted for making findings under subsection (g)(4). The Secretary, through the Administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, will consider the net present value of anticipated revenues as collateral for the applicant's project. The Administrator will submit biannual reports to Congress on the number of pending and issued loans under section 822 of title 45, as well as the processing time for each loan. SEC. 6. PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. In this section, key definitions include the Administrator of the Federal Transit Administration, covered HOT lane facility, eligible project, eligible recipient, and experimental program. The Administrator will establish a 6-year public-private partnership experimental program to attract private investment in covered projects and increase project management flexibility and innovation. The term \"fixed guideway miles\" includes various measurements related to fixed guideway transportation. The experimental program aims to identify and address provisions that impede public-private partnerships and private investment in covered projects. It will develop procedures similar to SEP-15 to protect the public interest. The experimental program aims to identify and address provisions that impede public-private partnerships and private investment in covered projects. The Administrator must submit a report to Congress every 2 years on the program's status and issue rules within 180 days of enactment. The program must not waive any requirements under specific laws. For funding apportionment under sections 5307 and 5309 of title 49, the Administrator deems covered HOT lane facility miles as fixed guideway miles. The Secretary cannot reduce funding for urbanized areas below the amount apportioned in fiscal year 2011 under section 5307 or 5309 for subsequent years. For fiscal year 2011, a reduction in funding is allowed if it is due to a specific requirement. Funds from the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund will be available for fiscal year 2012 and beyond to implement this provision. SEC. 7 amends the Internal Revenue Code to remove the cap on exempt facility bonds for highway or freight transfer facilities. SEC. 8 reduces annual adjustments to pay schedules for federal employees. SEC. 9 addresses funding. SEC. 9 of the Act directs Federal funds saved from 2013 to 2021 to be deposited into the Highway Trust Fund for Act implementation and any amendments, with the remaining funds allocated for deficit reduction."
