    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Consortia-Led Energy and Advanced Manufacturing Networks Act\" and includes definitions for clarity. Clean technology refers to technologies that produce energy from renewable sources, improve energy transmission and storage efficiency, enhance energy efficiency for buildings and industry, and enable the development of a Smart Grid integrating renewable energy sources. The curr_chunk discusses advanced manufacturing in the context of clean technology, focusing on the integration of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency applications, transportation efficiency, water security, and challenges in manufacturing related to technology advancements. Advanced manufacturing involves activities that rely on information, automation, computation, software, sensing, and networking, as well as cutting-edge materials and emerging capabilities from physical or biological sciences. It includes new ways to manufacture existing products and the production of new products from advanced technologies. The curr_chunk discusses entities involved in clean technology and advanced manufacturing, defining terms like consortium, project, and qualifying entity. It highlights the importance of geographic proximity for collaboration and resource sharing. The curr_chunk defines terms like Secretary, translational research, and qualifying entities involved in clean technology and advanced manufacturing. The curr_chunk establishes the Clean Technology Consortia Program. The Secretary will establish clean technology consortia to promote domestic development, manufacture, and deployment of state-of-the-art technologies. This program will leverage expertise and resources from various sectors to support collaborative research, development, and commercial application of clean technologies. The Secretary will oversee the program for clean technology consortia, selecting grant recipients through a competitive process and coordinating innovation activities with other agencies, industry, and higher education institutions. The clean technology consortia will bring together representatives from various sectors to share research, program plans, and collaboration opportunities. The consortia will promote innovative clean technologies, expand manufacturing capabilities, and create jobs through new companies and commercialization. The clean technology consortia aim to promote clean technologies, support companies investing in new products and processes, address challenges, empower small- and medium-sized enterprises, accelerate clean technology deployment through partnerships, and encourage collaboration among clean technology enterprises. The clean technology consortia aim to establish clean technology and advanced manufacturing enterprises, demonstrating a successful model for commercialization of clean technologies. The clean technology consortia aim to establish clean technology and advanced manufacturing enterprises, demonstrating a successful model for commercialization of clean technologies. SEC. 4. APPLICATIONS. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, a consortium must consist of research universities with clean technology research budgets and other qualifying entities with expertise in translational research. The consortium members must have a binding agreement outlining the partnership structure. The consortium must have a partnership agreement, governance structure, conflicts-of-interest policy, accounting structure, and an external advisory committee in place to receive funding from non-Federal sources. The consortium must have a partnership agreement, governance structure, conflicts-of-interest policy, accounting structure, and an external advisory committee in place to receive funding from non-Federal sources. The Secretary may disqualify an application if the conflicts-of-interest policy is inadequate. The consortium must have an external advisory committee consisting of members with relevant expertise to review and ensure projects meet conflicts-of-interest policies. The committee includes representatives of the consortium and industry, as determined necessary. The Secretary also joins the committee. The Secretary is required to be a member of the external advisory committee of a consortium receiving a grant under this Act. \"SEC. 5. GRANTS.\" The Secretary will award grants to consortia on a competitive basis for up to 5 years, with a possible extension of 5 additional years. The grant amount shall not exceed $30,000,000 per fiscal year or the collective contributions of non-Federal entities to the consortium. The Secretary will consider the translational research capacity of the consortium when determining the grant amount. The consortium's translational research capacity, resources, and cluster affiliation are considered for grant awards. Consortia can request grant amount increases with extensions. Grants must be used for clean technology research, development, innovation, and commercialization activities. Under this Act, a consortium must develop and share proposed plans, project criteria, and terms on the Department of Commerce's website. They must also establish policies to prevent displacement of private sector investment and allow private entities investing in clean technologies to participate in award reviews. The consortium oversees project solicitations, reviews proposals, selects projects for awards, and monitors project implementation. Administrative expenses are limited to 10% of the awarded amounts, and the consortium cannot use funds for prohibited purposes. The consortium receiving grants under this Act is prohibited from using the funds to construct new buildings or facilities. They are required to conduct annual audits to ensure compliance with the Act, submit audit reports to the Secretary and the Comptroller General, and allow full access to records for review by the Comptroller General. The Secretary has the authority to review and revoke grants if a consortium misuses funds. $100,000,000 is authorized for the Secretary to carry out this section. Congress must receive an annual report with audit copies and Secretary's recommendations."
