    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Social Security Caregiver Credit Act of 2017\". Congress finds that caregiving is essential for family life, providing vital services for children, the ill, disabled, and elderly. Establishing a caregiver credit would improve economic prospects for unpaid caregivers and ensure retirement security. Policy options should be considered to extend OASDI solvency, such as eradicating the gender wage gap or increasing the minimum wage. Sense of the Senate: Congress should address the exclusion of home care providers not eligible for Social Security or Medicare due to caring for a family member with a disability at the state and local level. SEC. 3. Deemed wages for caregivers of dependent relatives added to Title II of the Social Security Act. Sec. 235 defines a \"qualifying month\" as a month where an individual provided care to a dependent relative for at least 80 hours without pay, excluding months after retirement age. The individual can provide care to a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, parent, grandparent, sibling, aunt, or uncle who is under the age of 12 without pay. A chronically dependent individual relies on daily assistance for activities of daily living and instrumental activities. Activities of daily living include basic personal tasks like eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, and transferring. Instrumental activities of daily living involve tasks related to living independently, such as meal planning, managing finances, shopping, household chores, and communication. The caregiver's deemed wages are considered for benefit entitlement based on activities like communication and community participation. The caregiver's deemed wages are considered for benefit entitlement based on activities like communication and community participation. Qualifying months for an individual are determined based on wages or self-employment income, with only the last 60 months taken into account. The rules and regulations specify exceptions for larger benefit payments. The Commissioner of Social Security will establish regulations within a year to prevent fraud and abuse regarding benefits. An individual must apply for benefits under this section to be considered for a qualifying month. The Commissioner may require documentation from a physician to verify the status of a dependent relative for every qualifying month. The individual must certify that their application information has not changed after 12 qualifying months. Section 209(k)(1) of the Act is amended to include additional references. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can provide grants to States for medical training programs for caregivers of dependent relatives without pay. Authorization of appropriations is available for this purpose."
