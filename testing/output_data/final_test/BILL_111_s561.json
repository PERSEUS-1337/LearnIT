    "content": "The \"Federal Land Assistance, Management and Enhancement Act\" or \"FLAME Act\" includes provisions for a Flame Fund for catastrophic emergency wildland fire suppression activities, a cohesive wildland fire management strategy, a review of certain wildfires for cost containment evaluation, and measures to reduce the risk of wildfires in fire-ready communities. The Flame Fund, established by the FLAME Act, is for catastrophic emergency wildland fire suppression on Federal land, including public lands, National Park System units, National Wildlife Refuge System refuges, lands held in trust for Indian tribes, and National Forest System lands. The Flame Fund, established by the FLAME Act, is for catastrophic emergency wildland fire suppression on Federal land. The Land Assistance, Management, and Enhancement Fund is established by this section, with the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture acting jointly. The Flame Fund consists of appropriated and transferred amounts for catastrophic emergency wildland fire suppression. It is available to pay for separate fire suppression costs beyond the annual workload predictions based on historical and anticipated workloads. Authorization of Appropriations for the Flame Fund is necessary to cover emergency wildland fire suppression activities. Congress intends to appropriate an amount not less than the average spent over the previous five fiscal years. The appropriations should be designated as emergency requirements to meet urgent needs. The Flame Fund requires authorization of appropriations for emergency wildland fire suppression activities. The Secretaries must notify congressional committees when only two months of funding remains in the fund. Excess amounts for wildland fire suppression activities are transferred to the Flame Fund at the end of each fiscal year. Amounts in the Flame Fund require a declaration for use. The Flame Fund requires a declaration from the Secretaries for wildland fire suppression activities based on specific criteria like fire size, severity, and threat level. The Flame Fund allows for the transfer of funds to the Secretary concerned for wildland fire suppression activities during a declared suppression emergency, including on state, private, and tribal land. The Flame Fund provides funding for wildland fire suppression activities on State, private, and tribal land during emergencies. The Secretary concerned must use the additional funding to supplement the agency budget and is prohibited from transferring funds elsewhere until all Flame Fund and appropriated funds are obligated. The Secretaries must establish an accounting and reporting system for the Flame Fund and submit an annual report on fund usage to relevant committees for review. The Secretaries must provide recommendations to improve administrative control and oversight of the Flame Fund. They are required to submit periodic estimates of wildfire suppression costs for the current and following fiscal years to specified committees. The methodology for developing these estimates must undergo periodic peer review. The Secretaries must submit estimates of anticipated wildfire suppression costs periodically using the best available data, during specific weeks throughout the year. The Secretaries must submit estimates of anticipated wildfire suppression costs periodically using the best available data, models, and other analytic tools. The Secretaries must submit estimates of anticipated wildfire suppression costs periodically using the best available data, models, and other analytic tools. A cohesive wildland fire management strategy is outlined in Section 3. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture must submit a report to Congress within one year with a cohesive wildland fire management strategy, addressing cost-effective resource allocation, reinvestment in non-fire programs, and appropriate management response. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture must submit a report to Congress within one year with a cohesive wildland fire management strategy, including a system for assessing community risk levels and prioritizing funding for fuels reduction projects. SEC. 4 requires a review of wildfires incurring expenses over $10,000,000, with reports to specific Congressional committees. SEC. 5 focuses on reducing wildfire risk in fire-ready communities. A fire-ready community is defined as a community located in a priority area with a cooperative fire agreement, local codes for fire-resistant home design, a community wildfire protection plan, and engaged in a collaborative process. The resource advisory committee established under the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 will develop regional maps of communities at risk of wildfire and in need of hazardous fuel treatment. This includes identifying at-risk communities in fire-prone areas, watersheds, municipal drinking water sources, and emergency evacuation corridors. Local Wildland Firefighting Capability Grants are available for fire-ready communities to assist with education programs, training for firefighters, and equipment acquisition for wildland fire preparedness. Implementation of a community wildfire protection plan includes encouraging State and local communities to become fire-ready communities. Authorization of appropriations is available for the Secretaries to carry out this section."
