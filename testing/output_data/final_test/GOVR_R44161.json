    "content": "Section 707 of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 grants the Secretary of Veterans Affairs the authority to remove individuals in senior executive positions for performance or misconduct. This includes those in the Senior Executive Service (SES) or departmental SES equivalents. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 allows the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to remove senior executives for performance or misconduct. Appeals can be made to the Merit Systems Protection Board within seven days. The Board must expedite the appeal and issue a decision within 21 days. If not possible, the Secretary's decision stands. The MSPB cannot suspend any removal or transfer to a GS position. Senior executives transferred to a GS position must report for duty to receive the annual pay rate. During an appeal of removal, they cannot receive any pay or benefits until a final decision is made by an MSPB administrative judge. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has the authority to transfer career SES members to GS positions or remove them from federal service, in addition to other authorities provided by law. Section 713 provides the Secretary of Veterans Affairs with authority to remove career members of the SES from federal service. This includes specific procedures such as advance notice, the right to respond, representation, and a written decision. Appeals can be made to the Merit Systems Protection Board. The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) can review agency decisions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a77703. Section 713(b)(2) exempts expedited removal procedures from certain regulations. Career senior executives cannot be involuntarily removed from the SES within 120 days of a new agency head or supervisor appointment. P.L. 113-146 directs the MSPB to issue regulations within 14 days. The Board published interim regulations on August 19, 2014. The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) issued interim regulations on August 19, 2014, in response to P.L. 113-146. The regulations address practices and procedures for senior executive removal, including the Secretary of Veterans Affairs' authority to initiate adverse actions. MSPB's regulations allow administrative judges to uphold or reject removal decisions based on reasonableness, without the ability to mitigate them. Section 707(c) of P.L. 113-146 waives time limitations on removing career senior executives. Section 3592(b) prohibits removing a career senior executive within 120 days after the appointment of an agency head or the career appointee's immediate supervisor if that supervisor is a noncareer SES appointee. Section 707(d) of P.L. 113-146 clarifies that certain personnel actions are not affected by this law. The authority provided in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7713 is in addition to authority provided by 5 U.S.C. \u00a73592 and U.S. Code Title 5 Chapter 75. The Fifth Amendment raises a constitutional question regarding the removal of a Senior Executive Service member from federal service. Supreme Court cases have addressed whether government employees have a constitutionally protected property interest in their employment and what due process is required in cases of removal. In cases like Board of Regents v. Roth and Arnett v. Kennedy, the Supreme Court has discussed the property interests of public employees in their continued employment and the due process required in adverse action proceedings. The Supreme Court upheld Kennedy's removal from federal service in the Lloyd-La Follette Act, despite his argument that it deprived him of a property right to continued employment protected by the Due Process Clause. Kennedy accused his supervisor of bribery in exchange for signing a statement against Kennedy, leading to his removal. The district court concluded that Kennedy, a nonprobationary employee, should have been granted a hearing before being removed from federal service to comply with the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court justices agreed that Kennedy had a property right in continued employment. The Court focused on whether a hearing before or after removal provided adequate due process. The Supreme Court concluded that a hearing after removal sufficed to provide due process under the Clause. The plurality opinion held that a litigant must accept limitations on procedures when granted a substantive right. The Supreme Court ruled that federal employees were not entitled to a full evidentiary hearing for cause determination, as it would go against legislative authority. The property interest in employment was subject to procedural limitations, allowing the government to handle claims as proposed. The Supreme Court's ruling on federal employees' property interest in employment allows the government to handle claims as proposed, linking legislative procedures to the right to hold a position. Justice Powell concurred but disagreed with the reasoning, stating that procedural due process only provides protections expressly provided in statute. The Supreme Court ruling on federal employees' property interest in employment determines the extent of procedural protections based on statute. Justice White emphasized that once the state defines property rights, due process is defined by the Constitution. Justice White emphasized that due process is defined by the Constitution, with six members of the Court in agreement on this fundamental proposition. The Court rejected the \"bitter with the sweet\" approach, clarifying that the Due Process Clause protects substantive rights like life, liberty, and property through constitutionally adequate procedures. Property, life, and liberty cannot be defined by the procedures for their deprivation, ensuring that due process is not reduced to a mere tautology. The right to due process is guaranteed by the Constitution, not by legislative grace. Justice Powell's formulation in Loudermill may seem different from the \"bitter with the sweet\" approach, but they can overlap. Providing procedural safeguards is essential once a property interest in public employment is conferred. The Court in Loudermill balanced interests in retaining employment, government's interest in removing unsatisfactory employees, and risk of erroneous termination. Due process is flexible and requires procedural protections based on circumstances. In Loudermill, the Court ruled that a tenured public employee is entitled to notice of charges, explanation of evidence, and a chance to present their side before termination. Due process requires these procedures before removal, without being elaborate, as long as an evidentiary hearing is provided within a reasonable time after removal. Section 713 of Title 38, as added by Section 707 of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, does not expressly provide for notice and an opportunity to respond before termination. This lack of procedures may seem to contradict the Due Process rights outlined in previous cases like Loudermill and Gilbert v. Homar. The Department of Veterans Affairs has issued guidelines mandating notice and an opportunity to respond before removing a senior executive from federal service, in line with the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. This right is constitutionally protected for career federal employees, as stated in Title 38. An individual facing removal or transfer from federal service under Title 38 can appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board within seven days. The appeal is assigned to an administrative judge who must make a final decision within 21 days. If the judge cannot issue a decision in that time frame, the Secretary's decision stands. These post-removal procedures align with due process requirements outlined in the Loudermill case and Gilbert. The focus now is on whether these procedures would be deemed \"meaningful\" in a court's evaluation of a due process challenge to Section 713 of Title 38. In the Manzo case cited in Loudermill, a post-termination hearing must be provided at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. The time limits in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7713 differ from those in adverse action procedures for career members of the Senior Executive Service in 5 U.S.C. \u00a77543(b). This subsection outlines advance notice, time to respond, representation by an attorney, and a written decision with specific reasons. In Helman v. Department of Veterans Affairs, two senior executives appealed their removal from federal service, claiming a lack of due process. The former Director of the Phoenix VA Health Care System argued that she was not given proper notice or opportunity to respond before her removal. She also claimed that the post-removal proceeding was too brief to adequately defend herself. The administrative judge rejected these due process arguments. The judge rejected pre-removal due process arguments and ruled that the Board lacks authority to declare 38 U.S.C. \u00a7713 unconstitutional. In Talton v. Department of Veterans Affairs, a former Director challenged the Department for not considering his reply to the removal notice and argued against the delegation of removal authority. Another senior executive, the former Director of the New York Stratton Veterans Administration Medical Center, was removed under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7713 and appealed on grounds other than due process denial. In Weiss v. Department of Veterans Affairs, a nursing assistant was removed for misconduct but the penalty of removal was reversed due to lack of reason. Two senior executives appealed their demotions after being transferred to lower paying positions. In Graves v. Department of Veterans Affairs, a former Director of the St. Paul Regional Office of the Veterans Benefits Administration appealed her demotion from the Senior Executive Service to a General Schedule position. She argued that the Department denied her due process by not fully considering her reply to the charges against her. The administrative judge rejected her due process claim but found the Department's penalty unreasonable. In Rubens v. Department of Veterans Affairs, the former Director of VBA's Philadelphia Regional Office contended that the Department denied her due process by not giving fair consideration to her reply and evidence. She was charged with facilitating a reassignment and assuming a vacated position, with the penalty being reversed as unreasonable. The penalty for the reassignment in the Graves and Rubens cases was reversed as unreasonable by administrative judges. They were reinstated in their former positions and awarded back pay. The Department upheld charges of impropriety but reversed the penalties. The Graves and Rubens cases involved charges of impropriety, with penalties reversed as unreasonable. An investigation was ordered to determine if other senior executives should face similar charges. The question of challenging the constitutionality of the Secretary's expedited authority is before the U.S. Court. The constitutionality of the Secretary's expedited removal authority is currently being questioned before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The former Director of the Phoenix VA Health Care System appealed her removal from federal service, citing constitutional arguments related to due process rights. The former Director of the Phoenix VA Health Care System challenged her removal from federal service, arguing that Section 713 violates the Appointments Clause, her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and due process rights. The expedited removal process limited her rights and allowed an administrative judge to make a final decision without oversight from presidentially appointed officials. The Department denied a motion to postpone the appeal, asserting that preclusion of judicial review is clear from the legislative history of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7713. The court lacks jurisdiction as Helman failed to present colorable constitutional claims and has no constitutionally protected interest in her employment. Helman argued that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has jurisdiction to review the decision of the MSPB administrative judge. The Federal Circuit has jurisdiction to review the decision of the MSPB administrative judge regarding Section 713 of Title 38. Helman argues that if Section 713 precludes all judicial review, it violates Article III of the Constitution. She maintains that the MSPB administrative judge lacked constitutional authority to preside over her removal hearing due to not being appointed in accordance with the Appointments Clause. The removal restrictions on administrative judges violated separation of powers principles. Helman argued that her removal contravened the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The finality language in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7713(e)(2) may preclude any judicial review beyond the decision by an administrative judge within 21 days. The intent to preclude Board review seems straightforward. The finality language in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7713(e)(2) may preclude any judicial review beyond the decision by an administrative judge within 21 days. The substitute does not allow for further appeal or a second level review by the three-person board at the MSPB. Congress may have the power to preclude judicial review, as stated in Article III of the Constitution. This includes the ability to limit the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction, but not its original jurisdiction. This was seen in the Reconstruction era case Ex parte McCardle. In Ex parte McCardle, the Court dismissed an appeal due to a provision repealing the act authorizing it. In Felker v. Turpin, the Court upheld a limitation on reviewing habeas corpus petitions. The finality language in Section 713 may preclude judicial review, but not original jurisdiction. Section 7703 of the Civil Service Reform Act allows judicial review of MSPB final orders by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. It also allows trials de novo in district courts for cases under antidiscrimination statutes. The phrase \"[n]otwithstanding any other law\" may waive other jurisdictional statutes. Some Supreme Court cases have examined whether statutory language can preclude judicial review effectively. The Director of Central Intelligence has the discretion to terminate employees in the interest of the United States, but this does not preclude judicial review of constitutional claims. Section 102(c) does not exclude review of constitutional claims according to the Court. In cases where Congress intends to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims, a clear intent must be shown. This requirement is to avoid the serious constitutional question that would arise if a federal statute denied any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim. In a specific case, an individual challenged a statute limiting veterans' educational benefits under the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment. The Court's decision on judicial review of Veterans Administration benefits is final and conclusive, but does not bar challenges to the constitutionality of statutes. This approach allows for collateral challenges to unconstitutional conditions imposed by Congress. In a related case involving Medicare provisions, the Court reaffirmed its stance on judicial review. The Court in Salfi case did not need to obtain jurisdiction under the federal question statute as another provision granted court jurisdiction only after administrative remedies were exhausted. The Court cited the Michigan Academy case, emphasizing the importance of providing a judicial forum for constitutional claims. This stance was supported by previous cases like Johnson, which declined to accept an interpretation that would deny any judicial review of a constitutional challenge to the applicable statute. The Court illustrated the doctrine of constitutional avoidance in Johnson by emphasizing the importance of finding a construction of the statute that avoids constitutional questions. This principle was also seen in cases like Webster and McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, where the Court allowed judicial review of agency procedures despite limitations on reviewing denials under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. In Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management, the Court held that decisions of the Office of Personnel Management on retirement matters are final and not subject to review, but jurisdiction remains for reviewing procedural rights or misconstrued legislation. Congress typically uses more unambiguous language to preclude judicial review. The Secretary of Labor's decision on work injury compensation is final and not subject to review. In Elgin v. Department of the Treasury, the Court addressed jurisdiction issues related to challenging the constitutionality of expedited removal authority. Elgin and other petitioners were removed from federal service for failing to register with the Selective Service. Section 3328 of U.S. Code Title 5 prohibits executive agency employment for those who knowingly fail to register. The individuals were removed from federal service for failing to register with the Selective Service, challenging their removal on constitutional grounds. They argued that the registration requirement violated the Fifth Amendment's equal protection clause and the prohibition against bills of attainder. The administrative judge dismissed their challenge, stating that the Board lacked jurisdiction to declare a federal statute unconstitutional. The Supreme Court ruled that a district court did not have jurisdiction to hear a case challenging the constitutionality of a statute because the petitioners could have sought judicial review before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The petitioners had been removed from federal service for failing to register with the Selective Service and argued that the registration requirement violated constitutional rights. The Supreme Court ruled that a district court does not have jurisdiction to hear a case challenging the constitutionality of a statute. The Civil Service Reform Act provides the exclusive avenue for judicial review in such cases. The petitioners argued that a statute does not preclude district court jurisdiction without explicit direction from Congress, citing the Webster case. However, the Court stated that a statute must deny any judicial forum to apply the heightened standard for review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331. The Supreme Court ruled that a statute must deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim to apply the heightened standard for review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331. Congress's intent must be \"fairly discernable\" for a statute that channels or postpones judicial review, while a statute purporting to preclude any judicial review requires a \"heightened showing\" of intent. The Court's reasoning in the Elgin case was influenced by its decision in United States v. Fausto. In United States v. Fausto, a nonpreference eligible employee in the excepted service filed suit for back pay under the Back Pay Act, but the Court of Claims did not have jurisdiction to hear his claim. The Court stated that the Civil Service Reform Act limited judicial review to competitive service employees and preference eligibles in the excepted service. Fausto highlighted Congress's intent to streamline administrative and judicial review processes. The Court in United States v. Fausto upheld Congress's decision not to grant nonpreference eligible excepted service employees administrative appeal rights and judicial review. The Civil Service Reform Act prioritized competitive service employees and excepted service preference eligibles, giving the Merit Systems Protection Board authority for administrative resolution and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for judicial review. This structure allowed for a unified executive branch position on personnel matters. The Federal Circuit's primacy in personnel matters avoids unnecessary judicial review in lower federal courts and promotes consistent judicial decisions. The finality clause in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7713(e)(2) waives judicial review of MSPB decisions but does not explicitly prohibit all judicial review. The Court in Johnson and Webster cases allowed judicial review of constitutional claims regarding limitations on veterans' benefits and CIA Director's authority, respectively, without a heightened showing of Congress's intent to preclude such review. The Elgin case narrowed the scope of the holding in Webster, stating that it applied to cases precluding judicial review. Without judicial review, a senior executive removed under Section 713 would have no opportunity to challenge removal as a deprivation of property rights without due process. The finality clause in Section 713(e)(2) would need to clearly show intent to preclude judicial review, possibly influenced by legislative history. The conferees accepted the Senate provision allowing the Merit Systems Protection Board to hear appeals from removed senior executives. The provision required expedited adjudication within 21 days, with no explicit sanction for delays. The finality clause stated decisions were not subject to further appeal. The conferees amended the Senate appeal provision by substituting an MSPB administrative judge for the Board itself and adding finality language to prevent further appeals. They also included a clause stating that if an administrative judge couldn't issue a decision within 21 days, the removal or transfer would be final. This strengthened the finality language in the Senate provision by waiving judicial review and making the Secretary's decision final. The conferees strengthened the finality language in the Senate provision by adding a clause stating that if an administrative judge couldn't issue a decision within 21 days, the removal or transfer would be final. H.R. 1994 and S. 1082, both related to the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability Act of 2015, have been introduced in Congress. Hearings have been held on these bills, and recommendations were made by senior advisors on July 28, 2015. On July 29, 2015, the House approved H.R. 1994 by a vote of 256 to 170, while no action has been taken on S. 1082. Senior advisors recommended that the President veto H.R. 1994 on July 28, 2015."
