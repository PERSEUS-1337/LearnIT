    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bandelier National Monument Administrative Improvement and Watershed Protection Act of 1998\". Bandelier National Monument was established in 1916 to preserve archeological resources. Over the years, boundaries and purposes have been adjusted to further preservation efforts. In 1932, land was transferred from Santa Fe National Forest, and in 1959, acres of Frijoles Mesa were also included. In 1959, 3,600 acres of Frijoles Mesa were transferred to the National Park Service from the Atomic Energy Committee. In 1963, 2,882 acres of Upper Canyon were added to preserve their scenic and geological features. In 1976, Congress included the headwaters of the Rito de los for flood and erosion prevention in Bandelier National Monument. In 1976, Congress expanded Bandelier National Monument to include the headwaters of the Rito de los Frijoles and the Canada de Cochiti Grant, totaling 7,310 acres. The Monument faces threats from flooding, erosion, and water quality issues due to mixed ownership of upper watersheds, particularly in Alamo Canyon. The purpose of this Act is to modify the Monument's boundary for acquisition and enhanced protection of lands in the upper watershed. SEC. 3. BOUNDARY MODIFICATION.\n\nThe boundaries of the Monument will be modified to include approximately 935 acres of land in the Upper Alamo watershed. SEC. 4. LAND ACQUISITION. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to acquire lands within the Monument area by donation, purchase, transfer, or exchange with consent of the owner. State and local lands can only be acquired by donation or exchange. The Secretary may acquire less than fee interests to protect the Monument from flooding and erosion. Administration details follow. The Secretary of the Interior, through the National Park Service Director, will manage the national Monument as per this Act and applicable laws. Appropriations are authorized as needed."
