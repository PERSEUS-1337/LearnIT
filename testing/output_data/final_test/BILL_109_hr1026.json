    "content": "The Act titled \"Cross-Border Cooperation in Northern Europe Act of 2005\" is established for the purpose of promoting cooperation in the region. Congress finds that Northern Europe is a vital part of Europe with opportunities for US investment. It offers a chance to implement a vision of a secure, prosperous, and stable Europe through regional cooperation, engagement with Russia, commitment from Nordic and Baltic states, and strong ties with the US. The United States established the Northern Europe Initiative in 1997 to promote cooperation in business, trade, law enforcement, environment, energy, civil society, and public health. The initiative has sponsored various regional projects, including a training program for entrepreneurs, environmental partnership, and a center for treatment. The Northern Europe Initiative, established in 1997 by the United States, includes projects such as a Center of Excellence for Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Riga, Latvia, a regional HIV/AIDS strategy, efforts to combat organized crime, programs for electricity market reform, language and job training for Russian-speaking minorities in Latvia and Estonia, and a mentoring partnership program for women entrepreneurs in northwest Russia. The United States established the Enhanced Partnership in Northern Europe (e-PINE) in 2003 to promote collaboration between Nordic and Baltic countries, as part of efforts to enhance women's participation in political and economic life in the region. The Enhanced Partnership in Northern Europe focuses on promoting cooperative security, vibrant economies, and healthy societies in the region. It includes joint projects between the United States and Baltic states to support democracy promotion and institution building in Belarus, as well as a mentoring program for women entrepreneurs in the northwest region of Russia. The United States supports efforts to promote women's participation in political and economic life in Northern Europe, including mentoring programs for women entrepreneurs in Russia and outreach programs for parliamentarians in the Baltic states. The European Union's \"Northern Dimension\" initiative addresses economic development, environmental protection, nuclear safety, and other challenges in the region. The purpose of this Act is to provide substantial assistance in Northern Europe through partnerships with the European Union and the United States to support cross-border cooperation. This aims to supplement existing efforts and demonstrate concrete support for the region. The Sense of Congress is that the United States should support the e-PINE framework in Northern Europe, the EU should fund the 'Northern Dimension' Initiative, and democratic institutions should be strengthened for political stability and investment opportunities in the region and neighboring countries. The United States should support the E-PINE projects in Northern Europe to enhance partnerships in the region. The United States allocates funds for assistance programs in Eastern Europe, the Baltic States, and independent states of the former Soviet Union for fiscal year 2006. Up to $2,000,000 is authorized for projects in Eastern Europe and the Baltic States, while funds are also designated for assistance in the independent states of the former Soviet Union. Authorized funds are available for projects in the former Soviet Union under U.S.C. 5801 et seq. These projects, known as United States Enhanced Partnership in Northern Europe (e-PINE), cover various areas such as regional security, democracy promotion, economic growth, and civil society. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"Northern Europe\" includes Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. \"United States Enhanced Partnership in Northern Europe\" (e-PINE) was formed in 2003 to promote security, economic growth, and collaboration in the region. The \"United States Northern Europe Initiative\" (NEI) is also mentioned. The \"United States Northern European Initiative\" (NEI) is a framework agreement established in 1997 between the United States and Northern European countries to promote stability in the Baltic Sea region and strengthen key institutions and security structures. The Cross-Border Cooperation and Environmental Safety in Northern Europe Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-255) is repealed."
