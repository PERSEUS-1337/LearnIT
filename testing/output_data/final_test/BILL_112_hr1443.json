    "content": "The \"Outdoor Sports Protection Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. The findings section of the Act is also included. Congress finds that millions of Americans enjoy recreational fishing, sport shooting, and hunting, which are crucial for wildlife conservation. Traditional fishing, shooting, and hunting implements have been used for centuries, and banning them would increase costs for participants. Alternative gear is more expensive, impacting millions of Americans who fish and hunt. Traditional ammunition is more expensive and difficult to obtain compared to components made of traditional materials. A ban on traditional ammunition would decrease participation in shooting sports and impose significant costs on American hunters and sport shooters. Reduction in participation in fishing, hunting, and shooting sports would affect funding for wildlife conservation. Voluntary programs by hunters to reduce lead use have been successful, and the Federal Government should not restrict the use of traditional hunting and fishing implements without definitive evidence of harm to the environment. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"traditional hunting and fishing implement\" refers to items like firearms, ammunition, fishing lures, sinkers, and lines containing lead, zinc, copper, or brass. \"Federal public land\" is defined as land or water owned by the United States and managed by the Department of the Interior or Agriculture for conservation purposes. The term \"Federal public land\" excludes land held in trust for federally recognized Indian tribes or their members. SEC. 4. PROTECTION OF TRADITIONAL HUNTING AND FISHING IMPLEMENT.\n\nThe Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency cannot restrict traditional hunting and fishing tools unless proven to have a significant negative impact on the environment, in which case a report must be submitted to Congress for potential legislative action.\n\nSEC. 5. LIMITATION ON DEPARTMENTS OF THE INTERIOR AND AGRICULTURE. SEC. 5. LIMITATION ON DEPARTMENTS OF THE INTERIOR AND AGRICULTURE. The Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture are prohibited from restricting the use of traditional hunting and fishing equipment on Federal public lands unless there is scientific evidence of harm to local fish or wildlife populations, in which case a report must be submitted to Congress for potential legislative action. SEC. 6. STATE COMPLIANCE.\n\nNo State or territory shall receive funding under certain wildlife restoration acts if they restrict the sale or use of traditional hunting and fishing implements based on material content.\n\nSEC. 7. EXCEPTIONS.\n\nThis Act does not affect the authority of federal or state agencies to limit traditional hunting and fishing implements based on material content if already in effect before the Act's enactment."
