    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"American Schools Abroad Support Act\". During the 2003-2004 school year, the Office of Overseas Schools of the Department of State financially assists 189 American-sponsored schools in other countries, serving 99,318 students, including 27,412 U.S. citizens. These schools provide an American-style education in English with an emphasis on critical thinking skills. Some are located in regions with significant Muslim populations. The United States emphasizes public diplomacy programs, including education at various levels, to address anti-American sentiment in Arab and predominantly Muslim countries. American-sponsored schools in these regions play a crucial role in advancing U.S. public diplomacy interests. The Department of State provides funds to these schools to support their activities. The United States aims to increase financial support for American-sponsored schools in Arab and predominantly Muslim countries to boost student attendance and promote an appreciation for American culture, society, and history. This includes expanding access beyond affluent families who can afford tuition fees. The Department of State has legal authority to provide increased financial support for American-sponsored schools in Arab and predominantly Muslim countries to increase student attendance from lower- and middle-income families. Based on the findings, Congress believes additional funds should be allocated to American-sponsored schools in Arab and predominantly Muslim countries for merit-based scholarships to children from lower- and middle-income families. Grants will be provided to these schools to offer scholarships to students. The Secretary of State can grant funds to American-sponsored schools in Arab and predominantly Muslim countries for merit-based scholarships to students from lower- and middle-income families. Schools can establish criteria to determine eligible families, and funds are restricted to the purposes outlined. Authorization of appropriations in subsection (c) is solely for grants under this section, not for administration of the Office of Overseas Schools. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 to carry out subsection (a)."
