    "content": "The Terrorist Screening Center (TSC), administered by the FBI, maintains the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) created in 2003 after 9/11. It consolidated federal watchlisting efforts to share and compare information. The watchlisting regimen involves nomination, verification of identities for the TSDB, and export of data to screening systems. The TSDB is used for screening individuals against databases like the No Fly List. Screeners conduct over 1.2 billion queries against the TSDB. Originators at government agencies nominate identities for the TSDB based on terrorist activity suspicions. Intelligence and law enforcement agencies, U.S embassies, and consulates nominate individuals as \"known or suspected terrorists\" for the federal watchlisting regimen. A \"known terrorist\" is someone engaged in terrorism, while a \"suspected terrorist\" is reasonably suspected of terrorist activities. The TSDB contains identities of individuals suspected of terrorism activities, vetted by NCTC or FBI analysts and verified at TSC. NCTC manages international terrorist nominations and maintains TIDE, a classified database of international terrorist identities. TIDE includes all relevant information on individuals involved in terrorism activities. The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) contains identities of individuals suspected of terrorism activities, vetted by NCTC or FBI analysts and verified at TSC. TIDE, a classified database managed by NCTC, holds information on individuals involved in terrorism activities, with about 1.1 million people listed, including 25,000 U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents linked to international terrorist organizations. NCTC updates TIDE daily and exports a subset of data to the TSDB for final verification before inclusion. TIDE is a crucial resource for counterterrorism professionals in the U.S. Intelligence Community. The TSDB contains identities of individuals suspected of terrorism activities, vetted by NCTC or FBI analysts and verified at TSC. Nominations from FBI analysts are processed by the Terrorist Review and Examination Unit, with international nominations forwarded to NCTC for inclusion in TIDE. Domestic terrorist nominations are sent directly to TSC for review, meeting the \"reasonable suspicion watchlisting standard\" and having sufficient identifiers. TSC personnel ensure each nomination in the TSDB meets these criteria. The TSDB contains identities of individuals suspected of terrorism activities, vetted by NCTC or FBI analysts and verified at TSC. Nominations from FBI analysts are processed by the Terrorist Review and Examination Unit, with international nominations forwarded to NCTC for inclusion in TIDE. TSC personnel ensure each nomination in the TSDB meets the \"reasonable suspicion watchlisting standard\" and has sufficient identifiers. The nomination process involves rational inferences based on articulable facts to determine if a person is suspected of terrorist ties, with guesses or hunches not sufficient for inclusion. The TSDB requires a reasonable suspicion standard for inclusion, with minimum biographic criteria needed. From FY2009 to FY2013, 1.6 million individuals were nominated, with only about 1% rejected. The TSC shares watchlist information with authorized federal agencies almost instantly. The TSDB exports information to five major U.S. Government agencies for near-real-time screening. Each agency receives tailored portions of the TSDB based on their mission and technology requirements. Examples of agencies using TSDB information include the Department of State for passport and visa screening and the Transportation Security Administration for aviation security screening. The Secure Flight program includes the No Fly List, Selectee List, and Expanded Selectee List. The No Fly List and Selectee List are part of the Flight program, aimed at preventing threats to aviation and national security. Individuals on these lists face restrictions on boarding commercial aircraft within or flying over the United States. The criteria for inclusion in these lists are more stringent than the TSDB's standards, resulting in a smaller number of identities. In 2014, there were around 64,000 identities on the No Fly List and 24,000 on the Selectee List out of approximately 800,000 identities in the TSDB. The Expanded Selectee List was created as an extra security measure in response to a failed terrorist attempt in 2009. It screens against TSDB records not on the No Fly or Selectee Lists. Customs and Border Protection uses TECS and the Automated Targeting System to screen travelers and cargo. The Automated Targeting System (ATS) compares traveler and cargo data against law enforcement and intelligence databases, including the TSDB. ATS-P focuses on identifying potential terrorists and criminals for CBP personnel at borders and ports of entry. The FBI's NCIC database is a clearinghouse of crime data accessible to criminal justice agencies nationwide, including the \"Known or Appropriately Suspected Terrorist File.\" The NCIC includes 21 files, one of which is the \"Known or Appropriately Suspected Terrorist File\" containing TSDB records. This database is used for domestic law enforcement screening, with the Department of Defense utilizing TSDB information for screening individuals entering military bases. Screeners from various law enforcement agencies check identities against the TSDB either in-person or through official forms. Examples include CBP officers screening individuals at ports of entry, police pulling over vehicles for violations, and Department of State officials reviewing visa applications. Every year, screeners make over a billion queries against the TSDB for visa applications reviewed by Department of State officials. Screeners receive notifications of possible matches, known as \"encounters,\" and contact the TSC for further analysis. TSC analysts can search additional datasets for clarification. If a positive match is made or analysis is inconclusive, the FBI's Terrorist Screening Operations Unit coordinates the government's response. The FBI's Terrorist Screening Operations Unit coordinates the government's response by deploying agents to interview and apprehend subjects based on new information collected from encounters, which is then forwarded to the TSC to enhance existing TSDB entries."
