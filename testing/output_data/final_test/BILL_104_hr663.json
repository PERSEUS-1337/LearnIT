The \"No Frills Prison Act\" amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to provide living conditions and opportunities to prisoners that are not more luxurious than what the average prisoner would experience if not incarcerated. The \"No Frills Prison Act\" prohibits certain privileges for prisoners, such as earning good time credits, working less than 40 hours a week, unmonitored phone calls, in-cell television viewing, watching R, X, or NC-17 rated movies, possessing pornographic materials, and receiving boxing instruction or training equipment. The \"No Frills Prison Act\" prohibits certain privileges for prisoners, including the use or possession of electronic musical instruments, personally owned computers or modems, in-cell coffee pots, hot plates, or heating elements, obstructed views in living or work quarters, and food exceeding the quality or quantity available to enlisted personnel in the US Army. The \"No Frills Prison Act\" restricts privileges for prisoners, such as personal electronic devices, in-cell appliances, and special food. Prisoners serving time for violent crimes may face harsher conditions, including limited physical labor and confinement in punishment-focused cell blocks. The \"No Frills Prison Act\" restricts privileges for prisoners, including limited physical labor, confinement in punishment-focused cell blocks, and restrictions on activities like watching television, participating in sports, and possessing excess personal property. The \"No Frills Prison Act\" limits privileges for prisoners, including possession of personal property exceeding 75 pounds or that cannot be stowed in a standard size military duffel bag. The Attorney General will establish conditions in Federal prisons similar to those in State prisons under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Section 3624 of title 18, United States Code, is amended accordingly."
