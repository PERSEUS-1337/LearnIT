    "content": "Discussions on the federal workforce since the late 1990s have focused on the management of human capital, which refers to employees as assets that yield significant returns for the organization. Human capital encompasses loyalty, creativity, effort, accomplishments, and productivity. Lester C. Thurow defined human capital as an individual's productive skills, talents, and knowledge, measured by the value of goods and services produced. The value of human capital rises with the value of goods and services. The General Accounting Office (GAO) considers human capital as an organization's most critical asset. In January 2001, GAO identified strategic human capital management as a high-risk area in the federal government due to challenges affecting multiple agencies and the government's budget. Federal workforce reductions were found to lack sufficient planning for their impacts. The GAO found that federal workforce reductions were conducted without sufficient planning for their effects on agency performance. Agencies also reduced investments in performance rewards, enabling technologies, and training programs. Many agencies anticipate rapid turnover of top leadership and managers, with about 45% of the career Senior Executive Service expected to retire by FY2005. Despite some progress in human capital management reforms, the long-standing lack of a comprehensive and systematic approach remains a challenge. The GAO identified a lack of strategic approach to managing federal human capital, with outdated policies hindering government performance. Recommendations were made by Senators Thompson and Voinovich to address these challenges, anticipating a significant number of federal employees retiring by 2004. The Bush Administration also submitted legislative proposals in response. The Bush Administration submitted The Managerial Flexibility Act of 2001 to Congress, aiming to eliminate legal barriers to effective management. The proposal included provisions for personnel management flexibilities such as voluntary separation incentives, early retirement, recruitment bonuses, and more. Senator Voinovich introduced the Federal Human Capital Act of 2001 in response. Senator Voinovich and Senator Thompson introduced bills related to federal employee management reform in 2001, which were referred to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs. Hearings were conducted on the legislation in 2002, with testimony from various organizations and scholars. Representative Constance Morella also introduced a related bill in the House Committee on Government Reform. During the hearings on federal employee management reform in 2002, Akaka emphasized the need for government to attract young talent and support its workforce. Paul C. Light highlighted the importance of pending legislation to enhance government's ability to compete for talent and restructuring the federal government's human capital system. Following Senate committee hearings, Senator Voinovich, along with Senators Fred Thompson and Thad Cochran, revised and merged provisions from S. 1603 and S. 1639 into one bill, S. 2651, known as the Federal Workforce Improvement Act of 2002. Some of the provisions in S. 2651 were enacted in P.L. 107-296, The Homeland Security Act of 2002, signed by President George Bush on November 25, 2002, and are applicable government-wide. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is currently developing a new human resources management system for the department. In the 108th Congress, S. 129, the Federal Workforce Flexibility Act of 2003, passed the Senate with an amendment by unanimous consent on April 8, 2004. Senator Voinovich introduced S. 129 on January 9, 2003, and the bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs. The bill was reported with an amendment in the nature of a substitute, making political appointees ineligible for certain bonuses. The amended bill was agreed to by the Senate on April 8, 2004. In 2004, the House Subcommittee on Civil Service and Agency Organization marked up S.129, agreeing to amendments related to bonuses for political appointees. The bill was ordered to be reported to the House of Representatives on June 24, 2004. Another bill on federal workforce management was introduced in the House in 2003 by Representative Jo Ann Davis. Representative Jo Ann Davis introduced H.R. 1601, the Federal Workforce Flexibility Act of 2003, in the House of Representatives on April 3, 2003. The bill, along with S. 129, includes provisions on critical pay, retirement system computation, agency training, annual leave, recruitment bonuses, and retention allowances. S. 129 also amends current law provisions on bonuses and allowances. If S. 129 is enacted, agencies would have enhanced authority for recruitment, relocation, and retention bonuses under new sections 5754a and 5754b in Title 5 United States Code. Amendments on pay administration were included in S. 129 but dropped during Senate committee markup. Provisions on retirement service credit and compensatory time off for travel were added during Senate committee markup. Provisions on retirement service credit and compensatory time off for travel were added to S. 129 during Senate committee markup. Other provisions related to Thrift Savings Plan contributions, annuity commencement dates, and retirement for air traffic controllers were included in S. 129 but later removed during full committee markup. The Congressional Budget Office estimates direct spending if S. 129 is enacted. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that enacting S. 129 would increase direct spending by $4 million in 2004, $71 million over 2004-2008, and $233 million over 2004-2013. Revenues would also see a slight increase starting in 2005. The cost of implementing the legislation is estimated to be $351 million over 2004-2008 and $756 million over 2004-2013. A joint hearing was held on April 8, 2003, regarding the federal government's human capital challenge, where S. 129 and H.R. 1601 were discussed. TheMembers took testimony on S. 129 and H.R. 1601, including suggestions for additional legislation. A professor at Harvard University proposed three provisions for the pending legislation: creating a program for mid-career professionals to enter government service, amending hiring criteria to consider \"accomplishments,\" and extending hiring authority for master's degree graduates. During a 2004 hearing by the House Subcommittee on Civil Service and Agency Organization, discussions were held regarding H.R. 1601, which aims to address pay, benefit, and personnel issues in the civil service. Various stakeholders expressed concerns about the need for clear solutions and coordination of human capital activities. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) preferred S. 129 over other proposals. The AFGE union prefers S. 129 over H.R. 1601 due to the absence of demonstration project authorities. The National Commission on the Public Service supports personnel provisions in the Homeland Security Act of 2002. They recommend more flexible personnel management systems and simplified recruitment of federal employees. The text discusses provisions in S. 129, comparing them with current law. Comments from various congressional hearings are included. Specialists from the Congressional Research Service prepared the text on retirement and Senior Executive Service Authority provisions. Enhanced authority for federal agencies to pay recruitment and relocation bonuses and retention allowances is proposed in Title I of S. 129. These bonuses and allowances were first enacted as part of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 to provide cash incentives for agencies in the competitive job market. Limited funding and recruitment due to downsizing have restricted agency use of these incentives. Proposed changes aim to allow flexibility in their use. The proposed changes in S. 129 aim to enhance federal agencies' authority to pay recruitment and relocation bonuses. These changes, suggested by agencies in response to OPM's study, include allowing flexibility in payment methods and raising maximum amounts. The bill would amend current law at 5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5753 and add a new section 5754a on recruitment and relocation bonuses. If enacted, agencies would have the option to use current law provisions and the enhanced authority proposed in the bill. S. 129 aims to enhance federal agencies' authority to pay recruitment and relocation bonuses by providing flexibility in payment methods and raising maximum amounts. The bill would amend current law at 5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5753 and add a new section 5754a on recruitment and relocation bonuses, allowing bonuses to be paid to employees covered by the GS pay system. Current law requires employees receiving recruitment or relocation bonuses to enter into a service agreement with the agency, with a required period of employment determined by OPM regulations. S. 129 would amend the law to limit the service period to not exceed four years, with potential for a minimum service period as prescribed by OPM regulations. Repayment of bonuses on a pro rata basis is required if the employee fails to complete the service period voluntarily or is separated for cause before completion. The service agreement for recruitment or relocation bonuses would have a maximum period of four years, with potential for a minimum service period as determined by OPM regulations. The agreement would specify the bonus amount, payment method, and conditions for termination. The bonus is limited to 25% of the annual basic pay rate and is paid as a lump sum, excluding locality pay. The bonus for recruitment or relocation is limited to 25% of the employee's annual basic pay rate at the beginning of the service period, multiplied by the number of years in the service period, not to exceed four years. It can be paid as an initial lump sum, in installments, as a final lump sum upon completion of the full service period, or in a combination of these forms. The bonus calculation includes locality pay. S. 129 proposes changes to bonus regulations, including substituting \"eligible individual\" for \"newly hired employee\" and allowing OPM to waive the 25% limitation for critical agency needs. Bonuses can now be up to 50% of annual basic pay rate, not exceeding 100%. OPM regulations would require agencies to establish plans for paying recruitment and relocation bonuses. S. 129 proposes changes to bonus regulations, including extending coverage to other employees and prohibiting bonuses for political appointees. It also requires OPM to prescribe regulations for repayment of bonuses in certain circumstances. Not Eligible for Bonuses. Bonuses cannot be paid to individuals appointed by the President with Senate advice and consent, SES noncareer appointees, or positions excepted from competitive service. Political appointees are excluded from enhanced recruitment and relocation bonuses authorized in S. 129. OPM must report annually on bonuses paid. The House and Senate versions of the annual report on bonuses paid differ in the details required. The House version includes a description of how recruitment and relocation bonuses were used by agencies, while the Senate version specifies reporting on the number and amount of bonuses by grade and position. The Senate version of the annual report on bonuses paid focuses on individuals moving between positions in different agencies within the same geographic area. It includes details on bonuses furthering statutory purposes, restrictions on receiving multiple bonuses, and definitions of \"agency\" and \"employee.\" The Senate version of the annual report on bonuses paid includes a definition of \"agency\" and proposes amending current law to redefine \"employee\" as individuals appointed in the civil service by the President, engaged in federal functions under authority of law, and subject to supervision while performing their duties. The Senate version of the annual report on bonuses paid includes amendments to current law regarding retention allowances and bonuses for federal employees at the United States Naval Academy. The proposed changes would provide agencies with enhanced authority to offer retention bonuses in addition to existing retention allowances. The Senate version proposes amendments to current law regarding retention allowances and bonuses for federal employees, specifically focusing on the eligibility criteria for receiving bonuses under the GS pay system. The bill aims to provide agencies with increased authority to offer retention bonuses to employees who are likely to leave federal service without such incentives. The Senate bill proposes amendments to allow agencies to offer retention bonuses to employees at risk of leaving federal service, requiring a written service agreement for completion of a specified period with terms including bonus amount and conditions for termination. The agreement for retention bonuses can be terminated before completion of the service period, with written notification. If the bonus is paid in biweekly installments at the full rate with no deferral, the agency can stop payments by informing the employee in writing. The bonus cannot be based on the same service period as a recruitment or relocation bonus. The bonus is limited to 25% of annual basic pay and is paid in the same manner as basic pay. S. 129 proposes amending current law to state retention bonuses as a percentage of basic pay, not exceeding 25% if paid individually or 10% if paid as a group. Bonuses can be paid in installments or as a lump sum at the end of the service period. Installment payments are capped at a percentage of basic pay earned during the period. The bill proposes allowing agencies to waive the 25% or 10% limitations on retention bonuses and pay up to 50% of basic pay based on critical agency needs. OPM regulations would require agencies to establish a plan for paying retention bonuses. The bill proposes allowing agencies to waive limitations on retention bonuses and pay up to 50% of basic pay based on critical agency needs. OPM regulations require agencies to establish a plan for paying retention bonuses, and political appointees are not eligible for bonuses. The current authority allows political appointees to be eligible for retention allowances, excluding them from enhanced retention bonuses authorized in S. 129. OPM would submit an annual report on bonuses paid to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Government Reform. The House version requires reports on relocation and retention bonuses by agency and pay grade, including how bonuses were used to prevent job changes within the same geographic area. It also evaluates if the bonuses align with the statute's purposes. The House version includes a provision for notifying the OPM Director of bonus payments for employee recruitment, relocation, and retention within the same geographic area. The Director would monitor the effectiveness of these bonuses in retaining employees and ensuring they do not hinder other agencies' missions. The Senate version prohibits individuals from receiving both a retention bonus under Section 5754b and a retention allowance under 5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754. The Senate version prohibits individuals from receiving both a retention bonus under Section 5754b and a retention allowance under 5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754. It also amends current law by redefining \"employee\" to include specific categories such as officers appointed in the civil service by the President, Members of Congress, and uniformed service members. The Senate version of the bill prohibits individuals from receiving both a retention bonus under Section 5754b and a retention allowance under 5 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5754. It also expands the definition of \"employee\" to include specific categories such as officers appointed in the civil service by the President, Members of Congress, and uniformed service members. The provisions of the bill would become effective on the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after 180 days after the act's enactment. The proposed amendments aim to provide agencies with more flexibility in implementing recruitment, relocation, and retention bonuses. This includes expanding the reasons for using the bonuses, offering various payment methods (lump sum or installments), and potentially increasing bonus sizes through waivers. The proposed amendments aim to provide agencies with more flexibility in implementing recruitment, relocation, and retention bonuses, including expanding reasons for their use, offering different payment methods, and potentially increasing bonus sizes through waivers. The changes would allow agencies to use bonuses strategically to enhance their desired effect and be more competitive in recruiting and retaining the workforce they need. The amendments also introduce specific service requirements for receiving recruitment, relocation, and retention bonuses, directly tying an employee's service to bonus payments. The issue of agency funding for bonuses was not addressed in the amendments, as highlighted by Colleen M. Kelley of the National Treasury Employees Union during her testimony before the Senate subcommittee hearing. In December of 1999, only a small percentage of Executive Branch employees received recruitment, retention, or relocation incentives due to budgetary constraints. Agencies lack the resources to fund these programs, hindering their ability to address human capital crises. Expanding incentives without providing necessary resources is ineffective. The need for appropriate funding is emphasized to ensure that agencies can effectively implement recruitment and retention allowances. Without sufficient resources, increasing incentives may not lead to more flexibilities for federal employees. Testimonies from various officials highlight the importance of funding before offering false hope to agencies about additional bonus options. Mr. Harnage from the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) raised concerns about the draft proposal for bonus payments, stating that agencies may have to eliminate jobs or deny salary adjustments to fund bonuses for select individuals. He also emphasized the need to address the human capital crisis affecting blue-collar workers and highlighted that bonuses are not a substitute for competitive salaries and benefits. The Federal Managers Association and the Partnership for Public Service recommended budget allocation for recruitment and resources for managing the federal workforce. Comptroller General David Walker suggested capping the number of employees eligible for recruitment bonuses. Carl DeMaio and John Gage testified before a House subcommittee on bonuses for federal employees. DeMaio emphasized the need for performance measurement for bonuses, while Gage questioned the effectiveness of bonuses in recruitment and retention, stating they are not a substitute for competitive salaries. In a House subcommittee hearing, Ronald Sanders of OPM expressed preference for H.R. 1601 over S. 129, which would repeal relocation payments for LEOs. Currently, LEOs earning less than $60,000 can receive up to $15,000 in relocation payments. The analysis accompanying the introduction of S. 1612 (107th Congress) stated that repealing relocation payments for LEOs earning less than $60,000 would simplify administration and ensure consistency. Section 102 of S. 129 would amend critical pay provisions to allow fixing basic pay rates for certain positions. S. 129 would amend critical pay provisions to allow fixing basic pay rates for certain critical positions in agencies, not exceeding Level I of the Executive Schedule, with the President's approval. The authority would be granted by OPM in consultation with OMB, and would be used to recruit or retain highly qualified individuals for important agency missions. S. 129 would amend critical pay provisions to authorize OPM to determine pay rates for certain positions, with limitations on the number of positions. OPM would consult with OMB before making decisions on critical pay authority. S. 129 would shift oversight and reporting authority for critical pay positions from OMB to OPM, aiming to attract talented individuals to federal government positions for short periods of time. OPM staff believe no significant increase in resources would be needed for administering the critical pay provisions. The critical pay provisions aim to address salary disparities between government and private sectors, particularly at senior levels. Colleen M. Kelley of NTEU emphasized the importance of properly compensating the federal workforce to avoid the need for further critical pay authority. Carl DeMaio recommended pay based on market comparisons. During a Housesubcommittee hearing, concerns were raised about the proposed legislation not providing funding for expanding critical pay authority. John Gage of AFGE advocated for competitive salaries for all employees, not just a select few. OMB received 55 requests for critical pay from 1991 to 2000, with 37 approved but later cancelled due to vacancies. As of December 2003, only five employees were being paid under critical pay authority. Positions approved for critical pay included the Director of the National Institutes of Health and the Director of the Richland, WA, Operations Office of the Department of Energy. The Senate subcommittee hearing raised concerns about the lack of funding for expanding critical pay authority. The proposed legislation would give the President authority to employ senior executives in the White House Office. The authority's wide usage and applicable positions were not specified in the section analysis or hearing testimony. The provision added to S. 129 by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs at the request of OPM gives the President authority to employ senior executives in the White House Office of Administration. Career reserved positions for Senior Executive Service (SES) appointees must be filled by career appointees. Employment of senior executives follows specific provisions in Title 5, including those related to appointment, performance appraisal, and awards in the SES. The President has the authority to employ senior executives in the White House Office of Administration, with specific provisions in Title 5 related to appointment, performance appraisal, awards, and pay limitations. SES positions must be filled by career appointees through a merit-based selection process. The limitation on basic pay for senior executives is not greater than GS-15, step 10 ($113,674 as of January 2004). Agency training provisions in S. 129 aim to address budget constraints and prioritize training in federal government agencies. The hearing revealed agencies spread training dollars throughout their budget to avoid reprogramming. Poor record-keeping hinders tracking training budgets. S. 129 proposes changes to help agencies plan training activities better, requiring evaluation of training programs. S. 129 would require agency heads to evaluate training programs regularly to align with agency missions and goals. This systematic evaluation can ensure optimal use of training funds and provide feedback on performance. The Senate-passed version of S. 129 would require each agency to appoint a training officer responsible for developing and administering training programs. Additionally, agency heads would establish management succession and training programs in consultation with OPM. The Senate-passed version of S. 129 requires agencies to appoint a training officer for developing and administering programs. The training officer could also serve as the Chief Human Capital Officer. Congress previously mandated OPM to report on training expenditures but this requirement was dropped due to downsizing. Colleen M. Kelley emphasized the need for proper training funding in government agencies during Senate and House subcommittee hearings. John Priolo suggested a separate line item for training in agency budgets to improve fund allocation. This proposal addresses the issue of inadequate training budgets highlighted by agencies in previous hearings. In May 2000, agencies expressed concerns about inadequate employee training budgets and the need for additional training funds. Ronald Sanders of OPM argued that training officers in federal agencies are unnecessary as training and development are the responsibility of agency Chief Human Capital Officers. Newly hired federal employees accrue annual leave based on years of service, starting at four hours per biweekly pay period. Section 202(a) of S. 129 aims to amend the accrual of leave for federal employees. The Senate version of the provision would allow agency heads to count prior non-federal service for annual leave accrual, with specific conditions. The House version gives OPM authority to regulate credit for annual leave accrual for newly hired employees. The amendment allows agency heads to grant credit for annual leave accrual to newly hired employees based on prior service related to their current position, if deemed necessary for agency mission or performance goals. Service is creditable from the appointment's effective date and continues unless a full year of continuous service is not completed. Employees with non-governmental service within 90 days before appointment are not eligible for credit. The proposed change would allow newly hired federal employees to accrue more annual leave immediately, based on prior service. This is seen as a recruiting tool, especially for mid-level employees. Colleen M. Kelley of NTEU suggested a review of the entire leave system if leave limits hinder hiring. The proposed amendment in S. 129 would allow certain senior level employees to accrue a full day of annual leave per pay period, regardless of years of service. This applies to employees above GS-15, in scientific or professional positions, Senior Executive Service members, or equivalent categories with higher pay rates. The proposed amendment in S. 129 would allow senior level employees to accrue eight hours of annual leave every two weeks, targeting recruitment and retention. This provision would take effect 120 days after enactment, with OPM required to prescribe implementing regulations. It may have limited impact on senior executives already in government ranks but could attract more outside managers to federal positions. Under current law, time spent in travel away from the official duty station is not considered hours of employment unless specific requirements are met. The proposed amendment in S. 129 would add a new section to Chapter 55, Subchapter V of Title 5 United States Code, allowing senior level employees to accrue eight hours of annual leave every two weeks. The proposed section in S. 129 would allow employees to be granted compensatory time off for officially authorized travel away from their duty station. This provision aims to eliminate the need for employees to use personal time for travel outside of normal business hours. Regulations to implement this provision would be prescribed by OPM within 30 days of enactment. During markup by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, Senator Akaka requested S. 129 for compensatory time off for travel, supported by NTEU. OPM opposed the provision citing lack of business case and high cost. Part-time employees under CSRS face reduced retirement annuities due to a regulation from OPM in response to P.L. 99-272. OPM's regulation under P.L. 99-272 unfairly penalizes part-time workers by reducing their retirement annuities more than intended by Congress. Proposed amendments in S. 129 aim to clarify that CSRS retirement annuities for part-time service should not be lower than full-time rates. Proposed amendments in S. 129 aim to prorate CSRS retirement annuities for part-time service and include cadet or midshipman service towards civilian retirement annuity eligibility. The U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, and U.S. Naval Academy cadet or midshipman service may be creditable under the Civil Service Retirement System or Federal Employees' Retirement System. Proposed amendments in S. 129 would amend Chapter 53 of Title 5 regarding special pay rates. Effective conversion rules would apply after the act's enactment. The conversion rules for employees under the General Schedule, prevailing rate schedule, or special pay system receiving a retained rate or higher basic pay rate would be adjusted to include locality-based comparability payments. The changes aim to correct pay administration anomalies related to special rates. The proposed changes aim to correct pay administration anomalies associated with special rates and pay retention due to the introduction of locality pay under the GS paysystem. No current employee would lose pay because of these changes, and it is seen as a way to reinvigorate the special rates program for recruitment and retention purposes. The 108th Congress is considering legislative reforms to improve federal workforce management, with a focus on developing more flexible personnel management systems and simplifying recruitment processes. The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense are working on new human resources management systems, with a focus on personnel management flexibilities. Congressional oversight will also be focused on these efforts. Karen Heiser of the Federal Managers Association emphasized the importance of investing in government employees' training, incentives, and overall development for a world-class Civil Service during a congressional hearing in 2003."
