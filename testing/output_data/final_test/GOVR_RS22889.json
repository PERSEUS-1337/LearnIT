    "content": "The National Directory of New Hires (NDNH) is a database of personal and employment information of American workers. Employers must send new hire reports to the State Directory of New Hires, which then forwards the data to the NDNH. States also provide quarterly wage and unemployment compensation claims information to the NDNH. Federal agencies send their reports directly to the NDNH, containing six data elements on new employees. The NDNH consists of three components, including the new hires file and quarterly wage information. The National Directory of New Hires (NDNH) includes three components: new hire reports, quarterly wage information, and Unemployment Compensation data from State Workforce Agencies. The quarterly wage file contains wage details from individual employees in UC-covered employment, while the Unemployment Compensation file includes information on those who have received or applied for unemployment benefits. The National Directory of New Hires (NDNH) is a component of the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) maintained by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE). It obtains data from State Directories of New Hires, State Workforce Agencies, and federal agencies. The NDNH was originally created to help states locate child support obligors working in other states. About 672 million records were posted to the NDNH in FY2010, with approximately 30% of child support cases involving noncustodial parents living in different states. States primarily use NDNH data for this purpose. States primarily use NDNH data to locate noncustodial parents working in different states or for the federal government. Quick reporting of new hires increases the chances of collecting child support via income withholding before the parent changes jobs. Access to NDNH has expanded since 1996 to prevent fraud and abuse. Employers are required to collect and transmit new hire reports to the State Directory of New Hires, containing basic employee and employer information. The State Directory then submits these reports to the National Directory of New Hires (NDNH), which deletes them after 24 months. Wage and unemployment reports are deleted after 12 months unless a match occurs. The constant cycling of data in and out of the NDNH is maintained for child support enforcement purposes. The HHS Secretary may retain data samples for research. The HHS Secretary can transmit employee and employer information from new hire reports to the SSA for verification. SSA verifies Social Security numbers before adding them to the National Directory of New Hires. Quarterly wage files may lack necessary elements for verification, in which case they are flagged as unverified. The SSA verifies Social Security numbers before adding them to the National Directory of New Hires. Employers must provide new hires reports to the State Directory of New Hires within 20 days of hiring, which is then submitted to the NDNH for comparison in cases involving child support. The HHS Secretary compares information in the NDNH with child support abstracts in the Federal Child Support Case Registry every two business days. If a match is found, the information is reported to the state CSE agency within two business days for enforcement. Quarterly wage data on existing employees is transmitted to the NDNH by State Workforce Agencies within four months of the end of a calendar quarter, with federal agencies required to do so within one month for federal employees. The NDNH receives unemployment compensation information from State Workforce Agencies within one month of the end of a calendar quarter. Access to the NDNH database is restricted to authorized persons by federal law. Any agency not mentioned must have Congress authorize access. The HHS Secretary shares NDNH information with specific state agencies administering various programs. The NDNH database is accessed by authorized persons for various purposes, including administering federal programs such as TANF, Earned Income Tax Credit, defaulted student loans, federal housing assistance, and Unemployment Compensation. Access to the database is granted through specific legislation enacted by Congress. State Workforce Agencies oversee Unemployment Compensation programs and access to the Department of the Treasury for debt collection. Legislation grants access to state agencies for administering the Food Stamp program and requires data-matching with the NDNH for SNAP agencies. The P.L. 110-157 requires state SNAP agencies to data-match with the NDNH for SNAP certification to determine eligibility and benefit amounts. It also mandates the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide income verification information for certain veteran benefits, with consent and verification procedures in place. The NDNH provision was terminated in 2011 but reinstated in 2013 for 180 days. It has been successful in locating noncustodial parents and putative fathers, but does not include information on the self-employed or industry/occupation-related data. The NDNH is a database containing personal and financial data on working Americans and those receiving unemployment compensation. Concerns have been raised about potential misuse of confidential information as more agencies and programs are granted access to the NDNH. Privacy protection provisions and data security safeguards are in place, but the size and scope of the database continue to raise concerns about individual privacy protection. The NDNH contains personal and financial data on working Americans and those receiving unemployment compensation. Concerns have been raised about potential misuse of confidential information as more agencies and programs are granted access to the database. Stronger safeguards may be needed to prevent unauthorized intrusion into personal and confidential information, as expanded access could lead to privacy breaches and financial fraud. Some policymakers are concerned about potential privacy breaches and financial fraud with broader access to the NDNH. Agencies may lack the computer capacity to utilize the system effectively, especially at the local level. Child support advocates also worry about wider access to personal and financial data. Some child support advocates fear that increased access to the NDNH could lead to competition with the CSE program for collecting overpayments through income withholding."
