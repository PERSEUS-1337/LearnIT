    "title": "SB 1059",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature amends Section 67100 of the Education Code, stating that postsecondary educational institutions in California must seek approval from CSAAVE to enroll veterans or Title 38 eligible individuals in accredited programs. CSAAVE has the authority to approve accredited and nonaccredited institutions if they meet specific criteria and additional requirements. Postsecondary institutions must comply with accreditation, federal and state laws, and any additional criteria set by CSAAVE. Private postsecondary institutions must also obtain approval from the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education. In this chapter, terms like \"academic year\" and \"CSAAVE\" are defined. A \"qualifying institution\" is described as a degree-granting institution meeting specific criteria. The institution must provide information on California license examination passage rates for recent graduates of its undergraduate programs leading to licensure. This information should be easily accessible on the institution's website or in enrollment materials. The institution must certify compliance with accreditation requirements to CSAAVE. Degree-granting institutions must provide evidence of accreditation to be eligible for Title 38 awards. Unaccredited institutions must show candidacy or preaccreditation status by January 1, 2016, to remain eligible for awards. The institution must obtain accreditation from the accrediting agency by January 1, 2017, to be eligible for Title 38 awards for the academic year of 2017\u201318 and beyond. If an unaccredited degree-granting institution in the Title 38 award program fails to meet accreditation requirements, veterans enrolled in degree programs before specific dates can still receive Title 38 awards until they complete their programs. An unaccredited degree-granting institution that does not meet accreditation requirements cannot enroll new Title 38 eligible students after specific dates. This institution is not accredited to receive Title 38 awards, so attending here will make you ineligible for such awards. An institution accredited by the Committee of Bar Examiners is exempt from certain requirements if it provides detailed disclosures to applicants regarding admissions data, tuition, fees, financial aid, and more. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to admissions data, bar passage data, and conditional scholarships. The curr_chunk provides definitions for \"employment outcomes for graduates\" and \"enrollment data\" three years after graduation, as well as compliance with CSAAVE rules and regulations. The institution must meet specific criteria to be eligible for Title 38 awards, including being a campus of California's higher education systems or an independent institution of higher education. Private postsecondary educational institutions must also have approval to operate from the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education and comply with regulatory oversight. An accredited institution by the Committee of Bar Examiners under specific sections of the Business and Professions Code."
