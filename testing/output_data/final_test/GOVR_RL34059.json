This is crucial to combat global climate change caused by human activities. Scientists are studying how human CO2 emissions are impacting the global carbon cycle and the rate of CO2 buildup in the atmosphere. Most climate scientists agree that human activities have significantly altered the global carbon cycle, leading to a rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This shift has prompted policymakers to consider strategies like cap-and-trade systems to address carbon sequestration. The report focuses on the human contribution of carbon to the atmosphere in the context of the global carbon cycle, particularly on CO2. It highlights the uncertainties surrounding the future uptake of carbon by forests and farmland, as well as the behavior of ocean and land surface carbon reservoirs. This scientific understanding is crucial for the ongoing congressional debate on climate change mitigation strategies. The IPCC states that CO2 is the primary greenhouse gas from human activities, contributing to over half of Earth's radiation balance. Carbon is stored in the atmosphere, oceans, vegetation, and soils, with fossil fuels like oil, gas, and coal also storing carbon. The atmosphere holds 800 billion metric tons of carbon, more than all Earth's vegetation. Carbon in oceans, vegetation, and soils interacts with the atmosphere through natural processes like photosynthesis and respiration. Carbon in the atmosphere is linked to natural processes like photosynthesis and respiration, while carbon from fossil fuels is released through extraction and combustion. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere remains fairly uniform, with minor variations due to seasonal changes and latitude. Fossil fuel emissions globally impact the atmospheric carbon pool, which interacts with the ocean and land carbon pools. Unlike natural carbon cycles, carbon from fossil fuels is not exchanged with the atmosphere but transferred in a one-way process. The debate over global warming revolves around how much fossil fuel carbon ends up in the atmosphere, oceans, vegetation, and soils over time. Each storage pool (oceans, soils, vegetation) acts as a sink for carbon, absorbing it from the atmosphere, but also as a source, releasing it back through constant exchange. The atmospheric carbon pool's capacity to trap heat increases as more CO2 is added, emphasizing the importance of understanding carbon storage dynamics. The Northern Hemisphere acts as a sink for atmospheric carbon during spring and summer due to photosynthesis, but becomes a source in fall and winter through respiration. Human activities contribute around 9 GtC of carbon to the atmosphere annually, but when subtracted, the net flux of CO2 is close to zero. This highlights the importance of understanding carbon storage dynamics to address global warming concerns. The net flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has been close to zero for 10,000 years prior to 1750, with a relatively stable concentration of CO2 between 260 and 280 ppm. However, human activities have increased atmospheric CO2 levels by approximately 100 ppm since 1750, leading to a continuous rise in CO2 concentrations despite the oceans and land surface absorbing more CO2 than they release. About 45% of CO2 released from fossil fuel combustion and land use activities in the 1990s has remained in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide released from fossil fuel combustion and land use activities in the 1990s has mostly been absorbed by the oceans, vegetation, or soils on land. However, if CO2 emissions continue to increase, atmospheric concentrations will rise, leading to continued warming of the planet. The oceans and land surface are currently acting as sinks for CO2, but their capacity may be limited as they accumulate more carbon. Carbon sinks, such as vegetation and soils, accumulate more carbon than they emit to the atmosphere, acting as a net sink for CO2. Policy makers advocate for strategies to increase CO2 uptake and storage through land use changes. The behavior of carbon sinks in the future is a key question for scientists and policy makers. Land use practices, including deforestation, release carbon into the atmosphere. Despite some regions releasing more carbon than is captured, overall, the land surface acts as a global net sink of approximately 1 GtC per year. Tropical lands may even be carbon-neutral. The \"residual land sink\" component in the global carbon cycle, previously known as the \"missing sink,\" is responsible for the net uptake of carbon from the atmosphere to the land surface. The mechanisms behind this residual land sink, such as the fertilizing effect of increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations on plant growth, are not well understood. Many experiments show enhanced plant growth from increased CO2 concentrations, but nutrient and water limitations are common. Long-term observations suggest fertilization effects are too small to explain the land sink in the United States. Approximately 0.5 GtC per year accumulates in terrestrial sinks in North America, with a large fraction possibly coming from regrowth of forests on abandoned farmland. Woody encroachment is also contributing to the increase in woody biomass. The regrowth of forests on abandoned U.S. farmland and woody encroachment are significant terrestrial sinks, potentially accounting for over 20% of the net North American sink. Other carbon sinks in North America include wood products, wetlands, and oceans, which store more carbon than the land surface. If not for these sinks, CO2 concentration in the atmosphere would increase faster. The oceans act as a net sink for about 1.7 GtC per year and could store over 90% of all carbon. The oceans store more carbon than the land surface and could potentially store over 90% of all carbon released by human activities. CO2 entering the oceans increases acidity, affecting marine life. The rate of CO2 storage in the oceans depends on ocean mixing and transport to deeper waters. The slow rate of ocean mixing and transport of CO2 to deeper waters influence the effectiveness of the ocean sink for CO2. Large-scale circulation of the oceans around the globe, particularly in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean, plays a critical role in this process. The Southern Ocean around Antarctica is a significant contributor to the net air-sea flux of anthropogenic carbon, with a large portion of dissolved CO2 transported north towards the subtropics. The Southern Ocean is a key CO2 sink, but its ability to absorb carbon may be weakening. Congress is considering legislative strategies to address the human impact on the global carbon cycle. Uncertainty remains about whether the oceans and land will continue to absorb more carbon than they release as CO2 levels rise. Most North American terrestrial carbon sinks, like forest regrowth, sequester carbon naturally with little deliberate action. The future behavior of the unmanaged terrestrial carbon sink is uncertain, with some current sinks potentially becoming sources of carbon due to factors like melting permafrost and severe wildfires. Lawmakers need to consider how management practices could impact the net carbon balance. Some land management practices, like afforestation and conservation tillage, could increase carbon sequestration. Policy makers need to consider accurate accounting for carbon sequestered by these practices. The future behavior of the ocean sink, especially the Southern Ocean, is crucial for the net ocean-atmosphere CO2 flux. Managing the ocean carbon sink is different from terrestrial sinks, and techniques like iron fertilization are proposed for increasing ocean carbon sequestration. Proposed methods for increasing ocean carbon sequestration, such as iron fertilization and deep ocean CO2 injection, are experimental with unknown long-term environmental consequences. Uncertainty in carbon sink behavior makes accurately predicting future atmospheric CO2 concentrations challenging, even with precise control over emissions. Changes in carbon uptake/release from oceans, soils, or vegetation could impact predictions. Policy makers aiming to limit atmospheric CO2 levels may need to understand these complexities. Congress may need to understand the factors affecting the rate of carbon uptake and release by oceans and land surfaces if atmospheric CO2 levels fall below a certain threshold."
