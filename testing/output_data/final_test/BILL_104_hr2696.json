    "content": "The \"Agricultural Equity Act of 1995\" includes provisions for nonrecourse loans and deficiency payments for specific crops from 1996 to 2002. It also addresses the review of production agriculture's status and future. Congress finds that American agriculture and related industries are crucial for the US economy, providing over 21 million jobs and contributing over $41 trillion to the GDP. The future of American agriculture depends on the viability of producers, ensuring a dependable food and fiber supply at fair prices. Agricultural producers must receive a fair return for their efforts. Agricultural producers need fair returns due to foreign competition and price fluctuations. US must compete globally in agriculture, with exports contributing significantly to the economy and job market. Commodity Credit Corporation outlays for farm programs have decreased significantly. The reduction in farm program outlays from fiscal year 1986 to 1995 was over 65 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The policy of the United States is to provide continued Federal Government support for stability in American agriculture, ensuring a steady food and fiber supply at fair prices and enhancing farmer profitability. The purpose of this Act is to establish agricultural price support and production adjustment programs for the 1996 through 2002 crop years to enhance farmer profitability, encourage young farmers to stay on the farm, maintain competitiveness in the world market, and preserve a sound agricultural economy. Farm program spending reductions should be fair and equitable to achieve a balanced budget for the Federal Government. The Sense of Congress on ending the federal deficit is outlined in Section 3 of the Act. The sense of Congress is that Federal budget deficits harm the US economy and agricultural policy, price support programs are vital for US agriculture's competitiveness, and these programs should align with the goal of ending budget deficits. Federal budget deficits should be addressed to comply with budget reconciliation instructions and end deficits, in line with the goals of agricultural price support programs. SEC. 4. Nonrecourse loans and deficiency payments for various crops from 1996 to 2002. Nonrecourse loans are available for covered commodities including rice, upland cotton, feed grains, wheat, and oilseeds. Feed grains include corn, grain sorghum, barley, and oats, while oilseeds consist of soybeans, sunflower seeds, canola, and others determined by the Secretary. Loan levels are specified for each covered commodity for the 1996-2002 crops. Loan levels for covered commodities are set at 100 percent of the average price received by producers over the past 5 marketing years, excluding the highest and lowest years. The Secretary can adjust levels based on market price changes. No marketing loans or deficiency payments are available for producers for the 1996-2002 crops. Deficiency payments are available for producers of covered commodities from 1996 to 2002, calculated based on payment rate, payment acres, and farm program yield. The minimum established price for 1991-1995 crops continues for 1996-2002. The payment rate for covered commodities from 1996 to 2002 is determined by the target price minus the loan level or average market price. Payment acres are calculated as base acres minus idled and flex acres. The partial payment programs are discontinued starting from the 1996 crop year. The Secretary will increase producer planting flexibility by raising the mandatory flex acreage percentage and offering a voluntary increase in flex acres. Producers must obtain catastrophic risk protection insurance for eligibility for crop loans and deficiency payments. Certain sections of the Agricultural Act of 1949 are repealed. The repeal of certain sections of the Agricultural Act of 1949 will not affect the Secretary's authority to implement price support or production adjustment programs for crops from 1991 to 1995. SEC. 5. REVIEW OF STATUS AND FUTURE OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a review of production agriculture and farming communities in the US, assessing food security, farm land values, producer incomes, and regulatory relief. The review of production agriculture and farming communities in the US will include assessing cost-benefit principles in agricultural regulations, tax relief for agricultural producers, government interference in export markets, future relationship with production agriculture post-2002, and long-term goals for farming communities in the United States. The Secretary will develop legislative proposals to implement recommendations for agriculture and farming communities in the US. Reports on findings and recommendations will be submitted to the President and relevant committees by March 31, 1997. Hearings may be conducted as needed for this purpose. The Secretary may obtain necessary information from other government agencies to implement this section."
