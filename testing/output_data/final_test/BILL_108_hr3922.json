    "content": "The Act titled \"Drug Impaired Driving Enforcement Act of 2004\" is cited as the short title. The findings section follows. Congress finds that driving under the influence of illegal drugs is a significant problem worldwide. In 2002, over 35 million people in the US aged 12 or older had used illegal drugs, with almost 11 million driving under the influence. Research shows that drug abuse impairs driving performance, and illegal drugs are a factor in 10 to 22 percent of all motor vehicle crashes. Drug impaired drivers are involved in motor vehicle crashes; they are less frequently detected and prosecuted compared to drunk drivers. There is inconsistency among states in handling drug impaired drivers. Per se drug impaired driving laws are effective in dealing with these offenders. Driving under the influence of drugs is illegal in all states. While states have consistent methods for identifying alcohol impairment in drivers, there is no uniform approach for detecting drug impairment. The purposes of this Act include providing a model for States to enforce drug impaired driving laws, identifying and assisting drivers in need of drug education or treatment, advancing research on drugged driving, and enhancing training for traffic safety officers and prosecutors. In this Act, definitions for \"controlled substance,\" \"license,\" and \"revocation\" are provided, including details on what each term encompasses under the law. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms such as \"State,\" \"suspension,\" \"Secretary,\" \"inhalant,\" and \"drug recognition expert\" in relation to laws governing motor vehicle operation. The curr_chunk describes a procedure to determine if an individual is under the influence of drugs and identify the specific drug causing impairment. The curr_chunk provides a model statute for determining drug influence and identifying specific drugs causing impairment. The Secretary will develop a model statute for drug impaired driving, including provisions for operating a vehicle with any detectable amount of a controlled substance in the body or when mental or physical faculties are noticeably affected by a controlled substance. The model statute for drug impaired driving includes sanctions for refusing a test for controlled substances and allows lawful use of prescribed substances as a defense, except when faculties are noticeably impaired. The model statute for drug impaired driving includes evaluation, counseling, treatment, and penalties for repeat offenses, such as felony imprisonment for a third offense within 10 years. States can suspend or revoke licenses for drug-impaired driving convictions, and sentences for these offenses must be served consecutively. The sentence for impaired driving must be served consecutively, not concurrently with any other criminal act, except when based on an alternate theory of culpability for the same act. SEC. 6. USE OF GRANTS TO ENFORCE DRUG IMPAIRED DRIVING LAWS. Section 410 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to include provisions for individuals driving under the influence of controlled substances. This amendment also requires states to maintain efforts in drug impaired driving traffic safety programs. Additionally, states must provide programs for detecting controlled substances as part of their basic grant requirements. The amendment to Section 410 of title 23 requires states to have programs for detecting controlled substances in drivers and occupants of vehicles, as well as enforcing a model drug impaired driving statute on a statewide basis. Additionally, programs for counseling and treatment of individuals convicted of drug impaired driving must be provided. The amendment to Section 410 of title 23 mandates states to implement programs for detecting controlled substances in drivers and occupants of vehicles, enforce a model drug impaired driving statute statewide, and provide counseling and treatment for convicted individuals. Training for law enforcement officers and prosecutors in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting drug impaired driving is also required, along with education and research programs to advance knowledge in this area. The curr_chunk focuses on driving advancements in research, technology, and policy to key policymakers, prosecutors, law enforcement, and judges. The curr_chunk discusses research and development initiatives related to detecting drug use, improving testing technology, determining impairment levels for controlled substances, and training goals for law enforcement. The curr_chunk discusses the amendment to Section 403 of title 23, United States Code, which includes training goals for enhancing states' ability to detect, enforce, and prosecute drug impaired driving laws. The Secretary is required to establish programs for police and prosecutor training, ensure drug impaired driving enforcement training exists in all states by 2006, and train at least 10% of police officers in drug enforcement. The curr_chunk discusses the training goals for enforcing drug impaired driving laws, including training for traffic monitoring and enforcement personnel and state prosecutors. The goal is to have all states equipped with training by December 31, 2010, and to ensure that at least 10% of prosecutors are trained in prosecuting drug impaired driving laws. The Secretary is required to report to Congress on the progress of implementing the Act, including uniform drugged driving laws and new research. Additionally, a minimum of $2,000,000 per fiscal year is allocated for drug impaired driving traffic safety programs."
