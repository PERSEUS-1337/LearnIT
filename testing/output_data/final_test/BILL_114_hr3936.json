    "content": "The \"Veteran Engagement Teams Act\" or \"VET Act\" establishes a pilot program on Department of Veterans Affairs Veteran Engagement Team events. The \"VET Act\" establishes a 3-year pilot program for Veteran Engagement Team events, to be carried out monthly in 10 regional offices of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The \"VET Act\" establishes a pilot program for Veteran Engagement Team events to be held monthly in 15 regional offices of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The events will assist veterans with disability compensation and pension claims. The pilot program for Veteran Engagement Team events in 15 regional offices of the Department of Veterans Affairs includes events at different locations, with necessary personnel available for claim adjudication and assistance from veterans service organizations. Veterans unable to complete claims at events are informed of next steps. The Secretary coordinates with veteran organizations and selects easily accessible locations for Veteran Engagement Team events. Physicians cannot be permanently transferred for staffing these events, and salaries for work at these events are paid from available amounts. The Secretary may coordinate with various entities to host Veteran Engagement Team events at minimal costs and accept services from non-Department physicians for medical opinions. Customer satisfaction surveys will be conducted as part of the pilot program. The Secretary will collect and analyze information on customer satisfaction of veterans who received assistance at Veteran Engagement Team events. Reports on the program's implementation and effectiveness, including completed claims, reasons for incomplete claims, and customer satisfaction analysis, will be submitted to Congress annually. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 is amended to limit awards and bonuses paid to Department of Veterans Affairs employees. The aggregate amount of awards and bonuses is capped at $250,000,000 for fiscal year 2017 and $360,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2018 to 2024. The document is attested by Karen L. Haas, Clerk."
