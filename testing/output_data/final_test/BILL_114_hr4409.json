    "content": "The \"Made in America Act of 2016\" may be cited as the America Star Labels Act. The Commission will establish America Star labels for products to indicate their United States origin within 2 years of the Act's enactment. Four labels will be created, including one for products meeting the standard for a United States origin claim. The America Star labels will indicate the United States origin of products based on the percentage of manufacturing costs attributed to the US, with labels for products meeting 90%, 80%, and 70% US cost criteria as determined by the Enforcement Policy Statement. The America Star labels are designed to provide clarity for consumers on the US manufacturing extent, encourage more US manufacturing, and emphasize the importance of domestic manufacturing for the US economy. Regulations will establish the appearance, content, and additional standards for the labels. The America Star labels are intended to clarify the US manufacturing extent, promote domestic manufacturing, and highlight its significance for the economy. Regulations will define the criteria for using the labels, ensuring they align with public perceptions and are not misleading. The use of labels is voluntary, and the Commission cannot mandate their use. The Commission cannot require a person claiming a product is of US origin to use an America Star label. The Act does not affect existing standards for origin claims. The Commission must consult with Customs and the Trade Representative when creating regulations.
