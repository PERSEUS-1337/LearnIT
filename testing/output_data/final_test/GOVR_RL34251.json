    "content": "Four groups of federal programs target unemployed workers: unemployment insurance, health care assistance, job search help, and training. These programs interact with each other and provide funding. Unemployed workers may face income loss, and their families could qualify for means-tested benefits like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, SSI, or Medicaid. Eligibility for these benefits is not based on current employment status. The report does not cover these means-tested benefits. Unemployment Compensation (UC) program offers income support to eligible workers who lose their jobs, and those who exhaust UC benefits may qualify for other assistance. The UC program provides income support to eligible workers who lose their jobs. Those who exhaust UC benefits may be eligible for additional weeks of unemployment compensation through the EUC08 or EB programs. The maximum potential duration of EUC08 benefits is 47 weeks, depending on state unemployment rates. Certain groups of workers may qualify for additional income support through TAA programs. The UC program provides income support to eligible workers who lose their jobs. If a worker is not eligible for UC benefits due to a declared major disaster, they may be eligible for Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) benefits. The UC system is funded by federal taxes under FUTA and state payroll taxes under SUTA. In FY2012, states spent $44.3 billion on regular UC benefits. The federal government appropriates funds for UC program administration, EB payments, the EUC08 program, and federal loans to insolvent state UC programs. The 2009 stimulus package provided additional funds for states to administer UC programs, which pay benefits to eligible workers who become involuntarily unemployed. States disqualify claimants who lost their jobs due to inability to work, unavailability for work, or a labor dispute. The 2009 stimulus package provided up to $7 billion for states to modernize their Unemployment Insurance programs. Maximum weekly benefit amounts in July 2012 ranged from $133 to $653, with an average weekly benefit of $302 in November 2012. Claimants must have enough recent earnings to meet state requirements to receive UC benefits. In November 2012, the average weekly Unemployment Compensation (UC) benefit was $302, with a duration of 17.1 weeks. 25% of U.S. unemployed workers received UC benefits in September 2012. The EUC08 program, created in June 2008, has been extended multiple times, most recently until January 1, 2014. The duration of EUC08 benefits depends on the state's unemployment rate. The EUC08 program provides up to 47 weeks of benefits in high unemployment states, with different tiers offering varying durations based on the state's unemployment rate. All EUC08 benefits expire by January 1, 2014, with no extensions beyond that date. The EB program, established by P.L. 91-373 (26 U.S.C. 3304 note), may extend UC benefits at the state level if certain economic conditions exist within the state. The EB program is permanently authorized and triggered when a state's insured unemployment rate (IUR) or total unemployment rate (TUR) reaches certain levels. States must pay up to 13 weeks of EB if the IUR for the previous 13 weeks is at least 5% and is 120% of the average of the rates for the same 13-week period in each of the two previous years. Optional thresholds allow for an additional 13 weeks of benefits if the state's IUR is at least 6%. The EB program provides additional weeks of benefits based on specific state unemployment rates. Claimants must meet state requirements for UC eligibility and have 20 weeks of full-time employment in their base period. The federal government temporarily finances 100% of the EB program until December 31, 2013. The EB program, funded by the federal government and states, allows for additional weeks of benefits based on state unemployment rates. P.L. 111-312 made temporary changes to EB triggers, allowing states to use a three-year lookback for IUR and TUR triggers. This adjustment is crucial as some states may soon trigger off EB benefits despite sustained unemployment rates. States must individually amend their UC laws to implement these changes. The EUC08 program is temporary and its availability depends on state unemployment rates and calendar dates. On the other hand, the EB program is permanently authorized and applies to certain states based on specific unemployment conditions. States were previously allowed to choose between paying EB or EUC08 first, with Alaska being the only state to pay EB first. However, with the enactment of P.L. 112-96, states are now required to follow a specific order. The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers program (TAA) provides federal assistance to workers dislocated by international trade, including income support, job search assistance, health coverage tax credit, and training assistance. Eligibility is established through a petition to the Department of Labor (DOL) showing job loss due to foreign competition. If DOL certifies the petition, workers are eligible for TAA benefits. Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) is an extended income support program available to TAA-eligible workers who have exhausted their UC. TRA payments begin when the worker is no longer entitled to UC and interact with UC to provide a single duration of benefits. Basic TRA is available to workers who have completed qualified training or received a waiver from training. The Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) provides income support to TAA-eligible workers who have completed training or received a waiver. Basic TRA lasts for 52 weeks, with UC benefits offsetting TRA. Additional TRA can be accessed for up to 65 weeks, totaling 117 weeks, for workers in an eligible training program. If pursuing a degree or credential, TRA can be extended for 13 more weeks, reaching a total of 130 weeks. The Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) provides income support to TAA-eligible workers for up to 130 weeks, including basic TRA lasting 52 weeks with UC benefits offsetting TRA. Additional TRA can be accessed for up to 65 weeks, totaling 117 weeks, for workers in an eligible training program. The program is authorized through the end of calendar year 2013. Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) is a wage insurance program for TAA-certified workers aged 50 and over who secure reemployment at a lower wage than their certified jobs. RTAA provides a wage supplement equal to 50% of the difference between the worker's reemployment wage and the wage at his or her certified job, with a maximum benefit of $10,000. The program will revert to more restrictive eligibility criteria and lower benefit levels specified by the Trade Act of 2002 for one year before expiring on December 31, 2014. In FY2011, $40 million was paid to over 6,100 participants in the RTAA wage insurance program. The Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) program provides monetary assistance to individuals unemployed due to a major disaster. DUA is funded by FEMA and administered by DOL through each state's UC agency. DUA benefits are authorized by the Stafford Act, allowing the President to declare a major disaster. The President may declare a major disaster in a state, providing assistance under the Stafford Act including repair of facilities, cash grants for victims, housing, and unemployment aid. DUA benefit payments were significant after Hurricane Katrina, totaling $401 million in FY2006. Additionally, federal laws like COBRA can help unemployed workers purchase health insurance. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) allows certain unemployed workers to purchase continued health insurance coverage from their previous employers. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) provides a tax credit for purchasing health insurance to certain Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) participants. COBRA requires employers to offer continued coverage to former employees under certain circumstances, helping them access group rate coverage in situations like termination or reduction in hours of employment. COBRA coverage is available in the individual insurance market and generally lasts 18 months, but can be longer depending on circumstances. It applies to self-insured firms and state/local workers. Some individuals may not have access to COBRA, such as those working for firms with fewer than 20 employees or those without current health insurance access. The cost of COBRA premiums may be prohibitive for some individuals. The cost of COBRA premiums may be prohibitive for the unemployed, especially when compared to unemployment compensation. In 2011, average COBRA premiums were $460 per month for individual coverage and $1,280 per month for family coverage. This high cost is likely the reason for low COBRA participation rates, ranging from 18% to 26%. Workers receiving TRA, UI, or RTAA wage insurance may qualify for the Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC), set at 72.5% of premium costs. The credit can be claimed when filing taxes or paid in advance to insurers. HCTC recipients cannot have certain other health insurance or be entitled to Medicare. TRA recipients can receive the credit for one month longer than TRA eligibility, while RTAA recipients may receive it for two years. The HCTC program will end on January 1, 2014. The HCTC program, set at 72.5% of premium costs, will expire on January 1, 2014, coinciding with new federal tax credits for health coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Federal support for employment is provided through One-Stop Career Centers, established by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. These centers offer a labor exchange system accessible to job seekers and employers, managed by the U.S. Employment Service since 1933. The Employment Service (ES) was established by the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933 to facilitate the match between job seekers and employers. Services are provided without fees at local ES offices, offering career counseling, job search workshops, and referrals to job openings. States deliver ES services through self-service, facilitated self-help, and staff-assisted tiers. The Employment Service (ES) offices provide a range of services from job postings to career counseling. They also administer the UC \"work test\" requirements for UC claimants. ES processes UC income support claims and helps individuals find new employment. Total funding for Wagner-Peyser activities was $786.7 million in FY2012, with additional funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Workers covered by a certified TAA petition are eligible for case management and employment services. Employment services for TAA-certified workers are more intensive and provided at the same locations as public employment services. Workers may receive job search and relocation allowances up to $1,250 each if they cannot find suitable local employment. Funding for these services comes from the TAA Reemployment Services funding granted to states annually. The TAA Reemployment Services funding, allocated to states annually, primarily supports training benefits. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 established linkages between WIA training activities and various targeted populations, including TAA-eligible workers, military veterans, and older workers. WIA includes titles authorizing programs for job training, adult education, vocational rehabilitation, and employment services. Title I of WIA provides employment and training services for unemployed and underemployed individuals through state formula grant programs. WIA programs operate on a program year basis and are funded through annual appropriations. Table 1 provides detailed national funding information for WIA Title I programs, which include youth, adult, and dislocated worker programs that fund activities at One-Stop Career Centers. One-Stop Career Centers receive funds through statutory formulas based on unemployment and poverty measures for youth, adult, and dislocated worker allocations. Funds are distributed to local workforce investment boards for employment and training services targeting individuals aged 18 and older. Services include core services like job search assistance, intensive services like individual career planning, and job training for occupational skills development. In FY2012, state grants for adults and dislocated workers received funding totaling $770.8 million and $1.008 billion respectively. The majority of dislocated worker funds are allocated to states for training services, with the remainder reserved for National Emergency Grants. These grants provide employment and training assistance to workers affected by major economic dislocations. The formula grant program provides training and related services to low-income youths aged 14-21 who face barriers to employment, with funding of $824.4 million in FY2012. Job Corps, programs for Native Americans, and migrant and seasonal farm workers receive training funds through national grant programs. Job Corps, established in 1964, offers residential job training services to low-income individuals aged 16-24 through contracts with DOL, with 125 centers in 48 states and the District of Columbia. In FY2012, Job Corps centers received $1.7 billion in funding, while the Native Americans program received $47.6 million and the National Farmworker Jobs Program received $84.3 million. Other competitive grant programs under the WIA legislation provide training and related services to various disadvantaged groups. The Veterans' Workforce Investment Program, funded at $14.6 million in FY2012, provides training and services to veterans through competitive grants. Administered by DOL's Veterans' Employment and Training Service, it aims to implement the Workforce Data Quality Initiative (WDQI) in up to 12 states. The WDQI, funded at $6.5 million in FY2012, merges workforce and education data to build longitudinal data systems. The Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program, funded at $80.2 million in FY2012, combines the Prisoner Reentry Initiative (PRI) and the Responsible Reintegration of Youthful Offenders (RRYO) to support projects providing education and construction skills training for disadvantaged youth. Administered by the Department of Labor (DOL) since FY2007, the program aims to help recently released prisoners and young offenders find work and prevent youth from getting involved in the juvenile justice system. The YouthBuild Transfer Act (P.L. 109-281) was established in FY2007 to provide work experience, job training, education, and leadership development for youth by rehabilitating housing for homeless and low-income families. In FY2012, YouthBuild received $79.7 million in funding. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) received $4.9 billion in appropriations in FY2012, with $2.6 billion allocated to states for One-Stop centers. WIA Title I programs target unemployed individuals but also benefit the employed. Program-by-program funding details for FY2012 are provided in Table 1. The WIA statute mandates connections between the nation's One-Stop system and various employment, education, and social service programs. Two partners fund employment and training activities for trade-affected workers and low-income older Americans. TAA-certified workers are eligible for training assistance lasting up to 104 weeks. In FY2011, over 86,000 workers participated in TAA-funded training, funded annually by the TAA reemployment services funding. $575 million is distributed each year under the 2011 reauthorization (P.L. 112-40) based on the number of recent TAA-certified individuals in a state and local training costs. The Community Service Employment for Older Americans program, administered by the Department of Labor, aims to create part-time job opportunities in community service for low-income individuals aged 55 and older with poor job prospects. Older workers participating in the RTAA program may not receive training assistance if they work full-time, but those working part-time must be enrolled in a training program to receive wage supplements. The Community Service Employment for Older Americans (CSEOA) program targets individuals aged 55 or older with poor job prospects. It aims to create part-time job opportunities in community service and provides subsidized employment for older workers with special needs. Program participation is limited to 48 months, and funding for FY2012 was $448.3 million, representing 23% of OAA funds."
