    "content": "The economic downturn starting in 2007 impacted U.S. manufacturing, especially the automotive industry. GM and Chrysler received government aid for restructuring. The Obama Administration formed the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry in 2009, led by Geithner and Summers. U.S. automakers faced financial difficulties due to setbacks in the automotive industry. Delphi Corporation, a Tier 1 supplier for GM, declared bankruptcy in 2005. GM later declared bankruptcy in 2009 and did not assume Delphi's pension liabilities, which were taken over by the PBGC. Delphi retirees may have seen their pension benefits reduced by the PBGC if their monthly benefit exceeded the statutory maximum. Some union workers received supplemental \"top-off\" benefits from GM after their pensions were transferred to the PBGC. A lawsuit was filed against the PBGC in 2009 by current and future salaried employees seeking restoration of their pension benefits. GM had agreements with unions representing Delphi workers for supplemental benefits. Delphi, formerly known as Automotive Components Group (ACG), was created by GM in 1989 by combining suppliers. In 1999, GM sold Delphi through an IPO, making it a separate corporation. Delphi took over pension plans from GM for its workers, with hourly employees being union members and salaried employees having separate benefit plans. GM made agreements with unions to protect post-retirement benefits for hourly workers during the spin-off of Delphi, a separate corporation created in 1999. Salaried workers, who were non-union, did not receive benefit guarantees. Employer-sponsored pension plans in the U.S. include defined contribution (DC) and defined benefit (DB) plans, with DC plans allowing employees to direct investment decisions and bear investment risks. Defined contribution (DC) plans like 401(k), 403(b), or 457 plans require employees to make investment decisions and bear the risk of losses. On the other hand, defined benefit (DB) pensions are employer-funded plans where employees accrue monthly benefits based on years of service and salary. Employers are responsible for ensuring there are enough funds in DB pension plans to cover current and future benefit payments. ERISA protects participants in qualified employee benefit plans by ensuring plans are operated in their best interests, with provisions for vesting, funding, and pension insurance. Participants in DB plans have a claim on their vested benefits and cannot have them reduced by plan sponsors. ERISA established a government corporation, PBGC, to insure private sector DB plans' pension benefits. When a plan is underfunded and cannot pay all benefits, PBGC may step in to pay retirees up to certain limits. PBGC does not cover unpredictable events or benefits increased within five years of termination. Funding for PBGC benefits comes from insurance premiums paid by plan sponsors, not taxpayer funds. The PBGC collects insurance premiums from employers with insured pension plans, receives funds from plans it takes over, and earns money from investments. The maximum guarantee for a pension terminated in 2009 is $4,500 per month ($54,000 per year) for retirees starting at age 65. Benefits are adjusted for retirees choosing different forms or starting before 65. For example, retirees at 65 choosing a Joint and 50% Survivor Annuity get $4,050 per month ($48,600 per year), while those at 55 with single life annuity benefits receive $2,025 per month ($24,300 per year). In 2006, 84% of PBGC retirees received their full benefit amount. As part of a spin-off in 1999, GM continued paying pension benefits to workers who retired before October 1, 2000. Workers who retired after that date had their pension benefits managed by Delphi pension plans. GM also made Benefit Guarantee Agreements with three unions to supplement benefits for workers reaching the maximum benefit from the PBGC. Delphi filed for bankruptcy in October 2005, leading to the transfer of liabilities from the Delphi Hourly Plan to the GM Hourly-Rate Employees Pension Plan. GM later filed for bankruptcy in June 2009 and received U.S. government financial assistance. In July 2009, GM decided not to assume the Hourly Plan and declined to transfer additional liabilities from Delphi. GM declined to assume additional liabilities from the Delphi pension plans, leading to the termination of the Delphi pension plans by the PBGC in July 2009. GM announced it would fulfill its obligations to Hourly Plan retirees by supplementing pension benefits for those receiving the maximum benefit from the PBGC. General Motors Corporation agreed to supplement pension benefits for certain groups of hourly employees and retirees in the event of plan termination. The ERISA provides for three types of single-employer pension plan terminations: standard, distress, and involuntary. The PBGC can initiate involuntary termination proceedings for pension plans that do not meet funding requirements or are unable to pay benefits when due. Delphi pension plans were subject to involuntary termination by the PBGC in July 2009. The PBGC initiated termination proceedings for Delphi pension plans due to funding deficiencies. Delphi had not made required contributions, leading to assets covering only half of benefit obligations. PBGC took over responsibility for multiple pension plans with thousands of participants. DSRA filed a lawsuit in 2009. The Delphi Salaried Retiree Association (DSRA) filed a lawsuit in 2009 against PBGC, U.S. Treasury Department, and Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry. Claims include violations of Due Process Clause, ERISA, and Equal Protection Clause. DSRA alleges discrimination against salaried employees by GM post-bankruptcy. The DSRA filed a lawsuit against PBGC, U.S. Treasury Department, and Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry, alleging discrimination against salaried employees by GM post-bankruptcy. The court ruled in January 2010 that PBGC could reduce pension payments, leading to DSRA claiming violations of the ruling. The U.S. district court dismissed claims against the U.S. Treasury in September 2011, with PBGC remaining a defendant. DSRA submitted an affidavit stating PBGC miscalculated benefit obligations and that the pension plan for salaried employees was 86.52% funded. The Delphi Salaried Employees' pension plan had $2.4 billion in assets and $5 billion in liabilities at termination. PBGC expected to cover $2.2 billion of the $2.6 billion underfunding. Delphi emerged from bankruptcy in 2009, with GM acquiring some assets. Delphi reported $13.8 billion in sales in 2010. PBGC redeemed its stake in Delphi for $594 million in 2011. The PBGC acquired a stake in Delphi during pension plan termination proceedings. Final benefit determinations for Delphi retirees are expected to be completed by September 30, 2015. Chairman Dave Camp requested documents related to Delphi and GM's interest in Delphi. Chairman Camp requested documents from the U.S. Treasury and White House Counsel regarding GM's interest in Delphi. The Treasury's response was deemed incomplete, leading Chairman Camp to consider using compulsory process to obtain the documents. No public response has been received from the U.S. Treasury or White House Counsel. Several hearings and requests were made to officials in the Obama Administration regarding GM's decision to honor top-up agreements with union workers. Representative Darrell Issa subpoenaed Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew for information related to the preferential treatment of Delphi's unionized employees during GM's bankruptcy and bailout. A report by SIGTARP noted that the decision to honor the top-up agreement was a joint decision by the U.S. Treasury and GM, done to secure UAW approval for GM's bankruptcy. In the 111th, 112th, and 113th Congresses, legislation has been introduced and hearings held related to Delphi and the decision to top up the pensions of union but not salaried workers. Three bills were introduced in the first session of the 113th Congress regarding Delphi Corporation, including H.R. 2783 to extend the Health Coverage Tax Credit for eligible individuals. The Revenue Code of 1986 introduced legislation to extend the Health Care Tax Credit (HCTC) for PBGC pension recipients. Several bills were introduced in Congress to extend the HCTC, including the Health Care Coverage for Displaced Workers Act and the Tax Extenders Act of 2013. Additionally, bills were introduced regarding Delphi Corporation, such as the Delphi Pensions Restoration Act of 2012. A fund was established to provide retirement benefits for Delphi retirees whose pensions were reduced by the PBGC. The funds would come from the sale of stock acquired by the U.S. Treasury while assisting GM. H.R. 4232, introduced by Representative Michael Turner, aimed to make agencies with U.S. equity subject to FOIA requirements. The bills introduced in the 111th Congress aimed to evaluate assistance provided to General Motors under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Legislation included S. 3526 and H.R. 6046 introduced in 2010, and H.R. 3455 and S. 1663 introduced in 2009 to provide funding from the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act for GM. The 111th Congress introduced bills to evaluate assistance to General Motors under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. H.Res. 591 requested details on the role of the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry in relation to benefits for GM and Delphi employees. No further action was taken on the bills. The 113th Congress held hearings on Delphi Corporation's pension bailout, while the 112th Congress focused on the auto bailouts and Delphi pension decisions. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform conducted various hearings regarding the treatment of Delphi retirees. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held hearings in Dayton, Ohio, on November 14, 2011, and June 22, 2011, regarding the Delphi Pension Fallout and General Motors Bailout implications. Other congressional hearings in the 111th Congress focused on the challenges facing Delphi retirees after the financial crisis and the impact of Delphi's bankruptcy on workers and retirees. The Senate HELP Committee held a hearing on October 29, 2009, titled \"Pensions in Peril: Helping Workers Preserve Retirement Security through a Recession,\" focusing on the impact of Delphi's bankruptcy on workers and retirees. Bruce Gump, Chairman of Delphi Salaried Retirees Association, provided testimony."
