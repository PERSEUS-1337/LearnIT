    "content": "Free trade areas, customs unions, common markets, and economic unions are different types of preferential trade arrangements where member countries grant each other preferential treatment in trade. Free trade areas involve eliminating tariffs and nontariff barriers on trade within the area, while customs unions maintain common tariffs outside the arrangement. Common markets go beyond customs unions by removing barriers to labor and capital flows, and economic unions further merge economies by establishing a common currency and unified monetary policy. The European Union is a significant example of an economic union. The process of forming a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) involves discussions between trading partners to determine feasibility, followed by negotiations on tariff elimination and nontariff trade barriers. Rules of origin are established to define eligible products for duty-free treatment within the FTA. Disputes among members are resolved through agreed procedures. Most FTAs include procedures for dispute settlement, border controls, and rules on economic activities beyond trade in goods. The size and complexity of an FTA reflect the economic relations among participating countries. FTAs eliminate tariffs and nontariff barriers, allowing easier access to each other's markets. U.S. FTAs with Israel and Jordan are basic, while NAFTA is complex. Countries form FTAs for economic and political reasons. FTAs are formed to encourage trade liberalization and investment. They protect local exporters and can be a response to slow progress in multilateral negotiations. The surge in FTA formation is partly due to difficulties in launching multilateral agreements like the Doha Round. The surge in forming Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) in recent years is partly due to challenges in launching multilateral negotiations like the Doha Development Agenda round in the WTO. Political motivations also drive FTA formation, such as the United States forming FTAs with Israel and Jordan to strengthen relations. Post-World War II trade policy in the US has aimed to secure open markets for exports, protect domestic producers, control trade for foreign policy and national security reasons, and promote global trade for economic growth. The United States has formed trade policy through multilateral negotiations like the GATT and WTO, as well as through unilateral actions threatening trade restrictions to open markets for U.S. exports. The United States has historically used unilateral actions to pressure trading partners to open their markets or change commercial practices. This approach was particularly prominent in the 1970s and 1980s with Japan. However, the focus has shifted towards bilateral and regional negotiations for Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), starting with agreements with Israel in 1985 and Canada in 1989. Under President Bush, NAFTA was expanded to Mexico and completed by the Clinton Administration in 1993. Bilateral and regional FTAs were becoming a fixture in U.S. foreign trade policymaking by 1994, with agreements like the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum aiming for free trade and investment by specific deadlines. The pursuit of FTAs continued under President Clinton, with agreements reached with Jordan, Singapore, and Chile in the early 2000s. Many countries were actively negotiating FTAs, with over 200 in force according to the WTO. The WTO has reported over 200 FTAs in force, including agreements between Canada and Chile, Mexico and Chile, and the EU with various countries. Japan formed an FTA with Singapore and is exploring one with Korea. The Bush Administration focused on bilateral and regional trade ties through FTAs, completing negotiations with Chile and Singapore in 2002. The Bush Administration's trade agenda included signing FTAs with Australia, Morocco, Central American countries, and the Dominican Republic (DR-CAFTA). These agreements were approved by Congress and signed into law between 2004 and 2006. The President also sent draft implementing legislation to Congress for the DR-CAFTA agreement in 2005, which was passed and signed into law in August of the same year. President Bush signed FTAs with El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Bahrain, and Oman between 2005 and 2009. The US also signed FTAs with Colombia, Peru, Panama, and South Korea under the Bush Administration. Congress passed implementing legislation for these agreements, with the U.S.-Peru FTA being signed into law in 2007. The U.S.-Peru FTA implementing legislation (H.R. 3688) was signed into law (P.L. 110-138) on December 14, 2007, and entered into force on February 1, 2009. Negotiations in May 2007 led to new policy priorities for pending FTAs, including labor standards, environmental agreements, generic pharmaceuticals, port security, and foreign investor rights. President Obama supported pending FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Negotiations for pending FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea faced challenges. Critics raised concerns about treatment of union leaders in Colombia and Panama's tax policies. Detroit-based car manufacturers opposed the South Korean agreement due to barriers to auto imports. Modifications were made in December 2010 to address these issues. Most modifications to the KORUS FTA were made in December 2010, with Ford and Chrysler supporting the agreement along with the UAW union. U.S.-based steel manufacturers opposed the deal, citing concerns about weakening trade remedy laws. The AFL-CIO and other major labor unions also oppose the agreement. Colombia agreed to an \"Action Plan Related to Labor Rights,\" while Panama ratified a Tax Information and Exchange Agreement with the U.S. on April 13, 2011. President Obama submitted draft implementing legislation to Congress on October 3, 2011, for each of the FTAs with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama. The bills were approved by the 112th Congress in successive votes on October 12, along with legislation to renew an aspect of the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. The agreements entered into force on different dates in 2012. The Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement (TPP) is a free trade agreement involving nations on both sides of the Pacific, including the United States, Australia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, and Vietnam. There is also interest in negotiating the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the United States and the European Union. The impact of these agreements on countries involved and the global economy has been a topic of study and debate among economists. The debate on Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) has resurfaced, focusing on the economic efficiency and trade creation/diversion concepts introduced by economist Jacob Viner in 1950. This debate has divided economists between those opposing FTAs and those supporting them for freer trade. FTA replaces domestic production with imports from FTA members, leading to trade creation and diversion. Trade diversion occurs when FTA members switch imports from efficient nonmembers to less efficient members due to tariff differences. FTAs can result in both trade creation and diversion, impacting economic welfare based on the FTA structure. Even if countries move towards freer trade in an FTA, it could make them and the world worse off if it diverts more trade than it creates. Economists have developed conditions under which an FTA would create more trade than it diverts, stating that trade creation is likely to exceed trade diversion based on tariff levels among members. Economists have determined that FTAs can lead to increased efficiency of production, economies of scale, and increased foreign investment. The formation of FTAs has been limited until recently, with the European Community and EU being key examples. Studies show that while the EU has led to more trade creation than diversion, sectors like agriculture have experienced trade diversion due to barriers raised by the Common Agricultural Policy. The MFN principle under GATT requires equal treatment for all trading partners. FTAs violate the MFN principle by giving preferential treatment to member countries. However, GATT recognizes that FTAs can improve economic welfare if trade diversion is minimized. Article XXIV of GATT requires FTA members to not increase barriers on nonmembers and eliminate tariffs on most trade between member territories. Article XXIV of GATT requires FTAs to eliminate duties and trade restrictions within a reasonable time frame, typically within 10 years. Member countries must notify the WTO of their FTA intentions. Developing countries can form preferential trading arrangements under the \"Enabling Clause\" without Article XXIV conditions. GATS Article V allows preferential treatment of trade in services within FTAs, with requirements for substantial coverage of service elimination. The WTO formed the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA) in 1996 to review FTAs and customs unions for compliance with GATT and GATS rules. However, there is ongoing debate within the CRTA due to ambiguous rules, such as defining \"substantially all trade\" and \"substantially all sectors.\" The number of FTAs and customs unions has rapidly increased, with 474 notified to the WTO as of July 2010, and 283 currently in force. The WTO formed the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA) in 1996 to review FTAs and customs unions for compliance with GATT and GATS rules. The remaining FTAs and customs unions have largely been superseded by other agreements. However, CRTA members have not reached a consensus on completing reports of notifications. The vast majority of FTAs have gone into operation, including NAFTA in January 1994. The proliferation of FTAs and disagreements on rules have hindered the WTO review process, leading to discussions on regional agreements in the Doha Development Agenda round. The surge in FTAs worldwide has sparked a spirited debate. The surge in FTAs worldwide has sparked a debate among experts, policy makers, and observers over their impact on U.S. economic interests and global trade liberalization. Views on FTAs can be categorized into three groups: those who oppose FTAs for undermining the multilateral trading system, those who support FTAs as building blocks for trade liberalization, and those opposed to trade liberalization in general due to concerns about workers, the environment, or U.S. sovereignty. International economists Jagdish Bhagwati and Anne O. Krueger argue against pursuing FTAs at the expense of multilateral negotiations in the WTO. They believe FTAs are discriminatory and trade diverting, with high tariffs on goods imported into developing countries and some labor-intensive goods in developed countries. They criticize the rules of origin and implementation schedules of FTAs. Bhagwati and Krueger criticize the rules of origin and implementation schedules of FTAs, arguing that the incongruity of regulations across FTAs creates a customs administration nightmare. They highlight how producers in one FTA partner are encouraged to purchase inputs from other partner countries to meet rules of origin requirements, even if non-FTA members can produce inputs more cheaply. This diverts imports from efficient producers outside the FTA to less efficient producers within the FTA. Economists like Lawrence argue that FTAs go beyond tariff elimination, promoting economic integration by reducing barriers on services trade and foreign investment. NAFTA has also spurred economic reform in Mexico, increasing efficiency and welfare, contrary to the concerns raised by Bhagwati and Krueger about trade diversion within FTAs. The CATO Institute study by economist Edward L. Hudgins argues that FTAs, despite potential trade diversion, can be more efficient in addressing trade barriers than the WTO. Economist C. Fred Bergsten also supports the idea that FTAs are beneficial for global trade when multilateral negotiations are not feasible. FTAs are seen as promoting global trade liberalization when multilateral negotiations are not possible. Bergsten and Schott advocate for U.S. FTAs with countries like New Zealand and South Korea to prevent discrimination against American firms. They suggest structuring FTAs as building blocks for a global free trade system, with an emphasis on open regionalism. Bergsten proposes an FTA model based on the APEC plan, allowing other countries to join under certain conditions to minimize trade diversion. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation of trade and investment on an MFN principle, with the suggestion of conditional MFN to limit \"free rider\" effects. Different proposals for global free trade associations are mentioned, with opposition from groups like labor unions and environmentalists who question the impact of trade liberalization on workers. Trade liberalization is criticized by groups like labor unions for exporting jobs to countries with lower wages and weakening environmental regulations. The United Auto Workers (UAW) opposes agreements like the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) for favoring corporations over workers and lacking protections for workers, consumers, and the environment. The U.S. government has been involved in negotiations regarding free trade agreements, including the TPP. Congress plays a role in reviewing and implementing FTAs. Questions arise about the economic impact of FTAs and their effects on different sectors. Free trade agreements (FTAs) can have varying effects on different sectors of the economy. Members of Congress must consider the impact on their constituents versus the overall impact on the United States and other trading partners. Evaluations of FTAs differ due to varying conditions and long-term effects. There is debate among economic specialists on whether bilateral and regional FTAs are the best trade policy strategy for U.S. national interests. Some specialists view FTAs as leading to confusion and hindering a rules-based multilateral trading system, while others see them as beneficial for promoting freer trade and protecting U.S. interests. Questions arise about the capacity of trade policy agencies to negotiate multiple FTAs simultaneously and the inclusion of non-trade concerns in FTAs. Including non-trade concerns in FTAs has become a key issue in various FTA negotiations. Another important question is how the United States should determine suitable FTA partners, balancing political and economic factors."
