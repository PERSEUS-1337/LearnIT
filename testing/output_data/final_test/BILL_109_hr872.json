    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Improving Access to Nurse-Midwifery Care Act of 2005\". Congress has authorized certified nurse-midwives (CNMs) to provide maternity-related services to Medicare-eligible women since 1988. In 1993, CNMs were also authorized to offer additional services outside the maternity cycle. Medicare reimburses CNMs for primary care services within their State-regulated scope of practice. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) recommended increasing part B reimbursement for CNM services in a June 2002 report to Congress. A 1998 study found that births attended by certified nurse-midwives (CNMs) had lower risks of infant death, neonatal mortality, and delivering low birth weight infants compared to births attended by physicians. Mean birth weight was also higher for CNM-attended births. Certified nurse-midwives (CNMs) attended a higher proportion of women at risk for poor birth outcomes, including African Americans, American Indians, teenagers, unmarried women, and those with lower education levels. Despite this, CNMs had better birth outcomes compared to physicians, even after accounting for socio-demographic and medical risk factors. Medicare covers 3,000,000 women with disabilities of childbearing age, who give birth to around 50,000 infants annually within the program. CNMs and certified midwives (CMs) are highly educated health professionals. Certified nurse-midwives (CNMs) and certified midwives (referred to as \"CMs\") are highly educated health professionals who require completion of a post-baccalaureate program, licensure, and passing a national certification exam. Inequitable reimbursement for obstetrical and gynecological services provided by CNMs or CMs can limit access to healthcare for women, especially those covered by Medicare. \"Medicare payment for certified nurse-midwife and midwife services.\" Certified midwife services are defined as services provided by a certified midwife who has completed specific education and clinical experience requirements. These services must be legally authorized under State law and are payable under Medicare similarly to physician services.
