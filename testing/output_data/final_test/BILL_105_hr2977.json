    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 1997\" excludes certain committees from the definition of federal advisory committees. It specifically excludes committees composed entirely of full-time or permanent part-time federal government officers or employees, as well as committees created by the National Academy of Sciences or the National Academy of Public Administration. The Act excludes committees created by the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Public Administration from the definition of federal advisory committees. An agency cannot use advice or recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences or National Academy of Public Administration if the committee creating them was under agency control, unless specific conditions are met. The National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Public Administration provide advice and recommendations, subject to specific requirements. The Academy must disclose committee members' names and biographies, allow public comment on appointments, and prevent conflicts of interest. The National Academy ensures committee members disclose conflicts of interest, maintain balanced membership, and produce reports independently. Meetings are open to the public and managed by the Academy. The Academy ensures that committee meetings to gather data from non-Academy individuals are open to the public, with exceptions for certain disclosures. Written materials presented to the committee by non-Academy individuals may be made available to the public. A brief summary of non-data gathering committee meetings will also be made public, unless disclosure is deemed inappropriate. The Academy will provide a summary of committee meetings, including members present, topics discussed, and materials shared, unless disclosure is restricted by law. The final report will be made public, with an option for a condensed version if necessary. The names of principal reviewers will also be disclosed after publication. The names of principal reviewers who reviewed the report will be made public, and regulations may be issued to implement this. The section and its amendments will take effect upon enactment, with retroactive effect to October 6, 1972, except for advice or recommendations subject to prior judicial action. SEC. 3. REPORT. The Administrator of General Services must submit a report to Congress within 1 year of this Act's enactment on the implementation and compliance with the amendments."
