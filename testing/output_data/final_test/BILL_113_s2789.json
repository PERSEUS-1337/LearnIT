Amends the Internal Revenue Code to add a new part for Fair Share Tax on high-income taxpayers. A tax is imposed on high-income taxpayers for a taxable year based on a fraction of the excess of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income over a specified dollar amount. The tax amount is determined based on the excess of the tentative fair share tax over the sum of the regular tax liability, tax imposed by section 55, and payroll tax for the taxable year, minus the credits allowable under part IV. The tentative fair share tax for the taxable year is 30 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income minus the modified charitable contribution deduction. The modified charitable contribution deduction is calculated based on a ratio of the deduction allowable under section 170. The modified charitable contribution deduction is determined based on the ratio of itemized deductions allowable under the regular tax for the taxable year, with adjustments for high-income taxpayers. The term 'high-income taxpayer' refers to a taxpayer with an adjusted gross income exceeding $1,000,000 ($500,000 for married individuals filing separately), with an inflation adjustment applied after 2016. The payroll tax for a taxable year is calculated as the excess of taxes imposed on the taxpayer under various sections over the deduction allowable under section 164(f) for that year. If an adjusted amount is not a multiple of $10,000, it is rounded down to the nearest multiple. The tax imposed under this section is not considered tax imposed by this chapter for certain purposes, and for estates or trusts, adjusted gross income is computed as described in section 67(e). A clerical amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Effective Date for amendments in Part VIII--Fair Share Tax on High-Income Taxpayers is after December 31, 2015."
