    "content": "Section 101 of the tax code waives the 10% penalty tax for early retirement plan withdrawals for individuals affected by Hurricane Katrina. This applies to distributions made between August 24, 2005, and January 1, 2007, up to $100,000. Funds can be re-contributed over three years with tax-free rollover treatment. Section 102 allows tax-free re-contribution of distributions made between February 28, 2005, and August 29, 2005, for purchasing or constructing a principal residence in the hurricane-affected area. Section 103 of the tax code increases the amount Hurricane Katrina victims can borrow from their retirement plans without immediate tax consequences. The provision applies to individuals whose primary residence was in the disaster area on August 28, 2005, and who suffered an economic loss due to the hurricane. The maximum amount that can be borrowed without being taxed is increased to $100,000 for loans made between September 23, 2005, and January 1, 2007. The act increases the maximum amount Hurricane Katrina victims can borrow from their retirement plans to $100,000 or the greater of $10,000 or 100% of their accrued benefits. Repayment due dates are extended by one year if falling between August 24, 2005, and January 1, 2007. Businesses hiring individuals from high unemployment groups can claim the work opportunity tax credit for wages up to $6,000 in the first year, with a maximum credit of $2,400 for employees working at least 400 hours. The work opportunity credit allows employers to claim a credit for wages of Hurricane Katrina employees hired between August 27, 2005, and January 1, 2006. The credit is equal to 40% of wages, limited to $6,000, for employees whose principal place of employment was in the core disaster area. The Hurricane Katrina work opportunity credit applies to wages paid between the date the business became inoperable at the employee's principal place of employment and the date it resumed significant operations there, but no later than December 31, 2005. The charitable deduction limits are suspended for cash contributions made between August 27, 2005, and January 1, 2006. The taxpayer's deduction for charitable contributions for Hurricane Katrina relief efforts is limited by their contribution base. Corporations can only deduct contributions that exceed their taxable income. Individuals providing free housing to Katrina-displaced persons can claim personal exemptions of $500 per person, up to four exemptions per year in 2005 and 2006. The displaced person must have had a principal place of abode on August 28, 2005. Individuals who had a principal place of abode in the Hurricane Katrina disaster area on August 28, 2005, can claim a deduction for using their personal vehicles for charitable purposes. The rate is 14 cents per mile, or 70% of the standard business mileage rate if the vehicle was used for Hurricane Katrina relief between August 24, 2005, and January 1, 2007. Qualifying mileage reimbursements received from charitable organizations for operating expenses of a volunteer's passenger automobile are excluded from gross income. Donors of food inventory for Hurricane Katrina relief between August 28, 2005, and January 1, 2006, can claim a charitable deduction based on their basis in the inventory. C corporations have specific rules for deductions based on the property's appreciated value. Donors of wholesome food inventory can benefit from an enhanced deduction during this period. C corporations can also claim an enhanced deduction for donations of book inventory to public schools made between August 27, 2005, and January 1, 2006. The corporation can deduct the lesser of the basis plus 50% of the property's appreciated value or two times the basis. Debt forgiveness is usually included in the taxpayer's income, but there are exceptions such as gifts or discharge of student loans for qualifying services. Taxpayers may defer or permanently exclude income from debt discharge in certain situations like bankruptcy proceedings. Section 401 allows Hurricane Katrina victims to exclude forgiven non-business debt if certain conditions are met. Taxpayers may need to reduce certain tax attributes by the excluded amount, deferring tax on the cancelled debt. Taxpayers can deduct losses of property not related to a trade or business, such as from a casualty like a hurricane. If ordered to demolish or relocate their home in a disaster area, they can claim a casualty loss. The loss is the lesser of the property's fair market value decrease or the taxpayer's adjusted basis. Repairs can be used as evidence of the loss. No deduction is allowed if the taxpayer is reimbursed. The deduction is limited to the amount exceeding $100 plus 10% of the loss. Taxpayers can deduct losses from a casualty like a hurricane, limited to the amount exceeding $100 plus 10% of the loss.

Section 403 of the IRS allows for deadline extensions for employment and excise taxes, with an extension until February 28, 2006 for Hurricane Katrina victims. Mortgage revenue bonds finance below-market rate mortgages for low-income homebuyers, with special rules for homes in targeted areas. Section 404 removes the three-year ownership requirement for homes in core disaster areas or as replacement residences for Hurricane Katrina victims. The IRS provides deadline extensions for employment and excise taxes for Hurricane Katrina victims. Section 403 also increases the limitation on qualified home improvement loans for repairing damage from the Hurricane. An involuntary conversion occurs when property is converted due to destruction, theft, or condemnation. Taxpayers may have a loss or gain depending on the value of cash or property received compared to the basis of the converted property. If property is involuntarily converted to cash or dissimilar property, the taxpayer must recognize any gain unless similar property is purchased within a certain time period. The replacement property must be purchased within two to four years, depending on the type of property converted. If similar property is purchased in a timely manner, the taxpayer may elect to only recognize gain to the extent that the amount realized exceeds the cost of the new property. Section 405 of the IRS code extends the time period to purchase replacement property to five years for those affected by Hurricane Katrina. Section 406 allows victims to use last year's income for computing certain tax credits. Section 407 grants the Treasury Secretary the authority to make adjustments in the application of tax laws. The Treasury Secretary can adjust tax laws for tax years 2005 and 2006 to prevent taxpayers affected by Hurricane Katrina from losing tax benefits."
