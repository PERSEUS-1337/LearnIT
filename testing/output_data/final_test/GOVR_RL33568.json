President Obama announced the appointment of a new NASA director to shape the agency's mission for the 21st Century. NASA's first space station, Skylab, was launched in 1973. Skylab, NASA's first space station, was launched in 1973 and remained in orbit until it disintegrated over Australia and the Indian Ocean in 1979. Budget constraints led NASA to prioritize building the space shuttle before pursuing a permanently occupied space station. President Reagan directed NASA to develop a permanently occupied space station within a decade in 1984, and President George H. W. Bush invited other countries to join the program in 1989. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush supported the space station as part of a long-term civilian space program aiming for bases on the Moon and Mars. The Space Exploration Initiative, focused on Moon/Mars exploration, faced budget concerns and ended in FY1993. President Clinton later included Russia as a partner in the space station program to support U.S. foreign policy goals. The International Space Station program began in 1993 with Russia joining the United States, Europe, Japan, and Canada. An Intergovernmental Agreement established three phases of cooperation, implemented through Memoranda of Understanding between NASA and counterpart agencies. During Phase I (1995-1998), U.S. astronauts stayed on Russia's space station Mir for long missions, Russian cosmonauts flew on the U.S. space shuttle, and shuttle missions docked with Mir for crew exchanges and supply deliveries. President George W. Bush directed NASA to focus on returning humans to the Moon and eventually sending them to Mars in a space policy address on January 14, 2004. This \"Vision for Space Exploration\" included retiring the space shuttle in 2010 and completing the International Space Station assembly by 2002 under the original schedule. The program was restructured in 2001, with operations expected to continue through at least 2012. President Bush restructured the space station program in 2001, with NASA planning to complete ISS utilization in 2016. ISS segments are launched and assembled in orbit, composed of modules, solar arrays, and other elements. The U.S. space shuttle transported crews and cargo to ISS, but faced challenges after the Columbia disaster and resumed flights in 2006. The International Space Station (ISS) faced difficulties after the Columbia disaster and resumed flights in 2006. Russian Soyuz spacecraft are used for crew transport and a lifeboat in emergencies. Expedition crews have occupied ISS on a 4-6 month basis since 2000, with crew size temporarily reduced to two during shuttle grounding. Soyuz spacecraft are the only available lifeboats, each capable of holding three people. Russian Soyuz spacecraft serve as lifeboats on the International Space Station (ISS), with each capable of holding three people. The crew size is limited to three if only one Soyuz is attached, but it will grow to six once assembly is completed. Soyuz spacecraft must be replaced every six months through \"taxi\" flights, where a new Soyuz is brought up to the ISS and the old one is returned to Earth. NASA required an exemption from the Iran Nonproliferation Act to contract for Soyuz service due to the ban on U.S. payments to Russia in connection with the ISS. In 2005, Congress amended the Iran Nonproliferation Act to exempt Soyuz flights to the ISS until 2011. The provisions were extended to Syria and North Korea, renaming it the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act (INKSNA). NASA requested an extension of this exemption, and waiver authority was extended until July 1, 2016. The cost estimate for building the ISS grew from $17.4 billion to about $25 billion from FY1994 to FY2001. Launch costs, operational costs, civil service costs, and other expenses were not included in the initial estimate. NASA estimated the International Space Station's life-cycle cost from FY1985 to FY2012 at $72.3 billion, with a later estimate by GAO in 1998 at $95.6 billion. Congress imposed a $25 billion cap on development costs in the FY2000-FY2002 NASA authorization act, but NASA announced in 2001 that the cost would exceed $30 billion due to underestimation of complexity. The Bush Administration supported the cap and did not provide additional funds. In 2001, the Bush Administration announced it would cancel or defer some ISS hardware to stay within the cap and control space station costs. The decision truncated construction of the space station at a stage the Administration called \"core complete.\" NASA estimated it would cost $8.3 billion from FY2002 to FY2006 to build the core complete configuration. In 2001, the Bush Administration announced plans to limit ISS construction costs by canceling or deferring some hardware. This decision led to the concept of \"core complete\" for the space station. Subsequently, in January 2004, President Bush outlined a \"Vision for Space Exploration,\" restricting U.S. research on ISS to align with this vision. NASA issued a new research plan in June 2006, following the 2005 NASA authorization act. Changes to the ISS configuration were endorsed by partners in January 2005, but NASA later announced modifications, including reducing shuttle launches to 16 by FY2010 and canceling certain modules. Discussions with ISS partners are planned to address these changes. The agency plans to meet with ISS partners to discuss changes related to NASA's new direction in response to the Vision for Space Exploration. This includes the development of the Crew Exploration Vehicle Orion and Crew Launch Vehicle Ares I. Orion will be used to transport astronauts to and from the Moon, the ISS, and serve as a lifeboat. The U.S. commitment to build a crew return capability will be fulfilled, allowing the ISS crew size to increase to seven. An Earth-orbit capability is planned by 2014, with Moon missions by 2020. The Space Transportation System (STS) is the Space Shuttle, which is used to launch astronauts into orbit. It consists of an Orbiter, Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), and an External Tank (ET). NASA has three remaining Orbiters: Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour. Over 100 shuttle launches have occurred since 1981, with two tragic accidents in 1986 and 2003. The Columbia tragedy occurred due to a hole in the shuttle's left wing caused by foam insulation during launch. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board found technical and organizational failures, leading to 29 recommendations. NASA launched the space shuttle Discovery on the first \"Return to Flight\" mission in 2005, successfully landing on August 9. On July 27, NASA announced that foam detached from STS-114's ET during launch, similar to Columbia. Discovery and the International Space Station imaged the Orbiter, finding no damage but suspending further launches. Two \"gapfillers\" were removed from the Orbiter during a spacewalk. STS-121 was deferred to July 4, 2006, and Atlantis launched on September 9 for ISS construction. The International Space Station resumed flights with plans for nine more shuttle flights to complete construction before the shuttle program ends in 2010. A mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope was reinstated by Administrator Michael Griffin in 2008, extending its life until 2013. NASA prepared a \"launch on need\" mission for emergencies, with a second shuttle ready to launch for a rescue mission if needed. During the servicing mission in 2008, a major data handling unit in the Hubble telescope failed, leading to the activation of a backup unit. NASA revised the mission to include carrying a second data handling unit from Earth to replace the failed one, delaying the mission until May or June of 2009. NASA had been unsuccessful in developing a \"second generation\" reusable launch vehicle to replace the shuttle, which was planned to continue flying until at least 2015. The Columbia tragedy and President Bush's Vision for Space Exploration forced NASA to revise its plans. NASA is revising its plan to terminate the shuttle program in 2010, which currently absorbs 25% of NASA's budget. There are concerns about shuttle safety and funding availability for other aspects of the President's Vision for Space Exploration. Congress is debating the impact of terminating the shuttle program, with some members wanting to end it earlier due to safety risks or to accelerate the Vision. Others want to keep the shuttle until the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) is available in 2015, as there will be a gap in U.S. astronaut access to the ISS. The 2008 NASA Authorization Act required NASA to suspend activities that could affect the safe flight of the Space Shuttle after fiscal year 2010. Funding for the shuttle was $3.981 billion in FY2008 and $2.982 billion in FY2009. The omnibus appropriations bill appropriated the requested $2.982 billion. In 2005, Congress supported the President's plan for NASA to focus on returning to the Moon and manned missions to Mars. The plan included ending Space Shuttle flights in 2010 and limiting U.S. experiments on the ISS to those supporting the Moon-Mars goal. Concerns remain about NASA's funding adequacy, as the President did not request additional funds despite existing underfunding issues. NASA has reduced funding for other activities to support the new mission. NASA has cut back funding for scientific research and aeronautics to support the new mission of completing construction of the ISS by 2010. Each shuttle launch remains a major and risky event due to the vehicle's complexity and extreme operating environment. The future role of the ISS post-2010 completion is uncertain. After the retirement of the shuttle in 2010, there will be a gap before the Crew Exploration Vehicle begins flights. The vehicle is designed for the return to the moon and can also reach the ISS, but it is unclear what will happen to the ISS after completion in 2010."
