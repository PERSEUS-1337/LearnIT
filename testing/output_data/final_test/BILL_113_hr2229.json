    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safeguarding Social Security Numbers Act of 2013\". Congress finds that Social Security account numbers are widely used for various purposes, leading to potential risks of crime, fraud, and identity theft. Social Security account numbers can be misused for crime, fraud, and identity theft, leading to financial losses and time-consuming credit record restoration for victims. Some Government entities publicly display Social Security account numbers in certain records, increasing the risk of identity theft. Private information resellers also collect and sell personal data, contributing to privacy concerns. Private information resellers often obtain and sell individuals' Social Security account numbers and other personal information. A 2006 study by the Government Accountability Office found that 5 out of 21 internet information resellers surveyed were able to sell truncated or full Social Security account numbers. Unauthorized access to personal data, including Social Security numbers, is a common issue according to the GAO. A survey of 17 Federal agencies revealed over 788 data breaches from January 2003 to July 2006. Public and private entities make efforts to safeguard Social Security numbers from misuse. The GAO found that different truncation methods used by public and private sectors make Social Security account numbers vulnerable to misuse. Federal entities display the last 4 digits of the number, allowing for reconstruction of the full number. The GAO found that information resellers sell records with truncated Social Security numbers, often showing the first 5 digits. The last 4 digits are randomly generated, used for identity verification, making them a target for identity thieves. The GAO reported in 2006 the lack of industry standards for truncating Social Security numbers, leading to a lack of consensus on the best method for protection. They recommend standardizing truncation to prevent misuse, with the Social Security Administration being in a prime position to establish uniform standards. The Social Security Administration should standardize truncation of Social Security account numbers to prevent abuse, as they currently lack legal authority to regulate their use by other entities. The Federal Government, which created and maintains the system, should take steps to curb misuse of these numbers. The Social Security Administration needs to establish uniform standards for truncating Social Security account numbers to prevent misuse by other entities. The Commissioner of Social Security will issue uniform standards for truncating and securing Social Security account numbers to prevent fraud and identity theft. These standards will not apply to deceased individuals. The Commissioner will consult with the Department of Justice and other federal agencies in establishing these standards. Federal agencies involved in establishing standards for truncating Social Security account numbers to prevent fraud and identity theft include the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Department of the Treasury. Specific considerations include assessing the effectiveness of truncation methods in preventing fraud and identity theft, taking into account the risks associated with combining truncated Social Security numbers with other personally identifiable information. The risks associated with truncating Social Security account numbers include the potential for revealing personally identifiable information and the possibility of deriving a full Social Security number from a truncated one. The methods used for truncation by various entities and the reasons for truncating Social Security numbers are also important considerations. The reasons for collecting and recording Social Security account numbers by different entities, the impact of truncation methods on the use of these numbers, and comments from experts and government entities on proposed truncation methods are important considerations. Entities that regularly use Social Security account numbers include private entities, the Comptroller General of the United States, and other appropriate entities. SEC. 4. APPLICATION OF UNIFORM STANDARDS. The uniform standards issued by the Commissioner of Social Security will apply to the Federal Government when displaying or using Social Security account numbers. State and local governments, as well as private entities, are also subject to these standards when transmitting information online. State and local governments, as well as private entities, must not display Social Security account numbers on the Internet, except when complying with specific truncation and encryption standards. The method for truncation and encryption of Social Security numbers issued by the Commissioner is outlined, with penalties for violations by states or political subdivisions. The Attorney General can enforce civil penalties of up to $5,000 per day for non-compliance. The method for truncation and encryption of Social Security numbers is outlined, with penalties for violations by states or political subdivisions. A civil action can be taken against a State, political subdivision, or any officer for violations, with effective dates specified. Congress recommends compliance with uniform standards for displaying Social Security numbers. Private entities must comply with uniform standards for displaying Social Security numbers to the same extent as the Federal Government or State/local governments. Grants are provided to state and local governments to comply with the prohibition of displaying Social Security account numbers on the internet. The Attorney General awards grants to States and political subdivisions to remove Social Security numbers from public internet display. States must apply for grants following specified guidelines. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this purpose. Authorization of $10,000,000 for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 is provided to the Attorney General for removing Social Security numbers from public internet display. The Commissioner of Social Security must issue regulations within 6 months of this Act's enactment. Additionally, a GAO report is required. Within 18 months of the Social Security Commissioner's regulations, the Comptroller General will report to Congress on the adoption of uniform standards by private entities. The report will assess if these standards offer better protection against fraud and identity theft. Recommendations will be made on whether these standards should be mandatory for State and local governments and private entities to prevent fraud. The Comptroller General will report to Congress on recommendations for additional legislation or administrative action to reduce the risks of fraud, identity theft, and unauthorized access related to Social Security account numbers. SEC. 8 of the Act states that it will override State law only if it conflicts with the Act's requirements. SEC. 9 provides definitions. In this Act, \"display to the general public on the Internet\" refers to posting or allowing the visibility of a Social Security account number online. The term \"Social Security account number\" includes the number assigned by the Commissioner of Social Security and any derivatives. \"State\" refers to each of the 50 states. The term \"State\" includes each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands."
