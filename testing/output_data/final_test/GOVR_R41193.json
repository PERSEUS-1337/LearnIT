    "content": "Construction of new long-distance transmission lines is a hotly debated energy policy issue. Advocates believe it is necessary for utilizing remote sources of renewable power and improving system reliability. However, some argue that there are more cost-effective ways to meet energy needs. Estimates for expanding the transmission grid range from $49 billion to $80 billion for bringing Great Plains wind power to the East Coast, and a Department of Energy study estimated costs of $60 billion by 2030 for wind power expansion. The funding requirements for the period 2010 to 2030 are estimated to be about $300 billion, with 39,000 circuit-miles of high-voltage transmission projected over the next 10 years. One-third of these transmission facilities will be used to integrate variable and renewable resources. The most contentious issue is the cost allocation for new interstate transmission lines, determining which customers must bear the costs. This report provides background and analysis of current transmission cost allocation policy and issues, including federal authority under the Federal Power Act. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has the authority to regulate interstate electricity transmission under the Federal Power Act. Section 205 of the FPA requires rates to be \"just and reasonable\" and prohibits discrimination against customers. FERC's role is seen as passive and reactive under section 205, but section 206 gives FERC broader rate authority. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has the authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act to determine and adjust rates, charges, and classifications for public utilities related to transmission. FERC can make changes to existing utility rates if they are found to be unjust, unreasonable, discriminatory, or preferential. FERC has broad authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act to establish just and reasonable rates for public utilities related to transmission. This includes setting rules and regulations to address unjust, unreasonable, discriminatory, or preferential practices in the industry. FERC's Section 206 authority allows it to establish fair rates for transmission services, as seen in Order No. 1000. The commission addresses complex transmission projects that cross utility territories and benefit diverse stakeholders, making cost allocation challenging. Transmission lines were historically constructed by investor-owned utilities subject to traditional cost of service regulation by state utility commissions. Customers paid a share of transmission investments costs, leading to the \"socialization\" of expenses. Cost allocation was not complex under this regulatory regime. The historical development of the electric power grid involved transmission lines being built by single utilities to supply electricity to population centers. As technology advanced, these local grids began to interconnect, leading to jointly owned power plants and the exchange of power between companies. This evolution made cost allocation issues less contentious and visible. The development of the electric power grid involved interconnecting local grids, leading to jointly owned power plants and the exchange of power between companies. Cost allocation issues became more pressing due to industry restructuring in the late 1970s, prompting regulatory acts to introduce competition and establish open access to the transmission grid. Open access transmission allows operators to open their system to any connected generator or load on a non-discriminatory basis. Rates are cost or market based, embodied in an open access transmission tariff approved by FERC. This broke the rigid link between transmission builders and ratepayers, allowing multiple entities to use a transmission line. FERC's promotion of regional transmission organizations further weakened operational links between utilities and transmission, ensuring non-discriminatory operation of the grid. The restructuring of the transmission market under open access transmission had consequences for cost allocation and planning, making it more complex and contentious. The distinction between reliability projects and economic projects became important in the open access regime, as each type could benefit different customer groups. In the open access regime, responsibility for transmission planning shifted to RTOs or other planning organizations. Order No. 890 established principles for transmission cost allocation, including a process for allocating costs of new facilities. FERC established principles for transmission cost allocation, emphasizing the importance of understanding who will pay for new transmission infrastructure. This includes concerns about cost allocation for long-distance projects crossing multiple utility service areas and the treatment of projects benefiting multiple parties. FERC clarified that existing cost allocation methods for projects by a single transmission owner will not be modified. FERC established principles for transmission cost allocation, allowing flexibility for projects involving multiple transmission owners. FERC emphasized the importance of judgment in cost allocation, providing overall guidance while leaving room for stakeholders to determine specific criteria. FERC established principles for transmission cost allocation, emphasizing the importance of judgment and regional flexibility. Three key factors considered are fair cost assignment, incentives for new infrastructure, and support from state authorities and participants. These factors are interrelated, with broad regional support increasing the likelihood of providing adequate incentives for new transmission construction. Incentives for new infrastructure are crucial for fair cost allocation in transmission projects. States with siting authority may hesitate to approve projects if costs are not distributed fairly. Adequate financial support for major projects relies on assigning costs to beneficiaries. Order 890 mandated transmission planning processes by utilities and RTOs, with FERC ensuring compliance. Various approaches were taken nationwide to meet these planning principles. The cost allocation process for transmission projects involves a combination of beneficiary pays and socialization of costs, with each region defining their own methods. PJM's approach allocates costs based on the physical characteristics and purpose of the proposed transmission line, charging customers in the zones that benefit. FERC directed PJM and its customers to develop a standard methodology for allocating the costs of transmission projects, with beneficiaries paying for projects under 500 kV and costs of 500 kV or greater projects being socialized throughout the PJM Interconnection, leading to controversy. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected PJM's cost socialization approach as unjust and irrational, remanding the issue to FERC. The court questioned the justification of shifting costs to utilities for facilities from which they derive minimal benefits. This decision is discussed further below. Since 2004, NE-ISO has allocated $4 billion for reliability investments with region-wide benefits, funded by all customers in the RTO. While cost socialization for reliability upgrades is easier to justify due to potential system-wide disruptions, economic upgrades face challenges in justifying region-wide cost allocation. FPL follows cost allocation procedures approved by the Florida Reliability Coordinating Council for regional electric grid. FPL follows cost allocation procedures approved by the Florida Reliability Coordinating Council for regional electric grid reliability. If a new transmission project affects FRCC grid reliability and the transmission owner participates in the planning process, costs will be split between customers and sources creating the need. The organization follows standard cost allocation procedures for transmission grid investments. Exceptions include Regional Reliability Projects and Regional Economic Transmission Path projects, where costs are allocated based on benefits and savings among utilities. The utilities will recover their investment over 20 years from ratepayers. Economic projects must be part of NCTPC planning to qualify for cost allocation. FERC has not established uniform cost allocation procedures and focuses on regional perspectives. The regional transmission planning organizations aim to incorporate many stakeholders in the planning process, reflecting FERC's push for a regional perspective. The complexity of socializing transmission costs is evident in examples like PJM's process being rejected by a federal court and NE-ISO's process never being used. NCTPC and FPL have straightforward cost socialization processes for reliability upgrades, but NCTPC's process for economic project costs is multi-step and spans up to 20 years. FPL did not include socialization of economic projects in its filing, sparking debates over the proper allocation of transmission costs. In Illinois Commerce Commission v. FERC, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reviewed a challenge to FERC's approval of a cost allocation proposal for new transmission facilities in the PJM Interconnection. Two state utility commissions objected to FERC's approved allocation of transmission costs that required all utilities in the region to contribute proportionally. FERC's rationale for this approach included past agreements among PJM members, the complexity of determining beneficiaries of new transmission, and the potential for litigation. The court rejected FERC's approved pro rata rate increase for recovery of transmission costs, stating it lacked substantial evidence. Previous pro rata cost sharing arrangements among PJM members were deemed irrelevant. Feasibility concerns can impact rate determinations, but evidence of difficulty in assessing benefits was absent. The court rejected FERC's pro rata rate increase for transmission costs, citing lack of evidence. The court questioned FERC's reasoning on allocating costs among all PJM members, stating that benefits may not outweigh costs for non-eastern region customers. The court rejected FERC's pro rata rate increase for transmission costs, citing lack of evidence. FERC must justify benefits to midwestern utilities for new lines in the East. The ruling may lead to a reconsideration of cost allocation methods. The court rejected FERC's pro rata rate increase for transmission costs, citing lack of evidence. FERC must justify benefits to midwestern utilities for new lines in the East. The ruling seems to focus on FERC's procedural failure to justify ratemaking rather than a substantive failure in applying the law. The Seventh Circuit emphasized that FERC must demonstrate that benefits received are \"at least roughly commensurate\" with the pro rata cost allocation. The FPA gives FERC broad authority over transmission cost allocation policy, but with limits. In recent years, Members of Congress have introduced legislation to tighten FERC's transmission cost allocation policy. S. 400, introduced in the 112th Congress, aims to amend the Federal Power Act to ensure that transmission rates are based on a reasonable allocation of costs for new facilities. During the 111th Congress, legislation was proposed to adopt principles for transmission cost allocation, aiming for costs to be allocated proportionately to economic or reliability benefits. Senator Corker's amendment to S. 1462 sought FERC to issue a new rule allowing for the allocation of costs of national transmission projects to load-serving entities within a region, based on measurable benefits. During the 111th Congress, an amendment to S. 1462 raised concerns about limiting FERC's ability to allocate transmission costs widely. FERC Chairman and former chairmen criticized the amendment, citing potential litigation and infrastructure investment risks. Supporters argued for the amendment's benefits. Some supported the amendment to allocate transmission facility costs narrowly to focus on clear beneficiaries, while others raised concerns about the potential subsidization of localized benefits by those outside the area. Socializing transmission costs over wide areas could give long-distance projects an economic advantage over local renewable power development and energy efficiency initiatives. The ruling in Illinois Commerce Commission v. FERC and legislative efforts aimed at directing FERC transmission cost allocation were key factors in the debate. FERC initiated a rulemaking proceeding to formulate a clearer policy for transmission cost allocation under Docket AD09-8, Transmission Planning Processes. The Commission identified issues with transmission planning effectiveness, regional planning, treatment of renewable power, and cost allocation for new projects. The Commission found that determining costs and benefits for adding transmission infrastructure is complex, especially for projects affecting multiple systems. The expansion of regional power markets and renewable energy requirements has increased the need for cross-system transmission projects. Current rate structures do not adequately allocate costs for these projects, posing risks for developers. FERC may take a more direct approach to cost allocation processes based on feedback from meetings and a notice in October 2009. The Commission is considering a more direct approach to cost allocation processes for new transmission facilities, especially those crossing multiple systems. FERC is seeking feedback on how to identify project beneficiaries, including generators, and determine cost responsibility. This relates to the Seventh Circuit's rejection of the PJM Interconnection cost allocation process. The Seventh Circuit rejected the PJM Interconnection cost allocation process, sparking debate on whether costs should be allocated over larger geographic regions. FERC is considering static vs. changing cost allocations, including non-quantifiable costs and benefits. Various opinions have been submitted, with American Electric Power advocating for interconnection-wide planning and cost allocation for extra-high voltage transmission lines. Southern Company rejected the idea that transmission planning and cost allocation were hindering transmission development, stating that the current processes are not obstacles. They believe that the lack of economic viability is the reason for the limited inter-regional transmission projects in the Southeast. The New England Power Pool Participants Committee and the Southwest Power Pool RTO have differing views on cost allocation for transmission projects. The NE-ISO committee seeks policy guidance on cost allocation options, while the SPP suggests standardized rules for inter-regional planning. Both oppose interconnection-wide cost allocation but support broad area cost allocation processes. Southern Company believes economic viability, not cost allocation, is the main obstacle to inter-regional transmission projects in the Southeast. SPP believes that defining benefits for transmission projects is challenging and that economic models cannot fully capture all benefits. They are working on a cost allocation method for regional projects. ELCON, on the other hand, argues for a \"beneficiary pays\" principle for cost allocation. ELCON supports the \"beneficiary pays\" principle for cost allocation in transmission project development. This model ensures that those who receive actual, demonstrable benefits are responsible for paying for the transmission investment, reducing controversy and ensuring justified costs. In November 2009, a transmission trade group and environmental groups petitioned FERC to establish transmission cost allocation standards. This led to the issuance of Order No. 1000 on July 21, 2011, amending Order No. 890 to ensure just and reasonable transmission services. The Final Rule, effective October 11, 2011, establishes three requirements for transmission planning by public utility providers. Order No. 1000 mandates public utility transmission providers to participate in regional transmission planning processes that consider public policy requirements and coordinate with neighboring regions for efficient solutions. It also requires the development of regional cost allocation methods for new transmission facilities. Order No. 1000 mandates regional transmission planning processes to have cost allocation methods for new facilities in neighboring regions. It sets principles for both regional and interregional cost allocation, allowing participant-funding only with agreement. FERC does not specify a preferred methodology. Order No. 1000 mandates regional and interregional cost allocation principles for transmission facilities, requiring allocation based on estimated benefits within planning regions. FERC does not specify a preferred methodology but emphasizes fairness in cost allocation. Order No. 1000 mandates regional and interregional cost allocation principles for transmission facilities based on estimated benefits within planning regions. The principles ensure that facilities not benefiting from a transmission facility should not be involuntarily allocated any costs. Additionally, a benefit to cost threshold should not exclude transmission facilities with significant positive net benefits from cost allocation. Interregional Cost Allocation Principle 4 states that costs for an interregional transmission facility should only be assigned to regions where the facility is located, and not involuntarily to regions where it is not located. Regional Cost Allocation Principle 5 and Interregional Cost Allocation Principle 5 emphasize transparency in cost allocation methods and data requirements for determining benefits and beneficiaries of transmission facilities. Regional Cost Allocation Principle 6 allows for different cost allocation methods for various types of transmission facilities in the regional plan. The Final Rule eliminates the right of first refusal for incumbent transmission providers to build new transmission lines, citing concerns of unjust rates and discrimination. Transmission facilities may use different cost allocation methods for reliability, congestion relief, or Public Policy Requirements. The Final Rule eliminates the right of first refusal for incumbent transmission providers to build new transmission lines, citing concerns of unjust rates and discrimination. Order No. 1000 will take effect on October 11, 2011, requiring compliance filings by October 11, 2012. Compliance filings for interregional transmission coordination and cost allocation must be submitted within 18 months of the Final Rule's effective date, by April 11, 2013. RTO regions may submit existing procedures as compliant with Order No. 1000. FERC provides schedules for compliance filings and OATT schedule revisions to reflect cost allocation methods. Potential issues with region formation could impact transmission provider compliance. Transmission planning historically addresses load growth and new power connections. Transmission planning historically focused on load growth and connecting new power generation resources to load centers. However, recent emphasis on power markets and reliability has sparked discussions about the necessity of new transmission lines. Order No. 1000 by FERC introduced regulations to consider state and federal public policies in the decision-making process for transmission projects. The American Public Power Association (APPA) noted that FERC's use of the word \"consider\" may not be strong enough to drive these projects forward. Transmission planning should focus on the needs of load-serving entities, including accessing renewable resources as mandated by state RPS requirements and other clean energy resources. The FPA emphasizes the importance of planning and expanding transmission facilities to meet the reasonable needs of load-serving entities. Determining cost allocation will likely involve defining various benefits such as economic, reliability, and system-wide benefits. Order No. 1000 discusses different types of benefits but does not provide specific definitions. FERC does not prescribe a specific definition of benefits or beneficiaries in the Final Rule. The regions will define benefits, focusing on reliability, economics, and public policy. Order No. 1000 states that cost allocation will only occur where there is a benefit from new transmission facilities. The Final Rule by FERC states that those who do not benefit from new transmission facilities should not be forced to bear any of the costs. This rule aims to prevent free riders from receiving benefits without paying for them, based on cost-causation principles. FERC allows regions to define themselves for transmission planning, requiring more than one utility in a region. Existing RTOs or ISOs are considered natural regions with agreements in place. Some RTOs may span non-continuous areas, leading to overlap in planning regions. Transmission-owning utility definition may complicate matters as some generation facility operators are also designated as transmission owners for reliability reasons. Some generation facilities designated as transmission owners for reliability purposes may be impacted by requirements from the Final Rule. Regulatory principles and timing are crucial in defining benefits, with FERC emphasizing consideration of existing public policies. The planning horizon for cost allocation could be limited by the time frame of these policies or spread over the asset's life under \"used and useful\" ratemaking principles. FERC distinguishes between transmission facilities in a regional plan and those selected for cost allocation, favoring the latter for efficiency. The region is expected to choose the most efficient solution under a Commission-approved planning process. This approach may lead to the elimination of a transmission provider's right of first refusal for building a facility chosen for regional cost allocation. FERC does not preempt state or local laws. Order No. 1000 aims to ensure there is enough transmission capacity for future U.S. electricity needs by identifying more efficient and cost-effective transmission facilities. It allows local utilities to consider alternative solutions if a project selected for regional cost allocation is delayed. FERC does not preempt state or local laws regarding the right of first refusal for building transmission facilities. Order No. 1000 by FERC addresses the need for expanding high-voltage transmission lines to accommodate new renewable energy generation. The potential for long interstate transmission lines to transport renewable energy from the western US to eastern markets is discussed. Neighboring transmission planning regions can collaborate on interregional plans to meet state public policies like RPS requirements. A federal renewable energy standard is crucial for a multistate renewable energy transmission line. However, a segmented build-out of transmission facilities could achieve similar goals by showing benefits to local regions. The choice of technologies and facility designs is important for determining benefits. Federal regulations can reduce the need for state regulations, easing interstate commerce. In Order No. 1000, FERC addresses the expansion of high-voltage transmission lines for renewable energy generation. In Order No. 1000, FERC provides guidance on planning transmission facilities and cost allocation, allowing regions to customize arrangements to their own requirements. The cost allocation principles aim for flexibility, recognizing regional differences and promoting efficient ways to meet transmission needs. Order No. 1000 provides guidance on planning transmission facilities and cost allocation, aiming for flexibility and efficiency in meeting regional transmission needs. The optimal location of power generation facilities can offer cost-effective solutions to congestion-related reliability issues. Uncertainty remains on how regional planners will consider power generation solutions in meeting Order No. 1000 requirements amidst increasing demand for new transmission lines due to state renewable portfolio requirements and upcoming EPA regulations for coal power plants. The uncertainty surrounding upcoming EPA regulations has led some utilities to delay building new generation, relying on power markets for interim needs. Shortfalls in transmission capacity in certain regions may impact reliability. State utility commission decisions on new power plants will affect regional transmission planning. Many stakeholders are working to understand and meet obligations under the Final Rule, with key questions to be addressed in compliance filings. FERC issued Order 1000-A on May 17, 2012, requiring all jurisdictional electric transmission providers to comply with planning processes for new transmission facilities. Order 1000-B was issued on October 18, 2012, upholding previous orders and clarifying rules. Compliance filings will address key questions."
