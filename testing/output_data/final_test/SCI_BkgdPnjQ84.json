    "content": "We present an end-to-end model-building process for open-set authorship verification using transfer learning of a deep language model, a generative adversarial network, and text augmentation techniques. The model encodes documents into a domain-invariant space and trains an ensemble of neural networks bidirectionally. Experiments were conducted on four traditional datasets. The proposed approach for Authorship Verification (AV) involves transfer learning techniques and deep learning advancements to achieve state-of-the-art results on various datasets. AV aims to determine if multiple text documents are written by the same author, with applications including plagiarism analysis and email spoofing prevention. Studies traditionally focus on a limited set of authors and their documents, but the new method explores a broader approach. The goal of Authorship Verification (AV) is to identify if two documents are written by the same author. Traditional AV methods focus on learning individual writing styles, but the new approach aims to differentiate between authors within a corpus. This involves predicting authorship of unseen documents, even those not in the training set. The task has evolved to handle more challenging scenarios where authors may not be present in the training data. Authorship verification faces challenges such as lack of training data, different genres/topics between test and train documents, and ensuring robustness in various scenarios. The intersection of authors in the unknown train and test data sets is often empty, making it difficult to infer authorship of a given pair of documents. The goal in authorship verification is to learn a prediction function that can generalize well and make accurate predictions for documents written by both known and unknown authors. This involves multiple sub-problems where texts need to be verified against known documents, even if they were not seen during training. The approach to authorship verification involves designing a deep document classification model using transfer learning, ensembles, an adversary, and data augmentation. The model is tested on various datasets with different characteristics and performs well without specific modifications, outperforming baselines and competition winners. The method for authorship verification includes data augmentation, transfer learning, and training/testing processes. Various techniques are used to improve model generalization, such as document manipulation and adversarial noise injection with a deep LSTM-based language model. Some augmentation techniques can be applied to the test set during evaluation, but caution is needed as some may have negative effects. The authorship verification method involves data augmentation, transfer learning, and training/testing processes. Adversarial noise injection is used with a deep LSTM-based language model to improve model generalization. A 5-layer LSTM model acts as a generator, while a 3-layer RNN classifier works as a critic. The adversarial loss function is a weighted average of the two losses, and a specific approach is devised to enhance the quality of augmentation. The authorship verification method involves training on documents with injected noise to improve model generalization. Documents form latent domains based on linguistic characteristics, requiring transformation into a domain-invariant space. Authorship verification is a separate task for each domain due to different data distributions. Domain Adaptation (DA) is a subset of Transfer learning that addresses problems in knowledge transfer from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain by exploring domain-invariant features. Utilizing a deep language model, an encoder is used to produce an embedding representing a pair of documents, overcoming issues with standard classifiers and distance functions. The model described is a bi-directional pipeline of recurrent neural networks, pre-trained on Wikipedia articles, to produce embeddings for document pairs. It includes an ensemble of sequence classifiers, one based on an RNN and the other on a QRNN, outputting probabilities. The model described is a bi-directional pipeline of recurrent neural networks, pre-trained on Wikipedia articles, to produce embeddings for document pairs. It includes an ensemble of sequence classifiers, one based on an RNN and the other on a QRNN, outputting probabilities. The predictions made by RNN and QRNN are averaged. To overcome the challenge of bi-directional training, the authors tokenized and numericalized the text data, trained on a normal pre-trained Wikipedia model, then loaded the numericalized tokens backwards for training on a model trained on Wikipedia backwards. At test time, they reversed each document and used both forward and backward models, averaging the results to effectively utilize a bi-directional RNN without actually training one. This design is referred to as 2WD-UAV. The 2WD-UAV design utilizes an ensemble of two versions of RNN for authorship verification, implemented in PyTorch with elements of fast.ai library. PAN datasets are used for authorship identification, consisting of training and test corpora with various distinct problems. Each problem includes up to five writings by a single person and one piece of writing of unknown authorship. The design involves similarity functions such as Chi2 kernel and Cosine similarity for document feature vectors. The PAN2014 datasets include Essays and Novels for authorship verification experiments. A dataset of Amazon Reviews is used, with positive and negative candidate sets created from author reviews. The positive class consists of 4500 review pairs, while the negative class is of equal size. The MPLA-400 dataset was used for authorship verification experiments, with a balanced distribution of authors and classes. The positive class includes pairs of same-authorship articles, while the negative class consists of randomly selected pairs of articles with different authorship. The MPLA-400 dataset is used for authorship verification experiments with a balanced distribution of authors and classes. The positive class includes pairs of same-authorship articles, and the negative class consists of randomly selected pairs of articles with different authorship. Authors recommend using 5-fold cross validation for the dataset. Comparisons are made with the top methods of PAN AV competition between 2013 and 2015. Various classifiers and similarity measures are used to set strong baselines for the experiments. The summary vector is defined as a single representative unit for each example by utilizing multiple similarity measures. It comprises various metrics measuring the closeness of two documents for all feature sets. Classifiers like SVM, GNB, KNN, LR, DT, and MLP are used to predict the class label based on the summary vector. Our model utilizes recent work on alternating learning rates and one-cycle learning policy to train the MLP for predicting class labels. We use a range of momentum and different learning rates for each layer, along with the AdamW optimizer with weight decay regularization. The study utilizes various techniques such as weight decay adjustment, Gaussian distribution for Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor with K=3, L-2 regularization for Logistic Regression, and document expansion with a sliding window size of 10. Results show that the proposed model 2WD-UAV consistently outperforms all baselines and best-reported models in PAN competitions across different years in terms of the Score metric. The proposed model 2WD-UAV consistently outperforms all baselines and best-reported models in PAN competitions across different years in terms of the Score metric. It excels in Accuracy for PAN14Essay and PAN13 dataset, and in ROC metric for PAN14Novels and PAN15. It also outperforms all other models in the ROC metric for PAN15, PAN14E, and PAN13, offering stellar performance just behind MLP and CNG. The approach explored larger datasets of Amazon Reviews and MLPA, showing significant performance gains in accuracy compared to baselines. Domain Adaptation addresses the challenge of transferring knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, ensuring stable and consistent performance gains. Authorship verification involves determining if a piece of work is written by a known author using a one-class technique with high accuracy. A three-layer neural network is used for this task, observing the behavior of the network for documents by different authors and building a classifier for each author. Authorship verification involves determining if a piece of work is written by a known author using a one-class technique with high accuracy. The idea originates from the first applications of auto-encoder in classification as a novelty detector. Various methods have been studied for detecting sock-puppets who change their writing styles to pass filters and provide opinion spam. A spy induction method is proposed to leverage test data in training under an \"out-of-training\" setting. Since 2013, there has been a surge of interest in this type of authorship verification problem. BID24 investigates whether a document is an outlier in a corpus by generalizing the Many-Candidate method. The best method for the PAN 2014 Essays dataset optimizes a decision tree enriched by adopting a variety of features. The Novels dataset achieves best results with an author verifier using fuzzy C-Means clustering. Another approach involves generating impostor documents and applying iterative feature randomization to compute similarity distance. Investigating language models of all authors using a shared recurrent layer and building a classifier for each author is a powerful approach. Parallel recurrent neural network and transformation auto-encoder approaches show excellent results for various authorship verification problems. A non Machine Learning model using a compression algorithm, dissimilarity method, and threshold also performs well on PAN datasets. In this paper, the authors explore a novel approach to authorship verification using transfer and adversarial learning, data augmentation, ensemble methods, and cutting-edge deep learning models. Their design shows robustness and stability when dealing with previously unseen samples. The approach in the paper shows robustness and stability in dealing with out-of-sample authors and lack of training data, delivering state-of-the-art performance."
