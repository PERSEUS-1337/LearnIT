It also addresses the availability of safe and effective breast pumps. The Breastfeeding Promotion Act of 2009 amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include breast pumps as medical care in the Internal Revenue Code. Congress finds that women with infants and toddlers are a growing segment of the labor force, with over 50% of mothers with children under 1 year old working. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding for at least the first year of a child's life, as research shows that not breastfeeding can lead to various health issues in children. Breastfeeding provides protective effects against chronic diseases for both infants and mothers, including diabetes, lymphomas, and ovarian cancer. It also reduces parental absenteeism due to infant illness. Congress intended to protect breastfeeding under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 amended title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to protect breastfeeding and expressing breast milk in the workplace. This aims to promote the health of infants and clarify that such actions are covered under the law. Amendments to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 now include lactation as a protected condition. Employers can receive a credit for providing a suitable environment on business premises for employed mothers to breastfeed or express milk for their children. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 now allow for a credit for employer expenses incurred to facilitate employed mothers who breastfeed or express milk for their children. The breastfeeding promotion and support credit under section 38 allows for a 50% credit on qualified expenditures, not exceeding $10,000 per year, for breast pumps and equipment to assist employed mothers in breastfeeding or expressing milk. The breastfeeding promotion and support credit allows for a 50% credit on qualified expenditures for breast pumps and equipment meeting standards set by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as well as consultation services related to breastfeeding. It also includes costs for exclusive use property used by employed mothers for breastfeeding, with a recapture provision if conditions are not met. If property for which a credit was allowed under this section is disposed of or no longer used as required, the taxpayer's tax for that year will increase by the recapture percentage of the decrease in credits allowed for prior years. The recapture percentage is determined based on a table provided in the subsection. The recapture percentage for property disposed of or no longer used as required is based on a table provided in the subsection: Year 1 - 100%, Year 2 - 60%, Year 3 - 30%, Year 4 or thereafter - 0%. The recapture percentage for property disposed of or no longer used as required is based on a table provided in the subsection, with references to consecutive taxable years beginning with the year the property is placed in service. Special rules apply for aggregation of taxpayers and reduction in basis. Rules similar to section 50(c) and 1016(a)(19) apply to property eligible for the credit. No other deductions or credits are allowed for expenditures qualifying for this credit. Amendments to Section 38(b) include adding a new paragraph for the breastfeeding promotion and support credit. The table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code is amended by adding a new item. The \"Safe and Effective Breast Pumps Act\" provides a credit for employer expenses related to employed mothers who breastfeed or express milk for their children. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years starting after December 31, 2009. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish performance standards for breast pumps, regardless of their classification under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The standards will be based on efficiency, effectiveness, and sanitation for communal use in workplaces. A compliance policy guide will also be issued to provide complete information for women who want to breastfeed. Women who want to breastfeed will receive comprehensive information about breast pumps. Title IV expands the definition of medical care in the Internal Revenue Code to include breastfeeding equipment and services. Title IV expands the definition of medical care in the Internal Revenue Code to include qualified breastfeeding equipment and services, such as breast pumps and other specialized equipment to assist mothers in breastfeeding or expressing milk for their child. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009, allowing for the inclusion of qualified breastfeeding equipment and services in the definition of medical care. Title V - Privacy for Breastfeeding Mothers: Section 501 provides privacy for breastfeeding mothers. Title V - Privacy for Breastfeeding Mothers: Section 501 of the Fair Labor Standards Act requires employers to provide reasonable break time and a private space for employees to express breast milk for up to one year after the child's birth. Employers with 50 or more employees are subject to this provision. Section 16(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act is amended to allow employees harmed by a violation of section 7(r) to bring an action for equitable relief."
