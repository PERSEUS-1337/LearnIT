The \"Cleaning Product Right to Know Act of 2011\" mandates that cleaning products must have labels listing all ingredients, including those in dyes, fragrances, and preservatives, following specific guidelines for naming and order of listing. The \"Cleaning Product Right to Know Act of 2011\" requires cleaning products to list all ingredients in descending order of predominance by weight, with exemptions for undetectable ingredients and those constituting trade secrets. The \"Cleaning Product Right to Know Act of 2011\" mandates ingredient disclosure in cleaning products, with exemptions for trade secret ingredients. Manufacturers can claim trade secrecy for an ingredient for 5 years, with the option to renew for an additional 5 years. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for claiming trade secret protection, including the justification for the period selected, extent of knowledge within the facility or business, measures taken to restrict access, and non-disclosure agreements. The curr_chunk outlines additional requirements for claiming trade secret protection, including confidentiality determinations, estimated value of the information, effort/money expended in developing the information, and ease of acquisition. The curr_chunk specifies the need for a description of potential harm if information is disclosed and requires certification by an executive regarding the accuracy of the information. The curr_chunk outlines requirements for trade secret protection, including the need for accurate and non-public information, and contact details for further inquiries. The curr_chunk specifies exceptions to trade secret protection, such as publicly known ingredients, reverse engineering, hazardous substances, and substances meeting specific toxicity criteria. Hazardous substances can cause adverse effects in humans or other organisms, demonstrated through evidence or potential effects from exposure. The CPSC promptly determines if a chemical ingredient is a trade secret based on information submitted by the manufacturer, regarding its effects on various biological functions in humans or organisms. The CPSC notifies the manufacturer of non-conforming cleaning products and treats them as hazardous substances under the FHSA. Existing labeling requirements are unaffected, and the Commission has rulemaking authority for enforcement. Public Right to Know Petition allows any person to submit a petition to the Commission regarding a cleaning product not meeting labeling requirements. The Commission must investigate and make a determination within 180 days. If the claim is valid, enforcement actions will be taken. The Commission may also issue regulations for petitions to include evidentiary basis. Required Internet Disclosure is also mandated. Manufacturer of cleaning products must disclose a complete list of ingredients on their website within 6 months of this Act. The disclosure must include ingredient names, be updated every 120 days, include Chemical Abstract Services numbers, and highlight any potential health risks with appropriate signal words. The Commission must provide a web page for comparing cleaning products from different manufacturers, with information on ingredients, health effects, and hazard descriptors. The disclosures on the website must be available in English, Spanish, and other languages determined by the Commission. The Commission must provide information in English, Spanish, and other languages as necessary for users to be informed about a cleaning product's ingredients and potential health effects. SEC. 5. ENHANCED PENALTIES. Amends penalties under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. SEC. 6. REPORTING. Requires the Commission to prepare and transmit compliance reports to Congress. SEC. 7. PREEMPTION.
