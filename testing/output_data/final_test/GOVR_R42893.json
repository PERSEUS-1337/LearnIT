    "content": "Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program that finances medical services for 56 million individuals at a cost of $427 billion in FY2011. Participation is voluntary for states, which have flexibility in designing their own version of Medicaid within federal guidelines. States share the costs with the federal government by making payments to service providers. In FY2012, federal Medicaid payments to states totaled $271 billion, almost 8% of all federal spending. Medicaid costs have generally increased faster than the economy, driven by eligibility expansions and per-enrollee cost growth. Medicaid per-enrollee expenditures are relatively low compared to other health insurance forms. Medicaid expenditures are influenced by economic, demographic, and programmatic factors, including health care prices, population growth, and state decisions on eligibility and services. There is significant variation in Medicaid spending among states, with factors such as population and low-income residents contributing to differences. Over the next 10 years, Medicaid expenditures are projected to increase significantly due to changes enacted by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). The most significant ACA change to Medicaid is the expansion of eligibility to adults under age 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. Originally, all states were expected to implement the ACA Medicaid expansion in 2014, but the United States Supreme Court's decision in 2012 allowed states to opt out. The United States Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states cannot lose federal Medicaid funding for refusing to implement the ACA Medicaid expansion. Some states have decided to implement the expansion, while others have stated they will not. Despite this, federal Medicaid expenditures are still expected to increase. Federal Medicaid expenditures are projected to increase from $253 billion in FY2012 to $592 billion in FY2022, a 134% increase. Controlling federal Medicaid spending has been a focus of deficit reduction efforts, with recommendations including repealing or delaying the ACA's Medicaid expansion, restructuring Medicaid financing, and reducing states' use of provider taxes. The ACA's Medicaid expansion is expected to increase expenditures, even after the Supreme Court's optional decision. The federal government will fund most of the expansion costs due to enhanced matching rates. Recommendations include restructuring Medicaid financing, reducing provider taxes, changing coverage for dual eligibles, reducing federal DSH allotments, and limiting Medicaid reimbursement for DME. The ACA's Medicaid expansion will provide increased FMAP rates for newly eligible individuals and those in expansion states. Federal Medicaid expenditures from FY2014 to FY2022 are estimated at $643 billion, $288 billion less than initially projected. Repealing the ACA Medicaid expansion has been suggested as a way to reduce federal Medicaid expenditures. The House Budget Committee Report included examples for achieving budget savings, one of which was repealing the ACA Medicaid expansion. CBO's Choices for Deficit Reduction also suggested repealing the expansion of health insurance coverage under the ACA. Repealing the ACA Medicaid expansion could reduce federal Medicaid expenditures by $643 billion from FY2013 to FY2022. The current Medicaid financing structure aims to share the cost of providing healthcare services to low-income residents with the states. The federal government's Medicaid financing structure involves paying at least half of the cost to states, with no cap on funding. States are reimbursed based on their FMAP rate, incentivizing them to extend coverage to more low-income individuals. This financial commitment encourages states to expand Medicaid coverage. In FY2011, Medicaid expenditures were mainly for acute care services (71%) and LTSS (24%). Options to reduce federal Medicaid spending include converting it to a block grant program or funding acute care and LTSS separately. The CBO proposed converting the federal share of LTSS payments into a block grant for Medicaid. The House Budget Committee suggested restructuring Medicaid into a block grant program, with limited details on the design. Federal funding to states would increase annually based on inflation and population growth. The House Budget Committee proposed restructuring Medicaid into a block grant program, aiming to reduce federal outlays by $810 billion from FY2013 to FY2022. This model would provide states with more flexibility in designing and administering their Medicaid programs, potentially making federal spending more predictable and incentivizing cost control. The CBO noted that the impact of this change would depend on how states adapt, with potential efficiency gains and reduced cost burdens. The CBO proposes converting the federal share of Medicaid's payment for LTSS into a block grant, indexed to changes in the employment cost index. States would receive fixed federal funding for LTSS, allowing for greater flexibility in usage in exchange for slower growth in federal Medicaid payments. The Debt Reduction Task Force proposed dividing Medicaid financing between the federal government and states to save $20 billion from FY2012 to FY2020. Many states use provider taxes to fund their share of Medicaid expenditures. In FY2012, states and the District of Columbia used provider taxes to finance Medicaid, primarily to increase payment rates for certain providers. This strategy allows states to fund rate increases without using state funds, as the revenue comes from provider taxes and federal matching funds. Provider taxes must primarily burden healthcare providers and be broad-based to qualify for federal Medicaid matching funds. States also use provider tax revenue for various Medicaid and non-Medicaid purposes. The provider tax used to finance Medicaid must be broad-based and uniform, with states unable to guarantee providers receive their money back. States can waive the hold harmless requirement if the tax is below 6% of net patient service revenues. No state has imposed a tax above this threshold. Limiting provider taxes in Medicaid financing is proposed to reduce federal spending. The President's FY2013 budget proposal aims to reduce federal Medicaid expenditures by phasing down the Medicaid provider tax threshold from 6% to 3.5% from FY2015 to FY2017. The proposal is estimated to save $21.8 billion from FY2015 through FY2022 according to the President's budget, while CBO estimates savings of $47.8 billion over the same period. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform recommended restricting and eventually eliminating states' use of provider taxes in Medicaid financing. The commission's report estimated a $44 billion reduction in federal Medicaid expenditures from FY2012 to FY2020 by phasing down the use of Medicaid provider taxes. The FMAP formula determines the federal government's share for most Medicaid expenditures based on each state's per capita income compared to the U.S. per capita income, with rates ranging from 50% to 73% for FY2013. Exceptions to the regular FMAP rate exist for certain states, situations, populations, providers, and services. Some exceptions to the regular FMAP rates for Medicaid include temporary increases for states affected by disasters, enhanced rates for covering women with breast or cervical cancer, 100% federal reimbursement for services at Indian Health Service facilities, 90% reimbursement for family planning services, and 50% federal matching rate for Medicaid administrative expenditures. For the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), states are reimbursed according to the E-FMAP rate for services and administration. The E-FMAP rate for Medicaid and CHIP may be subject to changes to reduce federal expenditures. The President's FY2013 budget proposes a blended FMAP rate to replace the current structure, with details still pending. This blended rate would encompass Medicaid, CHIP, and exceptions to the regular FMAP rate. The Administration initially proposed a blended FMAP rate to reduce federal Medicaid spending, estimating a $17.9 billion reduction from FY2017 to FY2022. However, on December 10, 2012, they reversed course due to the importance of higher federal matching rates in the ACA for encouraging states to implement Medicaid expansion. CBO suggests saving federal Medicaid dollars by reducing the statutory FMAP floor, estimating a $20 billion savings in FY2020. In FY2020, a $20 billion savings in federal Medicaid expenditures is projected by reducing the statutory FMAP floor. This option would impact 14 states with FMAP rates of 50%, while the other 36 states and the District of Columbia would not be affected. Dual eligibles, who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid, include elderly and disabled individuals meeting specific eligibility criteria. In FY2008, dual eligibles accounted for 14% of Medicaid enrollees and 37% of Medicaid spending, totaling $89 billion for LTSS, $32 billion for Medicare premiums, and $8 billion for acute care services. Most dual eligibles receive coverage on a fee-for-service basis, but some are under managed care. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform proposed strategies to reduce Medicaid expenditures for dual eligibles, recommending that Medicaid take full responsibility for their care and enroll them in managed care plans. This is due to their high costs, complex health needs, and reliance on both Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Debt Reduction Task Force proposed fast-tracking waiver applications to mandate managed care coverage for dual eligibles, saving $5 billion from FY2012 to FY2018. Additionally, the task force recommended recognizing the financial challenges of hospitals treating low-income patients by requiring DSH payments. Recognizing the financial challenges faced by hospitals treating low-income patients, especially due to low reimbursement rates for uninsured and Medicaid patients. Federal Medicaid DSH funding is capped, with each state receiving an annual allotment based on historical payments. In FY2012, federal DSH allotments totaled $11.3 billion, with variations among states based on past DSH payments. The disparity in current DSH allotments remains due to the historical differences in states' DSH payments. Changes in methodology over time have aimed to reduce this gap by adjusting allotments based on past payments. Currently, states' DSH allotments are determined by their prior year's allocation. The ACA is expected to reduce the number of uninsured individuals in the United States through health insurance coverage provisions. It includes a provision for aggregate reductions in Medicaid DSH allotments starting in FY2014. Louisiana was the only state in FY2012 to receive its FY2004 DSH allotment. The ACA included reductions in Medicaid DSH allotments starting in FY2014, with allotments rebounding to pre-ACA levels by FY2021. However, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 extended the reduction for FY2021, with allotments based on FY2020 levels. In FY2022, states' DSH allotments were set to return to pre-ACA levels with inflation adjustments. However, P.L. 112-240 extended the FY2020 reduction for another year. FY2023 will see allotments rebound to pre-ACA levels with inflation adjustments. The President's FY2013 budget proposed rebasing FY2021 Medicaid DSH allotments to lower FY2020 levels. The Administration estimated that adjusting DME payments based on CPI-U would save $8.3 billion from FY2013 to FY2022, with CBO estimating $4.2 billion in savings. DME includes equipment for medical purposes like hospital beds and wheelchairs, generally used in the home. States have flexibility in setting payment rates for DME under Medicaid. The President's FY2013 budget proposed limiting Medicaid payment rates for DME to match Medicare rates in the same state, aiming to save $3.0 billion. Medicare typically pays for DME based on fee schedules updated annually for inflation, with a recent addition of a competitive acquisition program for selected DME. The competitive bidding program for DME determines prices in specified areas through supplier bids. The first round began in 2008 but was halted, with a new round starting in 2009. The second round began in 2011 in 91 additional areas. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must extend the program or adjust fee schedule rates by 2016. Federal Medicaid expenditures make up 8% of the budget, with the government funding the majority of the ACA Medicaid expansion starting in 2014. The government will fund the ACA Medicaid expansion starting in 2014, with proposals to reduce federal Medicaid expenditures including reforming financing structure, changing coverage options, and limiting reimbursement for medical equipment. Options to reduce federal Medicaid expenditures include block granting Medicaid, reducing states' use of provider taxes, and reforming the FMAP. States facing reduced federal Medicaid expenditures may need to increase their share to maintain current programs, impacting access to care for enrollees. Choices to constrain Medicaid spending include reducing provider payments, limiting benefits, or restricting eligibility. This could force states to prioritize Medicaid against other spending needs. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, created by President Obama, proposed deficit reduction measures that could impact Medicaid provider rates and access to care for enrollees. Other budget proposals, such as the Debt Reduction Task Force and the President's FY2013 budget, were also considered for deficit reduction. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform's final report in December 2010 proposed federal savings of $58 billion from FY2012 to FY2020 by changing Medicaid funding and coverage. The Debt Reduction Task Force, co-chaired by Pete Domenici and Alice Rivlin, suggested Medicaid provisions that could save $25 billion from FY2012 to FY2020. The Debt Reduction Task Force proposed Medicaid provisions to reduce cost growth exceeding GDP growth by one percentage point annually and eliminate barriers for dual eligibles in managed care. The President's FY2013 budget aimed to reduce federal Medicaid expenditures by $55.7 billion from FY2013 to FY2022, including limits on states' use of provider taxes for Medicaid financing. The FY2013 House Budget Resolution proposed changes to Medicaid financing, including provider taxes, a blended FMAP rate, durable medical equipment reimbursement limits, and Medicaid DSH reductions. Representative Paul Ryan released the Chairman's mark of the budget resolution, which was analyzed by the House Budget Committee and introduced as H.Con.Res. 112. The House Budget Resolution H.Con.Res. 112, introduced in March 2012, proposed restructuring Medicaid to a block grant system and repealing ACA provisions. It aimed to achieve budget savings, with estimates of $810 billion from the block grant and $643 billion from repealing the ACA Medicaid expansion. CBO's Choices for Deficit Reform in November 2012 further discussed deficit reduction options. In November 2012, CBO published Choices for Deficit Reform, outlining options to reduce federal spending, including repealing ACA Medicaid expansion, converting LTSS into a block grant, and reducing the FMAP floor. These options could save $156 billion in federal Medicaid expenditures by FY2020."
