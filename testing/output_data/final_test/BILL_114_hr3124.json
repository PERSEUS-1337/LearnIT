    "content": "The Act titled \"Clean Slate for Marijuana Offenses Act of 2015\" introduces a new subchapter for expungement of criminal records related to marijuana offenses in the United States Code. The \"Clean Slate for Marijuana Offenses Act of 2015\" introduces a new subchapter allowing individuals convicted of qualifying marijuana-related offenses to petition for expungement under specific requirements. The \"Clean Slate for Marijuana Offenses Act of 2015\" allows individuals convicted of qualifying marijuana-related offenses to petition for expungement under specific requirements. To be eligible for expungement, individuals must fulfill all sentence requirements, including completing imprisonment or probation terms, meeting supervised release conditions, and paying fines. An individual can file a petition for expungement. An individual can file a petition for expungement of a conviction in the court where the conviction occurred. The Government has 60 days to contest the petition by providing evidence if they believe the facts do not support expungement. If no opposition is raised, court-ordered expungement may proceed. An order granting expungement under this subchapter restores the individual to their pre-arrest status in the eyes of the law. After expungement is granted, the individual is not required to disclose information about the expunged conviction. The individual is not disqualified from pursuing lawful activities, occupations, or professions due to the conviction. Records are to be destroyed upon expungement, except as provided in section 3635. The Department of Justice maintains a nonpublic record of expungements with only the name and identifiers of individuals who obtained expungement. This information is only accessible to the individual or their designated agent. Unauthorized disclosure of this information is punishable by law. The Department of Justice keeps a private record of expungements, accessible only to the individual or their agent. Unauthorized disclosure of expunged conviction information is punishable by a fine or imprisonment up to one year. Expungement amendments made by this Act apply to individuals convicted of an offense before, on, or after the date of enactment."
