    "content": "The Act titled \"HMO Solvency Act of 2001\" aims to ensure the financial stability of Medicaid managed care organizations. The Medicaid Program requires Medicaid managed care organizations to submit financial reports regularly to monitor their stability and detect insolvency risks. States must review these reports and take appropriate action. The Medicaid managed care organization must undergo an on-site audit by an independent entity before entering into a contract with a State under section 1903(m). The audit will evaluate the organization's internal structure, including financial projections, claims processing capability, and utilization. The Medicaid managed care organization must focus on key business risks such as regulatory risks, competition, provider network, pricing, claims processing environment, reserves, and information system integrity. Periodic audits under a state audit plan are required to be conducted by each organization as per the State's requirements. The Medicaid managed care organization must maintain a minimum net worth in cash or cash equivalents as specified by the State. Approval of subcontractors is required for certain organizations. The Medicaid managed care organization must provide notice and a copy of the contract to the State at least 90 days before entering into a subcontract for health care services. An independent audit of the proposed subcontractor is also required before it takes effect. The Medicaid managed care organization must conduct an independent audit of the proposed subcontractor to ensure financial performance satisfactory to the State. Significant changes in ownership or operations must be reported to the State to maintain organization solvency. The Medicaid managed care organization must comply with additional solvency standards set by the Secretary. Requirements also apply to controlling organizations or entities. Effective date of the amendment is subject to specific conditions. The amendment made by subsection (a) applies as of a date specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, not later than 6 months after the enactment of the Act. The Secretary may delay the effective date for states needing legislation to meet the new requirements and allow additional time for existing Medicaid managed care organizations to comply. The amendment allows for additional time to comply with the new requirement of minimum net worth under section 1932(b)(9)(C) of the Social Security Act. SEC. 3. ASSURING THE SOLVENCY OF MEDICARE+CHOICE ORGANIZATIONS. SEC. 3. ASSURING THE SOLVENCY OF MEDICARE+CHOICE ORGANIZATIONS. Amends Section 1855 of the Social Security Act to add solvency-related requirements for Medicare+Choice organizations, applying similar rules as for Medicaid managed care organizations. Recognizes state enforcement in applying these requirements. The Secretary will deem a Medicare+Choice organization as meeting requirements if they meet certain conditions. The Secretary can waive requirements if they are duplicative and do not provide greater protection to enrollees. The requirement of section 1855(e) of the Social Security Act will apply to organizations providing Medicare benefits on a capitated basis. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will implement amendments to the Social Security Act for organizations receiving capitated payments for services under title XVIII. The implementation will be similar to other effective amendments. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will report to Congress within a year on steps taken by States to protect health care providers in case of insolvency of Medicaid managed care organizations or Medicare+Choice organizations. The report will also include recommendations for additional measures to safeguard providers in such situations."
