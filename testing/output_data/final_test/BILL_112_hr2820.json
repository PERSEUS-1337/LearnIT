    "content": "The Act titled \"Advanced Composites Development Act of 2011\" establishes Advanced Composites Development Centers. The Act establishes a program to improve transportation infrastructure, advance alternative energy technologies, enhance military security, and develop disaster mitigation systems through grants to consortia for Advanced Composites Development Centers. The program aims to solve identified problems over 5 years by developing advanced composite materials in collaboration with stakeholders and the private sector. The Act establishes Advanced Composites Development Centers to develop new composite materials for civil infrastructure, energy technology, military operations, and disaster mitigation. Each Center will focus on producing lighter, stronger, and more durable materials with immediate practical applications. The Centers are designated by the Secretaries of Transportation, Energy, Defense, and Homeland Security. The Act establishes Advanced Composites Development Centers designated by the Secretaries of Transportation, Energy, Defense, and Homeland Security. The Secretaries may collaborate to designate a single Center addressing common issues. Each Center may involve reviewers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Science Foundation for additional collaboration. Eligible consortia may receive grants under the Act. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a consortium must be composed of qualifying entities, including a prime applicant and a private company, and operate under a binding agreement documenting the partnership, governance structure, cost-effective measures, proposed budget, and financial contributions from non-Federal sources. To establish and operate a Center under this section, a consortium must have financial contributions from non-Federal sources, conflict of interest procedures, known conflicts of interest with mitigation plans, an accounting structure for compliance, and operate as a nonprofit organization. The consortium must submit an application to the Secretary through a prime applicant with required information. The Secretary requires detailed information for consortium applications, including a description of the consortium agreement. Selection of consortia for Centers is done through competitive processes, considering disclosed information and existing facilities. Grants for Center activities include experience in design, prototyping, testing advanced composites, ISO 17025 certification, working with the private sector, and leveraging previous support. Grants are for a maximum of 5 years. The operation of a Center is limited to 5 years, with the possibility of renewal through a competitive process. Centers conduct collaborative research and development in advanced composites technologies, encouraging communication and collaboration among consortium members. The Center proposed plans and programs, submits an annual report summarizing activities and expenditures, and monitors project implementation. Conflict of interest procedures are established to ensure disclosure of material conflicts. The Secretary may disqualify or revoke funds for non-compliance with conflict of interest procedures. Each Secretary must establish an Oversight Board to monitor Centers' progress. Priority consideration is given to applications involving 1890 Land Grant Institutions. The term \"advanced composites\" refers to polymer matrix composite materials used in structural applications, including synthetic and natural fibers, resins, and nano-additives. These materials may be used in combination with traditional and other advanced materials. The term \"Center\" refers to an Advanced Composites Development Center established in accordance with the section. The term \"institution of higher education\" has the meaning given in the Higher Education Act of 1965. The term \"prime applicant\" refers to an institution of higher education applying for a grant. The term \"qualifying entity\" includes State or Federal entities and nonprofit organizations with expertise in advanced composites technology research. The Secretary, as defined in the section, may designate entities with expertise in advanced composites technology for funding. Appropriations are authorized for the Secretaries to carry out the program, with increasing amounts allocated for fiscal years 2012 to 2015. Appropriations of $19,000,000 for fiscal year 2015 and $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2016 are authorized for the Secretaries to designate entities with expertise in advanced composites technology."
