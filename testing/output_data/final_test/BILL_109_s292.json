It prevents the funds from being used for purposes other than providing retirement security. The \"Social Security Lock-Box Act of 2005\" establishes a lock-box for Social Security funds to protect them from being used for purposes other than retirement security. The \"Social Security Lock-Box Act of 2005\" creates a lock-box to safeguard Social Security funds from being diverted for other purposes. It prohibits setting lower totals for Social Security Trust Funds in budget resolutions unless based on a current services baseline. The legislation requires any budget resolution related to social security reform to include a statement if it involves an increase in outlays or a decrease in revenues. The legislation prohibits consideration of any spending or tax legislation in Congress if it would impact the totals for any fiscal year covered by the budget resolution related to Social Security Trust. The budget must not exceed the totals of the Social Security Trust Funds for the fiscal year, except for social security reform legislation. Enforcement of this rule will be based on the levels set forth in the budget resolution report or joint explanatory statement. Additional content may be included in reports accompanying budget resolutions. The report accompanying budget resolutions and joint explanatory statements must include budget totals for each fiscal year and Social Security Trust Funds revenues and disbursements. Social security reform legislation is defined as a bill or joint resolution aimed at saving social security.

The President's budget must protect Social Security by recommending totals that are not less than the current services baseline. If the totals are lower, a detailed proposal for social security reform legislation must be included. This provision will end upon the enactment of social security reform legislation."
