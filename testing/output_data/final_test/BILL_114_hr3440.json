    "content": "The \"Fusion Innovation Act of 2015\" may be cited as the Fusion Innovation Initiative. The Fusion Innovation Initiative, established by the Director of the Office of Science of the Department of Energy, aims to solicit proposals for engineering designs of fusion energy systems with the potential for net energy production within 7 years of construction. Applicants must provide detailed cost estimates and construction schedules for their designs. The Director will review design submissions for the Fusion Innovation Initiative, awarding applicants with potential designs and requiring them to submit their designs within 18 months. An assessment will be conducted to determine which designs merit support from the Department. The Director will review design submissions for the Fusion Innovation Initiative, awarding applicants with potential designs and requiring them to submit their designs within 18 months. Designs must demonstrate net energy production within 7 years of construction. The Director will prioritize and provide expedited financial support for construction activities based on project management practices. SEC. 3. RESOURCE AND INFORMATION SHARING. The Secretary of Energy will establish open, transparent processes to share unclassified resources and information to advance fusion energy technologies. This includes advanced computing platforms, diagnostic equipment information, and pulsed power system information. Additionally, unclassified simulation codes controlled by National Laboratories will be made available to researchers from other institutions. The Secretary of Energy will support shared platforms for codevelopment of simulation codes for fusion energy systems among researchers from National Laboratories, institutions of higher education, and the private sector. Additionally, fusion researchers from National Laboratories can serve limited-term residencies at private sector companies working on fusion technologies, with support from the host companies. The Secretary of Energy will establish fusion demonstration sites to support collaboration among researchers from National Laboratories, higher education institutions, and the private sector. The Secretary of Energy will transmit a report assessing the Department of Energy's capabilities to oversee privately funded fusion prototypes with up to 20 megawatts thermal output at Department-owned sites. The report will address safety review, oversight capabilities, and potential sites for research and development of prototype reactors. The report will evaluate the Department of Energy's existing capabilities, contractual mechanisms, cost structures, and challenges related to overseeing privately funded fusion prototypes with up to 2 gigawatts of thermal output. The term \"National Laboratories\" in this Act refers to the definition provided in the Energy Policy Act of 2005."
