The \"Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act\" amends Section 43 of title 18, United States Code, to address force, violence, and threats involving animal enterprises. It criminalizes traveling in interstate or foreign commerce to damage or disrupt an animal enterprise, including causing property loss or instilling fear of harm to individuals. The \"Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act\" criminalizes conduct that causes fear of harm to individuals or economic damage to animal enterprises. Penalties include fines or imprisonment for economic damage up to $10,000, and more severe penalties for significant economic damage or disruption. Any violation of the subsection (a) that causes economic damage or disruption exceeding $10,000 but not more than $100,000 may result in a fine or imprisonment up to 5 years. Major economic damage exceeding $100,000 can lead to a fine or imprisonment up to 10 years. Significant bodily injury or threats during a violation may result in a fine or imprisonment up to 5 years. Any violation of subsection (a) that causes serious bodily injury may result in a fine, imprisonment up to 20 years, or both. Causing death during a violation can lead to a fine, death penalty, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for any term of years. Conspiracy or attempt to commit an offense under subsection (a) carries the same penalties as the substantive offense. Restitution may also be ordered for violations of this section. Restitution for violations of this section may include costs for repeating interrupted experiments, loss of food production or farm income, and other economic damages. The term 'animal enterprise' refers to commercial or academic entities using animals for profit, research, or testing. The term 'course of conduct' refers to a pattern of behavior with a continuity of purpose. 'Economic damage' includes costs of lost or damaged property, while 'economic disruption' involves losses exceeding $10,000 from various actions like vandalism or harassment. The term 'serious bodily injury' refers to severe harm such as risk of death, extreme pain, disfigurement, or loss of bodily function. It excludes lawful economic disruption resulting from public, governmental, or business reactions to information about an animal enterprise. The term 'significant bodily injury' includes deep cuts, burns, disfigurement, fractures, physical pain, illness, and impairment of bodily functions. This section does not preempt any State law. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to include force, violence, and threats involving animal enterprises in the relevant section of the United States Code."
