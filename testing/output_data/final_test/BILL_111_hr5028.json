DETERMINATION OF FAIR MARKET RENT. The fair market rent for a foreclosed property in a covered foreclosure proceeding is determined by an independent appraiser appointed by the court. It is adjusted annually based on changes in the Consumer Price Index.

This can only be done once every 12 months. SEC. 5. Nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings allow eligible mortgagors to seek a determination of fair market rent for foreclosed property in court.
