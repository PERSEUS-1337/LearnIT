    "content": "The 110th Congress overrode a presidential veto of WRDA 2007, authorizing approximately 900 projects, studies, and modifications. The President vetoed the bill citing \"excessive authorizations\" and lack of fiscal discipline. This was the first congressional override of a veto by President George W. Bush. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the 15-year impact at $23 billion. The conference report for WRDA 2007 had higher authorization levels than the House and Senate versions, totaling around $23 billion over 15 years. This was due to including most authorizations from both bills, increased federal cost estimates for New Orleans hurricane protection, and additional provisions not in either bill. The Administration supported these changes. The Administration supported a $23 billion authorization for the Santa Ana River Mainstem project in WRDA 2007, focusing on projects in the Corps' primary missions. Independent review was a debated issue during congressional consideration, with differences in scope, exemptions, and recommendations between the House and Senate versions. WRDA 2007 adopted the technical review approach of the House bill and did not establish a separate office of independent review. WRDA 2007 did not establish a separate office of independent review as part of the Senate language. It also set up a safety assurance review process for hurricane protection and flood damage projects, giving the Corps' Chief of Engineers discretion on when to call for a safety review. Key issues in WRDA 2007 included disagreements on project authorizations, such as billion-dollar regional authorizations for Coastal Louisiana wetlands restoration, Florida Everglades ecosystem restoration, and Upper Mississippi River Illinois Waterway navigation and ecosystem restoration projects. The WRDA 2007 authorized the Corps to participate in various municipal water and wastewater infrastructure projects, which faced opposition from taxpayer groups. Proponents argued that these authorizations were necessary to assist projects ineligible for other funding programs. New issues arose during the 110th Congress, including concerns about funding navigation and restoration projects on the Upper Mississippi River Illinois Waterway. Some new issues emerged during the 110th Congress regarding the WRDA debate. Environmental groups raised concerns about the lack of focus on climate change's impact on flood risk. There was also interest in studying the energy and fuel-related consequences of dam removal. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, a federal agency under the Department of Defense, is responsible for various water resource facilities across the U.S. Their responsibilities include creating and maintaining navigable channels, controlling floods, and ecosystem restoration. Congress has expanded the Corps' duties in the past two decades to include municipal water infrastructure, disaster relief, and other activities. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for water resource facilities and navigable channels. WRDA legislation authorizes Corps projects and modifications, with new acts adding to previous authorizations. Major issues in WRDA 2007 included changes to project development practices, Louisiana wetlands restoration, UMR-IWW investments, and Everglades projects. A new WRDA adds to and amends provisions of previous acts, authorizing Corps water resources studies and construction projects. Authorization generally does not expire, but there is a process to deauthorize projects without appropriations for seven years. Corps projects can be authorized in WRDAs or appropriations bills when WRDA is delayed or not enacted. Authorization in appropriations bills may be subject to a point of order on the House floor. Authorization establishes a project's essential character, which is seldom modified during appropriations. The appropriations process plays a significant role in realizing a project by determining which studies and projects receive federal funds. Congress has authorized various activities in the past 15 years, increasing competition for construction funds. The Corps had a backlog of over 800 authorized projects before WRDA 2007, with many projects not consistently receiving construction appropriations. Before the enactment of WRDA 2007, the Corps estimated a construction backlog of $39 billion for authorized projects. WRDA 1986 marked the end of a stalemate between Congress and the executive branch, changing cost-sharing requirements and establishing user fees and environmental requirements. Pressure to authorize new projects and modify existing ones promotes consideration of WRDA, but enactment may be complicated due to debates about the Corps' missions and resource allocation. Since 1986, a biennial cycle of WRDA consideration has been loosely followed. Since 1986, a biennial cycle of WRDA consideration has been loosely followed, with WRDAs enacted in 1988, 1990, 1992, 1996, 1999, and 2000. The 110th Congress faced pressure to enact WRDA 2007 due to a backlog of projects awaiting authorization. The Bush Administration did not propose a WRDA but expressed its position through Administration letters and Statements of Administration Policy. The President vetoed WRDA 2007 citing billions in new authorizations. The Bush Administration opposed billions in new authorizations for projects outside the agency's core mission, creating unrealistic expectations for federal actions and funding. Support for changing the Corps' practices grew after critical articles, whistleblower allegations, and investigations in 2000. The failure of Corps-constructed floodwalls in New Orleans further fueled calls for reform. The failure of Corps-constructed floodwalls in New Orleans led to calls for reform in the agency's practices. Advocates for change sought modifications to project planning and environmental protection measures, known as \"Corps reform.\" Despite discussions in multiple Congresses, no significant changes were enacted, with the Corps arguing that it had already implemented policies to address concerns. The Corps faced calls for reform after floodwall failures in New Orleans. Advocates sought changes in project planning and environmental protection measures. WRDA 2007 included provisions for Corps policy changes, with supporters of streamlining arguing against unnecessary measures proposed by environmental groups. The House and Senate provisions in WRDA 2007 differed on project review scope, exemptions, and who would conduct the reviews. The Senate version included safety reviews for Corps flood projects, prompted by New Orleans floodwall failures. WRDA 2007 adopted the House's technical review approach and did not create a separate office for independent review. WRDA 2007 included safety reviews for Corps flood projects, with a sunset provision extended to seven years. Some oppose authorizations for projects outside the agency's core mission areas. Corps had not been involved in environmental infrastructure projects before 1992. The Corps' involvement in environmental infrastructure projects has varied in funding, ranging from $94 million to over $200 million annually. Proponents argue that these projects are necessary due to limitations in existing federal programs, while opponents believe other agencies can address municipal infrastructure needs. WRDA 2007 authorized over 200 new Corps projects, including efforts in New Orleans and southeast Louisiana for hurricane recovery and infrastructure fortification. The Corps is repairing hurricane protection levees and floodwalls in the area using supplemental appropriations. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 shares offshore oil and gas revenues with Gulf coast states for coastal protection projects, totaling almost $350 million over the next decade. The law increases funding in Louisiana for restoration and hurricane protection efforts due to coastal wetland losses. Federal agencies and the state have developed plans to slow wetland loss and restore some areas. The Corps feasibility report recommended measures totaling $2.0 billion, with $1.1 billion for immediate projects. The Corps feasibility report proposed measures totaling $2.0 billion for projects and programs for immediate authorization, investigations of \"large-scale concepts,\" and future authorization of restoration features. The plan includes diverting water from the Mississippi River to convey sediments into nearby wetlands and stabilize the coastline. The federal government would cover about 65% of the estimated cost, with wetlands gradually reestablishing themselves on newly deposited sediments. The Coastal Louisiana title of WRDA 2007 used the report as a starting point, with additional provisions added in response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The conference report for the Coastal Louisiana title of WRDA 2007 authorizes more projects than the passed bills, with adjustments to language on restoration priorities. It includes the development of a comprehensive plan for coastal Louisiana, prioritizing wetlands creation and flood protection. A federal-state task force and expert working groups are established to implement the plan. The Coastal Louisiana title of WRDA 2007 authorizes a comprehensive plan for coastal restoration, with a federal-state task force and expert working groups making recommendations to the Secretary and Congress. Funding is allocated for various activities, including modification of existing projects, scientific and technical work, demonstration projects, and exploration of using dredged materials in restoration. Specific projects are authorized, with $828.3 million allocated for five restoration projects, subject to cost limitations and reporting requirements. Title VII of WRDA 2007 authorizes the Corps to carry out ten coastal restoration projects with cost limitations and reporting requirements. The Secretary can skip economic evaluations if environmental benefits to the coastal Louisiana ecosystem are proven. Additionally, progress reports on the projects are required. Title VII of WRDA 2007 authorizes the Corps to carry out coastal restoration projects with reporting requirements. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have influenced the debate on wetlands restoration proposals, with calls for more extensive efforts beyond those authorized in WRDA 2007. The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority released a draft plan in February 2007 titled Integrated Ecosystem. The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority released a draft plan in February 2007 titled Integrated Ecosystem Restoration and Hurricane Protection: Louisiana's Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast. WRDA 2007 authorized activities to improve flood and hurricane storm damage reduction projects in Louisiana, including work to provide protection from a 100-year flood and qualify for the National Flood Insurance Program. Nearly $6 billion in revised estimates were allocated for these projects. WRDA 2007 authorized expedited consideration for hurricane protection measures in coastal Louisiana, including projects like the Morganza-to-the Gulf of Mexico project and the Larose to Golden Meadow project. It also allocated funds for a flood damage reduction project in Lower Jefferson Parish. WRDA 2007 authorized $2.2 billion in navigation improvements and $1.7 billion in ecosystem restoration activities on the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway (UMR-IWW), a 1,200-mile navigation channel. The system has faced increasing traffic delays since the 1980s, affecting the competitiveness of U.S. products in global markets and habitat diversity. The Chief of Engineers approved the feasibility report on UMR-IWW improvements in December 2004, but the debate over the urgency and necessity of expanded navigation capacity continues. An economic reevaluation of navigation investments was requested by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) by September 2007. Critics argue that the Corps' analysis of the investments lacks reliability and completeness. Critics questioned the economic justification for navigation lock investments due to the shift towards using corn for ethanol production instead of shipping it internationally. Supporters argued that U.S. product competitiveness was being affected by delays and costs from existing locks. The Corps' ecosystem restoration plan had less controversy, with general agreement on the declining ecosystem and support for the initial 15-year phase. Debate focused on implementation strategies for the restoration proposal. The restoration proposal focuses on implementation strategies, including linkages between ecosystem restoration and navigation investments, with a 50% federal-50% nonfederal cost share. The largest Corps ecosystem restoration effort is in the Florida Everglades, with a $10.9 billion restoration program aimed at storing freshwater and redirecting it back to the Everglades to restore natural hydrologic functions. WRDA 2000 authorized an initial set of restoration projects under the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Total costs estimated at $1.4 million, representing $700 million in federal funding. WRDA 2007 authorized over $1.8 billion in Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) activities, with $0.9 billion in federal responsibility. The Modified Water Deliveries Project (Mod Waters) is a controversial ecological restoration effort in south Florida to improve water delivery to Everglades National Park. Completion of Mod Waters is necessary for some CERP projects. The conference report for WRDA 2007 provided directions to the Corps on Mod Waters, including increasing flows to the Everglades National Park. The conference report for WRDA 2007 authorized over $1.8 billion in Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) activities, including the controversial Modified Water Deliveries Project (Mod Waters) in south Florida. It directed the Chief of Engineers to reexamine prior reports and environmental documentation for increasing water flow under Tamiami Trail to Everglades National Park by July 1, 2008. Congress is also addressing unresolved water resource issues, such as multi-use river management, outside of WRDA authorizations. The management of rivers across the nation involves balancing benefits and harm for various uses, including economic, recreational, and habitat purposes. This shift in how rivers are valued has led to a reexamination of management alternatives by courts, agencies, and stakeholders. The example of Missouri River management raises questions about prioritizing different uses, such as endangered species protection versus waterway transportation, and how to decide precedence. This complexity highlights the challenges faced by the Corps in managing rivers. The Corps is facing complex issues in river management, often leading to congressional consideration through oversight or legislative language in bills like WRDA. The federal role in water resources, highlighted by Hurricane Katrina, raises questions about benefits, costs, and risks in flood mitigation. Increasing competition over water supplies, especially in urban centers like Atlanta, has led to more communities seeking federal assistance and permits for water supply. Congress typically pursues incremental changes through WRDA bills and other legislation for federal water resources policies, rather than broad legislation. The WRDA 2007 debate focused on differing opinions regarding policy changes, accountability, and investments in ecosystem restoration, navigation, and flood mitigation measures. The WRDA 2007 highlighted disagreements over the role of authorizations in guiding the agency's activities, with concerns raised about the backlog of Corps projects, funding constraints, aging infrastructure, and flood risks. Despite these issues, the popularity of the WRDA vehicle among legislators and demand from nonfederal project sponsors are likely to continue its use.
