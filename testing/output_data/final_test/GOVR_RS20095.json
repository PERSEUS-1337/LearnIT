    "content": "The Constitution grants Congress the \"power of the purse\" without specifying a budget process. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 established the executive budget process, requiring the President to submit an annual budget to Congress. The act also created the Bureau of the Budget (now the Office of Management and Budget) and the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office). The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 further shaped the federal budget process. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 established the congressional budget process, including the creation of the House and Senate Budget Committees and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The President must submit a proposed budget by the first Monday in February, initiating interaction with Congress. Congressional committees then submit their \"views and estimates\" within six weeks. The Budget Committees gather information from various sources to draft a concurrent resolution on the budget, including budget projections, program details, and priorities. This resolution represents an agreement between the House and Senate on budget priorities and sets the parameters for the budget process in Congress. The budget resolution is a key document in the Senate that establishes budget priorities and parameters for subsequent budgetary actions. It includes discretionary spending through appropriation bills and changes in direct spending or revenue laws. The reconciliation process may be used for changes directly tied to implementing fiscal policies in the budget resolution. Other budgetary legislation, such as changes in public debt limit or authorizing legislation, are not directly tied to the annual budget cycle. The budget resolution in the Senate establishes budget priorities and parameters for subsequent actions, including discretionary spending and changes in direct spending or revenue laws. Legislation related to public debt limit or authorizing legislation may be necessary but not directly tied to the annual budget cycle. Functional categories in the budget are allocated to committees through a process called \"crosswalking\" and must be adhered to in House and Senate legislation. Points of order can be made during floor consideration to enforce these allocations and aggregate spending levels. The budget resolution includes reconciliation instructions, which require committees to recommend changes in laws affecting revenues or direct spending programs to implement budget priorities. Committees submit recommended legislative language to the Budget Committee, which packages it into an omnibus measure for consideration by the full House or Senate. Reconciliation bills are typically considered under a special rule in the House. In the House, reconciliation bills are considered under a special rule. In the Senate, reconciliation bills are subject to limitations on debate and amendments. The annual appropriations process funds discretionary spending programs through appropriations bills. These bills originate in the House and are developed by subcommittees of the Appropriations Committees. Constraints exist in appropriations bills in terms of purpose and funding levels. Rules in both the House and Senate require authorization before considering funding for an agency or program. Funding for individual items or programs is limited to levels recommended in authorizing legislation. Overall discretionary spending in appropriations acts is restricted by allocations from the budget resolution to the Appropriations Committees. These limits can be enforced through procedural points of order during legislative consideration. The House or Senate may adopt a \"deeming resolution\" in the absence of a final agreement on a budget resolution to establish provisional enforcement levels. Section 302(b) of the Budget Act requires the Appropriations Committees to subdivide allocated amounts among their subcommittees promptly after a budget resolution is agreed to. These suballocations determine spending levels for annual appropriations bills, and exceeding them is subject to a point of order. Appropriations Committees can issue revised subdivisions to reflect changes in spending priorities during appropriations actions. The budget resolution guides overall revenue levels, with specific revenue control language determined by the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. Revenue measures must originate in the House, with the budget resolution setting a minimum revenue level. Revenue legislation can be considered at any time, often included in reconciliation bills, and specifies an appropriate public debt level. The budget resolution sets revenue levels and specifies public debt levels. Changes to the public debt level require statutory enactment. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 established sequesters to enforce budget limits through spending caps and the PAYGO process. Legislation's budgetary impact is scored by OMB three times a year. The President had to make across-the-board cuts in spending programs if statutory limitations were violated under the PAYGO or spending caps mechanism, which expired in 2002. Congress enforced budget limits through points of order even after the expiration. New control mechanisms like the Statutory PAYGO Act of 2010 have been established to limit deficit increases from new legislation. The Budget Control Act of 2011 reestablished discretionary spending caps for FY2012-FY2021 and included sequestration as an enforcement mechanism to limit deficit increases caused by new legislation. It also established a point of order against exceeding discretionary spending caps. By enforcing allocations and aggregates in the budget resolution consistent with the discretionary spending caps, Congress can enforce them through existing points of order."
