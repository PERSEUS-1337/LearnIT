This Act provides a safe harbor for determining that certain individuals are not employees. The Safe Harbor provision under the Independent Contractor Simplification and Relief Act of 1999 states that if specific requirements are met for a service performed by an individual, they will not be considered an employee, the recipient not an employer, and compensation not related to employment. This provision does not limit the application of other laws.

Written contracts between the service provider and recipient must specify the independent contractor status and tax responsibilities. The Safe Harbor provision of the Independent Contractor Simplification and Relief Act of 1999 sets requirements for service providers to be classified as independent contractors.

The Safe Harbor provision of the Independent Contractor Simplification and Relief Act of 1999 outlines requirements for service providers to be classified as independent contractors. If a corporation or LLC fails to file required tax returns, they may not qualify for independent contractor status. Service recipients or payors can rely on written statements from service providers to determine classification. The Safe Harbor provision of the Independent Contractor Simplification and Relief Act of 1999 allows service providers to be classified as independent contractors if they meet certain requirements, including being a properly constituted corporation or LLC, providing necessary information, and making payments to the entity. This provision helps service recipients determine the classification of their service providers. The Safe Harbor provision of the Independent Contractor Simplification and Relief Act of 1999 sets a threshold number for covered workers not treated as employees, ensuring compliance with the law. The term 'covered worker' refers to an individual for whom employment taxes were paid in all 4 quarters of the previous year. If a service provider can show it was reasonable not to treat them as an employee and cooperated with the IRS, the burden of proof shifts to the IRS regarding their treatment. The burden of proof regarding the treatment of a service provider as an employee shifts to the Secretary. If the service provider is operating through an entity owned by them, that entity is included in the references to the service provider. Determinations by the Secretary regarding the treatment of a service provider as an employee are effective from the notice date. The service recipient or payor must have a written contract meeting specific requirements, comply with reporting rules, and show a valid reason for determining that the service provider is not an employee. The Secretary makes determinations about the service provider's status. The Secretary determines if a service provider should be treated as an employee based on specific criteria, including having a valid contract, meeting reporting requirements, and demonstrating a reasonable basis for not being classified as an employee. The Secretary determines if a service provider should be treated as an employee based on specific criteria, including meeting reporting requirements due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. This subsection does not limit any provision of law that allows for administrative or judicial review of the Secretary's determination. The notice date is defined as the 30th day after receiving the first letter of proposed deficiency. The term 'service provider' refers to an individual who performs a service for another person, while 'service recipient' is the person for whom the service provider performs the service. The term 'payor' is the person who pays the service provider if the service recipient does not pay. The term 'service recipient' does not include any entity where the service provider owns over 5% of voting power or profits. 'In connection with performing the service' means related to the service provider's business. 'Principal place of business' has the same meaning as under section 280A(c)(1). The term 'fair market rent' refers to a fixed rental fee based on the value of facilities, established through a contract similar to those offered to unrelated parties. Section 530(d) of the Revenue Act of 1978 is repealed, and a clerical amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments made by this section, including safe harbor provisions for determining non-employee status, apply to services performed after the enactment of the Act. Determinations by the Secretary under Section 3511(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 apply after the enactment of the Act. The amendment in subsection (b) applies to periods ending after the enactment of the Act."
