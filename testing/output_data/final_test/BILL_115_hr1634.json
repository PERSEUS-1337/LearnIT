According to Congress findings, US healthcare spending reached $2.9 trillion in 2013, with a significant portion attributed to chronic diseases. Chronic diseases are a major cause of death in the US, with heart disease being the leading cause in 2013. In 2013, heart disease was the leading cause of death for American adults, with approximately 600,000 deaths each year. Coronary heart disease costs American taxpayers $108.9 billion annually. Research shows that a healthy diet can reduce cardiovascular disease symptoms and reverse artery damage. The US faces obesity issues, with two-thirds of adults overweight and half of them obese. The country spends $147 to $210 billion yearly on obesity-related diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. An estimated 29.1 million Americans have diabetes, with 86 million adults having prediabetes. The total costs of diagnosed diabetes have increased to $245 billion in 2012.

Physicians in 2008 felt inadequately trained to provide nutrition advice, with only 14 percent feeling adequately trained. A 1985 report recommended 25 hours of nutrition education in medical schools, but by 2010, only 38 percent of schools met this standard. In 2010, the percentage of medical schools requiring a dedicated nutrition course decreased from 30% to 25%. Over half of graduating medical students felt their nutrition education was insufficient. Healthy People 2020 aims to increase physician office visits including nutrition counseling, but in 2010, only 13.8% of visits included such counseling.

American Indian or Alaska Native adults have the highest rate of diabetes among all minority groups at 15.9 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Department of Health and Human Services guidelines and federal agencies' annual reports focus on primary care federal health professionals completing continuing medical education on nutrition. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will issue guidelines for federal agencies to ensure full-time primary care health professionals receive nutrition-related continuing education. Federal agencies must submit biannual reports to Congress on the adoption of these guidelines. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will issue guidelines for federal agencies to ensure primary care professionals receive nutrition-related continuing education. Agencies must report the percentage of professionals completing nutrition courses on obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer prevention.
