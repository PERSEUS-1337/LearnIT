An LSTM model is built to predict freezing behavior in patients. Results show that the model trained with patient-specific data comes close to hand-labeled data performance, and the weakly supervised model matches hand-labeled data performance without prior observations of subjects. This demonstrates the potential of weak supervision in reducing the need for manual labeling of time series training data. Supervised machine learning with sensor time series data can automate monitoring tasks in healthcare, but obtaining labeled training data is challenging. Hand labeling events in controlled settings is traditionally done by medical professionals, especially in human movement research with inter-subject variability. In this work, weakly supervised BID10 models are explored for time series classification, aiming to efficiently label large amounts of data needed for training machine learning models. Instead of manual labeling, domain insights are encoded into heuristic labeling functions to create probabilistically labeled training sets. This method is particularly useful for time series tasks like classifying freezing behaviors in people with Parkinson's disease. By encoding biomechanical knowledge about human movement and Parkinson's disease into a weakly supervised model, the need for large amounts of hand-labeled data can be reduced. This approach aims to achieve similar performance to fully supervised models for classifying freezing behavior in patients with Parkinson's disease. The model focuses on two clinical use cases: when there are no prior observations of the patient and when there is at least one observation. Noisy training labels are generated programmatically for unlabeled data using heuristic labeling functions, denoising the labels by learning their correlation structure and accuracies. The text discusses a generative model that uses labeling functions to create a label matrix for training data. The model incorporates factors like labeling propensity, accuracy, and pairwise correlation to generate probabilistic training labels. These labels are then used to train a discriminative model to generalize beyond the information provided by the labeling functions. In a dataset with measurements from 36 trials of 9 Parkinson's Disease patients exhibiting freezing behavior, leg angular velocity was measured during a walking task using wearable devices. Freezing of gait is a common issue in PD, leading to falls. The study focused on using wearable inertial measurement units positioned on the feet, shanks, lumbar, and chest trunk regions to extract ankle gyroscope data during Turning and Barrier Course runs. The data was segmented by gait cycle of the right leg, defined as the time period between two successive peaks on an angular velocity plot. The ankle gyroscope data was segmented by gait cycle of the right leg, defined as the time period between two successive peaks on an angular velocity plot. A single candidate is defined as x a\u00d7b \u2208 X where a is the number of sensor streams and b is the sequence length. Five labeling functions were used to distinguish freezing and non-freezing events based on domain specific knowledge and empirical observations. Positive, negative, or abstain labels were assigned based on threshold values from the validation set. The ankle gyroscope data was segmented by gait cycle of the right leg. Five labeling functions were used to distinguish freezing and non-freezing events. A generative label model was built using these functions to predict probabilistic labels for each candidate in the training set. A discriminative model was then trained on the probabilistic labels incorporating the labeling functions. The end model used a single layer bi-directional LSTM with a hidden state dimension of 300, taking in a multivariate sensor stream as input. Time series data from only the left and right ankle was used. The input for the model is two-dimensional sensor data from the left and right ankle. A windowed version of each candidate is passed in, including the last three gait cycles and the next gait cycle. Sequences are padded and truncated to a maximum length. Multiplicative attention is added to pool over hidden states in the LSTM. The weakly supervised model is evaluated in clinical settings and compared with a fully supervised model. Data is split into training/validation/testing sets based on trials/sessions. In the clinical evaluation, the weakly supervised model performs closely to the fully supervised model in both session and patient splits. The end-to-end system shows better performance when exposed to at least one session of a patient. However, the system struggles to generalize to certain patients in the patient splits setting, as seen in TAB2. The weakly supervised model shows promising results in freezing events detection for patients P1, P7, and P8. The study emphasizes the importance of having a large dataset without the need for hand labeling. Weakly supervised models perform comparably to fully supervised models, indicating that hand labeling may not be necessary for classifier performance. Future plans include incorporating more sensor streams and modalities to improve performance. In the future, more sensor streams and modalities like video will be added to improve the generative model and overall performance by utilizing labeling functions to capture temporal correlations."
