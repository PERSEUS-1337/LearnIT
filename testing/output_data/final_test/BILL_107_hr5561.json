The Wyandotte Nation has a valid interest in lands in the Fairfax Business District in Wyandotte County, Kansas, within their reservation established in 1843. They filed a lawsuit to determine ownership of lands once held in trust by the United States. The Lawsuit filed by the Wyandotte Nation contends that certain major roads in Kansas City encroach upon the Huron Cemetery, reserved for the Nation in the Treaty of January 31, 1855. This has caused economic hardships for residents of the Fairfax Business District in Wyandotte County, Kansas, by clouding title to much of the land. Congress aims to remove these title clouds without additional cost to any party involved. The Wyandotte Nation, Unified Government of Kansas City, and landowners in the Fairfax Business District of Wyandotte County, Kansas have settled a Lawsuit, requiring Congress to pass implementing legislation. The Act aims to settle the Lawsuit, direct the Secretary to take Settlement Lands into trust for the Wyandotte Nation, and resolve land claims.
