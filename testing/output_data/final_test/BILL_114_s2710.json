    "content": "The Act titled \"Women and Minorities in STEM Booster Act of 2016\" establishes a grant program to increase the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields. According to findings, STEM education is crucial for the US economy. Women are underrepresented in STEM fields, comprising only 26% of workers. They are also more likely to switch out of STEM majors and quit their jobs in STEM fields after about 10 years. According to recent projections, minorities will make up 57% of the US population by 2060. The US needs to increase the number of underrepresented minorities in engineering to remain competitive in technological innovation. While freshmen from underrepresented minority groups show interest in STEM degrees at similar rates as other freshmen, completion rates within 5 years are lower for Latino, African-American, and Native American students compared to White and Asian students. Data on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders reveal underrepresentation in STEM fields for subgroups like Cambodian, Laotian, Hmong, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. According to 3-year estimates from the 2013 American Community Survey, Southeast Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have higher poverty rates and lower educational attainment rates compared to the overall population. For example, 21 percent of Pacific Islanders, 21 percent of Cambodian, 26 percent of Hmong, 17 percent of Laotian, and 16 percent of Vietnamese community members live in poverty. Additionally, these communities have lower rates of individuals with a bachelor's degree or higher compared to the overall population. The Cambodian, Hmong, Lao, and Vietnamese communities have low rates of bachelor's degree or higher education, correlating with their underrepresentation in STEM employment. A 2014 study found that women and minorities leave STEM fields at higher rates, highlighting the need for resources to retain them. The National Science Foundation is authorized to award grants to support this goal. The National Science Foundation awards grants to eligible entities to increase women and minorities' participation in STEM fields through activities like online workshops. Eligible entities must submit applications to receive grants for these initiatives. The National Science Foundation offers grants for various programs to enhance diversity in STEM fields, including online workshops, mentoring programs, internships, outreach programs for students, recruitment of underrepresented faculty, and other initiatives determined by the Director of the NSF. The National Science Foundation offers grants to enhance diversity in STEM fields, including programs for underrepresented minority groups in science and engineering. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2017-2021."
