    "content": "Congress is concerned about widespread U.S. unemployment, with a jobless rate of 9.5% in June 2010. Workers in the residential contracting industry are facing high unemployment rates. Policy makers are focused on global energy price volatility and the impacts of climate change. Efforts are being made to improve energy efficiency in buildings to reduce energy costs and CO2 emissions. The Home Star Energy Retrofit program aims to promote energy efficiency. The Home Star Energy Retrofit program aims to promote residential energy efficiency and increase employment in related industries. Two similar Home Star programs are detailed in proposed legislation in the House and Senate. The House version, H.R. 5019, was introduced on April 14, 2010, and passed with amendments on May 7, 2010. The Senate proposal, S. 3434, was introduced on May 27, 2010. The Home Star Energy Retrofit program, introduced in both House and Senate bills, aims to promote residential energy efficiency. The House version, H.R. 5019, authorizes $6 billion in funding, while the Senate version, S. 3663, authorizes $5 billion. The program would be administered by the Department of Energy. This report focuses on operational and market aspects of the program, with limited discussion on job creation and economic stimulus potential. Home Star program in House and Senate bills has some differences. It includes a two-tiered structure for energy-efficiency rebates, with the Silver Star program offering up to $3,000 per home for various upgrades. Contractors receive fixed rebates for installing qualified measures under Silver Star. The Senate version also includes rebates for water-saving products certified under the EPA's WaterSense program. The Silver Star program offers fixed rebates for qualified measures, with quality assurance inspections for 10% to 20% of participating homes. The Gold Star program provides $3,000 to $8,000 rebates for energy retrofits achieving 20% to 45% savings, and up to $1,200 for water efficiency retrofits. Contractors use specialized software to propose retrofit measures based on a home's energy/water use. The Home Star program aims to model a home's energy/water use and propose retrofit measures for improvement. It targets the residential sector for efficiency improvements and employment opportunities. Rebates under Gold Star require testing to verify savings, with quality assurance inspections for a portion of participating homes. The Home Star program aims to improve energy efficiency in residential homes by providing rebates for energy retrofits. The program requires the DOE to implement a federal rebate processing system and develop a network of intermediaries to administer the program. Several operational aspects of the program may be new to a federal program and warrant further attention from Congress. The DOE expects \"a couple of hundred\" organizations to serve as aggregators for energy retrofits under the Home Star program, including home improvement retail stores, existing energy-efficiency programs, state agencies, and trade groups. Rebate aggregator applicants must demonstrate the ability to administer the rebate process and have financial systems to track transactions. Stakeholders have raised questions about the DOE's ability to manage rebate operations with multiple aggregators efficiently. Some contractor groups are concerned about potential inequities in rebate distribution among contractors or homeowners due to advantages held by certain rebate aggregators. Suggestions have been made for the DOE to serve as the national rebate aggregator to ensure equitable access to rebate services. Alternatively, S. 3663 proposes giving priority to rebate aggregators serving all qualified contractors within specific regions. Some stakeholders anticipate specialized rebate processing firms may be contracted by aggregators for Home Star transaction processing, offering advantages like quick execution and economies of scale. However, concerns arise about the complexity, speed, and cost of establishing and maintaining the administrative \"back office\" of the Home Star program. Some stakeholders are concerned about the time constraints for implementing and testing new software and systems required for the Home Star program, fearing potential errors or confusion in rebate processing functions that could hinder market effectiveness. Some stakeholders have expressed concerns that the Silver Star rebates in the Home Star program may unintentionally discourage energy-efficiency investments due to \"cream skimming,\" where contractors may prefer simpler, less risky opportunities over more complex measures like Gold Star rebates. The added complexity and administrative requirements of Gold Star rebates could be burdensome for contractors who believe they have enough Silver Star opportunities. Many contractors could start work under the Silver Star program immediately, appealing to financially constrained homeowners due to requiring less investment and risk. Participation in Silver Star may be concentrated in specialized trades, potentially limiting the types of measures offered. General contractors could offer all Silver Star measures through subcontractors, but profit opportunities may be limited. Homeowners in some markets may face dealing with multiple specialty contractors to take advantage of Silver Star retrofit opportunities, leading to inefficient and inconvenient outcomes. This could result in limited participation in certain Silver Star measures and the Gold Star program, with benefits concentrated among a few contractor groups and manufacturers. Lower-than-anticipated participation in Silver Star measures and the Gold Star program could lead to locked-in energy inefficiency in homes. This behavior may not impact overall job numbers but could affect expenditure distribution, energy savings, and long-term efficiency. Stakeholders are concerned about how technical standards in the Home Star program may influence its implementation speed and breadth. The Home Star program's technical standards can impact implementation speed and breadth. These standards determine contractor eligibility and the quality of home energy information provided. The program requires contractors to use approved simulation software for accurate evaluation. Home Star program aims to facilitate contractor participation by adopting widely used home simulation software. However, using multiple software programs may complicate quality control efforts due to differences in format and content. The inclusion of water-efficiency measures adds complexity to the program. Contractors meeting training certification standards face fewer quality inspections. The Home Star program authorizes workforce certification standards from various organizations like BPI, NATE, LIUNA, and HBI. Additional training standards may be approved by the Secretary of Energy, Secretary of Labor, and EPA Administrator. However, the approval process for new standards is limited, leading to potential delays in contractor retraining or certification. The Home Star program authorizes workforce certification standards from organizations like BPI, NATE, LIUNA, and HBI. Delays in contractor retraining or certification may put them at a competitive disadvantage. Contractor certification can be a bottleneck for program implementation, leading to higher job inspection rates if training requirements are time-consuming or costly. This could undermine the purpose of employee training standards. Some stakeholders are concerned about the uneven distribution of rebates under the Home Star program. Rebates are available nationwide on a first-come, first-served basis, which could result in certain states or sectors capturing the majority of funding if they are quicker to apply. Suggestions have been made to allocate funds by state to ensure a more equitable distribution. Some stakeholders suggest using a reservation system for rebates to prevent rapid oversubscription and concentration of rebates among a limited number of measures. This approach could address concerns about uneven distribution of rebates among states. S. 3663 proposes reviewing rebate distribution among states for the Home Star program, offering technical assistance funding to states that have not benefited enough. Unclear what \"technical assistance\" and \"sufficient benefit\" entail, and whether remedies can be implemented quickly. Concerns about concentration of rebate benefits among certain states or sectors may arise. If homeowner interest is low, rebate funding availability may not hinder participation but could impact program effectiveness. The Home Star program proposes DIY rebates for insulation and air sealing products, up to $250 per home, to increase consumer demand. Some policymakers are concerned about the quality of DIY installations and the impact on contractor employment opportunities. The Home Star program proposes DIY rebates for insulation and air sealing products, up to $250 per home, to increase consumer demand. Policymakers are concerned about the quality of DIY installations and prefer funding measures installed by professionals with quality control. The Home Star proposal authorizes appropriations of $6 billion through FY2011 in H.R. 5019 and $5 billion through FY2012 in S. 3663. If $6 billion in funds were expended through 2012, total participation in Home Star could reach nearly 2 million homes in the first two years. The Home Star program aims for total participation of nearly 2 million homes in the first two years, representing 1.6% of all U.S. residential housing units in 2008. Participation rates could potentially reach 5 million. Comparisons with the Weatherization Assistance Program show the ambitious nature of these goals. The DOE's Inspector General reported that only 30,297 out of 586,015 planned weatherization projects were completed by February 16, 2010. By May 2010, 25,231 homes were weatherized with ARRA funding, totaling 134,167 homes. New York's Home Performance with ENERGY STAR Program served nearly 30,000 homes in nine years, representing 0.75% of eligible homes. If this rate is achieved nationwide, approximately 728,000 homes could participate in similar programs. Comparisons with the ambitious goals of the Home Star program highlight the challenges in reaching high participation rates. Comparing the WAP and Home Performance programs in New York shows differences in structure, funding, target markets, and operational time periods. The ARRA-funded weatherization under WAP faced challenges like Davis-Bacon wage requirements and Buy American requirements, not expected in the Home Star program. Economic conditions may affect participation in Home Star. Despite differences, comparisons suggest higher homeowner participation in Home Star due to rebate funding provisions. The Home Star program aims to surpass the success of similar programs like WAP and Home Performance with ENERGY STAR. It may benefit from existing infrastructure but alternative options for administration and funding may be considered. The program's goal is to create a sustainable energy-efficiency contracting industry in the residential sector. The Home Star program aims to create a sustainable energy-efficiency contracting industry in the residential sector. However, there is little evidence that contractors will continue to pursue home energy retrofit services after the rebates are expended. Some believe contractors will return to traditional homebuilding work once home sales improve, and there is little market evidence of a self-sustaining home weatherization industry without federal or state incentives. The proposed Home Star program aims to improve residential energy-efficiency and increase employment, but its operational elements are untested and may be challenging to implement on a national scale. Achieving high homeowner participation may be unprecedented, making program implementation across states uncertain and presenting potential obstacles. The Home Star program aims to improve residential energy-efficiency and increase employment, but its operational elements may pose challenges to national implementation. Congress should consider tradeoffs between rapid implementation, operational complexity, and energy-efficiency impacts, as well as balancing short-term job creation with long-term investment in cost-effective energy savings."
