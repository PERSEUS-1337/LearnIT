    "content": "Kosovo declared independence in 2008, leading to a new reality in the Balkans with uncertainties. The US, France, and UK recognized Kosovo, joined by over forty countries. Support includes international missions and financial aid. Serbia and Russia oppose Kosovo's secession, with warnings of consequences. Kosovo Serbs and Serbia reject Kosovo's independence, insisting \"Kosovo is Serbia.\" Serbia and Kosovo Serbs reject Kosovo's independence, insisting \"Kosovo is Serbia.\" Post-independence tensions are highest in northern Kosovo, where ethnic Serbs reside. Serbian protesters clash with U.N. and NATO forces, with a deadly clash in Mitrovica. Despite no major violence recurrence, the situation remains tense. Serbia organized illegal national and municipal elections in Serb-majority areas of Kosovo. The municipal vote in Kosovo was deemed illegal by U.N. officials. Kosovo declared independence after failed negotiations. The Ahtisaari plan outlines terms for supervised independence with rights for minority communities. The EU and NATO support Kosovo's independence, but not all EU member states do. The EU's 27 member states support Kosovo's independence, with a majority expected to recognize the new state. UNSC Resolution 1244 remains in force, with EU-led missions launched. U.N. Secretary-General calls for a \"reconfigured\" U.N. presence, with the EU taking on enhanced responsibilities. U.S. and European officials seek friendly relations with Serbia, urging restraint in Belgrade's actions towards Kosovo. The new situation strains relations with Serbia, especially after February riots in Belgrade. In the aftermath of February riots in Belgrade, violent demonstrators set fire to the U.S. embassy and other European embassies nearby. The European Union is advancing Serbia's track toward EU accession to support pro-European political forces. In 1998 and 1999, the United States and NATO allies intervened in Kosovo to stop escalating violence between ethnic Albanian guerrillas and Yugoslav forces. This led to a 78-day NATO bombing campaign against Serbia, eventually resulting in Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic withdrawing his forces from the province in June 1999. In 1999, NATO intervened in Kosovo to stop violence, leading to Milosevic's withdrawal. U.S. policymakers faced challenges in rebuilding Kosovo and resolving its final status for stability in the Balkans. President Bush emphasized the need to achieve a political settlement for Kosovo to fulfill long-standing U.S. goals for a peaceful Europe. Since 2007, U.S. officials have supported Kosovo's independence to achieve stability in the Balkans and Europe. The U.S. believes its involvement is crucial for preventing organized crime and terrorism, as well as promoting Euro-Atlantic integration. Many observers stress that Europe has a greater stake in the region than the United States. Europe has a larger stake in stability in southeastern Europe, and European nations should lead international efforts in Kosovo. Critics question the impact of U.S. engagement in Kosovo on vital U.S. interests, such as the war on terrorism and national security challenges. There is a strong interest in \"finishing the job\" in Kosovo, with discussions on an eventual \"exit strategy\" for international administration. However, a residual international civilian and military role, including ongoing NATO and U.S. presence, is expected to continue. The war in Kosovo had deep historical roots, with the immediate cause being the decision of the Milosevic regime in Serbia to eliminate the autonomy of its Kosovo province in 1989. Ethnic Albanian guerrillas formed the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in 1998, leading to conflict with Serbian forces and widespread human rights abuses. The U.S. is likely to maintain a presence in Kosovo post-independence to assist with the transition. The United States and Western countries used sanctions to persuade Milosevic to restore autonomy to Kosovo, but without success. The Contact Group agreed on a draft peace plan for Kosovo on January 29, 1999, inviting both sides to peace talks in Rambouillet. NATO authorized air strikes against Serbia if the peace plan was rejected. The draft peace plan for Kosovo proposed greater autonomy within Yugoslavia and the deployment of a NATO-led international military force. Despite the ethnic Albanian delegation signing the plan, the Yugoslav delegation rejected it, leading to NATO air strikes on March 24, 1999. Yugoslav forces expelled most of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, resulting in over 1.5 million refugees and displaced persons. Reports indicated that about 10,000 ethnic Albanians were killed, and others were abused, tortured, and raped during the conflict. After 78 days of intense air strikes, President Milosevic agreed to a peace plan on June 3, 1999, based on NATO demands and a proposal from the Group of Eight countries. The plan called for the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo, deployment of an international peacekeeping force with NATO at its core, and international administration of Kosovo until elected interim institutions are set up. On June 9, a Military Technical Agreement was concluded for the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces, and on June 10, the U.N. Security Council approved UNSC Resolution 1244 based on the peace plan. After the approval of UNSC Resolution 1244, KFOR entered Kosovo on June 11 and the Yugoslav pullout was completed by June 20. The KLA and NATO signed a document on demilitarization. Most ethnic Albanian refugees returned home, while over 200,000 ethnic Serbs and minorities left Kosovo. Around 100,000 Serbs remain, with many in the northern part near Mitrovica. Violence and intimidation were key reasons for the departures. Since the pullout of Yugoslav forces in June 1999, Kosovo has been primarily administered by the UN Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). Kosovo Serbs report over 1,100 killed and 1,000 missing, with hundreds of houses looted and burned. UNMIK was tasked with transferring administrative responsibilities to interim autonomous government institutions while retaining oversight. After the pullout of Yugoslav forces in June 1999, Kosovo has been administered by UNMIK, overseeing the transfer of authority to interim autonomous institutions. Kosovo lacked governing experience post-autonomy loss under Milosevic. The Democratic League of Kosova (LDK) led by Ibrahim Rugova was dominant, but new parties emerged post-war, including the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) led by Hashim Thaci and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) led by Ramush Haradinaj. The LDK initially lost ground but regained support among Kosovo Albanians. The first postwar municipal elections in Kosovo in October 2000 saw the LDK win with 58% of the vote. The PDK and AAK also gained significant support. UNMIK issued a Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self-Government in Kosovo in May 2001, establishing a 120-seat legislature with reserved seats for ethnic minorities, including Serbs. UNMIK retained control over various policy areas. The first postwar vote for Kosovo-wide institutions was held in November 2001. The moderate LDK won 47 seats in the new legislature, the PDK won 26 seats, and the AAK won 8 seats. Kosovo Serbs turned out in substantial numbers to vote in the elections, with a coalition of Serbian parties winning 22 seats. Turnout in Serb-majority areas was about 47%, while turnout in Serbia and Montenegro was about 57%. After political wrangling, Kosovo's Assembly elected Ibrahim Rugova as President and Bajram Rexhepi as Prime Minister in March 2002. The government included members from LDK, PDK, and AAK, with positions reserved for Kosovo Serb and non-Serb minority representatives. Kosovo Serbs initially refused to join but agreed in May 2002 after UNMIK appointed a Kosovo Serb advisor on refugee returns. Second local elections in October 2002 had a 54% turnout, lower due to disillusionment with the government's performance. The low turnout in Kosovo's recent elections was attributed to disillusionment with the government and political parties. The LDK remained the leading party but lost ground, winning 45% of the vote. Serb turnout was particularly low, with almost no votes in Mitrovica. Serb dissatisfaction was evident, with hard-line parties performing well. Accusations in March 2004 led to violent demonstrations and attacks on Serb enclaves. The violent demonstrations and attacks on ethnic Serb enclaves in Kosovo in March 2004 resulted in 19 civilian deaths, over 900 injuries, and the displacement of 4,000 people. The attacks were the worst since the 1999 Kosovo war, with 30 churches, 800 houses, and 150 vehicles destroyed or damaged. The violence was partly spontaneous and partly orchestrated. The violent attacks in Kosovo in March 2004 were partly spontaneous and partly orchestrated by extremist forces, leading to 19 deaths, 900 injuries, and displacement of 4,000 people. The U.N. estimated tens of thousands participated in violent incidents. New parliamentary elections in October 2004 saw the LDK winning 45.4% of the vote, PDK winning 28.9%, and AAK winning 8.4%. Turnout was 53.57%, with few Kosovo Serbs voting due to a boycott call by Serbian Prime Minister. In March 2004, violent attacks in Kosovo resulted in 19 deaths, 900 injuries, and displacement of 4,000 people. The LDK won 45.4% of the vote in the October 2004 parliamentary elections, with the PDK winning 28.9% and AAK winning 8.4%. A coalition government led by AAK leader Ramush Haradinaj was formed, but he resigned in March 2005 due to concerns of being indicted for war crimes. Haradinaj and his associates were indicted for crimes against humanity and war crimes allegedly committed during the 1998-1999 conflict with Serbian forces. He was succeeded as Prime Minister by Bajram Kosumi. In June 2005, Haradinaj was provisionally released by the Tribunal in return for his pledge to return to The Hague for his trial. In April 2008, ICTY acquitted and released Haradinaj after a year-long trial. His return to Kosovo may bolster his party's standing, especially if early elections are held. In Kosovo, U.N. envoy Kai Eide conducted a review to determine Kosovo's future status. Progress was noted in governing institutions and economic structures, but the economic situation remained bleak. Inter-ethnic harmony and the return of displaced minorities were challenging. Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova passed away in January 2006, and Fatmir Sejdiu was elected as President. Later, Sejdiu won the internal party vote for President of the LDK party. In March 2006, Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi resigned and was replaced by Agim Ceku. The new government aimed to meet international standards for Kosovo. A Unity Team, led by President Sejdiu, was formed to present a united front in U.N.-led negotiations. The team did not include minority representation from Kosovo Serbs. Divisions within the leading LDK party persisted after the death of Rugova. In December 2006, President Sejdiu won a contentious internal party vote to become LDK chairman amidst divisions within the party. Concerns were raised about potential instability and local frustration if Kosovo's status process was further delayed. Demonstrations were held against the Ahtisaari plan for Kosovo's status, with some groups opposing further talks with Serbia. There were also concerns about the re-emergence of armed groups. In November 2007, Kosovo held general and local elections with over 40 political parties participating. The opposition PDK won the most votes (34%), followed by the LDK (22%). A coalition agreement was reached between the PDK and LDK, with Hashim Thaci becoming Prime Minister and Fatmir Sejdiu remaining President. The AAK is now in opposition. The AAK is now in opposition, along with the Democratic League of Dardania and the New Kosovo Alliance. Kosovo Serb voters largely boycotted the November vote. Governance in Serb municipalities will be coordinated with international authorities. Thaci's leadership opted for close coordination with the international community regarding Kosovo's independence. The Thaci government faces challenges in meeting voter expectations on economic issues such as unemployment, poverty, infrastructure, and energy shortages. The Kosovo Assembly adopted a new constitution in early April, to take effect by mid-June, in coordination with international officials. Engaging Kosovo Serb communities in governance is a key challenge, as per U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244. Resolution 1244 authorized an international security presence in Kosovo led by NATO to ensure the withdrawal of Yugoslav armed forces, demilitarization of the KLA, and maintenance of the cease-fire. It gave UNMIK the chief role in administering Kosovo, including civil administration, law and order, humanitarian aid, refugee return, human rights protection, reconstruction, elections preparation, and autonomy during an interim period. Resolution 1244 authorized an international security presence in Kosovo led by NATO to ensure the withdrawal of Yugoslav armed forces and demilitarization of the KLA. UNMIK was given the chief role in administering Kosovo, including civil administration, law and order, humanitarian aid, and autonomy during an interim period. Bernard Kouchner, Hans Haekkerup, Michael Steiner, and Harri Holkeri served as Special Representatives of the U.N. Secretary-General in Kosovo from 1999 to 2004. The credibility of UNMIK was damaged by the 2004 riots. Soren Jessen-Petersen became the new SRSG in August, outlining mission priorities. Jessen-Petersen left in 2006, replaced by Joachim R\u00fccker. Lamberto Zannier will head UNMIK in 2008. UNMIK had a four-pillar structure, phasing out humanitarian aid in 2000 and adding a police and justice pillar in 2001. The United Nations led the police and justice pillar, while the Organization for Security and Cooperation led the institution-building pillar, and the European Union led the reconstruction pillar in Kosovo. In 2002, UNMIK chief Steiner proposed an \"exit strategy\" based on a \"standards before status\" approach, outlining benchmarks for Kosovo's institutions and society before addressing its final status. The international community endorsed the \"standards before status\" approach in Kosovo, with UNMIK transferring administrative competencies to self-governing institutions. The Contact Group initiative in late 2003 aimed to operationalize the standards and review their implementation by mid-2005 for future status consideration. Joint working groups were established between UNMIK and the Kosovo provisional government, but the Kosovo Serb community did not participate. On March 31, 2004, UNMIK chief Holkeri unveiled the Kosovo Standards Implementation Plan (KSIP), a roadmap for implementing the Kosovo Standards. The U.N. Security Council strongly condemned the inter-ethnic violence in Kosovo and called for urgent steps on sustainable returns and freedom of movement. Some officials called for changes to the U.N. mission's mandate to improve security conditions in Kosovo. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International criticized the performance of U.N. agencies and NATO operations in Kosovo. Former U.N. Secretary-General Annan commissioned a U.N. team headed by Kai Eide to review the U.N. Mission in Kosovo. The Eide report called for policy and institutional changes to provide clarity and focus, suggesting that final status negotiations should take place by mid-2005 with the participation of Kosovo government and Belgrade. Eide recommended transferring more powers to the Kosovo government and terminating the U.N. mission after final status negotiations begin, proposing the European Union take over as the lead international agency in Kosovo. The Secretary-General endorsed some of Eide's recommendations. In 2006, UNMIK worked with the PISG to implement 13 priority standards, mainly focused on minority rights. Progress was reported in meeting these standards, strengthening Kosovo's institutions. The UN mission in Kosovo was expected to end after the status process with a new UN Security Council resolution. Kosovar Albanians showed little interest in extending UNMIK's tenure, often protesting against it. U.N. envoy Eide noted the U.N.'s limited influence in Kosovo in his 2005 review. In 2005, U.N. envoy Eide highlighted UNMIK's declining leverage in Kosovo due to scandals and corruption. UNMIK's reputation suffered further after deadly force was used on Kosovar demonstrators in 2007. The Ahtisaari plan aimed to transfer authority from UNMIK to the Kosovo government within 120 days. The U.N. resolution 1244 clarifies Kosovo's status and puts UNMIK's close-out process on hold. KFOR's mission is to monitor and enforce agreements, establish a secure environment, and support UNMIK's activities in Kosovo. KFOR oversees the return of Yugoslav troops to Kosovo for specific tasks, such as liaising with the international presence, marking minefields, and providing a presence at key locations. NATO approved the phased return of Serbia and Montenegro forces to the buffer zone in 2001, but a full return to Kosovo was deemed destabilizing. In response to ethnic Albanian attacks in 2004, NATO deployed an additional 3,000 reserve forces. The performance of KFOR units varied during the violence, leading to a \"lessons learned\" study by NATO. In the aftermath of the March incidents, NATO conducted a \"lessons learned\" study to evaluate KFOR's performance and identify areas for improvement. Recommendations included removing national restrictions on COMKFOR's deployment abilities, enhancing training and equipment, improving intelligence capabilities, and maximizing force presence in patrols. KFOR also established a Security Advisory Group with UNMIK and local Kosovar representatives for better communication and coordination on security matters. NATO periodically reviews KFOR's mission, considering adjustments to force structure, levels, and eventual withdrawal from Kosovo. NATO agreed to \"regionalize and rationalize\" KFOR's force structure, reducing strength to about 17,500. However, NATO members have maintained KFOR strength at 16,000-17,000, with the U.S. contributing about 1,600 troops. General Jones proposed streamlining KFOR into a task force structure for greater efficiency and flexibility. KFOR has been preparing for security challenges in relation to Kosovo's anticipated changed status. They have reinforced their presence in northern Kosovo to boost security in the volatile sector. In December 2007, NATO members reaffirmed their commitment to deter any renewal of violence in Kosovo. Following Kosovo's declaration of independence in February 2008, NATO reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining a safe environment in Kosovo. U.N. Resolution 1244 upheld the sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and did not dictate a permanent solution for Kosovo's status, leaving it to be determined through a political process. Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have long sought independence from Serbia, despite initial opposition from the United States and other Western countries. Concerns were raised about potential destabilization in the region due to separatist movements among ethnic Albanians in neighboring countries. The international policy on Kosovo focused on \"standards before status,\" causing initial irritation among Kosovar Albanians. However, they later supported the standards process as it became linked to achieving status. In 2003, a formal review was announced for Kosovo's progress towards status. The international Contact Group conducted a review in mid-2005 to assess Kosovo's progress towards meeting standards for determining its status. UNMIK released a detailed \"Standards Implementation Plan\" in March 2004. The violent events of March 2004 raised concerns about peaceful coexistence between ethnic Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo. The Serbian government proposed decentralization and self-governing autonomy for the Serb minority. A U.N. assessment team recommended a priority-based standards policy to facilitate status discussions and European integration. In mid-2005, the international Contact Group reviewed Kosovo's progress towards meeting standards for determining its status. U.N. Secretary-General Annan and UNMIK chiefs defended the standards policy, emphasizing security and minority rights. A \"roadmap\" towards Kosovo's future status was established in 2005, leading to a comprehensive review of standards by Norwegian diplomat Kai Eide. The U.N. Security Council reviewed a quarterly report on UNMIK in May 2005, sanctioning the launch of the review for the summer. Ambassador Eide submitted a review to Annan, who endorsed launching a political process to determine Kosovo's status. Ahtisaari was appointed as U.N. Special Envoy to lead the process, with visits to Kosovo and Serbia. The contact group agreed on principles for the status process, emphasizing no return to pre-1999 situation, no partition, and no union with another country. The Contact Group emphasized principles for Kosovo's status process, including no partition or union with another country. Status talks began in 2006, focusing on technical issues and preparing for future status determination. Ahtisaari refrained from specific proposals, allowing for negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo. The Serbian and Kosovar delegations discussed decentralization of Kosovo's government in Vienna, with little progress towards compromise. Serbs proposed creating Serb-majority municipalities and dividing the city of Mitrovica. The Serbian and Kosovar delegations discussed decentralization of Kosovo's government in Vienna, with little progress towards compromise. Serbs proposed creating Serb-majority municipalities and dividing the city of Mitrovica. Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Agim Ceku met with Serbian counterparts Boris Tadic and Vojislav Kostunica to discuss the status issue, but little progress was made as both sides reiterated their long-stated views on status. U.N. Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari was expected to present his proposal for Kosovo's status to the contact group and the U.N. U.N. Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari was expected to present his proposal for Kosovo's status to the contact group and the U.N. Security Council in late 2006. Despite leading negotiations with Kosovar Albanian and Serbian parties, no major progress was made. Ahtisaari postponed releasing his proposal to avoid influencing early elections in Serbia, presenting it after the inconclusive January 21 vote. Ahtisaari presented a Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement to the contact group, Serbian, and Kosovar Albanian parties. The proposal was swiftly endorsed by the United States, European Union, NATO, and other organizations. Despite Russia's call for more time to consider it, further consultations were held in Vienna. A final meeting in March did not lead to mutual agreement on Kosovo's status. Ahtisaari's proposal aims to establish a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo with guaranteed rights and interests for all communities, based on the rule of law. The Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement aims to establish a multi-ethnic, democratic Kosovo with broad governing authority and minority protections. It includes provisions for new elections, special privileges for minority communities, decentralization, and international supervision. Serb municipalities would have extended responsibilities and authority, with the city of Mitrovica becoming two municipalities under a joint board. The settlement proposal for the city of Mitrovica includes protection of religious and cultural heritage sites, self-rule provisions for Kosovo, and a revamped security sector with local ownership. The terms of the Ahtisaari plan aim to find a compromise between the maximum positions of each side, allowing Kosovo to enter into international agreements and create symbols of statehood. Ahtisaari recommended independence in his report to the Security Council. Ahtisaari recommended independence for Kosovo in his report to the Security Council on March 26, with constraints such as international supervision and power-sharing arrangements with minority communities. The Security Council began private consultations on the proposal on April 3 and agreed to send a fact-finding mission to the region from April 24 to 29. A fact-finding mission was sent to Kosovo in April to gather information on the situation. Preliminary drafts for a new U.N. resolution to replace Resolution 1244 were circulated in early May, with the U.S. supporting independence for Kosovo. Russia proposed further negotiations, leading to an impasse in the Security Council process. Russia's rejection of draft revisions led to an impasse in the Security Council process. Russian leaders opposed an imposed settlement for Kosovo without Serbian agreement, warning of a possible Russian veto. They also raised concerns about Kosovo setting a precedent for other territorial disputes. U.N., U.S., and European officials argued that Kosovo's situation is unique and not applicable elsewhere. Despite high-level meetings, no breakthrough was achieved on Kosovo. At the G8 meeting, Russian officials reiterated their opposition to other members. New French President Sarkozy proposed a six-month postponement of Kosovo status process with the Ahtisaari plan as default. A new U.N. draft resolution gave parties four months for negotiations, but Serbian and Russian officials rejected it. No agreement was reached at a summit between Bush and Putin. U.S. and European Security Council members withdrew a new resolution due to ongoing disagreement. Representatives of the contact group agreed to new talks on Kosovo's future. The contact group, represented by a \"troika\" of negotiators, agreed to new talks on the future of Kosovo under the sanction of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. All options were on the table, and the parties were urged to approach the talks constructively. The road map for Kosovo left some details unclear, such as the significance of the December 10 deadline for reporting back to the Security Council. The troika has hosted several rounds of talks. The troika hosted talks on Kosovo's future, with parties presenting detailed proposals. Despite opposing status positions, the troika proposed 14 principles for future relations emphasizing cooperation and European integration. They also suggested a cooperation agreement between Kosovo and Serbia that would remain \"status-neutral.\" The troika process aimed to reach a mutually acceptable status settlement for Kosovo but failed due to parties' unwillingness to compromise on sovereignty. Useful outcomes included a pledge to maintain security and discussions on the European perspective. However, no consensus was reached in the U.N. Security Council, with Russia advocating for continued talks and the U.S. and European members opposing further extensions. Kosovo's authorities prepared for next steps without U.N. Security Council action. In early 2008, Kosovo's authorities planned to declare independence, following the international community's guidance. Despite concerns and objections, the Kosovo assembly declared independence on February 17, 2008, in line with U.N. Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari's recommendations. The United States, France, and the United Kingdom, along with over forty other countries, formally recognized Kosovo's independence following the Kosovo assembly's declaration on February 17, 2008. While some countries, including Russia, China, Serbia, and others, denounced the declaration as a violation of international law, the EU remains divided on Kosovo's status. Despite this, the lack of EU unity has not hindered joint actions on deploying new missions to Kosovo. The United Nations has maintained a neutral position on Kosovo's status, while Kosovo's leaders welcome international support for democratic development. Kosovo's leaders have welcomed international support for democratic development. The Kosovo assembly enacted new laws consistent with the Ahtisaari plan, including ratifying a new constitution. Post-independence tensions are highest in northern Kosovo, where many ethnic Serbs reside. A clash on March 17 resulted in the death of a U.N. police officer and several wounded, with Serbian government security personnel allegedly involved in instigating incidents. The Serbian government and Kosovo's Serbian community insist on Serbia retaining sovereignty over Kosovo, with strong support from Russia. Serbian leaders advocate for \"more than autonomy, but less than independence\" for Kosovo. Belgrade declared Kosovo's independence invalid and participated in status talks with Kosovo Serbs as part of the Serbian delegation. Following Kosovo's declared independence, Serbia sponsored a large protest rally in Belgrade on February 21, with hundreds of thousands of peaceful demonstrators. Some individuals breached the U.S. embassy compound, setting fire to the chancery building and attacking other missions. Serbian riot police restored order, but one protest participant lost their life. Observers criticized the lax security and passive police response. Serbia's President and Prime Minister condemned the violence and vowed to protect foreign missions in Belgrade. Serbia's political leadership is divided after the violence in Belgrade, with President Tadic and Prime Minister Kostunica forming a new coalition government. Tadic won the 2008 presidential elections but the coalition fell due to disagreements on Kosovo's impact on Serbia's relations with the EU. Early parliamentary elections were scheduled for May 11, 2008. Tadic's DS party won an important victory in the 2008 parliamentary elections in Serbia, potentially forming a coalition with the Socialist Party. Serbia's government rejected a military solution to the Kosovo situation, focusing on implementing retaliatory measures. Observers are monitoring Serbia's actions, including the potential partition of Kosovo and pressure on Kosovo's Serbs not to cooperate with Pristina. Incidents at the border and protests in northern Mitrovica indicate tensions. Belgrade's plan to hold elections in Serb-majority municipalities in Kosovo on May 11 has sparked controversy with international authorities. The international community is concerned about Serbia's efforts to strengthen parallel institutions in Kosovo's Serb-majority areas. The deadlock over Kosovo's status in 2007 has complicated plans for new international missions to replace the United Nations. European officials are seeking a clear international mandate from the U.N. Security Council for these missions. In the absence of a new U.N. Security Council resolution, international institutions are exploring ways to establish an international legal basis for new missions in Kosovo. The EU and NATO have used Resolution 1244 as a framework for new missions in Kosovo, despite Russian objections. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon plans to \"reconfigure\" UNMIK in light of changed circumstances in Kosovo, maintaining a residual presence in the region. The Ahtisaari plan called for governing powers to be held by Kosovar authorities, with an international civilian presence and military presence. The civilian presence includes an International Civilian Representative (ICR) and a civilian European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) Mission. The ICR, also serving as the EU Special Representative (EUSR) to Kosovo, has \"final authority\" over civilian aspects of the settlement. The ESDP mission in Kosovo is led by Dutch diplomat Pieter Feith. The EU rule of law mission in Kosovo, named EULEX, involves training, monitoring, and developing police and judicial institutions with approximately 2,000 EU and international civilian personnel. Dutch diplomat Pieter Feith has been appointed as the International Civilian Representative (ICR) and EU Special Representative (EUSR) in Kosovo. The mission was approved by the EU in February and is led by former French General Yves de Kermabon. The International Steering Group (ISG) appointed Pieter Feith during their meeting in Vienna on February 28, 2008. The International Steering Group (ISG) in Kosovo urged full implementation of the Ahtisaari plan and criticized Serbia's efforts to hold municipal elections in Kosovo. NATO members expressed readiness to maintain a military presence in Kosovo under the plan. NATO pledges to maintain KFOR's strength at current levels post-settlement in Kosovo. There may be a shift to EU for military stabilization duties in the future. US troops in Kosovo could be relocated to meet demands in Afghanistan. Serbian and Russian opposition complicates the situation, especially in northern Kosovo. Belgrade recognizes only UNMIK and KFOR authority in the north, while EU insists on ICO and EULEX mandates throughout Kosovo. The Clinton Administration condemned Serbian human rights abuses in Kosovo and called for autonomy within Yugoslavia. They pushed for air strikes but opposed ground troops. US troops were willing to participate in peacekeeping if an agreement was reached. International missions will continue in Kosovo post-settlement, with the EU leading financial assistance efforts. President Clinton stated that the U.S. and NATO troop commitment to Kosovo could be reduced as local institutions took hold post-conflict. He emphasized the need for Europe to provide most resources for rebuilding Kosovo. During the 2000 presidential campaign, Condoleezza Rice suggested that U.S. allies in Europe should take over peacekeeping responsibilities in the Balkans due to global military overextension. However, the Administration later expressed a commitment to peace in the Balkans, with Colin Powell stating that NATO forces would remain in Bosnia and Kosovo for years. President Bush reiterated the commitment to maintaining NATO forces in Bosnia and Kosovo for an extended period, with a gradual reduction in troop levels. The U.S. would consult with allies and not withdraw abruptly. The September 11 attacks led to a desire to decrease deployments in the Balkans, resulting in a significant reduction in troops, with the U.S. contingent in KFOR decreasing from 5,500 to 1,600. NATO terminated its Stabilization Force in Bosnia. The United States provided significant bilateral aid to Kosovo from FY1999-FY2008, totaling over $1 billion. The Bush Administration supported the \"standards before status\" policy for Kosovo, requiring the autonomous government to meet certain benchmarks before gaining independence. The Bush Administration supported the \"standards before status\" policy for Kosovo, requiring the autonomous government to meet certain benchmarks before gaining independence. In November 2003, a review date strategy was announced for evaluating Kosovo's standards by mid-2005, with the possibility of determining Kosovo's future status if the standards are met. The United States did not take a position on final status at that time. On March 17, 2004, the State Department condemned serious violence in Kosovo and called for calm and cooperation. In May 2005, the second Bush Administration announced a new phase in U.S. policy in the Balkans, emphasizing the need to \"finish the work\" in the region. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs R. Nicholas Burns testified before Congress, expressing U.S. support for the standards review timetable in 2005, possibly leading to status negotiations later in the year. He mentioned that a settlement could be expected by the end of 2006, with the United States remaining an active partner in Kosovo. The United States named Ambassador Frank Wisner as the Special Representative for Kosovo status talks in December 2005. In February 2007, the Administration supported U.N. Envoy Ahtisaari's proposal for a Kosovo status settlement, calling it \"fair and balanced.\" U.S. officials urged Serbian and Kosovar parties to engage constructively with Ahtisaari. The need for international unity in supporting a future status settlement was emphasized, with top U.S. officials engaging counterparts, including Russia, on the Kosovo question. The Administration supported Serbia's entry into NATO's Partnership for Peace program in 2006 and pursued agreement on Kosovo's status in the U.N. Security Council in 2007. President Bush pledged to work towards Kosovo's independence based on the Ahtisaari plan, despite Russia's disagreement. The Administration strongly supported the troika process for Kosovo.
