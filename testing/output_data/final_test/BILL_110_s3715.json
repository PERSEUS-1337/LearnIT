Loan amounts repaid under this Act can be credited to the appropriate Government financing account for the advanced technology vehicle manufacturing incentive program until the loan is fully repaid. Once the loan is repaid, the repaid amounts can be used to reduce the public debt. LIMITS ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. The Secretary will require loan recipients to meet standards for executive compensation and corporate governance, including limits on risky incentives, recovery of inaccurate bonuses, and a prohibition on golden parachute payments to senior executives. The Act imposes restrictions on executive compensation for loan recipients, including prohibiting bonus payments to executives with annual base compensation over $250,000 and any compensation plan that could manipulate reported earnings. The Act prohibits the use of loan proceeds for lobbying activities or political contributions. Recipients are also not allowed to pay common stock dividends for the duration of the loan. Additionally, an oversight board is established for the auto industry emergency bridge loan. The Auto Industry Emergency Bridge Loan Oversight Board is established to review progress, recommend changes, and report any suspected fraud or misrepresentation to the appropriate authorities.

The Secretary, with the Board's consultation, has the authority to oversee transactions and financial conditions. The Secretary, with the Board's consultation, can review and direct against asset sales or investments exceeding $25,000,000 during outstanding loans. The Board may establish procedures for such reviews. The Board's authority under this section will end within 6 months after the last loan repayment. SEC. 11.
