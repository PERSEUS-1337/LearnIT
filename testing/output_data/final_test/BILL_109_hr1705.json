    "content": "REDUCTION OF ENGINE IDLING OF HEAVY-DUTY VEHICLES. Definitions in this section include the meaning of \"Administrator\" as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, \"advanced truck stop electrification system\" as a stationary system providing various services to heavy-duty vehicles, and \"auxiliary power unit\" as a system that offers heat, air conditioning, and electricity to heavy-duty vehicle components. Idle reduction technology refers to systems that reduce long-duration idling of heavy-duty vehicles, such as advanced truck stop electrification systems or auxiliary power units. Heavy-duty vehicles are defined as those with a gross vehicle weight rating greater than 8,500 pounds and powered by a diesel engine. These technologies must be certified by the Administrator under applicable emission standards. Energy conservation technology refers to devices that reduce long-duration idling of heavy-duty vehicles by allowing the main drive engine or auxiliary refrigeration engine to be shut down after 15 consecutive minutes of operation when not engaged in gear. The term \"long-duration idling\" excludes the operation of main drive or auxiliary refrigeration engines during routine stoppages in traffic. The Administrator is required to review EPA air emission models to assess accuracy in reflecting emissions from heavy-duty vehicle idling within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Administrator must review EPA air emission models for heavy-duty vehicles and engines, update models as needed, and assess emission reductions from idle reduction technology within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Reports on the reviews must be publicly available. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, must establish a program through the EPA's SmartWay Transport Partnership to support deployment of idle reduction and energy conservation technologies within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Administrator prioritizes deploying idle reduction and energy conservation technologies based on cost, air quality benefits, and emission reduction. Funding includes $19.5 million for 2006, $30 million for 2007, and $45 million for 2008, with cost-sharing requirements. The Administrator requires 50 percent of project costs to come from non-Federal sources, with the possibility of reducing this requirement if necessary. Within 90 days of the Act's enactment, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, must conduct an idling location study. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, will conduct a study on heavy-duty vehicles' long-duration idling locations, including truck stops, rest areas, border crossings, ports, transfer facilities, and private terminals. The study must be completed within 180 days of the Act's enactment, with publicly available reports on the results. The study will focus on heavy-duty vehicles' long-duration idling locations, with publicly available reports on the results. A vehicle weight exemption will be implemented to promote fuel use reduction and emissions reduction due to engine idling. The weight increase for idle reduction technology shall not exceed 400 pounds. Vehicle operators must provide proof of functionality and proper use of the weight increase. The Administrator will report to Congress within 60 days of fund allocation and annually thereafter. The Administrator will report to Congress on grant recipients, project descriptions, funding amounts, and all other program applicants."
