    "content": "Sections 911 and 915 of Dodd-Frank established the Investor Advisory Committee (IAC) and the Office of the Investor Advocate (IA) within the SEC. The IAC advises the SEC on regulatory priorities, securities regulation, investor protection, and market integrity. Members include the Investor Advocate, state securities commission representative, and individuals representing various investor interests. The Investor Advisory Committee (IAC) advises the SEC on investment issues and decisions, representing the interests of equity and debt investors, institutional investors, and mutual funds. The SEC is not obligated to follow the IAC's recommendations but must issue a public statement assessing them. Section 915 establishes the Office of the Investor Advocate to assist retail investors with SEC and self-regulatory organization issues, identify areas for rule changes, and analyze problems with financial service providers and investment products. Section 919D establishes an Ombudsman position in the Office of the Investor Advocate to assist retail investors with SEC and self-regulatory organization issues, recommend policies, and promote investor interests. SEC-registered broker-dealers and investment advisers are held to different standards in providing advice on securities investments under federal securities law. Investment advisers have a fiduciary duty to provide advice in the best interest of the customer, as defined in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Broker-dealers, on the other hand, must meet a standard of suitability under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This difference in standards can lead to confusion for customers, especially when firms employ both brokers and advisers. Customers may question if advice is influenced by compensation received. Section 913 addresses these concerns. The House and Senate took different approaches in addressing the fiduciary duty issue for broker-dealers and investment advisers. The conference version of the legislation directs the SEC to study the fiduciary duty question and report to Congress within six months, while also giving the SEC authority to establish a uniform fiduciary duty by rule. The SEC has approval authority over proposed rules of self-regulatory organizations in the securities industry. Regulatory Authority (FINRA, formerly the National Association of Securities Dealers), registers brokers and handles customer complaints. Section 916 sets timetables for SEC consideration of proposed SRO rules, with possible extensions for complex proposals. Section 919C calls for a GAO study on the financial planning industry and the use of the \"financial planner\" designation, focusing on investor protection and understanding licensing requirements. The Senate Banking Committee considered provisions for creating an SRO for financial planners, but the bill included a study instead. Section 922 aims to establish a whistleblower program at the SEC, modeled after the IRS program, with minimum awards for successful tips. Section 921 addresses the controversial practice of mandatory arbitration in securities markets, where customers waive their right to take their broker to court. Critics argue that the process is unfair to investors, while defenders point to cost savings. Less than 10% of monetary sanctions collected in actions are eligible for awards, with appeal rights and confidentiality protections for whistleblowers. SEC, SRO, law enforcement personnel, auditors, and persons convicted of criminal charges are not eligible for awards. The legislation amends securities laws to authorize the SEC to restrict arbitration agreements between customers and brokers or advisers. Regulation D allows private offerings of securities with certain conditions, such as selling only to accredited investors and not advertising the offerings. Under SEC's Rule 506, issuers can sell unlimited securities without registering. Dodd-Frank's Section 926 bars \"bad actors\" from issuing securities under Rule 506. Subtitle B enhances SEC enforcement authority and resources, including clarifying margin lending rules and Fair Fund procedures for defrauded investors. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions such as Fair Fund procedures for defrauded investors, nationwide subpoena authority for the SEC, expanded punishment for aiders and abettors of securities fraud, and amendments to the Securities Investor Protection Act. Credit rating agencies were criticized for assigning triple-A ratings to subprime mortgage-backed bonds during the financial crisis. During the financial crisis, credit rating agencies were criticized for assigning triple-A ratings to subprime mortgage-backed bonds, leading to market-wide panic when the housing boom stalled. Various approaches to rating agency reform were considered, including stricter regulation by the SEC, enhanced accountability through private litigation, reducing the significance of ratings in the securities marketplace, and increasing transparency by requiring disclosure of rating methods and models. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions to enhance the SEC regulatory scheme for credit rating agencies, known as \"nationally recognized statistical rating organizations\" (NRSROs). It does not allow the SEC to regulate rating methodologies or models but aims to ensure that ratings are based on objective criteria. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes an Office of Credit Ratings in the SEC to regulate NRSROs, impose conflict-of-interest regulations, and require rating analysts to meet standards of training and competence. It also mandates NRSROs to have independent boards of directors to address conflicts of interest in the ratings business. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes an Office of Credit Ratings in the SEC to regulate NRSROs and address conflicts of interest in the ratings business. Section 939F directs the SEC to study the conflict of interest in the \"issuer pays\" model and create a mechanism for selecting NRSROs to rate asset-backed securities on a random or semi-random basis. The SEC may use the Franken amendment or an alternative mechanism to define a pool of \"qualified\" NRSROs and establish a board to assign initial credit ratings for complex securities. Section 933 increases legal liability in private lawsuits seeking money. Section 933 of the Dodd-Frank Act increases legal liability in private lawsuits seeking money damages from credit rating agencies by lowering the pleading standard. It requires complaints to state specific facts showing a strong inference that the agency knowingly or recklessly failed to conduct a reasonable investigation or obtain verification of factual elements used in evaluating credit risk. Credit ratings are not considered \"forward-looking statements\" under this section. Section 939 of the Dodd-Frank Act repeals statutory provisions referencing credit ratings and directs federal agencies to establish their own credit-worthiness standards, reducing market reliance on ratings. Additionally, Section 939A requires federal agencies to review regulations for any references to credit ratings. Each federal agency must review regulations, remove references to credit ratings, and establish credit-worthiness standards. The goal is to eliminate the perception of government endorsement of ratings and encourage investors to conduct their own analyses. Section 939B eliminates rating agencies' exemption from SEC fair disclosure rules, preventing corporations from providing non-public financial information to rating agencies. Section 939G nullifies Rule 436(g). Section 939G nullifies Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act of 1933, removing NRSROs' exemption from liability when their ratings are included in SEC registration statements or securities offering prospectuses. This change requires issuers to obtain consent from rating agencies, potentially exposing them to Securities Act liability for false or incomplete disclosure. NRSROs may refuse consent, leading to less frequent inclusion of ratings in offering materials. Additionally, Section 932 mandates extensive disclosure requirements for NRSRO ratings to provide investors and other users with necessary information. The SEC requires rating agencies to disclose information on credit rating procedures, methodologies, data used, and any limitations. Specific requirements apply to asset-backed securities, including data on underlying assets and surveillance methods. Section 938 addresses concerns about universal rating symbols. The asset securitization process led to the creation of \"toxic\" assets during the financial crisis, causing losses in value for mortgage-backed securities. This, along with uncertainty about the true value of these securities, contributed to the freezing of interbank credit flows. Subtitle D focuses on regulating the asset-backed securities (ABS) market. Subtitle D of the financial regulations addresses the asset-backed securities (ABS) market by requiring securitizers to retain a portion of the credit risk in any ABS they sell. This aims to align the interests of sellers and buyers, encouraging securitizers to select high-quality assets and avoid overly complex securities. Subtitle D of financial regulations requires securitizers to retain a portion of credit risk in any asset-backed security they sell. This rule applies to various asset classes such as residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, commercial loans, and auto loans. The retention requirement is set at a minimum of 5% of the total credit risk, with exceptions for assets meeting low credit risk standards. The SEC, banking regulators, HUD, and FHFA will collaborate on writing rules for this risk retention. Regulators will establish standards for low credit risk on securitized assets, with risk retention below 5% in some cases. Qualified residential mortgages will be exempt from risk retention if they meet defined criteria. Risk retention requirements may be split between securitizers and originators based on asset characteristics and market incentives. Section 941 of the regulations provides exemptions from risk retention rules for certain types of securitizations, including those involving Farm Credit System institutions, municipal issuers, and assets insured or guaranteed by the United States. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Federal Home Loan Banks are not considered agencies of the United States for this purpose. Regulatory authorities have broad discretion to grant exemptions that promote high-quality underwriting standards, encourage risk management practices, and improve access to credit for consumers and businesses. Section 941 authorizes regulators to create risk retention rules for second-degree securitizations, such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which were heavily impacted during the financial crisis. The exemption for qualified residential mortgages does not apply to these securitizations. Section 942 directs the SEC to regulate disclosure of information about underlying assets in asset-backed securities, including loan-level data necessary for investor due diligence. The SEC is required to regulate the disclosure of information about underlying assets in asset-backed securities, including data on unique identifiers, broker compensation, risk retention, and representations and warranties. NRSROs must describe the enforcement mechanisms available to investors in ABS ratings. Securitizers must disclose fulfilled and unfulfilled repurchase requests for problem loans in the asset pool. Section 945 of the SEC rules requires issuers of ABS to conduct due diligence on underlying assets and disclose the review process. Flawed compensation structures are identified as a factor in the financial crisis, where short-term gains incentivize long-term risks. Subtitle E aims to align incentives of shareholders and employees, with Section 951 giving shareholders a \"say-on-pay\" vote. Section 951 of the SEC rules gives shareholders a \"say-on-pay\" vote to approve or disapprove executive compensation, occurring every one, two, or three years. Another vote involves \"golden parachute\" payments for executives in mergers. Section 952 mandates compensation committees on stock exchanges to be independent directors. Section 953 requires companies to disclose shareholder-friendly information in annual proxy statements. Companies must disclose executive compensation compared to financial performance in annual proxy statements. CEOs' pay must be compared to median employee pay. Section 954 mandates stock exchanges to adopt listing standards for executives to repay erroneously awarded compensation. If a company restates its accounts due to noncompliance, executives must return any excess incentive-based compensation received in the past three years. Section 956 grants regulators authority to address incentive-based compensation structures in financial institutions to prevent excessive pay or risks that could lead to financial loss. Regulators are required to disclose information on compensation structures, not individual pay packages, and to prohibit structures that encourage inappropriate risks. This applies to covered financial institutions as defined in the section. Subtitle F of Section 956 addresses incentive-based compensation risks in covered financial institutions, defined as specific types of financial entities. It excludes institutions with assets under $1 billion and aims to prevent failures like the SEC's handling of the Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme. The SEC's failure to detect the Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme raised concerns about the competence of some employees and organizational weaknesses. Inexperienced staff accepted Madoff's false claims, failed to verify accounts, and lacked communication between divisions. Supervisors did not support frontline staff, hindering investigations. Section 961, similar to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, was introduced to address these issues. Section 961, similar to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires the SEC to submit an annual report to Congress assessing the effectiveness of internal controls for staff conducting examinations, investigations, and reviews. The report must include a certification from key divisions and undergo a review by the GAO every three years. Section 962 mandates the GAO to evaluate personnel management effectiveness every three years. The GAO is required to evaluate the effectiveness of personnel management at the SEC every three years, considering various factors such as supervisor effectiveness, promotion criteria fairness, staff competence, communication efficiency, turnover rates, and management levels. Additionally, they assess initiatives to improve staff competence and actions taken for underperforming employees. The GAO evaluates SEC personnel management every three years, considering factors like supervisor effectiveness, promotion fairness, staff competence, communication efficiency, turnover rates, and management levels. Additionally, they assess initiatives to improve staff competence and actions for underperforming employees. The SEC is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure for financial reporting, overseen by the GAO. Federal securities law allows for a national securities association, currently FINRA, to self-regulate under SEC oversight. The GAO is required to submit reports to Congress on SEC oversight of national securities every three years. The GAO evaluates SEC oversight of national securities associations every three years, considering governance, examinations, executive compensation, arbitration services, regulation of advertising, cooperation with state securities administrators, funding, and other matters. SEC compliance examiners work in the Office of Compliance, Inspections, and Examinations (OCIE). Dodd-Frank requires expertise for SEC examiners in the Division of Trading and Markets and Division of Investment Management. SEC examiners are required to have expertise in the business of the entity being examined. An independent consultant with expertise in organizational restructuring and capital markets is hired to assess the SEC's internal operations, structure, funding, and the need for reform. This includes evaluating the SEC's relationship with self-regulatory organizations and other entities relevant to securities regulation. Areas of study include streamlining SEC units, improving communication between offices, establishing a clear chain-of-command structure, and addressing the impact of high-frequency trading on the market. The SEC's oversight of high-frequency trading and technological advances in the market, as well as its hiring practices and workplace policies, are being evaluated. Shareholder groups are advocating for legislation allowing shareholders to nominate board candidates alongside management's choices on proxy materials. Section 971 clarifies the SEC's authority to issue rules for shareholder proxy nominations. The SEC adopted a rule allowing shareholders with 3% ownership for three years to nominate directors. Companies must disclose reasons for combining or separating the roles of chairman and CEO. Concerns about municipal securities markets and \"pay-to-play\" abuses persist. Subtitle H introduces significant changes to the regulation of municipal markets, creating a new class of registrants known as \"municipal advisors.\" These advisors provide advice to municipal entities on financial products and securities offerings, excluding certain entities like broker-dealers and SEC-registered investment advisers. Subtitle H introduces significant changes to the regulation of municipal markets by creating a new class of registrants called \"municipal advisors.\" These advisors must register with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) and adhere to rules enforced by the SEC. The composition of the MSRB is also amended to include 15 members, with the majority being independent public members not associated with the industry. This includes representatives of investors, municipal entities, and individuals with knowledge of the municipal securities industry. The new regulations in Subtitle H introduce changes to the municipal markets by creating municipal advisors who must register with the MSRB. The MSRB composition is amended to include 15 members, with the majority being independent public members. The board members from the industry include representatives of bank and non-bank municipal securities dealers and at least one individual associated with a municipal advisor. GAO is tasked with conducting studies on disclosures to investors and the market, including trading mechanisms and the impact of innovations. Section 978 establishes funding for the GASB, which sets accounting standards for state and local governments. Section 979 of Subtitle I establishes the Office of Municipal Securities within the SEC to address concerns about oversight of municipal markets. It requires the SEC to collect accounting support fees from FINRA members and remit them to GASB. Section 981 deals with the PCAOB's authority to exchange information with foreign regulatory bodies. The PCAOB may share confidential information with foreign auditor oversight authorities to protect investors. Section 982 mandates PCAOB regulation of auditors for registered broker-dealers, regardless of public company status, in response to the Madoff Ponzi scheme case. Section 983 of the Madoff Ponzi scheme case amends the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 to extend protections to customers of failed broker-dealers, allowing reimbursement up to $500,000. It enables the inclusion of securities and related futures products in a single \"portfolio margining account\" for SIPA protection based on net risk. Section 987 of the Dodd-Frank Act raises the threshold for a material loss review to $200 million for losses in 2010 and 2011, $150 million for losses in 2012 and 2013, and $50 million thereafter. The purpose is to prevent duplicative reviews of bank failures and make recommendations for preventing future losses. Section 987 of the Dodd-Frank Act raises the threshold for a material loss review to $200 million for losses in 2010 and 2011, $150 million for losses in 2012 and 2013, and $50 million thereafter. Additionally, Section 987 directs the Inspectors General to prepare a semi-annual report on nonmaterial losses to determine if there were cases with unusual features that might justify a full loan loss review even though the materiality threshold was not reached. Reports are available to Congress upon request. Section 989A directs the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection to provide grants to states for investigating and prosecuting misleading financial practices towards seniors. States can use the grants for various purposes such as staff, technology, equipment, training, and educational materials. States must adopt rules on the use of designations in the offer or sale of securities, insurance products, or investment advice to receive these grants. Section 989B authorizes $8 million for fiscal years 2011 through 2015 for oversight on securities, insurance products, and investment advice. It also amends the Inspector General Act of 1978 to clarify authority delegation. Section 989C aims to increase accountability through a transparent peer review process among federal inspectors general. Section 989D states that in federal agencies where a board or commission is the head, an inspector general can only be removed with the written concurrence of two-thirds of the board. Section 989E establishes a Council of Inspectors General on Financial Oversight, consisting of inspectors general from various agencies. They meet quarterly to discuss ongoing work and improve financial oversight. Section 989H requires action from certain agency heads based on Inspector General reports. Section 989G provides an exemption from a specific section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 989G of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act exempts public companies with a market capitalization below $75 million from Section 404(b), which mandates external audits of internal accounting controls. However, Section 404(a) still requires management to certify internal control responsibility for all public companies. The SEC is tasked with studying the impact of extending the exemption to companies with a market capitalization below $250 million. Additionally, Section 989I directs the GAO to study the effects of Section 989G on accounting restatements, cost of capital, investor confidence, and voluntary compliance. Subtitle J of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act changes the way the SEC is funded, with fees collected on securities market transactions. Excess fees now go to a special account for the SEC's budget. Exempt securities under the Securities Act of 1933 are regulated by state insurance commissions, not the SEC, in states with suitable standards. Subtitle J of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act establishes a new funding mechanism for the SEC through fees collected on securities market transactions. The fees are adjusted to match the SEC's annual appropriation, with excess funds going into a Reserve Fund of up to $100 million. This fund can be used to ensure continuity in spending and prevent delays in multi-year projects. Additionally, the SEC is now authorized to submit its budget request directly to Congress, with appropriations authorized through FY2015 at $2.25 billion."
