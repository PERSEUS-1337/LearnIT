    "content": "The Act is titled the \"One Percent Spending Reduction Act of 2013\" and includes Congressional findings and purpose. The \"One Percent Spending Reduction Act of 2013\" finds that the fiscal crisis demands immediate action due to the growth in spending and debt threatening economic and national security. Federal spending has increased to nearly 23% of GDP, with total debt exceeding $16 trillion and projected to rise to $26 trillion by 2023. Interest payments on the debt will soon become unsustainable. The \"One Percent Spending Reduction Act of 2013\" aims to quickly balance the Federal budget by reducing spending by one percent per year until it equals projected long-term revenues. This is necessary due to the growth of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other health-related spending, which is projected to consume all tax revenues. The \"One Percent Spending Reduction Act of 2013\" aims to balance the Federal budget by reducing spending annually until it matches projected long-term revenues, along with reforming entitlement programs for fiscal stability. The \"One Percent Spending Reduction Act of 2013\" aims to balance the Federal budget by establishing and enforcing spending caps through outlay caps. The \"outlay cap\" refers to reducing projected outlays (excluding interest payments) for each fiscal year by one percent compared to the previous year, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. The outlay cap involves reducing projected outlays for each fiscal year by one percent compared to the previous year, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. Amendments to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 include sequestration preview reports outlining estimates for the budget year. The reports must include estimates for the budget year, such as projected outlays, reductions required under section 253A, and the sequestration percentage needed to achieve the reduction. Final sequestration reports will detail outlay caps and necessary reductions. The final sequestration reports must include estimates for the budget year, baseline levels of sequestrable budgetary resources, outlay reductions, and effects on outlays for direct spending programs. Enforcement measures will be added to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. \"SEC. 316. ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES.\" The text chunk discusses outlay caps and the procedures for waiving or suspending them in the House of Representatives and the Senate. It also mentions point of order protection in the House. The House of Representatives has point of order protection regarding the consideration of rules or orders that waive certain subsections. The Speaker cannot entertain a motion to suspend this protection. SEC. 4. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. The table of contents in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 are amended to include new enforcement procedures and establishing outlay caps. SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act and its amendments apply to fiscal year 2014 and subsequent years, including necessary reports and calculations for implementation in 2014."
