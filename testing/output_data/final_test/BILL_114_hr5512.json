    "content": "SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. The \"Improving the Juvenile Justice System for Girls Act of 2016\" acknowledges the increasing number of girls in the juvenile justice system, with girls representing nearly 30 percent of juvenile arrests by 2012. Girls' pathways into the system differ from boys', with a higher proportion of nonviolent status offenders. Girls also enter the system at a younger age and often experience multiple traumatic events. The trauma of untreated physical and sexual abuse in girls leads to various negative outcomes such as higher mortality rates, psychiatric problems, dysfunctional relationships, poor education, substance abuse, and reliance on social services. Girls in the juvenile justice system have equal or higher rates of mental health issues compared to boys. Gender-responsive, strength-based programming is crucial for addressing these issues. Gender-responsive, strength-based programming with trauma-informed care is crucial for preventing juvenile offenses and reducing recidivism. Incentive grants for local delinquency prevention programs under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 are being amended. The term 'State advisory group' refers to the advisory group appointed by the chief executive officer of a State under a specific plan. 'Gender-responsive services' are practices that address the unique needs of girls in the juvenile justice system comprehensively. The curr_chunk discusses the need for interventions addressing girls' experiences in the juvenile justice system, including abuse, violence, family relationships, substance abuse, social and cultural factors, and the risk of unplanned pregnancy or STIs. It emphasizes trauma-informed services. The curr_chunk emphasizes trauma-informed services that address the effects of traumatic stress, provide resources for understanding trauma exposure, and strengthen resilience in individuals who have experienced trauma. The curr_chunk focuses on trauma-informed interventions for individuals who have experienced traumatic stress, emphasizing continuity of care, collaboration among providers and families, universal screening for signs of trauma, and specialized treatment by mental health providers trained in trauma-specific interventions. The curr_chunk introduces trauma-specific interventions as empirically supported therapeutic approaches to reduce post-traumatic stress symptoms and enhance recovery for individuals who have experienced traumatic stressors. It also includes the addition of gender-responsive services in section 504. The curr_chunk discusses the inclusion of gender-responsive services in section 504 and amendments to section 505 regarding the effectiveness of plans and activities funded under the section. The curr_chunk amends section 505 by adding years 2017-2022."
