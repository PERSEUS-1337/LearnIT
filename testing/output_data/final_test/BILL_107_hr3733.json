An eligible person, such as the surviving spouse, children over 21, surviving parent, executor of the estate, or next of kin, can apply to take over the claim within one year of the claimant's death. Upon notification of a claimant's death, the Secretary must send a notice to the estate and authorized representative, stating that the claim will be dismissed unless a substitution application is received within one year. The substitute claimant will have the same rights and responsibilities as the original claimant. If benefits are payable due to a decision on a claim by a substituted claimant, they will be distributed to the veteran's spouse, children, and dependent parents in equal shares. If the deceased claimant was the surviving spouse of a veteran, benefits will go to the surviving children in equal shares.
