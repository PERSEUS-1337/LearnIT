    "content": "The \"Health Care Access and Availability Act of 2000\" is based on Congress's power to regulate commerce. It introduces Individual Membership Associations (IMAs) to expand access and choice in healthcare. Individual Membership Associations (IMAs) are legal entities that offer health benefits coverage to members and their dependents at rates set by health insurance issuers. The Individual Membership Associations (IMAs) must offer health benefits coverage to all members without discrimination, as allowed by State law. Health insurance issuers are not required to provide coverage outside their approved service area or to individuals not specified in their policies. The Individual Membership Associations (IMAs) provide health benefits coverage through contracts with health insurance issuers, without assuming insurance risk. IMAs can operate in multiple geographic areas and offer administrative services to members such as accounting and enrollment information. The Individual Membership Associations (IMAs) provide health benefits coverage through contracts with health insurance issuers, offering administrative services like accounting, billing, and enrollment information. IMAs must comply with consumer protection requirements and file information with the Secretary to demonstrate compliance with applicable regulations. Individual Membership Associations (IMAs) must meet State standards for consumer protection and offer coverage under a contract with the IMA. The coverage offered through an IMA can include benefits such as coverage through a health maintenance organization, preferred provider organization, or licensed provider. An IMA must offer a minimum of 2 health insurance coverage options, including options that meet State benefit mandates. Coverage can include options like provider-sponsored organization, indemnity coverage, medical savings account contributions, flexible spending accounts, point-of-service options, or a combination of these. The title does not prevent health insurance issuers from offering coverage through an IMA. The issuer can offer health benefits coverage through an IMA without establishing premium discounts or modifying copayments or deductibles in exchange for adherence to health promotion programs. Members of an IMA can apply for health insurance coverage through a health insurance issuer. The contract between an IMA and a health insurance issuer ensures payment of premiums for members enrolled in health benefits coverage offered through the IMA. Rules for enrollment must be consistent for all members and cannot be based on health status-related factors. \"SEC. 2802. APPLICATION OF CERTAIN LAWS AND REQUIREMENTS.\" State laws related to benefit requirements and other restrictions on health benefits coverage offered through an IMA are superseded and shall not apply, except for requirements necessary to implement Federal law or prohibit specific disease exclusions. State laws or regulations regarding the composition or organization of an IMA are preempted if they conflict with the provisions of this title. SEC. 2803. ADMINISTRATION. The Secretary is authorized to issue regulations to administer this title, including incorporating the process of 'deemed file and use' for information filed by IMAs. Periodic reports must be submitted to Congress every 30 months for a 10-year period to promote the development of IMAs and improve access to healthcare coverage and services. The Secretary may contract private entities to produce reports on the effectiveness of the rules for promoting coverage of uninsured individuals under this title. \"Definitions are outlined in section 2804.\" The term 'association' in health insurance coverage refers to a group that has been active for at least 5 years, formed for purposes other than obtaining insurance, does not base membership on health status, and only offers coverage to members. The term 'dependent' is also defined in this context. In health insurance coverage, the term 'dependent' includes the spouse and children of the individual. Other key terms defined are 'health benefits coverage', 'health insurance issuer', and 'health status-related factor'. The term 'member' in health insurance refers to an individual who is a member of an individual membership association offering coverage."
