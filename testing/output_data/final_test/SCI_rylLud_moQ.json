    "content": "In recent years, advancements in generative models, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown great performance in tasks like image generation and style transfer. Word embeddings like word2vec and GLoVe are widely used in Natural Language Processing for neural network models. This work introduces a method for text generation using Skip-Thought sentence embeddings with GANs, achieving comparable results to using word embeddings. Various efforts have been made in natural language text generation for tasks such as sentiment analysis. This work proposes a text generation approach using Generative Adversarial Networks with Skip-Thought vectors, achieving state-of-the-art results in tasks like sentiment analysis and machine translation. GANs are neural networks that train a generator to produce high-quality samples by competing against an adversarial discriminative model. The use of sentence embedding vectors allows for differentiable inputs in discrete text generation. The text discusses the use of deep neural network architectures, including recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks, for natural language generation tasks. Supervised learning with deep neural networks in encoder-decoder models is highlighted as a state-of-the-art method for NLP problems. Stacked denoising autoencoders have been utilized for domain adaptation in sentiment classification. The text discusses the use of deep neural network architectures for natural language generation tasks, including domain adaptation in sentiment classification. Various models like BID8 and BID12 demonstrate learning compositionality of sentences. Recent text generation models utilize GANs for natural language generation tasks, with architectures like RNN and variational auto-encoder generator with CNN discriminator showing promising results. The Skip-Thought Generative Adversarial Network induces embedding vectors for sentences in the training corpus, generating similar vectors for the discriminator network. The Skip-Thought model utilizes an encoder-decoder framework to generate sentence vectors that are sampled during training and decoded to produce sentences. It draws inspiration from the skip-gram model and uses an RNN encoder with GRU activations BID4 and an RNN decoder with conditional GRU. The encoder maps sentences with similar semantic and syntactic properties to similar vector representations, while the decoder reconstructs surrounding sentences of an encoded passage. The Skip-Thought model utilizes an encoder-decoder framework with RNNs to generate sentence vectors. The model has three components: Encoder, Decoder, and Objective function. It uses two decoders in parallel for adjacent sentences and an objective function based on log-probabilities. Additionally, it mentions Generative Adversarial Networks as deep neural net architectures. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are deep neural net architectures with two networks - a Generator and a Discriminator, competing in a zero-sum game framework. The Generator produces data close to the real distribution from a noise distribution, while the Discriminator distinguishes between real and generated data. The networks play optimally in a minimax game leading to Nash equilibrium, the convergence point for GAN models. The STGAN model utilizes a deep convolutional generative adversarial network for image generation. The Skip-Thought encoder encodes sentences with less than 30 words using 2400 GRU units to produce 4800-dimensional combine-skip vectors. The decoder uses greedy decoding to reconstruct sentences conditioned on a sentence vector. The Skip-Thought GAN utilizes a 620 dimensional RNN word embeddings with 1600 hidden GRU decoding units. Training the GAN is challenging and techniques like batch normalization and feature matching have been suggested to improve stability. Minibatch discrimination is used to overcome mode dropping during training. The Skip-Thought GAN incorporates minibatch discrimination to model distances between samples in a batch. It uses Wasserstein distance to improve training loss and includes a gradient penalty regularizer in the WGAN objective. The experiments focus on improving text generation performance by conditioning both the generator and discriminator on Skip-Thought encoded vectors. The BookCorpus dataset is used to train a model for text generation, with evaluation based on BLEU metrics. The CMU-SE dataset is also utilized, overcoming mode collapse with minibatch discrimination and improving sentence formation with Wasserstein distance and gradient penalty regularizer. Language generation is performed on simple English sentences from the CMU-SE 2 dataset. The CMU-SE dataset contains simple English sentences with a vocabulary of 3,122 words. Vectors are extracted in batches of sentences of the same length for encoding. Mode collapse is observed in sentence generation using different distance measures like least-squares, Wasserstein, and gradient penalty regularizer. Performance metrics are computed for this setup, as described in related work. The text discusses using Skip-Thought sentence embeddings to generate images with GANs for text-to-image conversion tasks. These embeddings have also been utilized in models like neuralstoryteller to experiment with generative adversarial networks for generating unique samples."
