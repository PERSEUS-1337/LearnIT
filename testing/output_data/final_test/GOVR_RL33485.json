On December 26, 2007, the President signed the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations into law (P.L. 110-161), providing $6.3 billion for global HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria initiatives. Congress exceeded the President's request by $570.1 million for these programs, with a significant portion allocated to the Global Fund. HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria collectively cause over 6 million deaths annually. At the end of 2007, an estimated 33.2 million people were living with HIV/AIDS, with 2.5 million newly infected and 2.1 million deaths that year. Sub-Saharan Africa has nearly 90% of children infected with HIV, totaling 2.2 million out of 2.5 million worldwide. Around 1,000 children were newly infected with HIV daily in 2007 due to limited access to prevention drugs. Only 9% of pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries were offered services to prevent HIV transmission to their newborns. The World Health Organization estimates that at the end of 2004, over 14 million people were infected with TB, with the majority in southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Malaria causes over one million deaths annually, with 85-90% occurring in Africa. U.S. contributions to combat HIV/AIDS have increased significantly, including initiatives to prevent mother-to-child transmission. The Prevention of Mother and Child Transmission Initiative and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) have contributed to the growth in U.S. contributions to combat HIV/AIDS. Congress provided funding for the International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative, aiming to prevent HIV transmission from mothers to infants in Africa and the Caribbean. Funding was allocated to USAID and CDC for PMTCT programs, with additional funds from the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative. President Bush proposed $15 billion over 5 years to combat HIV/AIDS through PEPFAR, with $10 billion for prevention, treatment, and care in Focus Countries, $4 billion for existing programs, and $1 billion for the Global Fund. Congress authorized funds through the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS Act, aiming to support care for 10 million HIV-affected people, prevent 7 million new infections, and help 2 million people receive ARVs between FY2004 and FY2008. The bulk of PEPFAR funds are appropriated to the GHAI account to support global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs in Focus Countries. The Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator transfers funds to implementing agencies. U.S. agencies may allocate additional resources to international HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs. Appropriators include a chart in reports detailing how funds are spent. The Global Fund was established in Geneva, Switzerland in January 2002 to provide grants to developing countries to reduce HIV, TB, and malaria infections. It is an independent foundation with a board of directors representing donor and developing countries, NGOs, the business community, private foundations, and individuals affected by these diseases. The Fund projects that approved grants will have an impact by 2007. The Global Fund was established in 2002 to provide grants for HIV, TB, and malaria. By 2007, approved grants will have treated millions of patients and prevented the spread of diseases. Despite strong support, Congress has placed restrictions on U.S. contributions due to spending concerns. In FY2008, Congress provided a total of $840.3 million for the Global Fund through Labor/HHS and Foreign Operations Appropriations. Since FY2004, about $3 billion has been provided for PEPFAR, with nearly $3.8 billion since FY2001. The Global Fund has approved proposals totaling $10 billion and disbursed half of those funds. The Global Fund has approved proposals totaling $10 billion, disbursing half of the funds. The funds have supported ARV treatment for 1.4 million people, TB treatment for 3 million, and distribution of 30 million bed nets to prevent malaria. President Bush launched the President's Malaria Initiative in 2005 to increase support for U.S. international malaria programs by over $1.2 billion between FY2006 and FY2010. In FY2006 and FY2007, appropriators provided $102 million and $248 million for bilateral malaria efforts, respectively. The Administration requested $387.5 million for malaria initiatives in FY2008, with $300 million allocated to PMI. Congress appropriated $347.2 million to USAID and $36.0 million to CDC for international malaria efforts. Through September 30, 2007, PEPFAR has supported the provision of anti-retroviral treatment. Through September 30, 2007, PEPFAR has supported anti-retroviral treatment for 1.4 million people, prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission for over 10 million pregnancies, care for nearly 6.7 million people, and counseling and testing services for over 30 million people. USAID's bilateral HIV/AIDS and TB programs in non-Focus Countries are funded through various accounts. Funds are also provided for bilateral malaria programs, including the President's Malaria Initiative. In FY2004, $87.8 million of the amount appropriated to the Global Fund was withheld per legislative provisions limiting U.S. Global Fund contributions to 33% of the amount contributed by all donors. P.L. 108-447, FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations, directed that these withheld funds be transferred to the Global Fund in FY2005, subject to the 33% proviso. Congress provides funds for PEPFAR's 15 Focus Countries to the State Department's Global HIV/AIDS Initiative (GHAI), with U.S. contributions to other global AIDS efforts also provided through GHAI. The GHAI funds support various global HIV/AIDS programs, including the Global Fund, DoD's bilateral HIV/AIDS programs, CDC's Global AIDS Program, NIH grants for international HIV/AIDS research, and other international activities. The Administration did not request funds for the Department of Labor's Global AIDS in the Workplace Initiative since FY2002, but Congress funded it until FY2006. Additional funds were received from GHAI for HIV/AIDS programs. In FY2008, funds were not requested for DoD's bilateral HIV/AIDS prevention programs, but Congress provided $8.0 million for the activities."
