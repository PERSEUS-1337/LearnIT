    "content": "The report provides information on the national emergency management structure, laws, and policies governing disaster response and recovery. It also discusses federal financial assistance, executive branch policies, and congressional office preparation for disasters. The United States follows a \"bottom up\" approach to disaster management, starting at the local level with survivors, elected officials, and emergency service personnel. If local resources are overwhelmed, assistance may come from voluntary organizations, neighboring jurisdictions, states, and tribes. For more information on disaster response and federal assistance programs, refer to the \"Where to Obtain Further Information\" section of the report. The federal government provides assistance in disasters after local and state resources are overwhelmed, and a request for help is made by the governor or tribal chief. This is outlined in the Stafford Act, where the federal government's role is to supplement the efforts of local and state governments in alleviating damage and suffering. In extraordinary circumstances, local and state/tribal governments lead disaster response. FEMA aids the process and coordinates federal resources upon request. The President leads the federal response when necessary. State resources can be coordinated through a State Coordinating Officer in emergencies declared under the Stafford Act. The President appoints a State Coordinating Officer (SCO) in emergencies declared under the Stafford Act. At the federal level, a Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) is appointed to coordinate all federal resources. The National Preparedness System (NPS) was established to ensure the nation's ability to prevent, respond to, recover from, and mitigate natural disasters. The National Preparedness System (NPS) aims to prepare the nation for all hazards, including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and man-made disasters. It establishes methods for achieving desired levels of preparedness for federal and nonfederal partners by identifying core capabilities. The NPS is supported by the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and various strategic component policies to ensure a consistent approach for managing incidents and reducing loss of life and property. The National Response Framework (NRF) guides the nation's response to disasters, establishing 14 Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) to organize federal response capabilities. ESF #9 is \"Search and Rescue,\" unifying agencies with relevant expertise and resources. The National Response Framework (NRF) includes ESF #9, \"Search and Rescue,\" which coordinates federal agencies for search and rescue operations after disasters. The NRF provides guidance on disaster response and coordination of volunteers and donations. It is always in effect and does not require a formal Stafford Act declaration. Any disaster requiring federal coordination would be managed through the NRF. The National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF) is a companion document to the NRF, guiding the nation's recovery from disasters. It provides a structure for short- and long-term recovery, including basic principles and roles at different government levels. FEMA and partners have identified six Recovery Support Functions (RSFs), such as the Economic Recovery Support Function coordinated by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF) establishes key positions for recovery coordination at different government levels, including Federal Disaster Recovery Coordinator (FDRC), State or Tribal Disaster Recovery Coordinators (SDRC or TDRC), and Local Disaster Recovery Managers (LDRM). Local governments overwhelmed by disasters can seek support from voluntary organizations and nearby local governments through mutual aid agreements. Voluntary organizations are encouraged to coordinate their assistance through the NRF structure. The American Red Cross and National VOAD have specific responsibilities under the NRF for disaster assistance. Faith-based organizations and local governments also play key roles in providing aid during incidents. State, tribal, or local government officials are initial sources of information on voluntary organizations' activities. FEMA may provide additional support through VALs for coordinating relief efforts in declared emergencies. Many local governments have agreements to share resources with neighboring jurisdictions for emergency services. Mutual aid agreements with neighboring jurisdictions and the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) facilitate sharing resources during disasters. States have varying capacities for providing assistance, coordinated by their emergency management or homeland security agencies. FEMA plays a similar role at the federal level. Local governments have the authority to declare a state of emergency, with the process and powers varying by state. Governors can utilize their state National Guard forces for disaster response, operating under their control. Additional information on state emergency declarations is available on state agency websites. National Guard personnel can be activated under state law for \"state active duty,\" assisting civil authorities in tasks like search and rescue, supply distribution, and medical care during emergencies. If local resources are overwhelmed, federal assistance can be requested through a declaration under the Stafford Act. The federal declaration process under the Stafford Act involves various factors and information sources, with the governor/chief or President exercising judgment. A Preliminary Damage Assessment (PDA) team may be assembled to evaluate the severity of the incident before requesting assistance. A Preliminary Damage Assessment (PDA) team, consisting of state, federal, and local officials, is deployed to survey the damaged area to determine if the situation exceeds the state's capabilities. The governor's judgment plays a key role in deciding whether a Stafford Act declaration is needed, with a PDA being a necessary step in the process. During the PDA process, FEMA representatives brief the team on assessment factors and necessary information. Participants reconcile findings at the process's close. The governor may request a disaster declaration based on PDA results, submitted to the FEMA Regional Administrator for analysis. Under the Stafford Act, the President can declare an emergency or major disaster to provide federal assistance. Emergency declarations help states and communities with essential services and activities to prevent future damage. Major disaster declarations offer a broader range of assistance to various entities. Under the Stafford Act, emergency and major disaster declarations provide federal assistance to states and communities for various needs, including repair of public infrastructure and additional recovery programs. FEMA can also issue Fire Management Assistance Grants for wildfires threatening major destruction. The Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) authorized by the Stafford Act provides federal assistance for controlling and mitigating wildfires on public or private land. Other declaration authorities, such as a presidential declaration of a national emergency, can also be used to provide additional assistance to affected communities. The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) can declare a public health emergency under the Public Health Service Act. Various disaster declarations are made by the Small Business Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Federal financial assistance after a major disaster includes Public Assistance for governments and nonprofits, and Individual Assistance for affected households. For-profit businesses are not eligible for Public Assistance grants. The Federal-State Agreement (or FEMA-Tribal Agreement) outlines conditions for assistance and financial aid available for affected households, including housing assistance, crisis counseling, legal services, and disaster unemployment assistance. Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA) funds projects like safe rooms, buyouts of flooded properties, and facility retrofitting. Total assistance is capped at $34,000 per household annually. Other programs outside of DHS or FEMA may also provide assistance in certain circumstances. Other programs outside of DHS or FEMA can provide assistance in certain circumstances. Significant programs include the SBA Disaster Loan Program, HUD Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery Program, and U.S. Department of Transportation Federal-Aid Highway Emergency Relief Program for road repair after disasters. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) provide assistance for repairing damaged infrastructure after natural disasters. USDA offers programs for food, housing, and financial aid to agricultural and rural communities. The Corps assists in repairing flood control works and hurricane protection projects under its emergency response authority. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers provides disaster assistance focused on saving lives and protecting property. Various federal agencies have authorities to assist tribal, state, and local governments in different ways, such as providing technical assistance and waiving regulations during disasters. The President, FEMA Administrator, and FEMA Regional Administrator can direct any Federal agency to use its resources in support of State and local response efforts during disasters. Federal agencies receive mission assignments from FEMA and can be reimbursed through the Disaster Relief Fund. The federal government also has deployable assets for immediate disaster response and can provide assistance without a formal request in certain circumstances. The federal government can provide immediate assistance without a formal request in certain circumstances, such as when the incident involves an issue for which the President or federal authority has exclusive responsibility. The Department of Defense can offer immediate assistance through its regulations, bypassing formal request procedures. This is part of the overall federal disaster assistance relationship outlined in the Stafford Act. The Stafford Act and federal disaster assistance involve a relationship between federal, state, and tribal governments. Congressional input and information distribution can aid in the recovery process. Steps during the predeclaration period include encouraging planning, establishing relationships with emergency management offices, learning about mutual aid agreements, and considering support for a declaration request. Consider supporting the governor/chief's request for a federal declaration by highlighting the state/tribe and local government's challenges and the need for specific federal assistance. Provide feedback to PDA teams through state, tribal, and local officials on areas of need. Manage residents' expectations by explaining the assistance process and limitations. Establish relationships with FEMA/DHS congressional liaisons for accurate information. Publicize the online application process for federal assistance programs. Offer suggestions to FEMA/DHS on potential assistance locations. Engage with FEMA/DHS to identify locations for Disaster Recovery Centers (DRCs) and Mobile Disaster Recovery Centers. Obtain a list of communities participating in the National Flood Insurance Program. Publicize the \"Applicants Briefing\" for local governments and organizations affected by the incident. Collaborate with the State Hazard Mitigation Officer to understand mitigation priorities. The Hazard Mitigation Officer works with the state to prioritize mitigation efforts and track the Disaster Relief Fund's financial status. Congress may provide additional funding for disaster assistance programs. CRS experts are available to assist Congress, and online sources offer immediate disaster response information.
