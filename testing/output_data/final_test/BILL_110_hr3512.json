The \"College Textbook Affordability and Transparency Act of 2007\" includes findings by Congress on the rising costs of college textbooks, stating that textbook costs have increased at twice the rate of inflation. The Act also highlights the impact of these costs on students' overall college expenses and the insufficiency of current grant and scholarship programs to mitigate textbook costs. Publishers are exploring alternatives to traditional textbooks. According to the GAO report, publishers have tried to develop and distribute cheaper alternatives to college textbooks, but the costs have been incorporated into domestic textbook prices. There has not been enough demand for these alternatives to offset development costs and reduce overall textbook costs. Publishers have also made agreements with overseas distributors to prevent the re-importation of cheaper textbooks, limiting students' access to lower-cost options. The lack of communication and transparency among stakeholders in the textbook market causes frustrations and misunderstandings about rising college textbook costs. Students are disadvantaged as they are not involved in decision-making processes for textbook purchases. It is essential for students to be fully informed about textbook costs before registering for classes to understand the full cost of higher education. Students should have the opportunity to find and purchase lower-cost textbook alternatives to reduce the overall cost of higher education. The purpose and intent of this section is to address the lack of communication and transparency in the textbook market, particularly regarding rising college textbook costs. It emphasizes the importance of students being fully informed about textbook costs before registering for classes and having the opportunity to find lower-cost alternatives to reduce the overall cost of higher education. The Act aims to improve access to affordable course materials in higher education by educating all involved parties on selection, purchase, and use of materials. It encourages collaboration to reduce textbook costs for students while preserving faculty's academic freedom. In order to improve textbook affordability in higher education, college bookstores should collaborate with faculty to disclose prices, review ordering processes, and implement various options. Institutions should also work with student organizations to educate students on factors influencing textbook costs and available resources to mitigate them. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as college textbook, course schedule, institution of higher education, publisher, and supplemental material. \"Material\" refers to educational material accompanying a college textbook, including printed materials, computer disks, web access, and electronically distributed materials. SEC. 5. PUBLISHER REQUIREMENTS. College textbook publishers must provide faculty members with pricing information, revision history, and availability in different formats for textbooks and supplemental materials. College textbook publishers must offer textbooks and supplemental materials as separate items, each with its own price, in addition to bundled options. SEC. 6. Provision of ISBN college textbook information in course schedules. Each institution of higher education receiving Federal assistance must disclose ISBNs, author, title, and retail price information for required course materials in their course schedules. If ISBN is not available, author and title should be used. If disclosure is not possible, designate as \"To Be Determined.\" Institutions of higher education receiving Federal assistance must include required course material information in their course schedules, whether online or in print. Institutions of higher education that receive Federal assistance must provide accurate information to college textbook sellers upon request, including course schedules, required textbooks, enrollment numbers, and maximum student capacity for each course."
