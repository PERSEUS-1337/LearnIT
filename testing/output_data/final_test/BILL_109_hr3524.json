    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Communities Act of 2005\". The Congress acknowledges the lack of financial resources for incorporating disaster threats into land use planning, leading to costly relief programs and disruptive security measures. While land use planning falls under State and local jurisdiction, the Federal Government should support integrating disaster mitigation and emergency preparedness into urban development. Disaster response and relief efforts are costly to taxpayers, with a focus on post-disaster recovery rather than mitigation. Planning should incorporate mitigation strategies from various professional fields to prevent property damage and human casualties. Traditional disaster planning biases efficient responses over other planning goals, but comprehensive planning can effectively reduce risks from natural disasters and terrorist acts. The Federal Government and States should support comprehensive planning for safe communities, including updating land use statutes. Efforts are needed to coordinate State and regional investments with local plans for at-risk public infrastructure. Comprehensive urban planning considers the relationship between land use, transportation systems, water facilities, and critical infrastructure to promote safety and economic viability. Safe housing is crucial for community development and should be integrated into comprehensive planning efforts. Prevailing land use patterns can put people and the environment at risk, especially in poorly-regulated rural communities and small towns on the outskirts of cities. It is important to use modern planning techniques to ensure a variety of safe housing options are available to all community members. The Federal Government and State governments should support tribal governments and Native Hawaiian organizations in implementing land use planning and community development to improve housing safety and socioeconomic conditions for Indian tribes and Native Hawaiians. SEC. 3. SAFE COMMUNITIES PLANNING GRANTS. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a grant program to assist States and local governments in developing or revising land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents to mitigate hazards and improve emergency preparedness efforts. The grant program aims to assist States and local governments in developing or revising land use planning statutes to mitigate hazards. Eligibility requires demonstrating consistency with guidelines including citizen engagement in the planning process. The grant program aims to assist States and local governments in developing, adopting, and updating land use plans through multijurisdictional cooperation and multi-agency coordination. Land use plans include implementation elements with defined roles and responsibilities. The comprehensive planning process encourages incorporating risk assessment and mitigation into land use plans, urban design guidelines, building codes, and transportation plans to guide infrastructure development decisions. Grant funds received by a State or local government can be used for developing comprehensive land use plans, integrating natural hazard mitigation and security plan elements, assessing critical public infrastructure, and mapping for land use and community development policies. The curr_chunk focuses on developing geographical information systems, scenario planning technology, updating building codes and zoning regulations, implementing CPTED initiatives, assessing risk and vulnerability related to land use, and incorporating security elements in transportation and land use plans. The curr_chunk discusses the amount and cost-sharing of grants for projects related to natural hazard areas and interagency cooperation. The maximum grant amount is $1,125,000 with a federal share not exceeding 90%, except for tribal governments or Native Hawaiian organizations. The Secretary encourages coordination between Federal land management agencies and State or local planning directors. The Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security conducts audits on grants to ensure funds are used as specified. In this section, audits are conducted on grants to ensure proper fund usage. Definitions for \"land use planning legislation\" and \"comprehensive plan\" are provided. The curr_chunk discusses resources, development practices, infrastructure investments, and activities related to future land use and urban development. It defines the term \"State\" and \"State planning director\" in the context of land use planning legislation. The curr_chunk discusses the responsibilities of State and local planning directors in drafting and updating land use guidance documents. It also defines the term \"tribal government\" in the context of land use regulation. SEC. 4 SAFE COMMUNITIES PLANNING RESEARCH. The Secretary of Homeland Security, along with various partners, will conduct research on land use and community planning to mitigate natural hazards and terrorism threats. This includes integrating federal facility security with local plans, assessing the impact of security strategies on communities, and using mapping and risk assessment tools. A report to Congress is required within 2 years. The Secretary will report to Congress on best practices in community security and safety planning, evaluating land use codes, software tools for safe development, design standards for residential areas, and safety integration into infrastructure planning. The Secretary will evaluate best practices for infrastructure such as wastewater, storm water, transportation, and electricity facilities, considering regional differences and focusing on risk-reduction and cost. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2007 through 2011 totaling $57,250,000, with $56,250,000 allocated for grants under section 3 and $300,000 for section 4 implementation."
