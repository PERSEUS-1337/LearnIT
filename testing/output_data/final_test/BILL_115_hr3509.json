    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Citrus Investment in Treatment and Research for U.S. Sustainability Act\" or the \"CITRUS Act\". Congress finds that the citrus industry is facing a serious threat from citrus greening, a disease without a cure. This disease has significantly reduced citrus production in Florida and has spread to other citrus-producing states. The industry's future is at risk, leading to job losses and revenue decline. Collaboration between Federal, State, and industry efforts has made progress, but further action is necessary. The citrus industry requires additional research funding and grower assistance to eradicate citrus greening disease. The Emergency Citrus Disease Research and Extension Program receives $25,000,000 annually for disease control and eradication. The Citrus Health Response Program aims to protect the industry from invasive pests and diseases through partnerships with states. The Huanglongbing Multi-Agency Coordination Group (HLB-MAC) helps address critical citrus industry issues. The Tree Assistance Program aids growers in replacing diseased trees, but more access to this assistance is necessary. SEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION OF EMERGENCY CITRUS DISEASE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAM. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION FOR CITRUS HEALTH RESPONSE PROGRAM. Reauthorization of Emergency Citrus Disease Research and Extension Program includes amending sections related to fiscal years and termination dates for the program. SEC. 4 authorizes funding for the citrus health response program for fiscal years 2018 through 2023. SEC. 5 authorizes funding for the Huanglongbing Multi-Agency Coordination Group for the same period. SEC. 6 sets limitations on assistance for the Tree Assistance Program. Amendment to the Agricultural Act of 2014 sets new limitations on assistance for citrus producers, increasing the maximum amount to $250,000 for any crop year. Amendment to the Agricultural Act of 2014 increases the acreage limit for citrus producers to 1500 acres and adjusts the gross income requirement for assistance. The amendment to the Agricultural Act of 2014 includes an exception for citrus producers with an average adjusted gross income exceeding $1,800,000, who are not eligible for benefits under the tree assistance program."
