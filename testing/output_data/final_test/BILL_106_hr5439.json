    "content": "The \"Taxpayer Protection and Contractor Integrity Act\" aims to stop taxpayer support for Federal Government contractors with a history of civil judgments or criminal convictions for specific offenses. The \"Taxpayer Protection and Contractor Integrity Act\" aims to prevent taxpayer funds from supporting individuals or entities who repeatedly violate laws regarding Federal contracting, jeopardizing the integrity of future contracts. Federal regulations already require bidders to disclose any indictments, charges, convictions, or civil judgments, and contracting officers must assess a potential contractor's integrity, ethics, and performance record before awarding a contract. The Federal Acquisition Regulation allows agencies to decide on suspension or debarment based on convictions or civil judgments against a contractor, with no set limit on the number of convictions that would make them ineligible for future contracts. Expanded disclosure requirements for bidders on federal contracts include providing information on convictions or civil judgments, nature of offenses, and any fines or penalties assessed. This is followed by a limitation on awarding future contracts based on this information. No Federal contract may be awarded to an individual or entity with three or more convictions or civil judgments for fraud, criminal offenses, antitrust violations, embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen property related to government contracts. The prohibition on awarding federal contracts to individuals or entities with multiple convictions or civil judgments for various offenses related to government contracts will last for three years, during which the contractor must maintain a clean record and submit a report on their ethical practices. The Director must certify satisfactory steps taken by a potential contractor to prevent future violations. If an individual or entity with a prior prohibition has a new offense, they will face an additional three-year ban on federal contracts. SEC. 6. PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER allows the President to waive section 5 for national security or urgent needs. The waiver cannot be exercised until 45 days after submitting a justification to Congress. SEC. 7. PAYMENT OF LEGAL COSTS. SEC. 7. PAYMENT OF LEGAL COSTS. The United States will not cover legal costs for individuals or entities found guilty of offenses under section 5(a). SEC. 8. CONTRACTOR DEFINED. The term \"contractor\" is defined as per the Federal Acquisition Regulation. SEC. 9. CONSTRUCTION. This Act does not override the authority of a Federal contracting officer to determine nonresponsibility or initiate suspension and debarment procedures for individuals or entities with multiple convictions or civil judgments under section 5(a)."
