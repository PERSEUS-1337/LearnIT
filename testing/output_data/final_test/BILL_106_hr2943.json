The \"Child Care Quality Incentive Act of 1999\" makes findings on early brain development, emphasizing the importance of quality early care and education for children's cognitive abilities and long-term success. Research shows that many child care centers do not promote healthy development or ensure the safety and health of children. Full-day child care can be costly, ranging from $4,000 to $10,000 per child. Full-day child care costs $4,000 to $10,000 per year. Federal assistance is limited, making it difficult for many families to afford child care. Families with a monthly income under $1,200 spend 25% of their income on child care. Low payment rates for child care providers impact the quality of care and accessibility for families. The Act aims to increase child care payment rates to improve quality and access to child care. Low payment rates force providers to cut corners, leading to lower quality care for children. Higher payment rates enable providers to attract qualified staff, offer training, maintain a safe environment, and purchase educational materials. Children in low-quality care may experience delays in reading and language skills, and display more aggression towards others. SEC. 3. Incentive grants of $300,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2000 through 2004 are authorized to improve the quality of child care under section 658H of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990. The Secretary will use funds to make grants to eligible States for child care services based on market rates surveys conducted within 2 years of application submission. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State must submit an application to the Secretary with required information, including details of the market rates survey and a plan to increase payment rates. The State must submit an application with market rates survey details and a plan to increase payment rates to be eligible for a grant. The Secretary may make annual payments if the State shows progress in maintaining increased payment rates and conducts a survey update every two years. Matching funds are required for eligibility. To be eligible for a grant, the State must provide at least 25% of the costs from State sources. State contributions must be in cash and cannot include Federal funds. The allotment of funds among eligible States follows a specific formula. Funds must be used according to priority guidelines set by the State. An eligible State receiving a grant must increase child care assistance payment rates up to the 100th percentile of the market rate survey. Once reaching this rate, the State can use the funds for activities enhancing child care quality. The term 'payment rate' refers to reimbursement rates for subsidized child care. Funds must supplement, not replace, other federal, state, or local funds. States must report efforts to increase payment rates and their impact on child care quality to the Secretary. The Secretary must submit biennial reports to Congress on this information. The Secretary must submit biennial reports to Congress on the information related to applications for increased payment rates submitted by eligible States."
