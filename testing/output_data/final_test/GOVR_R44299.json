    "content": "The Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill funds independent agencies in Title V, which manage federal real property, regulate financial institutions, and oversee mail delivery. The bill also covers general provisions in Title VII and Cuba sanctions in Title I, along with funding for the Department of the Treasury, Executive Office of the President, judiciary, District of Columbia, and mandatory retirement accounts in Title VI. For more details, refer to CRS Report R44133. The FSGG bill funds independent agencies and covers various provisions, including funding for the CFTC. President Obama's FY2016 budget request included $3.60 billion for independent agencies funded through the FSGG bill. The House Committee on Appropriations reported a Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2016, with $1.19 billion for independent agency funding, including $322 million for the CFTC. Another $245 million for the CFTC was included in the Agriculture appropriations bill. The total funding for independent agencies was $1.43 billion, $2.17 billion less than the President's request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported the Financial Services and General Government Act, 2016 (S. 1910, S.Rept. 114-97) with $1.35 billion appropriated for independent agencies for FY2016, $2.25 billion less than the President's request. S. 1910 also included the text of S. 1484, a financial regulatory reform package. H.R. 719, a continuing resolution for FY2016, was signed into law on September 30, 2015, providing budget authority for ongoing projects and activities at the FY2015 funding rate. In FY2015, projects funded in P.L. 114-53 saw a slight decrease of 0.2108%. The CR included exceptions for FSGG independent agencies, such as the Recovery Board, which received $20 million in FY2014 and $18 million in FY2015 but was set to sunset on September 30, 2015. The CR provided $20 million for FY2014 and $18 million for FY2015 for FSGG independent agencies, including the Small Business Administration. The SBA was authorized to issue general business loans under the 7(a) loan guaranty program up to $23.5 billion if demand exceeded the program's fiscal year authorization ceiling. The SBA temporarily suspended 7(a) loan guaranty program applications in July 2015 due to projected demand exceeding the authorization ceiling, but resumed issuing loans after the authorization ceiling was increased to $23.5 billion. The FY2015 authorization ceiling for the 7(a) loan guaranty program was increased to $23.5 billion. Previous CRs had also raised the ceiling to prevent demand from exceeding it. Two additional CRs were enacted to avoid a lapse in appropriations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113, H.R. 2029) was signed into law on December 18, 2015, providing $3.3 billion for independent agencies in FY2016, including the CFTC. Division O of the Act included provisions related to financial regulators. Tables show the status of FSGG appropriations measures and the amounts enacted for FY2015 and FY2016. The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB as an independent agency funded by the Federal Reserve. The President's budget did not include changes or funds for the CFPB, but H.R. 2995 and S. 1910 addressed its status and funding. The legislative bills H.R. 2995 and S. 1910 proposed changes to the funding and leadership structure of the CFPB, including prohibiting fund transfers from the Federal Reserve and requiring regular reports to Congress. The Senate bill also suggested changing the CFPB's leadership to a five-person commission. P.L. 114-113 did not include these provisions. For more information on the CFPB, refer to CRS reports IF10031 and R42572. The CFTC oversees derivatives markets, including futures exchanges and swaps markets. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded CFTC jurisdiction to regulate previously unregulated swaps markets. Budgetary concerns have been raised about whether the CFTC has enough resources to handle its new responsibilities. The President's budget request for FY2016 was $322 million, a $72 million increase. The President's budget request for FY2016 for the CFTC was $322 million, an increase of $72 million from FY2015. The House Agriculture appropriations bill would have allocated $245 million, while the Senate FSGG bill would have allocated $250 million. P.L. 114-113 ultimately appropriated $250 million. For more information on the CFTC, see CRS Report R44231. The CPSC's mission is to reduce consumer harm from various products. The CPSC is responsible for creating safety standards, developing voluntary standards, banning unsafe products, monitoring recalls, educating consumers, conducting research, and collaborating with governments. Its funding has increased significantly since FY2007, reaching $123 million in FY2015. The CPSC received increased funding in FY2016 to support reforms from the CPSIA. The $129 million budget included funds for IT security, product testing, nanomaterial safety research, and expanding an import surveillance program. The budget proposal requested funding for the CPSC in FY2016, including allocations for hazard reduction, compliance, import surveillance, information technology, and agency management. The proposed import surveillance user fee would cover program costs. H.R. 2995 allocated $122 million for the CPSC in FY2016, slightly less than FY2015 and the budget request. The committee criticized the CPSC's limited report on safety measures. The committee expressed disappointment with the \"limited scope\" of a 2015 CPSC report on reducing testing burdens for third parties. H.R. 2995 aimed to allocate $1 million for actionable relief. Concerns were raised about proposed modifications to recall and disclosure procedures affecting companies' legal responsibilities. The Consumer Product Safety Commission proposed changes to make corrective action plans legally binding for companies conducting voluntary recalls. Legislation aimed to restrict funding for implementing these changes. Additionally, concerns were raised about accounting practices at the commission. The committee raised concerns about accounting practices at the Consumer Product Safety Commission, citing violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act since FY2014. They directed the commission to review safety standards for off-road vehicles and urged them to reduce the use of fire retardants in furniture. The committee directed the Consumer Product Safety Commission to review safety standards for off-road vehicles and reduce the use of fire retardants in furniture. Additionally, the commission was instructed to submit a report on safety standards and labeling requirements for protective headgear used in youth sports within 180 days of the bill's enactment. P.L. 114-113 allocated $125 million in appropriations for the CPSC in FY2016, with $1 million reserved for reducing third-party testing burdens. The act also prohibited the commission from implementing a proposed rule on off-road vehicle design requirements until a study by the National Academy of Sciences was completed. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) was established under the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to administer federal funds for election reform programs and voting machine certification. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) was established under the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to administer federal funds for election reform programs, accredit testing and certification of voting machines, distribute studies of election issues, and issue voluntary guidelines for voting systems standards. The EAC does not have new rulemaking authority under HAVA, but it took over responsibilities for the National Voter Registration Act from the FEC. The Department of Justice enforces HAVA, and there were discussions about potentially eliminating the EAC and transferring its functions to the FEC. The committee report highlighted that one of four commissioner seats at the EAC remains vacant, most of the $3 billion allocated for HAVA grants has been distributed, and no additional funds have been requested. The President formed a commission to address voter concerns instead of directing the EAC. The Senate Committee on Appropriations proposed $9.6 million for the EAC, with $1.5 million for NIST. P.L. 114-113 allocated $10 million for the EAC. The FCC, established in 1934, regulates communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. Its budget is funded by regulatory fees collected from license holders and other entities. The FCC requested $388 million for FY2016, while H.R. 2995 proposed $314.8 million, all from regulatory fees. The bill proposed $314.8 million for FY2016, derived from regulatory fees. It included provisions to restrict FCC rule implementation, regulate rates for Internet providers, and delay net neutrality order enforcement. Other provisions covered spectrum allocation, field office closures, media ownership, broadband access, and funding sources. The bill proposed retaining funds from spectrum auction activities for administrative expenses and relocating operations to reduce costs. It also included provisions related to FCC exemptions, broadband connectivity, call completion in rural areas, and improving commission transparency and technology. The P.L. 114-113 law allocated $384.0 million from regulatory fees for various reforms at the commission, including improving the national broadband map and universal service. It also extended exemptions for the Universal Service Fund and prohibited rule changes regarding single connection restrictions. The FDIC administers deposit insurance for banks funded through premiums, with the OIG funded through a direct appropriation. The FDIC OIG receives $34.6 million in appropriations to ensure independence. The FEC enforces campaign finance regulations and administers the presidential public financing system. FEC appropriations have been noncontroversial in recent years. For FY2016, H.R. 2995 and S. 1910 proposed appropriations for the FEC, with H.R. 2995 allocating $76.1 million, the same as requested and $8.6 million more than FY2015. S. 1910 allocated $72.5 million, $3.6 million less than requested but $5 million more than FY2015. The additional funding is partly due to the FEC's expiring lease at 999 E Street, NW, which will expire on September 30, 2017. $5 million of the funds is designated for lease expiration and replacement lease expenses. The agency's current lease at 999 E Street, NW, will expire on September 30, 2017. More than 90% of the FEC budget is allocated to salaries, rent, and information technology. P.L. 114-113 appropriated $76.1 million for the FEC in FY2016. Provisions in the House and Senate appropriations bills impact campaign finance regulations. The Senate bill includes provisions to prohibit reporting certain political contributions or expenditures as a condition of government contracting, amend FECA to allow unlimited coordinated expenditures by parties, and require electronic filing of campaign finance reports. P.L. 114-113 maintained prohibitions on additional contractor and SEC disclosures but excluded electronic filing and coordinated expenditure provisions. For more information on FEC and campaign finance issues, refer to CRS Report R41542 by R. Sam Garrett.

Its funding sources include direct appropriations, pre-merger filing fees, and Do-Not-Call Registry fees. The President requested $309.2 million for the FTC in FY2016, an increase from the previous year. The FTC's FY2016 budget request included $16.2 million in added funding, with allocations for maintaining operating levels, hiring new employees, and modernizing information technology infrastructure. The budget was divided into resources for protecting consumers and promoting business competition, with $175.0 million for consumer protection and $134.2 million for competition promotion. The FTC's FY2016 budget request included $175.0 million for consumer protection and $134.2 million for competition promotion. H.R. 2995 would have provided the FTC with total funding of $302.5 million in FY2016, slightly below the budget request. The committee raised concerns about deceptive marketing practices in the mobile consumer hotel booking market and urged the FTC to take appropriate action. The FTC committee urged the adoption of a comprehensive strategy to reduce consumer fraud in Hispanic and African American communities. They also emphasized the need to monitor FTC and CFPB activities to avoid unnecessary burdens on businesses and taxpayers. The proposed funding for the FTC in FY2016 was $300 million, slightly below the budget request. The FTC committee recommended a funding increase to $162 million for the commission to support cybersecurity initiatives and consumer financial security. They also encouraged efforts to address sports-related concussions and deceptive marketing practices. The FY2016 budget for the FTC was $307 million, with a net appropriation of $169 million after deducting fees. The General Services Administration (GSA) oversees federal civilian procurement policies for federal buildings, property disposal, and records management. It manages funding through the Federal Buildings Fund (FBF), which receives rental payments from agencies leasing GSA space. Congress allocates FBF revenue for construction, repairs, rentals, and other building expenses, with spending limitations set by Congress. The Federal Buildings Fund (FBF) is not allowed to exceed Congress-approved funding levels, even if there is excess revenue. Some debts can be paid with FBF funds. A negative total in the FBF occurs when available funds are less than expected revenue. GSA's operating accounts are funded separately from the FBF. Total GSA funding is the sum of FBF funds and direct appropriations. The President's FY2016 request was $10.4 billion. The President proposed $10.4 billion from the FBF for GSA's real property activities in FY2016, an increase from FY2015. The House recommended $8.4 billion, while the Senate recommended $8.3 billion, both lower than the President's request. Operating accounts funding also varied between the President's request and the House and Senate recommendations. The Senate committee recommended $254 million for GSA's operating accounts, $12 million less than the President requested and $14 million more than was provided for FY2015. P.L. 114-113 appropriated $10.2 billion from the FBF and provided $254 million for GSA's operating accounts. The Electronic Government Fund (E-Gov Fund) was merged with the Federal Citizen Services Fund (FCSF) in FY2015 to improve services and efficiency. In FY2015, the E-Gov Fund was combined with the FCSF to improve services and efficiency. H.R. 2995 would have appropriated $54.0 million to the newly merged FCSF, with $14.8 million for electronic government projects. S. 1910 proposed $55.9 million for the fund, while P.L. 114-113 allocated $56 million. The FSGG appropriations bill includes funding for agencies like the FLRA and MSPB.

The agency is funded through various appropriations bills, including the FSGG bill. The FLRA, excluding certain agencies for national security reasons, is composed of a three-member authority, the Office of General Counsel, and the FSIP. Members are appointed by the President to resolve disputes over bargaining units, unfair labor practices, representation elections, and labor negotiation impasses. The FLRA manages regional offices and the FSIP resolves labor negotiation impasses. The President requested $26.6 million for the FLRA in FY2016, with the House and Senate bills providing similar amounts. The MSPB protects the civil service merit system and adjudicates appeals. The President requested $47.4 million for the MSPB in FY2016. The MSPB requested $51.6 million for FY2016, citing the need for increased staffing due to potential budget reductions and upcoming retirements among employees. The MSPB requested $51.6 million for FY2016 to address staffing needs due to budget reductions and upcoming retirements. The President's budget requested almost $121 million for OPM salaries and expenses, including funding for federal investigations enhancements and strengthening the acquisition workforce. The OPM budget for FY2016 requested appropriations for trust fund transfers, OIG salaries and expenses, and FTE employment levels. The increased staffing would occur in various organizational components to support acquisition workforce effectiveness and management. The agency's budget request for FY2016 includes funding for ACA programs, MSAC audit functions, and administrative operations. The funding will support OPM's strategic plan, network upgrades, cybersecurity defense, and OIG's prescription drug audit program. It will also continue the FEHBP claims data warehouse initiative. The OIG will audit and examine Multi-State Plan Program records, review business practices, and report findings to OPM. The House-reported bill provided appropriations for OPM and OIG salaries and expenses, trust fund transfers, and encouraged recruitment efforts at Hispanic Serving Institutions and Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The House Committee directed OPM to prioritize retirement processing and provide monthly progress reports on addressing claims backlog. They also urged OPM to move towards a fully automated electronic filing system. The Senate-reported bill allocated appropriations for OPM salaries, trust fund transfers, and OIG expenses, with slight variations from the President's request. The committee also emphasized the need for updates on OPM's efforts to secure its IT networks following data breaches. The Senate report recommended $21 million in funding for IT security improvement as requested by the President, directing OPM to consult with various federal partners for financial management and cybersecurity expertise. OPM was also directed to provide updates on addressing retirement claims backlog and modernizing the retirement system. Additionally, the agency was instructed to submit a report on cost-of-living allowances and locality-based payments. The Senate Committee directed OPM to provide an estimate of the total number of current Federal annuitants who retired from the Federal civil service from 1994 to 2014 by each non-foreign area and by year of retirement. OPM was also directed to implement internal controls for security clearance investigations by contractors. Additionally, the Senate Committee requested a report on steps taken to prevent, mitigate, and respond to data breaches involving sensitive personnel records and information within six months after the FSGG Act's enactment. The Senate committee directed OPM to report on cybersecurity policies, oversight of IT contractors, and compliance with government-wide initiatives to improve cybersecurity. The OIG was encouraged to monitor technology infrastructure improvements and include cybersecurity information in its reports to Congress. Appropriations of $120.7 million were provided for OPM salaries. The GAO report highlighted that P.L. 114-113 allocated $120.7 million for OPM salaries and expenses, $124.6 million for trust fund transfers, $4.4 million for OIG salaries and expenses, and $22.5 million for OIG trust fund transfers, matching the President's request. Additionally, $2.5 million is designated for Federal investigations enhancements and $616,000 for strengthening the acquisition workforce. $21 million was allocated for IT security and infrastructure improvements, with OPM required to provide quarterly briefings on progress to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The Senate Committees on Appropriations reported progress on infrastructure improvements for network security and legacy system migration. OPM must consult with various agencies before using funds for modernization projects. Mandatory appropriations were provided for health benefits, life insurance, and retirement accounts. The estimated costs include $11.9 billion for employee health benefits, $49.0 million for employee life insurance, and $8.872 billion for annuitant payments. The explanatory statement for P.L. 114-113 outlined estimated costs for government payments, including $11.8 billion for employee health benefits, $55.0 million for employee life insurance, and $8.975 billion for the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. The law allowed OPM to use funds for resolving litigation related to the cost-of-living allowance program and required providing identity protection coverage to individuals affected by a data breach. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) is an independent federal agency focused on protecting federal employees from prohibited personnel practices, including reprisal for whistleblowing. The agency's budget for FY2016 was $24.1 million with an estimated FTE employment level of 146, an increase from the previous year. There was a projected rise in whistleblower disclosure, Hatch Act, and prohibited personnel practice cases. OSC's caseload was expected to increase significantly. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) requested funding to meet the rising demand for its services, protect whistleblowers in the VA and other agencies, and manage increasing case levels. The House and Senate bills provided appropriations close to the President's request, with the Senate bill slightly lower at $23.5 million. The Senate Committee expressed belief that OSC should apply its budget proportionally with the percentage of cases received from the VA. P.L. 114-113 provided $24.1 million in appropriations, the same as the President's request. NARA, known as \"the nation's record keeper,\" assists federal agencies in record collection and retention. The President requested $389.1 million for NARA in FY2016, $12.4 million more than FY2015.

The President's budget request for NARA in FY2016 was $389.1 million, with H.R. 2995 appropriating $385.7 million and S. 1910 appropriating $388.7 million. Senate appropriators emphasized the need for improved security and inventory controls for NARA's collections and urged efficient preservation and digitization of electronic records by Federal agencies. Senate appropriators encouraged NARA to digitize and post online archival records relocated due to facility closures. NARA must report to Congress on efforts to digitize physical collections moved between states and provide storage space for future records. Concerns were raised about Federal agencies' ability to manage electronic records effectively for oversight purposes. The Senate report directs NARA to improve oversight of records management by establishing a formal program for inspections and audits of federal agencies. $395.9 million was appropriated for NARA in P.L. 114-113, including $7 million for congressional collections. $21.2 million is allocated for debt reduction related to an archives facility construction.

The President requested no funding for FY2016, and no legislation included funding for the Recovery Board. The SEC administers federal securities laws to protect investors and maintain fair trading markets, with its budget set through the normal appropriations process. The SEC's budget is offset by fees collected from securities exchanges, which go directly to the Treasury Department. The agency adjusts its fees to remain deficit-neutral. The enacted appropriations for FY2014 was $1.35 billion, FY2015 was $1.5 billion, and the President requested $1.7 billion for FY2016.

The fund cannot exceed $100 million, with excess collections going to the Treasury Department general fund. H.R. 2995 would have also prohibited funding the reserve fund for the fiscal year. The House committee argued that the SEC should request necessary funding without access to reserve funding outside of Congressional review. P.L. 114-113 did not change the status of the reserve fund. The Selective Service System is an independent federal agency for conscripting personnel for military needs. All males aged 18-25 in the US must register with the SSS. In the United States, males aged 18-25 must register with the Selective Service System (SSS). The draft for military induction ended in 1972 and has not been reinstated.

The U.S. Postal Service generates almost all of its funding by charging mail users, with Congress providing annual appropriations for revenue forgone in providing free mailing privileges. The Revenue Forgone Reform Act of 1993 authorized appropriations for USPS to compensate for below-cost postal services to nonprofit organizations. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 changed the appropriations process, requiring budget requests from USPSOIG and PRC to go directly to Congress and OMB. The Revenue Forgone Reform Act of 1993 authorized appropriations for USPS to compensate for below-cost postal services to nonprofit organizations. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 changed the appropriations process, requiring budget requests from USPSOIG and PRC to go directly to Congress and OMB. Funding for USPS and USPSOIG comes from the PSF, while PRC's budget is treated separately. Advance appropriations are provided for USPS revenue forgone, with specific amounts allocated for different fiscal years. In FY2016, USPS requested $67.2 million as an advance appropriation for FY2017 costs related to free mailing privileges for the blind and overseas voters.

P.L. 114-113 renews postal policy provisions and allocates funding for the PSF and select construction projects. The P.L. 114-113 renews long-standing postal policy provisions, including requirements for six-day mail delivery, free mail for overseas voting and the blind, and prohibitions on charging fees for address requests and closing small post offices. The House bill also mandates USPS to report on increasing sales of a specific stamp. The President's FY2016 budget request aligns with these policies. The Administration proposes operational reforms to reduce Postal costs and improve revenue, including potential five-day delivery and changes to retiree benefits calculations and payments through FY2016. The President's budget proposes operational reforms for USPS to provide financial relief through 2016. The United States Tax Court received $51 million in FY2015, with a request for $54 million in FY2016. H.R. 2995 and S. 1910 would appropriate $51 million for FY2016. The FSGG Appropriations Act for FY2016 appropriated $51.3 million, which was $3 million less than the President's request and the same as the FY2015 enacted amount. The Act includes general provisions that apply government-wide, with most provisions being language that has been reiterated for several years. The Administration's proposed government-wide general provisions for FY2016 were included in the Budget Appendix, with new provisions addressing budget authority exceeding discretionary spending limits. The FY2016 Budget Proposal includes adjustments to discretionary spending limits due to estimating differences with the Congressional Budget Office. The use of appropriated funds to require disclosure of political contributions for federal contracts is prohibited. The Executive Order 13690 titled \"Establishing a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard and a Process for Further Soliciting and Considering Stakeholder Input\" is restricted in its implementation, except for specific purposes related to federal lands, construction, and land use activities. It cannot be used to modify the non-grant components of the National Flood Insurance Program or change the 'floodplain' criteria for issuing Department of the Army permits. The provision regarding the use of appropriated funds for abortions or administrative expenses under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is not in effect from October 1, 2016, to September 30, 2017. Exceptions apply in cases where the mother's life is endangered, or the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. H.R. 2995 also included three Cuba provisions. H.R. 2995 included provisions related to Cuba policy changes, with the House bill aiming to restrict funding for people-to-people educational travel to Cuba. However, these provisions were not included in the final legislation. Section 131 of S. 1910 aimed to prohibit funding for importing confiscated property by the Cuban government, specifically targeting alcohol and tobacco products. The Obama Administration's policy allowed for limited importation of these products. Section 132 would have restricted financial transactions with certain Cuban ministries and their officers, excluding transactions related to U.S. agricultural exports. The bill also included provisions to ease sanctions on financing for U.S. agricultural exports, travel, and shipping, while repealing the prohibition on financing. Section 638 of the bill aimed to repeal the prohibition on financing agricultural sales to Cuba, allowing for payment in advance or financing by third country financial institutions. Section 641 would have lifted restrictions on travel to Cuba, prohibiting funds from being used to restrict travel. Section 642 would have repealed a provision prohibiting vessels trading with Cuba from loading or unloading freight in the US within 180 days."
