    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2017\". The Government of China restricts access to Tibet for US citizens, imposes greater restrictions on travel to Tibetan areas, promotes tourism in Tibetan areas, and requires foreigners to obtain permission from the Tibet Foreign and Overseas Affairs Office. The Government of China imposes restrictions on travel to Tibet for US citizens, requiring permission from the Tibet Foreign and Overseas Affairs Office. Diplomatic access to the Tibet Autonomous Region is limited, with few requests granted and closely supervised visits. Consular access for the United States was delayed by China for over 48 hours in October 2013. In October 2013, after a bus crash in Tibet that killed three US citizens and injured others from California, China delayed consular access for over 48 hours, hindering US government assistance. In 2015, after an earthquake trapped US citizens in Tibet, the US Consulate General in Chengdu faced challenges providing emergency consular help due to lack of access. The Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2015 and 2016 highlighted the Chinese government's restrictions on visits to Tibet, with foreign diplomats facing denials and tightly controlled trips. Tibetan-Americans also reported discrimination in visa applications at Chinese embassies in the US. The Washington Post reported in September 2016 that visiting Tibet as a journalist is more difficult than visiting North Korea. The Chinese government has not responded positively to requests from the US to open a consulate in Lhasa, Tibet. Foreign reporters face restrictions in visiting the Tibet Autonomous Region, with permission rarely granted under 2008 rules. Foreign reporters face restrictions when trying to enter Tibet Autonomous Region. They must have permission, be accompanied by a government tour guide, and are rarely allowed to enter by road. Visits are limited around the March anniversary of a Tibetan uprising, and access is banned to Larung Gar, the world's largest Tibetan Buddhism study center. Foreign visitors, including journalists and Chinese diplomats, face restrictions when traveling in Tibetan areas outside the Tibet Autonomous Region. The United States generally allows Chinese citizens to travel freely within the country but requires diplomats to notify and sometimes obtain approval from the Department of State before traveling, which is usually granted quickly. The US regularly grants visas to Chinese officials, scholars, and others visiting to discuss and promote their perspectives. The Government of China restricts US citizens from traveling to Tibetan areas while Chinese diplomats freely travel in the US to lobby against resolutions on Tibet. China criticizes US officials for interfering in its internal affairs regarding Tibetan areas. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"appropriate congressional committees\" refer to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. \"Senior leadership positions\" are defined at both national and sub-national levels. The curr_chunk discusses individuals who are involved in policies related to access for foreigners to Tibetan areas, including members of the Communist Party Standing Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Director of the Tibet Autonomous Region Tourism Bureau, heads of United Front Work Departments of certain provinces, and others determined by the Secretary of State. The term \"Tibetan areas\" includes the Tibet Autonomous Region and areas designated as Tibetan Autonomous by the Chinese Government in Gansu and Qinghai Provinces. The Tibetan areas include regions in Qinghai, Sichuan, and Yunnan Provinces designated as Tibetan Autonomous by the Chinese Government. SEC. 4. ANNUAL REPORT. The Secretary of State must submit an annual report to Congress on the level of access granted to diplomats, journalists, and tourists from the United States in Tibetan areas compared to other areas of China, including any restrictions on travel freedom. The Secretary of State must submit an annual report to Congress on access in Tibetan areas, including measures restricting travel freedom and a list of senior leaders. The report will be publicly available on the Department of State's website. SEC. 5. INADMISSIBILITY OF CERTAIN ALIENS. Ineligibility for Visas: Individuals on the list under section 4(a)(2) cannot receive a visa to enter the US if specific official permission is required for entry into the Tibetan Autonomous Region or if there are greater travel restrictions in designated Tibetan Autonomous areas in China. The Secretary of State can revoke visas for individuals ineligible to enter the US due to travel restrictions in designated areas of China. Waivers may be granted for national interests. The Secretary of State can grant waivers for visa restrictions based on national security interests or international obligations. The Secretary must provide detailed justification to Congress for any waivers granted. Congress emphasizes the importance of reciprocity in visa policies between countries, ensuring equal consular access for diplomats. Specifically, the Secretary of State should consider China's treatment of U.S. diplomats when granting access to Chinese diplomats in the United States."
