This effort includes rebalancing, stabilization, and readiness initiatives to sustain the active and reserve Army for potential long-term warfare against terrorism. Key questions for Congress include the progress of the Army's modularity program, funding for the Future Combat System (FCS), and the impact of increasing soldiers on the modularity program. Additionally, concerns exist about the vulnerability of some Brigade Combat Teams to enemy armor. The U.S. Army is redesigning its force structure to smaller brigade-level modular brigade combat teams (BCTs) to better meet 21st-century security challenges. The 110th Congress's decisions on Army funding, modularity program, and Future Combat System (FCS) could have significant implications for national security and congressional oversight. The Army is implementing modularization to increase combat power, readiness, and joint interoperability, reduce deployment stress, and facilitate future network-centric developments. The Army is implementing modularization to increase combat power, readiness, and joint interoperability. The Department of Defense announced plans to increase the size of the Army and Marine Corps in 2007. The Army defined roles, designs, and numbers of support brigades in 2005, including Combat Aviation Brigade and Fires Brigade. The Army is implementing modularization to increase combat power, readiness, and joint interoperability. The Department of Defense announced plans to increase the size of the Army and Marine Corps in 2007. The Army defined roles, designs, and numbers of support brigades in 2005, including Combat Aviation Brigade and Fires Brigade. The Combat Support Brigade (Maneuver Enhancement) consists of 435 personnel with engineer, military police, NBC defense, and air defense units. The Battlefield Surveillance Brigade has 997 personnel with intelligence, support troops, and long-range surveillance detachment. The Sustainment Brigade has 487 personnel with medical, finance, human resources, ammunition, transportation, maintenance, and supply units. The Army plans to field various types of Functional Support Brigades in the active and reserve components, including Air Defense, Engineer, Military Police, Chemical, Military Intelligence, Signal, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Quartermaster, Medical, Logistics Regional Support Groups, Civil Affairs, and Psychological Operations. Commanders have noted that modular BCTs have improved interaction with other service's tactical elements and simplified command and control by eliminating \"multiple bosses.\" Additionally, modular BCTs have shown increased situational awareness for brigade commanders. The Army has identified areas for improvement in modular BCTs, including the need for additional earthmoving capability, armed reconnaissance squadron capability, intelligence analysis capability, engineer assault breaching and gap crossing capability, and greater bandwidth capacity for battle command systems. Commanders have also highlighted the positive impact of increased situational awareness and favorable comments on BCT staffs and combat support elements. The Army plans to evaluate combat experiences and make changes to personnel, equipment, and force structure as needed. The Army has made changes to BCTs and support units for force protection, navigational capability, physical site protection, convoy security, and IED protection based on lessons learned. A study by TRADOC suggests that IBCTs and SBCTs lack tactical lethality in early deployment, unable to achieve desired effects against main battle tanks. The Army has made changes to BCTs and support units for force protection, navigational capability, physical site protection, convoy security, and IED protection based on lessons learned. Proposed solutions to deficiencies in IBCTs and SBCTs include modifying tactics and developing better equipment. By FY2006, 31 active BCTs had been converted, with more in progress. The Army National Guard continued modular conversion of BCTs, with a total of 16 BCTs converting in FY2006. In FY2007, the Army accelerated the modular conversion of two BCTs, with plans for five BCTs to undergo conversion. The ARNG will also begin converting nine more BCTs. The President's FY2007 Budget Request included funding for modularity in FY2007 and beyond. The Army received $6.6 billion for modularity in FY2007 and an additional $34 billion between FY2008 and FY2011. Costs are spread among various programs, making it difficult to determine an exact figure. The FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act added $548.9 million for Army modularity, directing it towards refurbishing armored vehicles. Army cost estimates have increased significantly since 2004. In 2004, the Army allocated $8 billion for reserve component reorganization, increasing the total estimated cost to $28 billion. By 2006, the cost of modularity was revised to $52.5 billion, with $41 billion for equipment, $5.8 billion for military construction, and $5.7 billion for sustainment and training. Concerns arise over affordability with competing priorities like the Future Combat System and war costs. The Army faces challenges in funding modularity, the Future Combat System (FCS), and equipment reset due to competing priorities and cost growth. Despite program adjustments, skepticism remains about affordability, with the Army arguing for a larger share of defense resources based on historical spending levels. However, there is a lack of support for increasing military spending as a percentage of GDP, raising doubts about the Army's ability to secure additional resources. The Army's decision to convert to a modular force structure significantly increased the requirement for officers, particularly captains and majors. This has led to projected shortages in FY2007 and FY2008, which will be exacerbated by the creation of 48 BCTs and additional modular support brigades. The Army's shift to a modular force structure has increased the need for officers, leading to projected shortages in captain and major grades. Additional modular support brigades may worsen these shortages and impact the Army's ability to man BCTs and support units. Equipment shortages are also a concern, with significant increases needed for command, control, and communications equipment, wheeled vehicles, and artillery. The Army's shift to a modular force structure has led to projected shortages in officers, particularly in captain and major grades. Equipment shortages are also a concern, with significant increases needed for command, control, and communications equipment, wheeled vehicles, and artillery. The Army expects shortages in heavy trucks and command and control systems for modular units, especially in the Army National Guard. The stationing plan for active duty BCTs does not account for the proposed addition of 65,000 soldiers over the next five years, which may pose challenges in finding adequate facilities. The Army is facing difficulties in finding facilities for additional units due to ongoing initiatives involving policy, organizational, and personnel changes. This restructuring involves converting units to better align with current operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, impacting over 100,000 personnel. The Army is restructuring its units to align with operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, involving over 100,000 personnel. This initiative aims to increase capabilities, reduce stress on certain units, improve deployability, and transition to a unit-focused system for Active Component forces. The Army implemented a new readiness system in FY2006, called the Army Force Generation Model, to replace the old \"Tiered Readiness System.\" This model aims to provide stability to Army families, improve unit cohesion, and save money by reducing the number of soldier moves. Units will progress through three pools: reset/retrain, ready, and available, to ensure predictable availability of trained and equipped units for deployment. The Army's new readiness system, the Army Force Generation Model, consists of three pools: reset/retrain, ready, and available. Units progress through these pools to ensure a steady supply of fully-resourced Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) for deployment. The goal is to maintain 20 BCTs (14 Active and 6 Reserve) in the available pool continuously. The proposed increase of 65,000 soldiers in the Army may impact the modularity program. DOD officials suggest creating six additional active component BCTs, leaving 44,000 soldiers for other purposes. This could address personnel shortages in existing BCTs and support units. The proposed increase of 65,000 soldiers in the Army may impact the modularity program. Reports indicate shortages in equipment for current modular forces, raising concerns about the Army's ability to equip new units adequately. For example, a new heavy brigade combat team would require the procurement of 177 armored vehicles and 870 wheeled vehicles of all classes. The proposed increase of 65,000 soldiers in the Army may impact current and future basing plans, as new units will require additional training areas, barracks, motor pools, and family housing. This expansion could lead to a significant increase in equipment wear and tear, requiring more funds for reset and replacement. Additionally, the availability of necessary real estate and physical facilities may pose challenges in stationing these forces as intended. Infantry units, historically vulnerable to enemy armored forces, may face challenges even with anti-tank systems. Infantry and Stryker BCTs are vulnerable to enemy armored forces, especially when equipped with explosive reactive armor and active protection systems. Congress may examine potential changes to enhance their firepower and mitigate vulnerabilities. The Army believes it can afford modularity and the FCS program. The Army contends that it can afford modularity and the FCS program with an increased budget, but it is unlikely that the defense budget will rise to World War II levels as suggested. Congress may need to review the Army's assumptions to ensure realistic funding for these programs and assess the progress of rebalancing and stabilization initiatives critical to the Army's transformation. The Army's Force Generation Model of cyclical readiness is undergoing significant structural and cultural changes, with budgetary implications that may need further examination by Congress. This new model aims to maintain a force pool of 20 active and reserve BCTs at all times, impacting how units are staffed, equipped, and trained. Some argue that reducing readiness standards may be beneficial, but the budgetary and resource implications should be reviewed. Some argue that reducing readiness standards in wartime may be beneficial, but it can lead to under-resourcing of units in terms of personnel and equipment. This can create a discrepancy between the advertised \"48 brigade combat team Army\" and the actual number of soldiers and equipment available. CRS reports on Army transformation, military forces size, U.S. military dispositions, and defense FY2006 authorization and appropriations are available."
