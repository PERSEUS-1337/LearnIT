    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that Lyme disease is a common bacterial infection transmitted by tick bites. Early detection is crucial as it can cause serious health issues if left untreated, affecting various organs and systems. Lyme disease accounts for 90 percent of all vector-borne infections in the US, but ticks also spread other disorders like ehrlichiosis and babesiosis. Tick-borne diseases have been reported in 49 states, with 90 percent of cases in 10 states. The actual number of cases is estimated to be 10 times higher than reported. The poor surveillance of Lyme disease results in cases being approximately 10 times higher than reported, making treatment more difficult due to the persistence of symptoms in many patients without reliable testing. Establishment of a Tick-Borne Disorders Advisory Committee. Establishment of the Tick-Borne Disorders Advisory Committee to advise on interagency coordination, collaboration with other organizations, and responses to constituency groups regarding efforts to address tick-borne disorders. Membership includes appointed members.
