    "content": "The Act titled \"Fighting Medicare Payment Fraud Act of 2009\" aims to extend the number of days for Medicare claims to be paid in order to prevent fraud, waste, or abuse. The \"Fighting Medicare Payment Fraud Act of 2009\" amends Section 1816(c)(2) of the Social Security Act to extend the time for Medicare claims to be paid in cases of suspected fraud, waste, or abuse. The \"Fighting Medicare Payment Fraud Act of 2009\" allows for extended time for Medicare claims to be paid in cases of suspected fraud, with heightened scrutiny of claims during this period. The Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services will provide recommendations regarding the application of the \"Fighting Medicare Payment Fraud Act of 2009\" to the Secretary, who must respond within 60 days. There will be no review of the Secretary's implementation of this act. The Secretary will extend the timeframe for claims processing in cases of suspected fraud, waste, or abuse involving providers or suppliers. The Secretary may extend the time for processing claims up to 365 days for specific providers or suppliers or geographic areas, or as needed for clean claims scrutiny. The Secretary may implement heightened scrutiny of claims, with no review allowed. The amendments made by this section will take effect 6 months after enactment, with regulations potentially being effective immediately on an interim basis. The Secretary may implement heightened scrutiny of claims with no review allowed. If an interim final regulation is provided, a period of public comment will follow its publication, allowing for potential changes or revisions based on feedback."
