    "content": "The \"Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement (FIRE) Act\" aims to address the increased demands on firefighting personnel by providing Federal support for necessary fire safety precautions. This Act recognizes the critical need for financial resources to protect the health and safety of firefighters and the public, due to high rates of death, injury, and property damage caused by fires in the United States. The \"Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement (FIRE) Act\" authorizes the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to award competitive grants to fire departments for public and firefighter safety against fire hazards. Before granting funds, an office will be established to set criteria and manage the grants. Grant funds can be used for hiring additional firefighting personnel and training. The FIRE Act authorizes grants for fire departments to train personnel, create rapid intervention teams, certify fire inspectors, establish wellness programs, fund emergency medical services, acquire firefighting vehicles and equipment. The FIRE Act authorizes grants for fire departments to acquire equipment, modify facilities for safety, enforce fire codes, fund prevention programs, and educate the public on arson prevention. Grants require a 10% match with non-Federal funds and recipients must maintain expenditures. The Director may grant funds to fire departments under certain conditions, including maintaining expenditures at or above the average level of the previous two fiscal years and submitting a report on fund usage. Grants must be distributed to a variety of fire departments, including paid, volunteer, and combination departments. The Director may grant funds to fire departments, including paid, volunteer, and combination departments in communities of varying sizes. Limitations are set on the use of funds for firefighting vehicles and administrative costs. Grants can only be made if the fire department submits a required application. In this Act, \"firefighting personnel\" refers to individuals, including volunteers, who are firefighters, officers of fire departments, or emergency medical service personnel of fire departments as defined by the Director. SEC. 4. Authorization of appropriations: $1 billion authorized for the Director for fiscal years 2000 through 2005."
