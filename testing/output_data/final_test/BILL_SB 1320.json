    "title": "SB 1320",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature declares a $59 billion shortfall for state highway maintenance over the next 10 years. A report by the Reason Foundation in 2014 shows California's highway system ranks 45th in performance despite spending more than the national average on maintenance and administration. The Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office recommended holding Caltrans accountable for delivering SHOPP projects by requiring oversight from the California Transportation Commission. This includes approving SHOPP projects, allocating funds, and monitoring project delivery performance. Additionally, an amendment to Section 13975 of the Government Code establishes the Transportation Agency consisting of various departments. The California Transportation Commission oversees transportation projects and works independently within the state government. The Department of Transportation prepares plans for review by the commission. The Department of Transportation prepares a state highway operation and protection program for review by the California Transportation Commission. The program includes capital improvements for maintenance, safety, and rehabilitation of state highways and bridges, with projects limited to those not adding new traffic lanes. It also outlines projects to be advertised before July 1 of the following year and construction to begin within four fiscal years after submission. The Department of Transportation submits a proposed state highway operation and protection program to the California Transportation Commission every even-numbered year by January 31. The program includes details such as capital and support budgets, projected delivery dates for project components, and involves review and comments from transportation planning agencies before submission. The department provides detailed information on programmed projects to the commission, including cost, scope, and schedule. The commission reviews the proposed program for adequacy, consistency with the asset management plan, funding priorities, and impact on the state transportation improvement program. The commission must adopt the program and submit it to the Legislature and Governor by April 1 of each even-numbered year, but may decline if it is not consistent with the asset management plan. The commission reviews and approves individual projects submitted by the department for the state highway operation and protection program. Expenditures for these projects are not subject to certain sections of the Streets and Highways Code. Any changes in project cost, scope, or schedule must be approved by the commission before implementation. Section 14534.1 of the Government Code is repealed. Section 14534.1 of the Government Code is repealed, giving the commission independent authority to perform duties prescribed by law."
