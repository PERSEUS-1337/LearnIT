The Act \"Vaccinate America's Children through Complete Information & Education Act of 2015\" amends Section 1928 of the Social Security Act to require states to certify administrative procedures for granting nonmedical exemptions from state immunization requirements. The Act \"Vaccinate America's Children through Complete Information & Education Act of 2015\" mandates states to establish procedures for granting nonmedical exemptions from state immunization requirements, which are exemptions not based on medical reasons. Parents seeking a nonmedical exemption must discuss the consequences before it is granted. The Act mandates states to establish procedures for granting nonmedical exemptions from immunization requirements. Parents seeking an exemption must discuss the consequences with a pediatrician or primary care provider, sign a form discussing the risks, and submit a notarized letter to the State. The State requires a notarized letter from parents explaining the reasons for seeking a nonmedical exemption from immunization requirements. Exemptions are granted for one year and must be renewed annually. Failure to comply may result in penalties for the State. The State shall pay the Secretary 5 percent of the value of pediatric vaccines provided, based on whether the State is a manufacturer or not. The State is required to pay the Secretary a certain amount for pediatric vaccines provided, and any payment made will be considered an overpayment to the State. This overpayment will be deducted from the State's regular quarterly draw for all spending under section 1903(d)(2) of the Social Security Act. Additionally, there are conforming amendments to section 1928 of the Social Security Act related to these payments. The amendments made by this Act involve changing subsection references in various sections of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The effective date for these changes is one year after the enactment of the Act."
