The \"Utilizing DNA Technology to Solve Cold Cases Act of 2011\" allows familial searches for DNA samples collected from crime scenes in Federal and State investigations, ensuring privacy protection for individuals identified in these searches. Familial searches by the FBI are allowed under specific circumstances: when no match is found in the offender index for a DNA sample from a crime scene, and the investigation involves serious offenses like murder, kidnapping, or crimes against minors. The FBI allows familial searches in CODIS under certain conditions, such as when no match is found for a DNA sample from a crime scene for serious offenses like murder, kidnapping, or crimes against minors. States requesting a familial search must have procedures in place as required by the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. States requesting familial searches in CODIS must have a written policy in place that establishes criteria and procedures for requesting and evaluating familial matches, consistent with regulations issued by the Attorney General. The policy must also ensure the privacy interests of individuals identified in familial searches are protected. Additionally, each time a familial search request is made, the policy must be made available to the Attorney General.

The Attorney General must report annually on familial search compliance, including search requests, matches found, and case statuses. Regulations for this section must be issued within a year of the Act's enactment, defining terms like \"CODIS State administrator\" and \"familial search.\" The offender index contains DNA samples from individuals convicted of sex offenses and violent crimes. A familial match is determined by the Attorney General to show a high probability of familial relation between a DNA profile in the index and a sample collected at a crime scene. The term \"State\" refers to various regions including the several States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other territories."
