    "content": "In this study, artificial neural networks were used to study the optimality of evolutionary design in olfactory circuits. The networks replicated key structures of the olfactory system, such as glomeruli formation and sparse connectivity. The findings provide insights into the evolutionary convergence of olfactory circuits and shed light on the anatomic and functional organization of the olfactory system. The olfactory system in flies and mice has been extensively mapped, revealing a two-layered structure with compression and expansion layers. Olfactory perception begins with odorant recognition by a variety of receptors in the sensory epithelium. In fruit flies, individual olfactory receptor neurons express specific receptors that converge onto projection neurons through olfactory glomeruli, establishing a one-to-one mapping between receptors and neurons. The olfactory system in flies and mice has a two-layered structure with compression and expansion layers. Odor information is conveyed from olfactory receptors to Kenyon Cells through sparse connectivity, before being classified by mushroom body output neurons. Synaptic plasticity at the KC-MBON synapse is crucial for odor learning. The architecture of the olfactory circuits in flies and mice is similar, with numerical differences in the number of receptors, glomeruli, and neurons. This shared architecture across different organisms suggests its optimality for odor sensing. The olfactory system in flies and mice has a two-layered structure with compression and expansion layers. Odor information is conveyed through sparse connectivity before being classified by mushroom body output neurons. To study optimal circuit design, an artificial neural network is trained to classify odors, allowing for analysis of the anatomical and functional structures that emerge. This approach leverages the simplicity of the fly olfactory circuit and our extensive knowledge of its anatomy to gain insight into evolutionary design. Anatomy provides constraints for evolutionary design insights. A simple odor classification task is used with 100 odor prototypes activating 50 olfactory receptors each. Ground-truth class is based on Euclidean distance in the ORN space. Training set has 1 million odors, validation set has 8192 odors. Networks connections are modified to classify odors accordingly. Standard training techniques are employed. The olfactory system is modeled as a layered feed-forward network with specific neuron quantities in each layer. Connections between layers represent synaptic strengths, and neuron activities represent firing rates. The architecture simplifies MBONs into class neurons for outcome representation. Several biological structures are omitted for simplicity, including interneurons and a realistic readout. Initial connections between neurons in each layer are not specified. After training, the network achieves 83% accuracy in odor classification. Connections between ORNs and PNs resemble the convergence of ORNs expressing the same OR onto glomeruli in the olfactory system. PNs sample exclusively from ORNs expressing the same OR, indicated by a high GloScore. KCs are initially connected to all 50 PNs, and during training, the model's ORN-PN connectivity quickly approaches a GloScore of 1. After training, KCs evolve to randomly sample from PNs, with connections sparsening and correlations decreasing to resemble randomly shuffled connectivity. This supports high-dimensional representations for downstream readout neurons to learn associations. During training, KCs in the network sample uniformly from all PNs without preferential connections. Extensive hyperparameter testing showed robust results, except for learning rate affecting weight separation. The highest learning rate allowing for over 50% classification accuracy was used. Results were also robust to biologically realistic network motifs. In a network with excitatory and inhibitory connections, PNs mix from multiple ORs while maintaining accuracy. The network evolves to preserve odor information by minimizing correlation between PNs. Networks with fewer than 2500 KCs should bias the PN layer to mix ORs and increase dimensionality for downstream expansion. Training networks with variable numbers of KCs while keeping ORNs and PNs fixed at 500 and 50, respectively, showed promising results. The study varied the numbers of KCs, ORNs, and PNs in a network model. Decreasing KCs led to PNs sampling from multiple ORs, with marginal benefit beyond 2500 KCs. Excess PNs receiving mixed OR input did not improve task performance, suggesting a saturation point. Having fewer than 50 PNs caused information flow bottlenecks and mixing to ensure representation of all ORs. The study analyzed the optimal expansion layer input degree for olfactory systems with varying numbers of ORs, showing a power law relationship between them. Experimental estimates suggest an optimal input degree of 40-100 for a system with 1,000 unique ORs. The study analyzed the optimal input degree for olfactory systems with varying numbers of ORs, showing a power law relationship. Experimental estimates suggest an optimal input degree of 40-100 for a system with 1,000 unique ORs, with a hypothesis that this power-law maximizes robustness to perturbations in connection weights. This robustness is crucial for variability in synaptic transmission and between individuals of the same species. The study focused on quantifying the robustness of olfactory systems by measuring the angle between odor representations before and after perturbation. Results showed that the perturbation angle is minimized at around K = 7, indicating a more robust network. Optimal K values derived from maximal robustness closely matched results from direct training of networks. The study trained artificial neural networks to classify odors, finding that glomeruli emerged in the PN layer and sparse random connectivity in PN to KC connections. The formation of glomeruli did not depend on input noise but on the presence of an expansion layer downstream. An expansion layer with a synaptic degree of 7 provided robustness to the olfactory system. The work offers a framework to explain the Optimal K predicted by maximal weight robustness and direct training."
