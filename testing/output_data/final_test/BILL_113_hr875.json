    "content": "SECTION 1. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The term \"mid-level ethanol blend\" refers to an ethanol-gasoline blend containing 10 to 20 percent ethanol by volume for use in various engines and vehicles. The Administrator, through the Assistant Administrator of the Office of Research and Development at the EPA, must enter an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences for a comprehensive assessment of mid-level ethanol blends compared to gasoline blends with 10% or no ethanol. A report must be submitted to specific committees within 30 days of receiving the assessment results. The Administrator must submit a report to committees on the assessment findings and the Administrator's agreement or disagreement with them. Any waivers allowing mid-level ethanol blends before the Act's enactment are void, and no new waivers can be granted until after the report is submitted. The assessment includes evaluating environmental, safety, durability, and performance effects of mid-level ethanol blends. The evaluation will assess the environmental, safety, durability, and performance effects of mid-level ethanol blends on various engines, vehicles, and equipment. It will consider the impacts of different ethanol concentrations as a certification fuel and their effect on carbon emissions compared to gasoline blends. The evaluation will review scientific evidence, government, and industry data to make informed conclusions. The evaluation will assess the environmental, safety, durability, and performance effects of mid-level ethanol blends on engines, vehicles, and equipment. It will identify gaps in understanding and research needs related to various aspects such as tailpipe emissions, evaporative emissions, engine durability, fuel efficiency, consumer education, and cost-effectiveness. The evaluation will identify research needs to ensure existing motor fuel infrastructure is not impacted by mid-level ethanol blends and to reduce misfueling risks in the distribution and supply chain. This includes examining potential impacts on materials used in pipes and storage tanks, as well as strategies to prevent misfueling at various points in the distribution process. The evaluation will focus on strategies for blender pumps, including purchase and labeling requirements, assessing misfueling mitigation plans, and examining technical standards for fuel pump labeling from various organizations. The Administrator will utilize up to $900,000 from EPA funds for science and technology, including research and development activities, to carry out the Act."
