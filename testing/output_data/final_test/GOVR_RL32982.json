    "content": "The connections between trade and migration have existed for centuries. The Immigration Act of 1924 recognized the link between trade and migration, allowing aliens to enter the US for trade purposes. Today, foreign nationals known as \"treaty traders\" and \"treaty investors\" can still enter the US under similar provisions. Free trade agreements also raise broader immigration issues. Free trade agreements (FTAs) raise questions about provisions for immigration between countries and the impact on future migration. The debate includes whether movement of people, like temporary workers, is part of FTAs. Some FTAs, like the U.S.-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), do not have explicit immigration provisions but still spark discussions on migration effects. This report discusses immigration law elements relevant to trade-related immigration and recent FTAs affecting U.S. immigration law. The report discusses the interaction between trade and migration in the context of FTAs, highlighting key policy questions. It emphasizes the division of authority between the legislative and executive branches in setting immigration policies, as well as the importance of bilateral or multilateral agreements in trade negotiations. Congress shares authority with the executive branch in regulating commerce, with the latter taking the lead in negotiating trade agreements under specific conditions. The Immigration Amendments of 1965 replaced the national origins quota system with per-country ceilings, shifting U.S. immigration policy to be country-neutral. Unlike trade negotiations, bilateral and multilateral agreements are rare in U.S. immigration policy. Congress retains authority over immigration law, not the executive branch. Foreign nationals seeking temporary entry to the United States are known as nonimmigrants. There are 24 major nonimmigrant visa categories, with 72 specific types of visas issued. Visa categories are designated by letter and numeral in the Immigration and Nationality Act. E-1 treaty trader and E-2 treaty investor visas are available to citizens of countries with which the U.S. maintains a commerce treaty. Foreign nationals can apply for E visa if they are citizens of a treaty country with the US. They must show intent to engage in substantial trade or direct operations of an enterprise they have invested in. The E visa can be renewed indefinitely, and substantial trade is defined as a continuous flow of international trade items between the US and the treaty country. Treaty trader status cannot be based on a single transaction. The regulations for E visas require substantial trade or investment in a bona fide enterprise. Principal trade is defined as over 50% of international trade volume between the US and the treaty country. Investors must have control of funds and be involved in developing and directing the enterprise. B-1 nonimmigrants are visitors for business with specific activities allowed. The difference between a business visitor and a temporary worker depends on the source of the alien's salary. Business visitors must receive their salary from abroad and not from a U.S. source, except for expenses. Intracompany transferees on L visas must be in executive, managerial, or specialized knowledge roles. The regulations define \"specialized knowledge\" as special knowledge possessed by an individual of the petitioning organization's product, service, research, equipment, techniques, management, or other interests and its application in international markets, or an advanced level of knowledge or expertise in the organization's processes and procedures. The major nonimmigrant category for temporary workers is the H visa, which includes professional specialty workers (H-1B) and nurses (H-1C). There are also visa categories for importing seasonal workers, such as agricultural workers with H-2A visas. The H visa program allows for temporary workers, including agricultural workers with H-2A visas and professional workers with H-1B visas. There are numerical restrictions on annual admissions for various visa categories, such as H-1B, H-2B, and H-1C visas. Employers must conduct an affirmative search for available U.S. workers and obtain certification from the Department of Labor before admitting alien workers. The H-2A visa has additional requirements aimed at protecting domestic workers. The H-2A visa program has requirements to protect alien workers and prevent domestic workforce displacement. Employers must offer wages based on the adverse effect wage rate. Employers of H-1B workers must attest to paying prevailing wages and providing suitable working conditions. Employers recruiting H-1C nurses must also attest to certain conditions. Employers recruiting H-1C nurses must attest to taking significant steps to recruit and retain U.S. registered nurses. Labor market tests are not required for firms bringing L intracompany transfers or foreign nationals with B-1 business visas. The United States does not have open borders or freedom of movement agreements with other countries. The United States does not have open borders or freedom of movement agreements with other countries. However, there are immigration provisions in existing FTAs that regulate the temporary entry of business persons, including specific language on temporary professional workers and intra-corporate transfers in agreements like GATS and NAFTA. The NAFTA provisions allow for temporary entry of business persons from Canada, Mexico, and the United States for activities related to research, design, production, marketing, sales, distribution, and other services. This includes business visitors, traders, and investors. The NAFTA agreement allows for temporary entry of business persons from Canada, Mexico, and the United States for various business activities. This includes professionals in supervisory or executive roles, intracompany transferees, and certain categories of professionals seeking to engage in business activities at a professional level. The agreement does not allow for numerical limits or labor market tests for intracompany transferees, but there was a 10-year limitation on Mexican professionals entering the US under the TN category, which expired last year. The TN category requires specific credentials for aliens to qualify, with employers certifying their qualifications for professional positions. Legislation implementing the Chile and Singapore FTAs created the H-1B-1 visa for professional workers, similar to the H-1B visa but with a focus on specialized knowledge. Labor attestation requirements were also added for employers under the FTAs. The laws amended INA to add labor attestation requirements for FTA professional worker nonimmigrants, similar to H-1B requirements. P.L. 108-77 and P.L. 108-78 set numerical limits for new entries from Chile and Singapore. FTA professional workers have no annual renewal limit, unlike H-1B workers limited to six years. FTA workers count against the H-1B cap upon entry and renewal after the fifth year. The FTA professional worker visa allows foreign nationals to work in the U.S. indefinitely without requiring labor certification or numerical limits on intracompany transfers from Singapore or Chile. The Australian FTA does not have explicit immigration provisions, but a provision in the FY2005 appropriations bill includes related measures. The U.S. foreign aid legislation (H.R. 1268, P.L. 109-16) includes a provision for 10,500 visas for Australian nationals under a new E-3 temporary visa. The U.S.-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) was signed in 2004 but requires approval from all seven countries' legislatures. Unlike other FTAs, DR-CAFTA does not have explicit immigration provisions. Trade theory views trade and migration as substitutes. Trade theory views trade and migration as substitutes, with the assumption that a country with abundant and inexpensive labor can choose to export labor-intensive goods or its workers. The theory also suggests that trade liberalization can increase the migration of knowledge-based workers. The similarities in economies of trading partners, such as development level and economy size, play a role in determining the relationship between trade and migration. Studies have shown conflicting results on whether trade and migration are complements or substitutes. According to various authors, free trade could impact migration flows in different ways, such as reducing, increasing, or having no visible effect. This report examines the impact of trade agreements on migration from three perspectives: temporary workers and business personnel with top trading partners, NAFTA's effect on knowledge-based worker migration between the US and Canada, and NAFTA's impact on permanent migration from Mexico. The volume of trade with top trading partners correlates with migration patterns. The volume of trade with the United States' top trading partners correlates with the number of foreign nationals entering the country with business-based visas. This relationship holds true regardless of whether the US has a free trade agreement (FTA) with the country. The data shows a strong positive relationship between trade and temporary admissions, indicating a clear link between FTAs and the issuance of E visas for treaty traders and investors. The use of E visas by foreign nationals from the United States' top trading partners, Canada and Mexico, accelerated after the implementation of FTAs in 1989 and 1994. In 2004, U.S. issuances of E visas to Mexicans exceeded Canadian issuances for the first time. Concerns were raised about a potential \"brain drain\" from Canada due to trade liberalization, but others argued that labor flows are essential for economic integration. Ten years after the Canada-United States FTA, skilled workers migrated to Canada, benefiting from professional and technical skills acquired in the United States. Professor Steven Globerman noted an increase in Canadian professionals coming to the US on TC/TN visas. The number of Canadian professionals coming to the United States on TC/TN visas increased by 3,000 to 4,000 visas annually. There was also a rise in bilateral flows of L intracompany transfers. Globerman observed an upward trend in temporary migration of business and professional workers between the US and Canada post-Canada-United States FTA. Permanent migration patterns remained consistent in the 1980s and 1990s. During the 1980s and 1990s, permanent migration between the United States and Canada remained consistent. Trade liberalization had little impact on this migration flow. There was a shift in the composition of immigration, with more professional and managerial workers moving to the US. Some believed that NAFTA would reduce illegal migration from Mexico by improving the Mexican economy. The U.S. International Trade Commission's 1991 report suggested that NAFTA would slightly decrease the wage gap between the United States and Mexico, leading to a decline in migration from Mexico to the United States. However, others argued that NAFTA could destabilize the Mexican economy, resulting in unwanted migration. The International Migration Commission recommended a U.S.-Mexican free trade agreement in 1990 to address the push factors for illegal migration. It emphasized that expanded trade and development were long-term solutions to unauthorized migration, despite acknowledging that development could initially increase migration due to raised expectations. The \"migration hump\" model proposed by Professor Philip Martin suggests that migration levels would initially increase after NAFTA implementation before decreasing over time. Martin predicted that after about 15 years, migration levels would return to pre-NAFTA levels, and after 30 years, migration would be significantly lower. He concluded in 2002 that NAFTA would reduce unauthorized Mexico-US migration in the long term by making trade a substitute for migration. The March Supplement of the Current Population Survey provides limited data on Mexico-US migration trends by year of arrival, showing a bias towards more recent migration due to underrepresentation of earlier migrants. Trade is predicted to become a substitute for migration in the long term. The surge in Mexican-born residents in the United States post-1995, influenced by factors like the peso devaluation, job growth in the U.S., and changes in INA provisions allowing more Mexicans to exceed per-country limits for legal permanent admission. Mexico remains a top sender of LPRs. In 2001-2003, Mexico was the top country for legal permanent residents (LPRs) in the U.S. Unauthorized migration, mainly from Mexico, is influenced by job opportunities in the U.S. and lax enforcement of employer sanctions. Tighter border enforcement may not necessarily reduce unauthorized migration. Some researchers suggest that stricter immigration enforcement, like the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, may have unintentionally increased the number of unauthorized resident aliens. The increased penalties and border enforcement have made crossing the border more difficult, leading to a higher incentive for those who successfully enter the U.S. to stay. Additionally, post-9/11 changes in immigration laws have slowed down the processing of immigrant petitions and visas. The economic recession in 2001 and slow rebound may have slowed down migration. Congress considered migration trends from DR-CAFTA countries when passing legislation. Migration from DR-CAFTA countries is historically smaller than from Mexico. In 2004, there were 2.7 million foreign-born U.S. residents from DR-CAFTA countries compared to 10.7 million from Mexico. Migration from Costa Rica was minimal with only 53,000 Costa Rican-born residents in 2004. Migration from DR-CAFTA countries has fluctuated over the past decades due to various factors like political instability and natural disasters. Trade and immigration issues raise policy questions, with some concerns about FTAs liberalizing immigration laws. Some argue that the USTR exceeded its authority by including immigration provisions in FTAs, particularly concerning temporary professional nonimmigrants. There are concerns that workers from Chile and Singapore have less stringent standards than H-1B laws due to recent FTAs. Proponents claim that these agreements align with current immigration policies and are crucial for U.S. economic growth. The USTR has added labor attestations, education/training fees, and numerical limits to FTAs in response to congressional concerns. The temporary business personnel provisions in FTAs are not considered immigration policy as they only impact temporary entry. This issue has sparked controversy in WTO negotiations, with developing countries criticizing visa restrictions on temporary workers entering the U.S. and calling for more transparency in U.S. immigration policy. The U.S. business community argues for greater flexibility in offers. The U.S. business community advocates for more flexibility in trade offers to secure commitments from developing countries. Some suggest linking FTAs to immigration enforcement agreements, with varying opinions on measures to curb migrant flows to the U.S. Some argue for including immigration enforcement measures in FTAs, while others believe it is not the role of the USTR and should be handled by other federal departments. Proponents see FTAs as a way to reduce unauthorized migration, citing DR-CAFTA as an example of \"good immigration policy.\" Some argue that FTAs should be evaluated based on the terms of the agreement, not their impact on unauthorized migration. They believe that trade liberalization can improve economies in migrant-sending countries, reducing the push factors for migration. However, others argue that FTAs may actually trigger new migration, including illegal migration, for at least a generation. This additional migration could stimulate traditional family-based immigration to the United States. The March Supplement of the Current Population Survey provides limited data on migration by year of arrival for non-Mexican foreign-born residents in the United States. The data may underestimate earlier migration trends due to emigration and death of earlier migrants, leading to a biased upward trend line. Migration to the United States dropped after the September 11, 2001 attacks due to revisions in immigration laws and economic recession. Residents arriving after 1995 closely follow the trend of those arriving before 1996."
