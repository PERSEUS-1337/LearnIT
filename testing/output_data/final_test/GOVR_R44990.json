    "content": "In the past, Congress has regularly extended temporary tax provisions known as \"tax extenders.\" The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 addressed 33 expiring provisions, with 18 being energy-related. Thirteen energy tax provisions that had expired in 2016 were extended through 2017 but remain expired. These provisions offer incentives for renewable electricity, alternative fuels, vehicles, building energy efficiency, and other energy activities. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act of 2015 extended tax provisions, making some permanent and others extended through 2016 or 2019. Energy-related provisions were generally extended for two years, with longer-term extensions for certain renewables in Division P of the law. The renewable electricity production tax credit (PTC) for wind was extended through 2019, with a phaseout starting for facilities beginning construction in 2017. The investment tax credit (ITC) for business solar was extended through 2019, with changes in deadlines and reduction percentages based on construction start dates. Residential solar tax credit was extended through 2021, with a phaseout starting in 2020. The BBA18 extended various energy tax provisions through 2021, including the ITC for nonsolar technologies and five-year cost recovery for ITC-eligible and wind property. The tax credit for residential energy-efficient property was also extended with a phaseout in 2020 and 2021. Additionally, the law extended the per-barrel excise tax on oil to fund the oil spill liability trust fund. The law extended the per-barrel excise tax on oil to fund the oil spill liability trust fund and modified tax credits for advanced nuclear power facilities and carbon dioxide sequestration. Congress has options to consider regarding temporary provisions, with the 2017 tax revision providing new context for extending expired temporary tax provisions. The revised tax system became effective in 2018, raising questions about the place of expired provisions in the new system for the 115th Congress to consider. The 115th Congress may consider extending expired tax provisions in the new tax system. The extensions could be retroactive for the 2018 tax year and could be short term, long term, or permanent. Options include allowing expired provisions to remain expired. Table 1 provides cost information for extending expired energy tax provisions. The renewable electricity PTC is a per-kilowatt-hour credit for qualified energy resources. Eligible facilities can claim the tax credit for the first 10 years of production. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was enacted in 1992 as part of the Energy Policy Act and has been regularly extended since then. Eligible resources include wind, closed-loop biomass, and geothermal for full credit, while others receive half credit. Nonwind facilities must have started construction before January 1, 2017, to qualify for the tax credit. The Investment Tax Credit (ITC) in lieu of the Production Tax Credit (PTC) was introduced in 2009 alongside Section 1603 grants. This option has been extended in recent years through \"tax extenders\" legislation to promote renewable energy development. The PTC, enacted in 1992, aims to promote renewable energy sources, with subsequent extensions reflecting its importance in environmentally friendly power development. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has been extended multiple times to support renewable energy infrastructure development. Most recently, the PTC was extended for nonwind technologies in 2016 through 2017. Previous extensions were included in the PATH Act of 2015 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. The rationale for supporting renewable energy resources is to promote the development of mature infrastructure. Tax-related federal financial support for mature technologies and environmental considerations are key rationales for providing tax incentives for renewable electricity production. Some argue that ongoing support for renewables can address inefficiencies and market failures in energy production markets, while others suggest imposing a price on pollution instead of subsidizing nonpolluting alternatives. There are three tax credits for biodiesel: the biodiesel mixture credit, the biodiesel credit, and the small agri-biodiesel producer credit. Each gallon of biodiesel, including agri-biodiesel. The tax credits for biodiesel include the biodiesel mixture credit, biodiesel credit, and small agri-biodiesel producer credit. Each gallon of biodiesel may be eligible for a $1.00 tax credit, with the mixtures credit being proportionate to the fraction of biodiesel in the blend. The tax credits expired on December 31, 2017. Additionally, a small agri-biodiesel producer credit of 10 cents per gallon is available for qualified production. The small agri-biodiesel producer credit is available for individuals with annual productive capacity not exceeding 60 million gallons, with a limit of 15 million gallons for the credit. It is effective from August 8, 2005, to December 31, 2017. Renewable diesel is eligible for a $1.00 per gallon tax credit, but cannot qualify as agri-biodiesel. These biodiesel tax incentives were introduced under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and extended through BBA2018. Tax credits for biofuels aim to reduce dependence on petroleum imports, address environmental concerns, and support farm incomes. However, it is unclear if these tax incentives are driving the increase in biofuel use. Renewable fuel standards and blend mandates may be the main drivers of domestic biofuel production. If nontax policies are responsible for this growth and tax policies do not induce additional production, the tax credits may result in windfall gains for taxpayers without increasing biofuel usage. The tax code includes credits for alternative fuels, such as a 50-cents-per-gallon excise tax credit for certain alternative fuels used in motor vehicles. The tax code includes credits for alternative fuels, such as a 50-cents-per-gallon excise tax credit for certain alternative fuels used in motor vehicles, motor boats, or airplanes. Qualifying fuels include liquefied petroleum gas, P Series fuels, compressed or liquefied natural gas, liquefied hydrocarbons derived from biomass, and liquefied hydrogen. No fuel produced outside of the United States is eligible for the alternative fuels tax incentives. Tax credits for alternative fuels, introduced under SAFETEA-LU, have been extended through 2017 in BBA2018. The incentives aim to reduce petroleum imports, address environmental concerns, and support farm incomes. A 30% tax credit is available for qualified alternative fuel vehicle refueling property, limited to $30,000 for businesses and $1,000 for residences. Clean fuel refueling property includes equipment like pumps for fuel dispensing. Tax credits for alternative fuels, extended through 2017, aim to reduce petroleum imports, address environmental concerns, and support farm incomes. A 30% tax credit is available for qualified alternative fuel vehicle refueling property, limited to $30,000 for businesses and $1,000 for residences. Clean fuel is defined as ethanol, methanol, natural gas, LNG, hydrogen, biodiesel, and electricity. The credit for business property is part of the general business credit and can be carried back one year or carried forward 20 years. The credit for alternative fuel vehicle refueling property, introduced under EPACT05, can be claimed by the seller for property sold to a tax-exempt entity. The credit has been extended multiple times since 2005 and aims to attract investment by reducing after-tax capital costs. Additionally, federal incentives may also promote investment in this property. Federal incentives can promote investment in alternative fuel vehicle refueling property, but special tax credits for certain technologies may lead to economic inefficiencies by encouraging investments in high-cost technologies. However, these incentives can improve resource allocation if they correct market failures. The second generation biofuels producer credit offers a nonrefundable income tax credit of $1.01 per gallon of qualified second generation biofuel production. The cellulosic biofuel producer credit, introduced by the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, offers a tax credit for second generation biofuels produced in the United States, including algae-based fuels. The credit was extended as part of \"tax extenders.\" Tax credits for second generation biofuels aim to reduce dependence on petroleum imports, address environmental concerns, and support farm incomes. The incentive was extended through 2017 in BBA2018, allowing for immediate first-year bonus depreciation of 50% for facilities producing eligible biofuels. This includes nonethanol fuels from cellulosic feedstocks, previously excluded from bonus depreciation. The special depreciation allowance for second generation biofuel plant property was introduced by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. It was extended through 2017 in BBA2018, allowing for immediate first-year bonus depreciation of 50% for facilities producing eligible biofuels. This incentive may distort resource allocation but can also increase economic efficiency by addressing market failures. Fuel cell vehicles may qualify for a federal tax credit. Fuel cell vehicles that use alternative technology (such as combining oxygen with hydrogen to create electricity) may qualify for a federal tax credit based on vehicle weight. Vehicles weighing 8,500 pounds or less can receive a base credit amount of $4,000, while heavier vehicles may be eligible for larger credits, up to $40,000 for vehicles weighing over 26,000 pounds. Cars and light trucks can also qualify for an additional tax credit of $1,000 to $2,000 per vehicle based on fuel economy. The alternative technology vehicle tax credit was enacted as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and replaced a previous clean-fuel-vehicle deduction. The tax credit for fuel cell vehicles was available for vehicles placed in service from 2006 to 2014, while credits for other alternative technology vehicles generally expired in 2009 or 2010. Tax incentives for fuel cell vehicles have been extended through 2017 in BBA2018 to address market failures in automobile markets. The credits for alternative fuel vehicles generally expired in 2009 or 2010, except for fuel cell vehicles. These incentives aim to reduce the price barrier and high upfront costs associated with adopting alternative-technology vehicles. Tax credits for fuel cell vehicles aim to address market failures and barriers such as high upfront costs, fuel price volatility, technology risks, and lack of infrastructure. While tax credits reduce vehicle prices, they may not be the most efficient way to tackle negative externalities and market barriers. Rising gas prices have been more effective in driving consumer demand for alternative technology vehicles. Directly taxing gasoline, the source of the negative externality, could be a more economically efficient approach. Tax credits for two-wheeled plug-in vehicles were available in 2015 and 2016, equal to 10% of the vehicle's cost up to $2,500. Vehicles must meet specific criteria to be eligible. The provision was initially set to expire in 2011 but was extended through 2013 for two- and three-wheeled vehicles. Tax credits for two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles were initially available in 2015 and 2016, equal to 10% of the vehicle's cost up to $2,500. The provision was extended through 2017 in BBA2018. These credits support emerging technologies and encourage energy-efficient vehicle purchases. Concerns have been raised about the equity of these tax benefits, as they are mostly claimed by high-income taxpayers. Before 2017, contractors and manufacturers of energy-efficient homes were eligible for a tax credit of $2,000 per home for contractors and $1,000 per manufactured home. Homes had to meet specific energy efficiency criteria and be in accordance with the 2006 International Energy Conservations Code. Certification was required before claiming the credit, which could be carried back one year and carried forward 20 years. This tax credit was introduced under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The tax credit for energy-efficient new homes, introduced in 2005, was extended through 2017 to incentivize builders to use energy-efficient technologies. Market prices may not accurately reflect the value of these improvements, leading to underinvestment without the credit. A deduction is also allowed for energy-saving property in commercial buildings. The tax credit for energy-efficient new homes was extended through 2017 to incentivize builders. A deduction is allowed for energy-saving property in commercial buildings, including interior lighting, heating, cooling, ventilation, hot water systems, and building envelope upgrades. The property must reduce energy costs by 50% compared to a reference building. The maximum deduction is $1.80 per square foot, with a reduced deduction available for single-system upgrades that do not meet the 50% reduction threshold. Entities can allocate the Section 179D deduction to designers of energy-efficient commercial building property. The deduction was initially available for 2006 and 2007, extended through 2008, and further extended for five years in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Congress recognizes the significant energy consumption in commercial buildings and the multi-year process of their design and construction, justifying the long-term extension of the deduction. The Congress believes a long-term extension of the deduction for energy efficient commercial buildings is necessary to ensure buildings in the design phase can claim the deduction. Short-term extensions have been included in \"tax extenders\" legislation since 2014, most recently extended through 2017 in BBA2018. The objective is to promote an economically efficient level of investment in energy-saving property, but market outcomes may lead to less investment in building energy efficiency than is socially desirable due to negative external costs associated with energy consumption. Federal financial assistance, such as tax incentives, may be needed to address market inefficiencies in building energy consumption. While tax deductions can help, a direct price on pollution might be a more economically efficient policy. The deduction for energy-efficient commercial property is mostly claimed by taxpayers constructing new buildings, as the energy-efficiency threshold is tied to recent standards. The nonbusiness energy property tax credit provides homeowners with a nonrefundable tax credit for investments in high-efficiency energy property and energy-efficiency improvements. Meeting certification requirements for the tax credit can be costly and burdensome, but it helps prevent fraudulent claims. The nonbusiness energy property tax credit offers homeowners a nonrefundable tax credit for energy-efficient property improvements. The credit was capped at a specific amount, subject to a lifetime limit of $500 per taxpayer. Introduced in the late 1970s, the credit expired in 1985 but was reinstated temporarily in 2006 and 2007. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 reinstated and modified the Section 25C credit for the 2009 tax year, further extended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for two years. The credit equaled 30% of qualified expenditures for energy-efficiency improvements and energy property, with a lifetime cap raised to $1,500 for 2009 and 2010. The credit was extended through 2017 by the PATH Act of 2015 and BBA2018. The 25C credit's impact on investment is uncertain, with some researchers suggesting it leads to additional investment while others believe it mainly benefits credit recipients. The nonrefundable nature of the incentive limits its effectiveness for low- and middle-income taxpayers. Compliance issues have been identified in the administration of residential energy-efficiency tax credits. The special tax incentive for the sale of transmission assets allows for the recognition of gain over eight years, rather than in the year of sale, providing a deferral of tax liability. This incentive was enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and is available for sales made through December 31, 2017. The tax provision for the sale of transmission assets, enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, encourages the unbundling of electricity assets to improve transmission management and promote a more competitive industry. The tax provision for the sale of transmission assets, enacted in 2004, aims to improve transmission management and promote competitive electricity markets. This provision has been extended through 2017 in BBA2018. The restructuring of the electric power industry may lead to significant reorganization of power assets, including transmission assets, which could trigger income tax liabilities and interfere with industry restructuring. The tax provision for the sale of transmission assets, enacted in 2004, aims to improve transmission management and promote competitive electricity markets. This provision has been extended through 2017 in BBA2018. The restructuring of the electric power industry may lead to significant reorganization of power assets, including transmission assets, which could trigger income tax liabilities and interfere with industry restructuring. Capital gains on the sale of depreciable assets involve specific rules, with sales of personal property taxed partly as capital gains and partly as ordinary income. The credit for Indian coal production provides a tax credit for coal produced from reserves owned by an Indian tribe or held in trust by the United States. The production tax credit (PTC) for Indian coal was added by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, allowing a credit for coal sold to third parties between 2005 and 2013. The credit was extended through 2016 to encourage mining on Indian lands and has been further extended as part of \"tax extenders.\" The PATH Act extended the production tax credit for Indian coal through 2016, removing certain requirements and exempting it from the alternative minimum tax. The credit was further extended through 2017 in BBA2018. Proponents argue it compensates Indian coal producers for regulatory challenges and promotes investment and job creation on Indian lands, while concerns include environmental and social impacts of coal-fired power."
