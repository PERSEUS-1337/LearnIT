    "content": "Congress generally uses an annual appropriations process to fund discretionary spending programs. However, Congress may be constrained by previously enacted legislation when making funding decisions. The distinction between appropriations authorized by law and unauthorized appropriations is significant for understanding how agencies can spend appropriated funds. The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse by requiring expenditures to be made only in accordance with appropriations made by law. Legislation for government expenditures must adhere to the same requirements as any other measure, determined by congressional rules and practices. Congress distinguishes between policy and funding measures through rules limiting appropriations to authorized purposes. An authorization defines government authority to act, while an appropriation provides budget authority for specific purposes. Authorizations establish policies and restrictions, while appropriations allow agencies to incur obligations and make payments. The distinction between authorizations and appropriations is crucial in government funding measures. The distinction between authorizations and appropriations has been practiced long before formal recognition in rules, likely derived from earlier British and colonial practices. Early Congresses accepted the practice of considering appropriations separately. This distinction was reflected in \"supply bills\" containing budget authority for multiple purposes. Including substantial new legislative language in early bills was seen as inappropriate, as it could delay necessary funds or enact laws that might not otherwise pass. The distinction between authorizations and appropriations dates back to early Congresses, with supply bills initially drafted with blanks for dollar amounts. The formal rule prescribing the separation of authorizations and appropriations originated in 1835 during the 24th Congress to address delays in enacting appropriations caused by including debatable matters. John Quincy Adams suggested stripping measures of non-appropriation items before consideration. The House and Senate rules regarding unauthorized appropriations originated in the 24th Congress in 1835 to address delays in enacting appropriations. The rule stated that no appropriation should be included in general appropriation bills without prior authorization by law. The Senate adopted a similar rule in 1850, prohibiting amendments proposing additional appropriations unless for existing law provisions. These rules have evolved over time but still guide both chambers today. The House and Senate rules on unauthorized appropriations pertain to general appropriations bills. In the House, these bills cover multiple agencies but not continuing appropriations acts, while in the Senate, they include both supplemental and continuing appropriations acts. This process formalizes funding decisions as a two-step process, with legislation to establish or continue federal entities enacted first, followed by funding legislation. The distinction between authorized and unauthorized appropriations is based on technical issues related to legislation defining legal authority for federal agencies and their relationship to applicable appropriations. This distinction has been largely determined by House and Senate rules, with authorization laws historically being permanent and not requiring periodic appropriations action. The distinction between authorized and unauthorized appropriations is based on the legal authority for federal agencies. Authorized appropriations follow explicit language defining the authority, while unauthorized appropriations lack such authority or have expired. Additional distinctions may depend on whether the program's statute explicitly authorizes appropriations. The statutory authority to administer a program or activity provides implicit authorization to appropriate funds, even without explicit authorization of appropriations. The interaction between authorizations and appropriations can be influenced by the specificity of the authorization. Some statutes place limits on the amount authorized for a class of programs or activities. Clause 2(a)(1) of House Rule XXI states that appropriations must be authorized by law before being included in a general appropriation bill. This rule ensures that budget authority falls within prescribed limits and that expenditures are for public works already in progress. The House considers an appropriation authorized if the relevant statute provides broad or specific authority for the project or activity, even if the authorization is not as detailed as the appropriation. General grants of authority can support appropriations depending on the laws applicable to the function or department. The authorization of appropriations must be specific and in line with the enabling statute. Permanent authority in the statute is sufficient unless a periodic authorization scheme has been enacted. Appropriations exceeding authorized amounts are considered unauthorized. An authorization for appropriations must be specific and in line with the enabling statute. Appropriations exceeding authorized amounts are considered unauthorized. An authorization can also be provided by a ratified treaty. Congress enacting appropriations for an unauthorized project does not authorize future appropriations. An executive order alone is not a valid authorization of appropriations without proof of derivation from a statute. Rule XXI, Clause 2(a)(1) allows appropriations for \"public works and objects already in progress\" to continue. This exception is narrowly applied to cases of \"general revenue\" funding. The House Manual states that 'public works and objects already in progress' include tangible matters like buildings and roads, but not duties of officials or indefinite works. This exception does not apply to projects governed by an expired authorization or not yet under construction. Examples of allowed continuations include topographical surveys and boundary markings, but not scientific investigations or extensions of foreign markets. Unauthorized appropriations are enforced through points of order raised by Members during consideration of appropriations bills. Points of order against unauthorized appropriations in general appropriations bills can be raised by Members during consideration. If sustained, the provision is removed from the bill, allowing the bill's consideration to continue. In the House, points of order are automatically reserved for provisions in general appropriations bills, while points of order against amendments must be allowed by the chair. Points of order must be raised during the reading of the bill for amendment, before any amendments to the relevant paragraph are offered. In the House, points of order must be raised during the reading of the bill for amendment, before any amendments to that paragraph have been offered. The burden of proof is on the manager to demonstrate that the appropriation is authorized. Unauthorized appropriations may be waived by unanimous consent, suspension of the rules, or special rule. In the House, points of order must be raised during the reading of the bill for amendment. The burden of proof is on the manager to demonstrate that the appropriation is authorized. Special rules may waive points of order against provisions in the bill or amendments with unauthorized appropriations. The Senate interprets \"authorized by law\" more broadly than the House. The Senate requires authorizations to be previously enacted or passed during the current session of Congress before considering general appropriations bills. Authorization can be in the form of existing laws, treaties, acts, resolutions, or estimates submitted in accordance with the law. Treaty provisions or simple resolutions may also serve as valid authorizations in the Senate. The Senate requires authorizations to be previously enacted during the current session of Congress before considering general appropriations bills. Authorizations can be broad or specific, with limits on budget authority. Appropriations must be proposed in accordance with law, such as in the President's budget request. The President's budget request is submitted to Congress for authorization. Amendments for appropriations not otherwise authorized do not need to be printed in advance if within the estimated limit. Unauthorized appropriations are prohibited by Senate Rules. The Senate Rules prohibit unauthorized appropriations in certain circumstances, particularly focusing on amendments offered by individual Senators during consideration of a general appropriations bill. Amendments from the House-passed text or Senate Committee on Appropriations are not subject to points of order. Amendments with unauthorized appropriations from the authorizing committee are allowed if reported and referred to the Committee on Appropriations in advance. The Senate rules prohibit unauthorized appropriations, especially for amendments offered by individual Senators during consideration of a general appropriations bill. Points of order can be raised to challenge unauthorized appropriations, with the burden of proof on the Member to show authorization. Amendments from the House or Senate Committee on Appropriations are not subject to points of order. Amendments with unauthorized appropriations from the authorizing committee are allowed if reported and referred to the Committee on Appropriations beforehand. Appropriation is authorized without a specific act preceding it. The existence of a statute imposing functions on an agency is sufficient legal authorization for necessary appropriations. Congress can appropriate funds for a program not previously authorized, carrying its own authorization for obligation and expenditure. Congress may appropriate money for programs with expired authorizations of appropriations, as long as there is legislative history showing intent for the program to continue. The Government Accountability Office states that funding an expired program is legally sufficient unless there is evidence of contrary congressional intent. For example, programs authorized in the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 have received appropriations despite expired authorizations. Despite expired authorizations, programs like the Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2003 have been funded by Congress, including in FY2011. Agencies can use these funds as long as they are spent for the intended purposes. Some statutes, like 10 U.S.C. Section 114(a), require specific authorization before funds can be appropriated for certain activities. Congress may choose not to fund certain programs or activities, even if authorized by law. Lack of appropriation can be intentional or due to other reasons. Despite expired authorizations, programs have been funded by Congress, allowing agencies to use the funds for intended purposes. Congress has the power to limit or deny funding to federal agencies for specific activities, even if authorized by law. Without appropriations, agencies cannot use funds allocated for other purposes to carry out unfunded activities. This allows Congress to directly restrict agencies from engaging in certain activities by withholding funds. Federal agencies have statutory duties and obligations outlined in authorizing statutes, including enforcement of laws they are responsible for. Federal agencies have statutory obligations outlined in authorizing statutes, which remain in effect even if funding is insufficient. If a statutory obligation involves entitlement to funds, lack of appropriations will prevent spending, but funds may be recovered through a lawsuit. The failure of Congress to appropriate funds does not negate government obligations created by statute. Statutory entitlements can be enforced through lawsuits, as seen in the case of United States v. Langston where a plaintiff successfully sued for the full amount owed despite insufficient appropriations. The Court emphasized that an unqualified right to compensation should not be affected by subsequent enactments that reduce funding. In City of Los Angeles v. Adams, the court considered a case where appropriation acts limited grant funds below authorized amounts. The court held that grant funds can be limited below authorized amounts by subsequent Congresses, even though appropriations should not amend general laws. The effect of a new law on existing rights must be assessed case by case, with some instances where appropriations omissions or repeals do not affect vested obligations. The court ruled that agencies must adhere to the original statutory scheme when distributing funds, with limitations imposed by appropriation measures. Some authorizing measures make federal funds conditional on appropriations, limiting the government's liability. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit clarified that the \"subject to availability of appropriations\" language prevents recipients from claiming entitlement to full funding as a right."
