    "content": "The \"Regional Skills Alliances Act of 2001\" aims to address the lack of financial support for training high-skilled workers in small businesses, the shortage of IT workers, and the need for specialized skills in underserved communities. Regional skills alliances bring together businesses and educational institutions to develop effective training programs for workers. The term \"Secretary\" in this Act refers to the Secretary of Labor. The Act authorizes skill grants in Title I. The Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, awards grants to consortiums of businesses, labor organizations, and government entities to improve job skills for specific industries. Eligible entities must include at least 5 businesses or a lesser number employing 30% of industry employees in the region. The Secretary awards grants to consortiums of businesses, labor organizations, and government entities to improve job skills for specific industries. Priority is given to entities where a majority represent small-business concerns. Grants awarded may not exceed $1,000,000 per fiscal year. SEC. 102. USE OF AMOUNTS. The Secretary may award a grant to an eligible entity under section 101 for improving job skills necessary for industry employment. The entity can conduct programs including assessing training needs, developing skill standards, curriculum, and technology-based training. The eligible entity awarded a grant can improve job skills by purchasing training equipment, identifying training providers, developing apprenticeship programs, training programs for workers, training plans for businesses, and expanding membership. Performance outcome measures for the program and training providers must be developed and tracked. The eligible entity awarded a grant can use up to 10 percent of the amount for administrative costs associated with the program. SEC. 103. REQUIREMENT OF MATCHING FUNDS. The Secretary may not award a grant under section 101 to an eligible entity unless the entity agrees to provide non-Federal contributions of at least $2 for every $1 of Federal funds, with $1 from participating businesses and $1 from the State or local government. Equipment donations to shared facilities can count towards the contribution requirement. In-kind contributions cannot be used to meet the requirement. The Secretary may consider donations in ranking applications for grants under section 101, to comply with the contribution requirement. Title II of the document authorizes planning grants for States to assist businesses, organizations, and agencies in forming consortia. Grants awarded cannot exceed $500,000 per fiscal year. The Secretary is authorized to appropriate $50,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2004, with additional funds as needed in subsequent years. Title II authorizes planning grants for States to form consortia. States must submit an application to receive a grant, agree to provide matching funds, and authorize $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2002."
