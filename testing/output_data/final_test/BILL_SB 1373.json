    "title": "SB 1373",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Amendment to Section 11323.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code requires necessary supportive services for program participants, including paid child care for those with dependent children under 10 years old or with special needs. Paid child care is available for participants with dependent children aged 11 or 12. Former recipients can receive necessary child care services for up to two years. Children in foster care or receiving federal benefits are considered dependent children for this purpose. Transportation costs for child care participants are governed by regional market rates and a standard allowance is provided at the beginning of each month. The provision of care and payment rates are regulated by specific sections of the Education Code. Participants in educational activities may receive a standard allowance of $500 if full-time or $250 if part-time, for expenses like books and tools. Reimbursement for transportation costs can be claimed monthly through mail, in person, or online. Participants can opt out of the standard allowance for books and supplies and claim reimbursement for actual costs. Personal counseling is available for participants facing personal or family issues affecting their welfare-to-work plan. The county may provide case management and supportive services to former participants who become employed for up to 12 months if needed to retain employment. The department can implement this act through an all-county letter by April 1, 2017, with no appropriation from Section 15200 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by this act, as per the Government Code."
