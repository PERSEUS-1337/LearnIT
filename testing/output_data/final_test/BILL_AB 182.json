    "title": "AB 182",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The purpose of this act is to address vote dilution and discrimination in voting in California, ensuring compliance with the state constitution and the 14th Amendment. It aims to eliminate minority vote dilution and is consistent with a previous court decision. The act adds a new heading to the Elections Code. The act aims to address vote dilution and discrimination in California elections, adding new articles to the Elections Code to regulate At-Large and District-Based Elections. District-based elections must not impair the ability of protected classes to elect candidates of their choice. A violation of Section 14040 is established if racially polarized voting occurs in elections for the governing body of a political subdivision or in elections with other electoral choices. Elections before filing an action are more significant in proving racially polarized voting than those after the action is filed. The occurrence of racially polarized voting is determined by analyzing election results involving candidates or ballot measures affecting protected classes. The election of preferred candidates from protected classes to governing bodies is a factor in determining violations. Geographic dispersion of protected classes does not prevent finding racially polarized voting. Factors such as history of discrimination, use of electoral devices, denial of access to support, effects of past discrimination, and racial appeals in campaigns are considered in determining violations of Section 14040 regarding racially polarized voting. The fact that a district-based election was imposed on a political subdivision as a result of legal action shall not be a defense to a violation of the law. If a court orders a political subdivision to adopt a district-based election system, there is a presumption that it does not violate the law, but this only applies to the specific system approved by the court and not if district boundaries are adjusted. This provision applies to systems approved on or after January 1, 2016. Upon finding a violation of Sections 14040 and 14041, the court must implement a district-based elections system for the protected class to elect candidates from single-member districts. If additional districts are not feasible, the court may order remedies like increasing the governing body's size or approving a coalition-based election system for protected classes with political cohesion. In enforcing Sections 14040 and 14041, the court may order district-based elections or remedies like increasing governing body size. Prevailing parties may recover attorney's fees and litigation expenses. Any voter in a protected class residing in a political subdivision where a violation of Sections 14040 and 14041 is alleged can file a court action in the county's superior court. If any provision of this article is deemed invalid, it will not affect other sections or applications."
