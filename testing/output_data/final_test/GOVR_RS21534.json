    "content": "Oman, located along the Arabian Sea, has a history of independence since expelling the Portuguese in 1650. The Al Said monarchy, established in 1744, expanded Omani influence into East Africa. Sultan Qaboos bin Sa'id Al Said, the eighth in the monarchy, became sultan in 1970 with British support. The United States established relations with Oman early on, signing a Treaty of Amity and Commerce in 1833. Oman has a history of independence since expelling the Portuguese in 1650. Sultan Qaboos bin Sa'id Al Said became sultan in 1970 with British support. The United States established relations with Oman early on, signing a Treaty of Amity and Commerce in 1833. Oman sent an official envoy to the United States in 1840. A U.S. consulate was maintained in Muscat during 1880-1915, and a U.S. embassy was opened in 1972. Sultan Qaboos was accorded formal state visits by several U.S. Presidents. Ambassador Marc Sievers has been in Oman since late 2015. Sultan Qaboos holds multiple key positions in the government. Omani society reflects diverse backgrounds, with potential candidates for a formal Prime Minister position including Fahd bin Mahmud Al Said, Sayyid Badr bin Hamad Albusaidi, Salim bin Nasir al-Ismaily, and General Sultan bin Mohammad al-Naamani. This is in addition to ongoing political reform issues. The question of succession in Oman is a key issue as Sultan Qaboos has no heir apparent. The succession process involves a \"Ruling Family Council\" of about 50 male members from the Al Said family. Leading contenders to succeed Qaboos include three brothers who are cousins. The succession issue has gained prominence since Qaboos underwent cancer treatment in 2014-15. The potential successors to Sultan Qaboos in Oman include three brothers who are cousins of the Sultan: Sayyid Haythim bin Tariq Al Said, Asad bin Tariq Al Said, and Shihab bin Tariq Al Said. Another potential choice is Fahd bin Mahmud. Sultan Qaboos is credited for establishing consultative institutions and electoral processes in Oman. The Oman Council, comprising the Consultative Council and State Council, was established by the Basic Law. The Council has expanded powers but cannot draft legislation or overturn the Sultan's decrees. Unlike other GCC states, formal political parties are not allowed in Oman, and political societies have not developed. The electoral process has broadened over time, with the Consultative Council initially chosen through a government-influenced selection process. The Oman Council, established in 1991, initially had government influence over its composition but transitioned to full popular elections. It started with 59 seats and now has 85. The Consultative Council chairman was chosen by the Sultan until 2011 when elections were introduced. Municipal councils also had elections in 2011, with provinces electing members based on population. The electorate for the Consultative Council has gradually expanded, with direct elections starting in 2000. In 2003, voting rights were extended to all citizens over 21 years old in Oman. About 195,000 Omanis voted in the election with a 74% turnout. In 2007, public campaigning was allowed for the first time, and about 250,000 people voted with a 63% turnout. The State Council in Oman is all-appointed and serves as a counterweight to the Consultative Council. In 2010, 50 prominent Omanis petitioned Sultan Qaboos for a \"contractual constitution\" that would provide for a fully elected legislature. Protests broke out in 2011 in Sohar and Muscat, with calls for a fully elected legislature. One person was killed by security forces. In February 2011, one person was killed by security forces during protests in Oman. Many protestors supported Sultan Qaboos's rule, while older Omanis compared the current political space favorably to the restrictive policies of Sultan Said bin Taymur. The government calmed the unrest in mid-2012 through reforms and punishments, including empowering the Oman Council and appointing new ministers. The Sultan of Oman responded to unrest by implementing various measures such as creating public sector jobs, increasing the minimum wage, and pardoning arrested individuals. The U.S. reaction was subdued, possibly due to Oman's alliance with the United States. In January 2018, small protests focused on job opportunities rather than political reform, leading the government to announce plans to create 25,000 jobs for Omani citizens. The government in Oman reiterated a plan to create 25,000 jobs for Omani citizens and banned new visas for expatriate workers in 87 private sector professions. The Consultative Council elections in October 2011 saw increased interest with 1,330 candidates applying to run, including a record 77 women. Voter turnout was about 60%, and only one female candidate was elected. Two political activists were victorious, and a young entrepreneur was selected as the speaker of the Consultative Council. The Sultan appointed 15 women to the State Council, increasing female participation to over 10%. In Oman, the government increased female participation in the Council to over 10%. Elections for 11 municipal councils were initiated in 2012, with 192 seats up for election. Four women were elected. The Consultative Council, expanded to 85 seats, had 20 female candidates in the last elections. In the 2011-2012 unrest, 20 female candidates participated in Oman's elections. Turnout was estimated at 56% of eligible voters. Only one woman was elected to the Council, with Khalid al-Mawali reelected as chairman. In 2015, 13 out of 84 State Council members were women. In the 2016 municipal elections, 23 out of 731 candidates were women, with 7 women elected. The next Consultative Council elections are scheduled for fall 2019. The State Department report on human rights in Oman highlights issues such as limits on freedom of speech, torture of prisoners, censorship of Internet content, and criminalization of LGBT conduct. The government is credited with holding security personnel accountable for abuses, but the Sultan chairs the Supreme Judicial Council. An \"Oman Human Rights Commission\" investigates prison conditions. State Department funds support human rights initiatives in Oman. The U.S. has used various accounts to promote civil society, judicial reform, election management, media independence, and women's empowerment in Oman. The government limits freedom of speech and press, with criticism of the Sultan and senior officials not tolerated. A royal decree in 2014 allows for revocation of citizenship for joining \"harmful\" groups. Oman issued a decree in 2015 prohibiting dissemination of certain information. Oman issued a new royal decree prohibiting dissemination of information targeting the State's authorities' prestige or weakening confidence in them. Dissident bloggers and cyber-activists have been prosecuted under this decree. In 2017, the Al Zaman independent daily newspaper was permanently closed for articles accusing senior judicial officials of corruption. Private ownership of radio and television stations is allowed, but there are few privately owned stations. Internet usage faces legal and practical restrictions, with many sites blocked for sexual content. Access to foreign broadcasts is possible through satellite dishes, and some Omanis bypass restrictions using cell phones. Omani law allows freedom of association with restrictions. A 2014 decree allows citizenship revocation for joining harmful groups. Associations must register with the Ministry of Social Development. Oman is a destination for forced labor and sex trafficking. In 2008, Oman was upgraded from Tier 3 to Tier 2/Watch List for efforts against trafficking. In 2008, Oman was upgraded to Tier 2/Watch List for efforts against trafficking. In 2016 and 2017, Oman was downgraded back to Tier 2 due to lack of increased anti-trafficking efforts. However, in 2018, Oman was upgraded to Tier 2 again based on increased efforts in investigating, prosecuting, and convicting traffickers, providing care to victims, and implementing a new national action plan. Oman's labor rights include the right to form unions and strike, with the General Federation of Oman Trade Unions being the government-backed federation. The Ministry of Manpower regulates labor rights, allowing collective bargaining and prohibiting retaliation against union activities. Some occupations are exempt from the minimum wage requirement. Oman also has a high degree of religious tolerance, with a significant percentage adhering to the Ibadhi sect of Islam. \"Islam is centered in Oman, East Africa, Algeria, Libya, and Tunisia. Ibadhism is sometimes mistaken for a Sunni sect but has its own beliefs. Ibadhis believe in a just Muslim society and choose religious leaders based on knowledge and piety. A long-term rebellion led by the Imam of Oman, the leader of the Ibadhi sect, ended in 1959. About 5% of Oman's population are Shiite Muslims, who can resolve family and personal cases according to Shiite jurisprudence. Recent reports show no societal abuses or discrimination based on religion in Oman.\" Non-Muslims in Oman are allowed to worship at designated places of worship, but there are restrictions on proselytizing and religious gatherings outside of approved locations. All religious organizations must be registered with the Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs. Various non-Muslim sponsors are recognized, including the Protestant Church, Catholic Diocese, Hindu Temple, and Sikh community. Buddhists can worship in private spaces. People of all religions can maintain connections with coreligionists abroad and travel for religious purposes. Plans are in place to address overcrowding in some non-Muslim places of worship by constructing a new building for Orthodox Christians. The government of Oman has approved new worship space for Baptists and is constructing a new building for Orthodox Christians with separate halls for Syrian, Coptic, and Greek Orthodox Christians. Sultan Qaboos has emphasized the importance of Omani women in national development, with women now making up over 30% of the workforce and holding ministerial positions. Private media in Oman have occasionally published anti-Semitic cartoons. Oman's ambassadors to the United States and the United Nations are women. Omani women face social discrimination due to the interpretation of Islamic law, with allegations of spousal abuse being common. Oman's foreign policy under Sultan Qaboos diverges from its GCC allies, focusing on mediation in regional conflicts and refraining from direct military involvement. Oman joined the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State but did not conduct airstrikes against the group. Oman's foreign policy under Sultan Qaboos diverges from its GCC allies, focusing on mediation in regional conflicts and refraining from direct military involvement. Oman did not join the Saudi-led Arab coalition fighting the Iran-backed Houthi forces in Yemen and opposed the isolation of Qatar in 2017. Sultan Qaboos has not attended any annual GCC summits since 2013 due to health reasons. Oman's foreign policy differs from its GCC allies, focusing on mediation in regional conflicts and avoiding direct military involvement. Oman opposed a 2012 Saudi proposal for political unity among GCC states and has not attended annual GCC summits since 2013 due to health reasons. Oman's stance on engagement with Iran as a mediator in regional conflicts has positioned it uniquely within the GCC. Oman's unique foreign policy stance includes positive sentiments towards Iran, demonstrated by Sultan Qaboos's visits to Tehran despite U.S. and GCC criticism. Oman's citizens, mostly Ibadhis, are not receptive to Sunni or Shiite Islamist appeals, reducing concerns about Iranian meddling in Oman's affairs. This approach contrasts with its GCC allies and emphasizes mediation in regional conflicts. In 2014 and February 2017, Rouhani visited Oman as part of Iran's effort to engage with the GCC. Oman and Kuwait tried to involve other GCC countries in talks with Iran, but it was unsuccessful. Oman signaled disagreement with the Saudi-led isolation of Qatar by strengthening ties with Iran. Oman did not immediately join the Saudi-led \"counterterrorism coalition\" in 2015 but eventually joined in 2016. Oman was the only GCC state that did not downgrade relations with Iran in 2016. Oman maintained relations with Iran in January 2016, unlike other GCC states who downgraded ties with Iran. Oman's security cooperation with Iran has raised concerns among experts and GCC officials. The two countries have agreements on combating smuggling and patrolling the Strait of Hormuz. Oman and Iran have a Memorandum of Understanding on military cooperation and conduct joint exercises. Despite maintaining relations with Iran, Oman enforces US sanctions on Iran. Iran and Oman engage in significant civilian trade, with joint ventures and plans for expanding Oman's port of Al Duqm. Khodro Industrial Group is conducting a feasibility study for a $200 million car production plant in Oman. China, Britain, and other countries are also investors in Oman's Al Duqm development. In February 2018, India signed an agreement with Oman for navy rights at the port. Oman granted the United States military access to Al Duqm port in March 2019. Iran and Oman jointly developed the Hengham oilfield in the Persian Gulf, producing 80 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. They are discussing investments to develop Iranian offshore gas fields near Oman's West Bukha field in the Strait of Hormuz. Oman and Iran signed a deal to build a $1 billion undersea pipeline for Iranian natural gas to be converted to LNG in Sohar, Oman. Progress on the project has been slowed by U.S. sanctions. In Yemen, Oman has patrolled the border since 2015 due to conflicts with Iran-backed Houthi rebels and Al Qaeda presence. Oman has been involved in the Yemen conflict since 2015, establishing refugee camps near the border and improving ties with tribes to prevent spillover. Despite historical difficulties, Oman has mediated the conflict as the only GCC state not part of the Saudi-led coalition, with ties to Iran. Oman's role in Yemen has been praised by the U.N. Special Envoy for Yemen. Oman has played a crucial role in mediating the Yemen conflict, hosting talks between U.S. diplomats and Houthi representatives, and facilitating the release of captives. Iran's involvement in Yemen has raised concerns about Oman's relations with Iran, with reports suggesting Iran has used Omani territory to smuggle weapons into Yemen. Iran has allegedly used Omani territory to smuggle weapons into Yemen, including anti-ship missiles, short-range missiles, small arms, and explosives. Reports suggest that Iran-made UAVs used by Houthi forces in Yemen may have transited through Oman. U.N. reports have identified land routes and Omani ports as possible channels for weapons smuggling, although Omani officials deny these allegations. Since March 2018, Oman has addressed security concerns regarding Iran smuggling weapons to the Houthis through its territory. Omani officials claim to have closed the file on this issue and have implemented the Oman Border Security Enhancement Program to enhance border security along the Oman-Yemen border. In May 2018, the State Department notified Congress of its plan to use funds for counterterrorism programs in Yemen and Oman. The FY2019 NDAA extends funds to Oman for border security along the Oman-Yemen border. U.S. officials used the Oman-Iran relationship to engage with Iranian officials for a possible nuclear deal, with meetings accelerating after Sultan Qaboos's visit to Iran in 2013. Meetings between U.S. and Iranian officials continued to accelerate, culminating in Secretary of State John Kerry meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Muscat in November 2014. In Muscat, Javad Zarif met with the P5+1 to accelerate negotiations on the JCPOA. Oman also hosted talks between Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and Iran's Atomic Energy Organization head Ali Akbar Salehi. Iran exported heavy water to Oman in 2016 to comply with JCPOA limits. Omani banks facilitated financial arrangements for the JCPOA, leading to $5.7 billion in Iranian funds in Bank Muscat. Iran obtained a special license in February 2016 to access these funds. The Treasury Department issued a special license in February 2016 for Iran to convert funds held in Omani rials to dollars, allowing for easier conversion to Euros. Oman has served as an intermediary for the exchange of captives between the United States and Iran, including brokering the release of prisoners in various incidents. Oman has played a key role in brokering releases between the United States and Iran, including helping with the release of U.S. hikers and an Iranian scientist. The country's mediation has also been sought in determining the fate of a retired FBI agent. Additionally, Oman's ties to Iran have been utilized by other countries like Israel for indirect communication on various disputes. Oman, along with other GCC states, joined the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State in 2014. Despite offering air bases, Oman did not conduct airstrikes. In the Syria conflict, Oman refrained from supporting rebel groups due to its relations with Iran. Instead, Oman focused on mediation efforts. Oman suspended Syria's Arab League membership in 2011 and hosted talks for political solutions in 2015. Additionally, Oman hosted Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in 2016 for discussions on the Syria conflict. Oman did not actively support the 2011 Libyan uprising that ousted Mu'ammar Al Qadhafi. In 2013, Oman granted asylum to Qadhafi's widow and children. Oman granted asylum to Qadhafi's widow and children, including daughter Aisha and sons Mohammad and Hannibal, in October 2012. The GCC has been divided on post-Mubarak Egypt, with Qatar supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and Saudi Arabia and the UAE opposing them. Oman hosted Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah Al Sisi in November 2017, despite criticizing the crackdown on Brotherhood supporters. Oman has maintained relations with Egypt since the 1979 peace treaty and participated in peace talks in 1994. In 1994, Oman hosted a session resulting in the establishment of a Middle East Desalination Research Center. Oman renounced the Arab boycott of Israel and hosted visits by Israeli prime ministers. Trade offices were exchanged with Israel in 1995, but diplomatic relations were not established. In April 2008, Oman informed Israel that their trade office would remain closed until an agreement on a Palestinian state was reached.

In November 2018, Israel's Minister of Transportation visited Oman to propose a railway project connecting Israel, Jordan, and the Gulf states. Sultan Qaboos of Oman, a respected defense strategist, met with US officials to discuss Middle East peace proposals and US policy towards Iran. Oman's armed forces are well-trained but under-equipped due to limited funds. Qaboos has always supported close defense cooperation with the US since Iran's 1979 revolution. Oman signed a \"facilities access agreement\" with the United States in 1980, allowing U.S. forces access to Omani military facilities. The agreement, last renewed in 2010, permits the U.S. to use Omani military airfields for specified purposes with advance notice. Oman hosts U.S. military aircraft landings and overflights, and stores U.S. Air Force equipment, including lethal munitions, at various bases. In 2019, Oman signed a Strategic Framework Agreement with the United States, allowing U.S. forces to use the ports of Al Duqm and Salalah. This agreement enhances the U.S. ability to counter Iran in the region. Oman is also willing to join a U.S.-backed Middle East Strategic Alliance to counter Iran. Oman's support for U.S. operations in the region includes providing facilities for major combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Sultan Qaboos hosted meetings on the economic and energy pillars of the Middle East Strategic Alliance during Secretary of State Michael Pompeo's visit in January 2019. The U.S.-GCC summit planned for spring 2018 to counter Iran has been repeatedly postponed due to the intra-GCC rift. During major combat operations of OEF in late 2001, there were about 4,300 U.S. personnel in Oman, mostly Air Force and B-1 bombers were extensively used for strikes. The U.S. military presence in Oman decreased to 3,750 during OIF in March 2003. Oman did not contribute forces to OEF or OIF. Oman's historic ties to the British military led to reliance on British officers initially, but over the past two decades, Oman has shifted its arsenal mostly to U.S.-made major combat systems. In April 2016, Britain and Oman signed a memorandum of understanding for defense cooperation. In April 2016, Britain and Oman signed a memorandum of understanding to build a base near Al Duqm port at a cost of about $110 million to support the stationing of British naval forces in Oman permanently. Oman is expanding and modernizing its arsenal primarily with purchases from the United States, but due to financial constraints, it cannot buy U.S. arms as easily as wealthier GCC states. Oman has received some Foreign Military Financing (FMF) to purchase U.S. equipment and is eligible for grant U.S. excess defense articles. The United States has not provided Oman with FMF since FY2017, but General Votel testified that Oman will continue to develop its foreign military sales portfolio, which already includes over $2.7 billion in open cases. Oman's FMS portfolio includes over $2.7 billion in open cases, with budget constraints affecting new acquisitions. Oman purchased 12 F-16 C/D aircraft in 2001 and 18 additional F-16s in 2010.

About 100 Omani military students study at 29 U.S. military institutions each year. Oman cooperates with the U.S. in efforts against terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. Oman actively works to prevent terrorist attacks and denies safe haven to such groups. The United States provides funding to Oman to help counter terrorist activity and combat trafficking of WMD-related equipment. This funding falls into three categories: Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) funds, Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) funds, and Terrorism Interdiction Program funding. These programs enhance the capabilities of various Omani agencies to interdict weapons of mass destruction, advanced conventional weapons, or illegal drugs at official Ports of Entry. The United States provides funding to Oman to enhance their capabilities in countering terrorist activity and trafficking of WMD-related equipment. This includes training the Royal Army of Oman and civilian law enforcement agencies on investigative techniques, maritime border security, cybersecurity, and detecting terrorists at entry points. Funding also supports establishing port controls and providing training to reduce the flow of foreign terrorist fighters and related goods at entry points. Oman joined the U.S. Container Security Initiative in 2005 for pre-screening U.S.-bound cargo. Oman joined the U.S. Container Security Initiative in 2005 to pre-screen U.S.-bound cargo from its port of Salalah. The lack of clear delineation between Oman's armed forces and law enforcement agencies sometimes hinders the effectiveness of U.S. programs.

The country has a \"Vision 2020\" strategy to reduce dependence on oil and gas, expanding LNG exports and participating in the Dolphin project. Oman is positioning itself as a trading hub to attract foreign investment, with a $60 billion project in Al Duqm funded by various countries. The project includes a refinery, container port, and transportation facilities for petrochemicals, aiming to link to other GCC states by rail and provide direct access to the Indian Ocean. China's investments in Al Duqm are part of its \"Belt and Road\" initiative. China's investments in Al Duqm are part of its \"Belt and Road Initiative\" to build a trade link between China and Europe. The $11 billion investment is for the \"Sino-Oman Industrial City.\" Oman is China's fourth-largest source of oil, while the United States is Oman's fourth-largest trading partner. U.S. exports to Oman include automobiles, aircraft, and oilfield equipment, while imports from Oman consist of fertilizers, industrial supplies, and oil by-products. The United States no longer imports Omani oil due to increased domestic production. The United States no longer imports Omani oil due to expanded U.S. oil production. Oman joined the WTO in 2000 and signed the U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement in 2006, leading to increased partnerships between Omani and U.S. companies in various sectors beyond oil. The U.S. phased out development assistance to Oman in 1996 after providing support for conservation and management of fisheries and water resources. The United States and Oman signed an agreement on cooperation in science and technology, allowing for exchanges of scientists, joint workshops, and U.S. training of Omani personnel in fisheries and water resources."
