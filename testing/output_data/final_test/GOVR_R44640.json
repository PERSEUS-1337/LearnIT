    "content": "The pricing of prescription drugs is a concern for U.S. consumers due to rising healthcare costs. Some studies show that drugs are cheaper in foreign markets. Several bills in Congress aim to allow importing lower-cost drugs from abroad, with varying restrictions on the source countries. None of these bills have been passed. The debate on importing lower-cost prescription drugs from abroad in the 114th Congress does not address the intellectual property implications of parallel importation. Brand-name firms can use patent rights to block unauthorized importation of prescription drugs, despite their safety and efficacy for domestic use. The debate on parallel trade of patented pharmaceuticals involves a trade-off between encouraging innovation and promoting access to medicines. Some believe that reducing patent rights may hinder future pharmaceutical development, while others argue that high drug prices in the US warrant a reevaluation of the patent system's role in regulating global trade. The report discusses intellectual property laws and policies on parallel importation of patented pharmaceuticals in the United States, including patent policy, legal framework, exhaustion doctrines, and legislative issues. The patent system aims to promote technological information dissemination and inventive activity by preventing free riders from duplicating inventions. The patent system allows inventors to profit from their inventions by providing exclusive rights for a limited time. Without patents, inventors may keep inventions as trade secrets, hindering knowledge sharing and innovation. Patents require inventors to disclose their inventions, promoting technological advancement and preventing free riders from exploiting inventions. The Patent Act of 1952 aims to stimulate technological advancement by encouraging individuals to invent around patented technology. Critics argue that market forces already drive innovation sufficiently, making the patent system unnecessary. The Patent Act of 1952 does not automatically grant patent rights; inventors must submit applications. Critics argue that market forces drive innovation sufficiently, making patents unnecessary. In 1952, U.S. patent rights require inventors to submit applications to the USPTO for examination. Examiners assess if the invention meets patent standards of usefulness, novelty, and nonobviousness. The process, known as \"prosecution,\" determines if the invention is operable, provides a benefit, and is not fully anticipated by prior knowledge. A nonobvious invention must not have been readily within the ordinary skills of a competent artisan at the time the invention was made. If the USPTO allows the patent to issue, the patent proprietor obtains the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing into the United States the patented invention. The term of the patent is ordinarily set at twenty years from the date the patent application was filed. Patent title provides inventors with limited periods of exclusivity in which they may practice their inventions or license others to do so. The grant of a patent permits the inventor to receive a return on the expenditure of resources leading to the discovery. Patent rights are not self-enforcing, and a patentee bears responsibility for monitoring others to determine infringement. Rights are not self-enforcing. A patentee must monitor others for infringement. Litigation in federal district courts is usually necessary to enforce intellectual property rights. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over patent appeals, with the U.S. Supreme Court having discretionary review authority. The Hatch-Waxman Act establishes special enforcement rules for pharmaceutical patents against generic competitors. The Hatch-Waxman Act governs patents on drugs and medical devices, providing provisions for patent term extension, exemptions for certain activities related to regulatory approval, mechanisms to challenge patent validity, and rewards for disputes. It also grants the FDA authority to offer marketing exclusivity periods independent of patents, with patent rights subject to the exhaustion doctrine. The exhaustion doctrine states that the sale of a patented product depletes the patent rights with respect to that physical object. This allows purchasers to use, charge others to use, or resell the product without interference from the patentee. The doctrine is also known as the \"first sale rule\" because the first sale extinguishes patent rights. For example, if a consumer buys a patented appliance and later sells it at a garage sale, the patent rights are exhausted, allowing the new owner to use or resell the appliance freely. The exhaustion doctrine allows purchasers to freely use or sell a patented product after the first sale. U.S. patents only provide rights within the United States, and owners must obtain foreign patents for protection in other countries. Multinational corporations often start the foreign patent acquisition process by submitting a patent application to a foreign patent office. Multinational corporations often obtain national patents for their inventions, which may have different legal effects in various jurisdictions due to differences in wording, translations, and patent laws. Each national patent is independent under the Paris Convention, requiring individual enforcement. Enforcement of patents in different jurisdictions is independent. A court ruling on the validity of a patent in one country does not directly affect its validity in another. Price disparities between countries can lead to parallel importation of medications to lower healthcare costs. The term \"parallel imports\" refers to patented products distributed abroad and sold in the United States without permission. Two positions exist on using patent rights to block parallel importation, one supporting \"international exhaustion.\" This view argues that U.S. patent rights are exhausted when authentic goods are lawfully purchased from the patent holder. The U.S. patent right is subject to \"international exhaustion\" when authentic goods are purchased from the patent holder, allowing for parallel importation. However, the Federal Circuit supports \"national exhaustion,\" stating that U.S. patents are enforceable against imports despite foreign sales. This doctrine restricts exhaustion to domestic sales only, emphasizing that U.S. patents are independent of foreign patents and effective only within the United States. The Federal Circuit restricts exhaustion doctrine to domestic sales, allowing U.S. patents to block unauthorized imports of pharmaceuticals. This contrasts with the Supreme Court's 2013 ruling in Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, which adopted an \"international exhaustion\" principle for copyrights. The case involved Supap Kirtsaeng, a Thai national studying in the U.S., who found textbooks cheaper in Thailand than in the U.S. The Supreme Court ruled in Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons that works lawfully purchased abroad and imported into the United States are protected from copyright infringement under the first sale doctrine. The Court based its decision on the international exhaustion principle, citing intellectual property policy and the burden it would place on booksellers if restricted to domestic sales. The Supreme Court ruled in Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons that works lawfully purchased abroad and imported into the United States are protected from copyright infringement under the first sale doctrine. The Court considered the burden on booksellers, museums, and retailers in determining the origin of copyrighted works, especially in cases involving technology products like automobiles, mobile phones, and personal computers. The decision highlighted the challenges of enforcing a domestic exhaustion rule, which would require permission from each copyright holder for resale, potentially affecting foreign car owners selling their used vehicles. The Federal Circuit reevaluated its stance on international exhaustion of patented products following the Supreme Court decision in Kirtsaeng. In the 2016 case of Lexmark International, Inc. v. Impression Products, Inc., the court rejected the doctrine of international exhaustion for patents. Unlike copyright law, the patent exhaustion doctrine only applies to sales within the United States, as the Patent Act does not address exhaustion. Judge Taranto reasoned that the Kirtsaeng ruling was based on specific provisions of the Copyright Act, which do not have analogues in the Patent Act. The Federal Circuit reevaluated its stance on international exhaustion of patented products following the Supreme Court decision in Kirtsaeng. In the 2016 case of Lexmark International, Inc. v. Impression Products, Inc., the court rejected the doctrine of international exhaustion for patents. Judge Taranto concluded that patents should not be equated with copyrights regarding international exhaustion. Judge Dyk dissented, arguing that policy arguments for international exhaustion apply to patents as well. U.S. retailers face challenges with high-tech patented products, potentially not made in the country. Judge Dyk warns of burdensome patent rights issues without an international exhaustion rule. The Federal Circuit's ruling in Lexmark v. Impression Products stands, limiting patent exhaustion to U.S. sales only. This rejects international exhaustion, allowing brand-name drug companies to block imports of patented medications. The parallel importation of patented pharmaceuticals raises additional concerns. The report discusses issues related to state and local governments importing patented medications, potential use of label licenses on drugs, and implications of international trade rules by the WTO. Some governments have plans to import prescription drugs, creating complexities for patentees due to the Eleventh Amendment. This presents a dilemma as federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over patent infringement cases. Recent judicial developments have raised concerns for patentees regarding patent enforcement against state and local governments importing patented medications. In Ouellette v. Mills, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine found a Maine statute allowing drug importation from foreign pharmacies unconstitutional, as it was preempted by federal law. This ruling may have implications for similar legislation in other jurisdictions. The exhaustion doctrine allows lawful purchasers of patented goods to use or resell them without interference from the patent owner. Label licenses or bag tags may impose restrictions on product use through sales contracts. The exhaustion doctrine allows purchasers of patented goods to use or resell them without interference. Label licenses may restrict product use, such as \"For Use in Canada Only,\" but these restrictions are generally upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Customers are presumed to have entered into valid sales contracts. Under current law, label licenses like \"Single Use Only\" or \"For Domestic Use Only\" are enforceable, and violating them could lead to liability for breach of contract and patent infringement. Legal issues around pharmaceutical importation involve contract and patent law. The US, as a member of the WTO, is bound by the TRIPS Agreement, which requires member countries to enact patent statutes with certain provisions, including non-discrimination in patent rights. Article 27 of the TRIPS Agreement requires equal treatment for all classes of inventions under patent laws, with minor exceptions. It prohibits countries from granting lesser proprietary rights to pharmaceutical patents compared to other types of inventions. However, the TRIPS Agreement imposes lesser obligations on signatory states regarding the exhaustion doctrine. Article 6 states that the issue of exhaustion of intellectual property rights cannot be addressed for dispute settlement purposes. The TRIPS Agreement imposes national treatment and most-favored-nation obligations regarding the exhaustion doctrine. Signatories must treat all WTO member states equally in terms of exhaustion rules. The agreement does not require equal treatment for all types of inventions in relation to exhaustion. The TRIPS Agreement imposes national treatment and most-favored-nation obligations regarding the exhaustion doctrine, requiring equal treatment for all WTO member states in terms of exhaustion rules. Bilateral free trade agreements, like the United States-Morocco FTA, address intellectual property rights, including provisions on patents, such as preventing importation of patented products without the patent owner's consent. The United States-Morocco FTA and other similar agreements place restrictions on importation of patented products without the patent owner's consent, even if the product is sold outside the territory. The United States-Australia FTA and United States-Singapore FTA have similar provisions, especially concerning pharmaceuticals. The United States-Morocco FTA and other agreements restrict the importation of patented products without the patent owner's consent, even if sold outside the territory. The US is obligated to allow pharmaceutical patent holders to block parallel imports if restrictions are in place. Congressional interest in this area offers various options for consideration. Congressional interest in this area offers various options for consideration, including the possibility of an infringement action against unauthorized importers of patented pharmaceuticals or introducing some form of international exhaustion doctrine into U.S. patent law. The TRIPS Agreement does not require adopting the international exhaustion doctrine as an all-or-nothing proposition, allowing Congress to limit its application to specific types of inventions. One approach to implementing the international exhaustion doctrine into U.S. patent law is to declare that importing goods sold abroad by a patent owner is not infringement. For example, the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act of 2004 proposed this for patented pharmaceuticals. The amendment proposed in S. 2328 aimed to allow the sale of patented goods abroad by the owner or licensee without infringing on the patent rights. This could potentially impact the international exhaustion doctrine for pharmaceuticals and other patented inventions, potentially strengthening the ruling in Lexmark v. Impression Products. The Patent Act of 1952 exempts licensed medical practitioners and certain health care entities from patent infringement in certain circumstances. To promote drug importation, an explicit statutory infringement exemption could encourage individuals to engage in parallel trade of patented pharmaceuticals. Label licenses should also be considered in legal changes to patent laws. Firms can use contract law to restrict the use of drugs sold in foreign jurisdictions. Legal changes should consider firms using contracts as a substitute for patent protection in drug importation. Balancing prescription drug costs and new drug development is a policy challenge, as lowering drug prices may reduce incentives for research and development. The current drug importation debate involves considering patent law reforms in the context of drug costs influenced by various factors. Balancing access to medications and the development of new drugs by pharmaceutical firms is a central concern."
