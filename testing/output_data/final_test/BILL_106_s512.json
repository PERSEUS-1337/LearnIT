    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Advancement in Pediatric Autism Research Act\". The Congress finds that infantile autism and autism spectrum disorders are neurodevelopmental diseases causing severe language and communication impairments. Estimates show 1 in 500 children will be diagnosed with autism, with 400,000 Americans affected. Limited data on prevalence in the US exists, with no national studies conducted. Studies in Canada, Europe, and Japan suggest higher prevalence rates. Recent studies in Canada, Europe, and Japan indicate a 300-400% higher prevalence of classic autism. Three-quarters of individuals with infantile autism end up in institutions or group homes by age 13. The cost of caring for those with autism and autism spectrum disorder is estimated at $13.3 billion annually. Advancements in biomedical science suggest that effective treatments and a cure for autism are possible with proper coordination of federal agencies involved in research. Recent research suggests that environmental factors may contribute to autism, potentially making contributing causes preventable. Understanding the prevalence and incidence of autism is crucial for discovering effective treatments and a cure. Finding the causes of autism may also shed light on other developmental disorders. Research is needed to understand the underlying causes, epidemiology, and early diagnosis of autism and autism spectrum disorders. This includes identifying risk factors, developing treatments, and preventing future abnormalities. The National Institutes of Health announced a research program in 1998 to study autism spectrum disorders, focusing on identifying subtypes, disseminating relevant biomedical data for early diagnosis, and assessing the costs of education and care for individuals with autism. Adequate funding is necessary for the program's success. The National Institutes of Health are expanding and intensifying their research activities on autism spectrum disorders. This includes coordinating efforts to study subtypes, early diagnosis, and the costs of education and care for individuals with autism. Adequate funding is crucial for the success of these research programs. The Director of NIH is expanding research activities on autism spectrum disorders, coordinating efforts with other agencies. Grants and contracts are awarded to establish centers of excellence for research. The Director of NIH is expanding research activities on autism spectrum disorders by awarding grants for centers of excellence to conduct basic and clinical research on the cause, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of autism. These centers may also provide services to make individuals aware of research opportunities and offer health care and other services to research subjects. The Director of NIH is establishing centers of excellence for research on autism spectrum disorders, which will provide services to research subjects and coordinate information among centers. Each center will be based on a single institution or a consortium of cooperating institutions. The Director of NIH will establish at least five centers for autism research, with funding for up to 5 years, extendable for additional 5-year periods based on peer review. A program will be created to facilitate the donation, collection, preservation, and availability of tissues and genetic materials for autism research. The program for autism research will adhere to scientific and medical standards. The Director of NIH will provide public information and receive feedback on autism programs. $33,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2000, with additional funding for 2001-2004. SEC. 4. DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES SURVEILLANCE AND RESEARCH PROGRAMS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may award grants for data collection on autism and developmental disabilities to public or nonprofit entities. Technical assistance can be provided instead of cash. Additionally, Centers of Excellence in Autism and Developmental Disabilities Epidemiology will be established by the Secretary through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will establish 3 to 5 regional centers of excellence in autism and pervasive developmental disabilities epidemiology to collect and analyze information on autism and related developmental disabilities. These centers will be awarded grants or cooperative agreements to public or nonprofit entities for research purposes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will establish regional centers of excellence in autism and pervasive developmental disabilities epidemiology. These centers will collect, analyze, and report data on autism and related developmental disabilities according to guidelines prescribed by the Director. The regional centers of excellence in autism and pervasive developmental disabilities epidemiology will coordinate surveillance efforts, provide education and training for health professionals, identify cases and controls for research, and develop special research expertise in areas like genetics and environmental exposure. The Secretary will establish a clearinghouse at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to collect and store data from monitoring programs related to autism and pervasive developmental disabilities. This clearinghouse will coordinate research and policy development on the epidemiology of these conditions. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will coordinate the Federal response to these issues. The Federal response to requests for assistance regarding autism or developmental disability clusters will be coordinated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The term \"State\" in this Act refers to various regions including States, the District of Columbia, and territories. An authorization of $7,500,000 for each fiscal year from 2000 to 2004 is provided for this purpose. The Secretary will establish a program to provide information and education on autism to health professionals and the public, including advances in diagnosis and treatment. Stipends may be provided for professionals in training programs. $6,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2000 to 2004. An Inter-Agency Autism Coordinating Committee will also be established. The Secretary will establish the Autism Coordinating Committee to coordinate efforts within the Department of Health and Human Services regarding autism. The Committee will consist of Directors from national research institutes, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other relevant agencies as determined by the Secretary. Additional members, such as parents or legal guardians of individuals with autism, may be appointed if deemed appropriate. The Autism Coordinating Committee will include parents or legal guardians of individuals with autism and representatives from other governmental agencies serving children with autism. The Committee will receive administrative support from the Department of Health and Human Services, members will serve for 3 years and can be reappointed for unlimited terms, and they will meet at least twice a year. Members will not receive additional compensation. Members of the Autism Coordinating Committee will not receive additional compensation for their service but may be reimbursed for expenses incurred through their committee work. SEC. 7. REPORT TO CONGRESS. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress by January 1, 2000, and annually thereafter, regarding the implementation of the Act and its amendments."
