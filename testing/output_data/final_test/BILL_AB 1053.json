The identity of the decedent on the death certificate will be as reported by the person with the right to control the disposition of the remains.

Starting July 1, 2015, individuals completing death certificates must adhere to specific data and certification requirements.

The second section of the certificate contains medical and health data designated by the State Registrar. Starting July 1, 2015, death certificates must include details on the cause of death, operations, accidents, injuries, pregnancy status, and starting July 1, 2016, information on suicide methods. Starting July 1, 2016, local registrars must provide data on veteran suicides to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. No reimbursement is required for costs incurred by local agencies or school districts due to changes in crime penalties or definitions. The act allows members of the Military Reserve or National Guard to defer payments on certain obligations while on active duty. Reimbursement for additional costs mandated by the state will be provided to local agencies and school districts. A reservist called to active duty may defer payments on various obligations, including mortgage, credit card, retail installment contracts, vehicle loans, and property tax. This benefit is in addition to any other provided by law and is subject to federal law. Reservists called to active duty can defer payments on obligations such as credit cards, retail installment contracts, vehicle loans, property tax, and utility bills by submitting a signed letter requesting a deferment. Reservists on active duty must provide proof of their activation orders and show that their military pay does not exceed 90% of their pre-deployment income. Employers must provide a letter confirming this within five working days upon request. The deferral period for financial obligations is up to 180 days or the period of active duty plus 60 days, with a maximum of 180 days within a year. Lenders must extend the term of the loan for the deferred months. Open-end credit obligations may have restricted credit availability during the deferral period. \"Vehicle\" refers to a vehicle as defined in the Vehicle Code."
