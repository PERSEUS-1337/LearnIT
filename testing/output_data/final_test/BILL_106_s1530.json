    "content": "The \"Family and Medical Leave Clarification Act\" establishes definitions and regulations regarding serious health conditions, intermittent leave, request for leave, and substitution of paid leave. It also includes a table of contents outlining the sections of the Act. Congress acknowledges that the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 is not functioning as intended due to issues with compliance, caused by broad regulations and interpretations leading to increased costs, productivity loss, and administrative challenges. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 faces compliance issues, conflicting with employers' sick leave policies and hindering absence management. The Commission on Leave failed to identify compliance problems early on, leading to difficulties when employers later tried to comply with final regulations. SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION. The definition of serious health condition under Section 101(11) (29 U.S.C. 2611(11)) is amended to include exclusions for short-term illnesses and examples such as heart conditions, strokes, and spinal injuries. The definition of serious health condition under Section 101(11) (29 U.S.C. 2611(11)) is amended to include exclusions for short-term illnesses and examples such as heart conditions, strokes, spinal injuries, appendicitis, pneumonia, emphysema, severe arthritis, nervous disorders, injuries from accidents, ongoing pregnancies, miscarriages, pregnancy-related complications, prenatal care, childbirth, and recovery. SEC. 4. INTERMITTENT LEAVE. Amends Section 102(b)(1) to allow intermittent leave in increments of up to \\1/2\\ of a workday. Employers can require employees to take leave for the duration of work or assignment if unable to accommodate intermittent leave requests. SEC. 5. REQUEST FOR LEAVE. Section 102(e) (29 U.S.C. 2612(e)) is amended to allow employers to require timely requests for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Failure to make a timely request may result in denial of leave. Employees must provide advance notice and submit a written application for leave within 5 working days. For unforeseeable leave, employees must orally notify the employer before the leave commences. Failure to make a timely request for leave may result in denial of leave. Employees must provide advance notice and submit a written application for leave within 5 working days, or as necessary if physically or mentally incapable. SEC. 6. SUBSTITUTION OF PAID LEAVE. Employers can require employees to choose between paid absence provided through collective bargaining agreements or other plans, and unpaid leave under this title. SEC. 7. REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Labor will review existing regulations for the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 within 90 days of this Act's enactment. These regulations will cease to be effective once final revised regulations reflecting amendments made by this Act are issued. The Secretary of Labor will issue proposed regulations within 90 days and final regulations within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. The final regulations will take effect 90 days after issuance. The regulations will apply to actions taken by an employer before the effective date of the final regulations under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.
