    "content": "The \"Intellectual Property Protection Act of 1993\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings and purposes. The Congress finds that Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 is crucial for US businesses to address unfair trade practices and enforce intellectual property rights. A GATT panel in 1988 found Section 337 violated US obligations, leading to adoption of the panel report in 1989. The GATT panel report in 1988 found Section 337 violated US obligations, leading to the obligation to reform it. Special enforcement procedures for intellectual property rights against unfairly traded imports are necessary under the GATT. These procedures must be effective and not less favorable than those used for domestic products. The purpose of this Act is to align section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 with the GATT provisions to allow for efficient foreign discovery, expedite dispute resolution, and enable border enforcement by the United States Customs Service. The Act aims to amend section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 to align with GATT provisions for efficient foreign discovery, expedited dispute resolution, and border enforcement by the US Customs Service. The amendment to section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 aims to expedite investigations and determinations by the Commission, setting a target date for final decisions within 30 days of initiation. The amendment also removes certain provisions to promote expeditious adjudication. The amendment to section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 includes changes such as modifying language regarding settlement agreements and exclusions from entry, as well as adjustments to entry under bond provisions. The amendment to section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 includes changes to entry under bond provisions, allowing the Commission to determine bond amounts to protect complainants and forfeit bonds if violations occur. The amendment to section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 allows the Commission to issue cease and desist orders, including temporary orders with bond requirements for complainants. Bonds may be forfeited if violations occur. The Commission may prescribe terms and conditions for forfeiting bonds if violations of the section are not found. The authority to issue exclusion orders is limited to those violating the section unless a general exclusion is necessary to prevent circumvention or there is a pattern of violations. The amendment allows entry under bond until a determination is final, with the bond amount set by the Secretary. Declaratory relief can be sought by owners, importers, or others under the new subsection added to Section 337 of the Act. The amendment allows entry under bond until a final determination is made, with the bond amount determined by the Secretary. Declaratory relief can be requested by owners, importers, or consignees in cases of unfair competition or acts described in subsection (a) of Section 337. SEC. 4. AMENDMENT OF TITLE 28, UNITED STATES CODE. Section 1659 of Title 28, United States Code, allows for a stay of certain civil actions involving parties also in proceedings before the United States International Trade Commission. The district court must stay proceedings in the civil action related to issues in the Commission's proceeding until the Commission's determination is final. After a stay is dissolved under subsection (a), relevant portions of the United States International Trade Commission's record can be used in a civil action, with the district court able to impose protective orders as needed. The chapter analysis for title 28, United States Code, is amended to reflect this change. SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE. The amendments made by this Act apply to complaints filed and investigations initiated under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 after the date of the enactment of this Act."
