Despite being removed from the list in 2008, there have been calls to redesignate North Korea due to provocative actions. Other countries currently on the state sponsors of terrorism list include Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria. Calls for redesignation intensified in 2010 after a naval vessel sinking and in 2014 following a cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment. Calls for redesignating North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism have intensified since 2014, following a cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment. Legislation such as H.R. 204 in the 114th Congress aims to urge the Secretary of State to redesignate North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism. The U.S. should redesignate North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, as legislation like H.R. 1771 from the 113th Congress aimed to impose restrictions on the DPRK. Despite being removed from the terrorism list, North Korea has not seen significant economic benefits due to U.S. legal restrictions on trade. Commercial trade between the U.S. and North Korea remains minimal. The U.S. continues to treat North Korea as a supporter of terrorism in trade considerations, with restrictions on aid and contributions to UN programs. Some U.S. companies have opened small-scale operations in North Korea, but redesignating DPRK as a terrorism sponsor may not have significant immediate economic impact. The U.S. treats North Korea as a supporter of terrorism in trade, with restrictions on aid. Redesignating DPRK may not have a significant immediate economic impact, but could increase pressure on North Korea and impact diplomacy. The Kim regime's two-track policy of nuclear and economic development could be affected by a redesignation. Placing North Korea back on the lists could hinder future diplomatic initiatives between the United States and North Korea, impacting the Kim regime's two-track policy of nuclear and economic development. Those supporting economic reforms in North Korea may oppose redesignating the DPRK, while those favoring increased economic pressure may support it. North Korea's goals include improving relations with the United States on its terms and gaining economic benefits. Releasing U.S. detainees in 2014 signaled a diplomatic breakthrough with Washington. Redesignating North Korea could hinder dialogue and provoke further provocative actions, such as nuclear tests. North Korean leaders may use redesignation to shift blame to the United States for escalating tensions with Pyongyang, potentially influencing China's stance. South Korean President Park Geun-hye aims to improve relations with North Korea but redesignation could complicate efforts, especially in attracting investments for the Kaesong Industrial Complex. Some in South Korea and Japan support North Korea's redesignation as a terrorism sponsor, believing it would empower North Korean refugees to resist intimidation. These refugees provide valuable insights into North Korean politics and society, and some operate radio stations in Seoul with U.S. democracy assistance funds. North Korean agents have targeted refugees for harassment, kidnapping, and assassination. Redesignation could lead North Korea to demand removal from the list as a precondition for cooperation. If redesignated, North Korea might make removal from the list a precondition for cooperation in future talks over its weapons programs. Redesignation could hinder talks and serve as a bargaining tool for the United States. The Secretary of State can designate a country as a state sponsor of terrorism under three laws. None of the Acts define \"international terrorism.\" The Foreign Relations Authorization Act defines \"terrorism\" as premeditated, politically motivated violence against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents. Criteria for adding a foreign government to the terrorism support lists include supplying terrorist organizations with support and aiding in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The criteria for designating a foreign government as a state sponsor of terrorism do not specify the type or level of terrorism-related activities considered. This ambiguity allows for discretion in weighing policy and political implications. In North Korea's case, diplomatic and policy considerations seem to have influenced the decision. The government of North Korea was added to the state sponsors of terrorism list due to its involvement in the bombing of Korean Air flight 858 in 1987. Despite not sponsoring any terrorist acts since then, North Korea remained on the list for factors like abductions of Japanese citizens and harboring terrorists. The government of North Korea was removed from the state sponsors of terrorism list in 2008 despite maintaining ties to terrorist groups and developing weapons of mass destruction. The decision was primarily for diplomatic reasons as part of the 2007 deal with the Bush Administration to disable North Korea's nuclear program. The removal of North Korea from the state sponsors of terrorism list in 2008 was based on diplomatic reasons related to the 2007 deal with the Bush Administration to disable its nuclear program. However, some analysts argue that North Korea's advancements in its nuclear programs have raised concerns about its designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. The State Department is currently assessing whether North Korea still meets the criteria for this designation, which could result in trade restrictions and controls on dual-use technology.

However, some analysts argue that North Korea's advancements in its nuclear programs have raised concerns about its designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. The State Department is currently assessing whether North Korea still meets the criteria for this designation, which could result in trade restrictions and controls on dual-use technology. Placement on the list may trigger denial of beneficial trade designation, unfavorable tax status for investors, stricter licensing requirements for financing trade with the United States, and prohibition of most foreign aid under certain acts. The U.S. prohibits transactions with foreign governments on terrorism lists. Two paths exist to remove a government from the list: certification of change in leadership and policies, or a report to Congress. The Bush Administration used the second procedure for North Korea. In the 110th Congress, there were objections to the delisting of North Korea from the U.S. state sponsors of terrorism list. Pyongyang demanded removal from the list during negotiations over its missile program in 2000. Congress can block a government's removal from the list with a joint resolution. The Clinton Administration presented North Korea with four steps to be removed from the terrorism list, including issuing a written guarantee and joining anti-terrorism agreements. Despite a joint statement in 2000, the issue was not resolved as the Clinton Administration rejected North Korean demands for delisting. Discussions were revisited during the Six-Party Talks in 2003-2004. During the Six-Party Talks in 2003-2004, North Korea demanded removal from the terrorism support list in exchange for concessions on its nuclear programs. The negotiations continued from 2006-2008, leading to an agreement in February 2007 where North Korea agreed to freeze and disable its nuclear programs in return for being removed from the terrorism sponsor list. The coordinator for counterterrorism stated that North Korea had complied with removal criteria from the terrorism support lists due to no recent acts of terrorism. Despite unresolved issues, the Bush Administration removed North Korea from the lists. Pyongyang's subsequent actions led to calls for reinstating North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism. The State Department has not re-listed North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism despite actions such as the 2010 attacks on a South Korean naval vessel and Yeonpyeong Island. The department stated that North Korea's actions did not meet the legal definition of terrorism, even after a submarine sank the Cheonan in 2010. The State Department did not re-list North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism despite the sinking of the Cheonan in 2010. The sinking was deemed a violation of the armistice agreement but not an act of international terrorism. Calls to redesignate North Korea arose in 2014 after their reaction to the film \"The Interview.\" North Korea's Foreign Ministry condemned \"The Interview\" as an act of terrorism and threatened retaliation. Sony Pictures experienced a cyberattack, with North Korea denying involvement but praising the hackers. The film's release was canceled due to threats of terrorist attacks on theaters. The Department of Homeland Security stated there was no specific intelligence on such attacks. The U.S. government declared North Korea responsible for cyberattacks on Sony, with President Obama vowing a proportional response. The film \"The Interview\" was eventually shown in limited theaters and online after threats of terrorist attacks. The North Korean Internet network went offline for approximately 10 hours, possibly due to a cyberattack. Two groups linked to Anonymous claimed responsibility for the shutdown. The White House authorized sanctions on North Korean individuals and entities as a response. Pyongyang denied involvement in the Sony cyberattack. The FBI claimed North Korea executed the cyberattack on Sony, citing previous malware use. Some experts question the evidence, while officials say classified intelligence supports the attribution. FBI Director Comey and DNI Clapper expressed high confidence in North Korea's involvement, calling it the most serious cyberattack against U.S. interests. As of January 2015, cyber-related incidents have not been used to justify inclusion on the state sponsors of terrorism lists. The laws regarding state sponsor of terrorism designation may need amendments to include cyber-based incidents. Changing legislation to include cyber-related incidents as acts of terrorism could lead to designating other governments as state sponsors of terrorism. On May 19, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted five Chinese military hackers for computer hacking and economic espionage targeting American industries. Attorney General Eric Holder called it a case of economic espionage by Chinese military members, the first charges against a state actor for this type of hacking. There was no suggestion to add China to the state sponsors of terrorism list. The State Department's annual report since 2003 has not linked North Korea to any terrorist acts since the 1987 KAL bombing, raising questions about the basis for these claims. The Department's claims point to evidence of North Korea's involvement in proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including assisting Syria in building a nuclear reactor and supplying chemical protective gear. Reports suggest cooperation between North Korea and Iran in developing nuclear capabilities or weapons. The U.S. government has stated that there is no nuclear cooperation between Iran and North Korea. North Korea has been involved in missile sales and transfers to Syria, as well as conventional arms sales and transfers. In July 2013, a North Korean cargo ship was intercepted in Panama carrying military equipment. The Cuban government claimed military materials were to be \"repaired\" in North Korea before being returned, with skepticism from analysts. Reports of North Korean arms shipments to Iran, Syria via Iran and Turkey, with ties to Hezbollah and Hamas. Kidnapping, assassination, and other direct activities against civilians, including attempts to murder North Korean refugees and critics in Denmark and other foreigners helping defectors. Since being removed from the state sponsors of terrorism lists in 2008, North Korea's actions, including cyber-related incidents like the Sony attack in late 2014, have sparked debate on whether it should be re-listed. The 2009 and 2013 seizures of chemical protection equipment bound for Syria are the only actions that could potentially meet the criteria for relisting. The U.S. government and United Nations sources have concluded that North Korea sold missile parts and weapons to state sponsors of terrorism. North Korea has also conducted military attacks against South Korea, including a torpedo attack on a naval vessel. Despite these actions, they do not meet the criteria for being listed as a state sponsor of terrorism. Other activities, such as cyberattacks and supporting terrorist organizations, have been linked to North Korea, leading to debates on whether they should be relisted. The U.S. government and United Nations sources have concluded that North Korea engaged in missile sales and military attacks, but these actions do not meet the criteria for listing as a state sponsor of terrorism. Alleged activities include weapons sales to Hezbollah and Hamas, with diplomatic considerations influencing decisions on North Korea's status. The State Department weighs the potential impact on international diplomacy before re-listing North Korea."
