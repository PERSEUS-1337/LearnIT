    "content": "The Equity in Public Education Act of 1996 may be cited as the official title. The Congress acknowledges the Federal Government's duty to prevent illegal immigration and the failure to do so has led to a growing number of illegal immigrants in the US. States are required to provide education benefits to all children, regardless of immigration status, resulting in the costs being primarily borne by the States with a high number of illegal immigrants. Illegal immigrants bear a disproportionate share of educational costs due to the failures of the Federal Government. In the interest of equity, the Federal Government should reimburse States for these costs. The Federal Government should reimburse States for educational costs for illegal alien students. The Secretary of Education will provide payment to eligible States for reimbursable costs, subject to appropriations. States must meet certain criteria to be eligible, including cooperation with the Secretary of Commerce and using payments only for specified purposes. The Act defines \"reimbursable costs\" as the additional expenses incurred by local educational agencies in providing free public education to eligible illegal alien students. An \"eligible illegal alien student\" is an alien not lawfully present in the US enrolled in a public school as of a specified date determined by the Secretary of Commerce. The Secretary of Commerce determines the amount of payment to eligible States based on average numbers and incremental expenditure increases. Before fiscal year 1998 and every third fiscal year after, determinations are made for California, Texas, and Florida. Before fiscal year 1999, the Secretary of Commerce will determine funding for at least half of the states not mentioned in the previous paragraph. Every third fiscal year after, determinations will be made for the remaining states. Equal determinations will be made before fiscal year 1999 and 2000. The Secretary of Commerce determines funding for states before the beginning of a fiscal year based on the average number of eligible illegal alien students and the incremental increase in per pupil expenditures for public education benefits. Authorization of Appropriations for grants in public schools starting from fiscal year 1998. Definition of \"State\" as per Immigration and Nationality Act."
