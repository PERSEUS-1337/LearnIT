    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Brownfields Housing and Community Renewal Development Act\". The Congress recognizes the importance of addressing contaminated abandoned properties through funding programs like Brownfields grants. EPA programs focus on assessment, planning, job training, and cleanup, but are insufficient for full redevelopment. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is suggested to provide grants for redeveloping contaminated buildings, impacting both health and community quality of life. The purpose of this Act is to empower local communities to clean and redevelop brownfields by providing flexibility for local plans and access to economic development grant funds. The Act aims to promote community renewal through brownfield redevelopment by establishing a grant program. Section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 is amended to establish a grant program for brownfield redevelopment activities. Grants will be provided to assist in the redevelopment of brownfield sites and underused structures. Eligible recipients include local governments, nonprofit organizations, and community entities. The grant program for brownfield redevelopment activities allows grants to be used for purposes such as benefiting low and moderate-income communities, increasing affordable housing opportunities, addressing urgent community needs, and providing open spaces or parks. Priority is given to proposals that meet multiple objectives specified in the program. The Secretary shall not require that grant amounts be used only in connection with projects assisted with a guaranteed loan. Each grant award shall not exceed $1,000,000 and may allocate up to 10% for administrative costs. The Secretary will establish audit procedures for the grants. The Secretary will establish audit procedures for grants made under this subsection, including measures to sanction violators. $25,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2008, and $50,000,000 for grants under this subsection. The Secretary will establish audit procedures for grants under this subsection, with $25,000,000 authorized for fiscal year 2008, $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2009, and $75,000,000 for fiscal year 2010. Amounts appropriated will remain available until expended. A report to Congress on the grant program's use and impact is required within 30 months of the enactment of the Brownfields Housing and Community Renewal Development Act."
