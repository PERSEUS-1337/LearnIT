    "content": "The THUD appropriations subcommittees draft bills for annual funding of DOT, HUD, and related agencies. DOT primarily provides grants for transportation infrastructure and oversees safety in various industries. FAA's budget is mainly for operating the air traffic control system. The Department of Transportation (DOT) primarily funds the operation of the U.S. air traffic control system, employing over 80% of its workforce. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) focuses on addressing housing issues for low-income households through rental assistance programs like Public Housing and Section 8 vouchers. Other grant programs like HOME Investment Partnership and Community Development Block Grants support housing and community development activities for low-income families. HUD's activities include serving low-income families and providing specialized grant programs for homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. The Federal Housing Administration insures mortgages for home buyers with low down payments and developers of affordable rental buildings. Title III of the THUD appropriations bill funds agencies involved in transportation, housing, and community development. This includes the Access Board, Federal Maritime Commission, National Transportation Safety Board, Amtrak Office of Inspector General, NeighborWorks, U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, and costs related to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The THUD bill funds programs for transportation, housing, and community development through regular annual appropriations from the general fund of the Treasury. Advance appropriations may be provided for some accounts, and emergency appropriations are sometimes allocated in response to disasters. These funds are separate from regular appropriations and may come from emergency supplemental spending bills. The Department of Transportation's budget includes contract authority from federal trust fund resources, controlling spending from the Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. This contract authority is not subject to the same limitations as discretionary budget authority. Comparing total funding can be confusing as the THUD bill typically includes both discretionary budget authority and mandatory contract authority. The THUD bill's regular annual appropriations include discretionary funding offset through rescissions and offsetting receipts. Funding trends for DOT and HUD from FY2009-FY2015 are shown in Table 1, excluding emergency and supplemental funding. The funding trends for DOT and HUD from FY2009-FY2015 are shown in Table 1, excluding emergency and supplemental appropriations. Table 2 outlines the legislative timeline for the FY2016 THUD appropriations bill, which follows the annual budget resolution framework set by Congress for spending and revenue decisions. The FY2016 budget resolution set a base discretionary spending limit of $1.017 trillion, with a $376 million difference in allocations between the House and Senate THUD subcommittees. This creates challenges in reaching agreement on the final FY2016 THUD appropriation level. Table 3 shows the funding for THUD in FY2015, the FY2016 Administration request, and the allocations by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The President's FY2016 budget requested $134.7 billion for programs in the THUD bill, $27.4 billion more than FY2015. Most of the increase was for highway, transit, and rail funding. The House-passed H.R. 2577 provides $108.7 billion for THUD in FY2016. H.R. 2577 provides $108.7 billion for THUD in FY2016, which is virtually identical to the FY2015 level after accounting for reductions in offsetting receipts and rescissions. The Senate-reported H.R. 2577 recommends $109.1 billion for THUD, representing an increase of less than 1% over FY2015 funding. In FY2015, the THUD subcommittees were able to provide $10.1 billion in discretionary appropriations to THUD agencies above the net discretionary budget authority level due to budgetary savings from rescissions and offsets. The amount of these \"budget savings\" can vary from year to year, impacting the 302(b) allocation for providing the same level of appropriations. In FY2016, a $1.1 billion reduction in offsetting collections required the House THUD subcommittee to allocate an additional $1.1 billion in discretionary funding to maintain the same total funding level as in FY2015. In FY2016, the House THUD subcommittee proposed a $1.5 billion increase in 302(b) allocation over THUD's net FY2015 level, which ultimately resulted in a $25 million increase after adjustments. However, with a proposed reduction in mandatory funding by $25 million, the net change for FY2016 became zero. The House-passed H.R. 2577 for DOT would provide $70.6 billion in budgetary resources, $1.0 billion below the FY2015 level, and a significant cut of $100 million to the National Infrastructure Investment. In FY2016, the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a budget of $71.3 billion for the Department of Transportation (DOT), which is $368 million below the FY2015 level. This includes cuts of $100 million to the National Infrastructure Investment program, $1.148 billion to Amtrak, and $199 million to the transit Capital Investment Grants program. Additionally, the Senate recommended a 25% cut of $535 million to the transit Capital Investment Grants program compared to FY2015. The Administration's budget proposal for DOT requested $93.7 billion in budgetary resources. The budget proposal for DOT includes a request for $93.7 billion in budgetary resources, with significant increases in funding for various programs compared to FY2015. Additionally, there is a detailed account-by-account summary of FY2016 appropriations proposals for HUD in comparison to FY2015 enacted levels. The budget proposal for HUD includes $46.2 billion in gross appropriations, $37.6 billion in net budget authority, a 93% cut in funding for HOME, a $100 million decrease in CDBG funding, and funding increases for Section 8 tenant-based and project-based rental assistance accounts. The House-passed H.R. 2577 proposes $46.4 billion in gross appropriations for HUD, which is $1 billion more than FY2015 but $3 billion less than requested by the President. It includes funding for new vouchers for homeless youth and veterans, a 15% cut in HOME funding, level funding for CDBG, and cuts to Choice program funding. The President's budget proposal for HUD in FY2016 includes funding cuts for Choice Neighborhoods and the Public Housing Capital Fund, while increasing funding for Section 8 tenant-based and project-based rental assistance. The budget also rejects new incremental vouchers and legislative reforms requested by the President. The gross appropriations requested are $49.3 billion, $4 billion more than FY2015, with a net budget authority of $40.6 billion, $5 billion more than FY2015. The FY2016 HUD budget proposal includes a $5 billion increase in funding compared to FY2015, with increases for most programs and 67,000 new Section 8 vouchers. There is a 7% funding cut for CDBG and proposed reforms for rental assistance programs."
