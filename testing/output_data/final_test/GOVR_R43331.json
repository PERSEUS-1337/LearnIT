    "content": "In recent Congresses, there has been a focus on Senate rules allowing minorities to delay votes unless a supermajority invokes cloture. Proposals to change rules on extended debate and cloture have been debated, with some changes adopted. Some suggest establishing a new precedent instead of amending Standing Rules to address Senate procedure. Some Senators and outside observers have used the term \"nuclear\" to describe proceedings that could potentially undermine Senate minorities' prerogatives. Discussions have focused on Senate consideration of presidential nominations to the executive branch and federal judiciary. In 2013, the Senate took actions to address concerns about executive branch and judicial appointments. The Senate reinterpreted Senate Rule XXII for nominations, lowering the cloture vote threshold to a simple majority for most nominations. Confirmation still requires unanimous consent or successful cloture. Confirmation vote requires a numerical majority of those voting. No general time limits for floor consideration of nominations under Senate rules. The Senate Rule XXII allows for cloture to limit consideration of nominations by a supermajority vote. This rule was amended in 1949 to include cloture for nominations, allowing a vote to proceed. However, it wasn't until 1968 that a cloture motion was filed for a nomination. Since 1975, a supermajority is required for cloture under the Rule. Since 1975, a cloture motion filed on a nomination under Rule XXII requires a three-fifths supermajority vote in the Senate. If cloture is supported, the Senate will vote on the pending question after 30 hours of consideration, with final approval needing a simple majority vote. Unlike bringing legislation to the floor, the procedures for bringing up a nomination do not rely on current practice. In current practice, the motion to consider a nomination or treaty does not require a cloture process, allowing a simple majority vote to bring up the nomination. However, the Senate cannot consider multiple nominations together, and once cloture is invoked on a question, it becomes the priority until resolved. The Senate can only consider nominations sequentially, with cloture motions filed on multiple nominations. Once cloture is invoked on one nomination, the Senate must resolve it before moving on to others. In 2013, the Senate adopted a standing order governing floor proceedings, but it did not change the cloture process provided by Rule XXII. The standing order adopted by the Senate in 2013 did not change the cloture process provided by Rule XXII. However, for certain nominations, there are different post-cloture limits on consideration. Executive nominations, except for the highest positions, are limited to eight hours post-cloture, while district judge nominations are limited to two hours. Other federal judicial positions and high-level executive nominations still have up to 30 hours of post-cloture debate. The precedent set in 2013 did not alter the text of Rule XXII. The Senate relies on precedents to advise on enforcing rules and responding to points of order. The Senate itself has the final authority on interpreting and applying its rules. On November 21, a new precedent was set requiring a simple majority for cloture under Rule XXII. The Senate set a new precedent on November 21, lowering the vote threshold for cloture on most nominations to a simple majority. This allows a supportive majority to confirm a nomination with an \"up-or-down\" vote. However, the cloture process remains unchanged, with a two-day delay before voting on the cloture motion unless unanimous consent is given. The Senate can conduct other business during this time. The Senate's new precedent allows cloture on most nominations with a simple majority vote, reducing the threshold. Post-cloture consideration is limited to 2, 8, or 30 hours, depending on the nomination. Rule XXII still prohibits other business during this period, and multiple nominations must be processed sequentially. The new precedent did not change the time required to complete the cloture process and reach a vote on a nomination. The Senate's new precedent allows a simple majority to employ the cloture process and reach a vote on confirming a nomination, reducing the threshold from three-fifths to a numerical majority. This change could impact elements of the nomination and confirmation process prior to floor consideration. The Senate's new precedent allows a simple majority to employ cloture for confirming nominations, reducing the threshold from three-fifths to a numerical majority. This change may lead opponents to focus their opposition on nominees in committee, as those not reported out can only be considered on the Senate floor by unanimous consent. The Senate's new precedent allows a simple majority to employ cloture for confirming nominations, reducing the threshold from three-fifths to a numerical majority. S.Res. 116 provides a process for \"privileged\" nominations to be placed on the Executive Calendar for floor consideration without committee referral, unless a Senator requests referral. This applies to positions in cabinet departments, advisory boards, and independent agencies, except for Supreme Court nominations. The Senate's new precedent allows a simple majority for confirming nominations, reducing the threshold from three-fifths to a numerical majority. The limits on post-cloture consideration for certain nominations will revert back to 30 hours in the 114th Congress. The standing order may not be renewed, requiring Senators to negotiate unanimous consent agreements for swift processing of nominations. The President's nominee selection process may now be influenced by the understanding that nominees can receive a vote with only a numerical majority. The Senate's new precedent allows a simple majority for confirming nominations, reducing the threshold from three-fifths to a numerical majority. The procedures for selecting nominees may now be influenced by the understanding that nominees can receive a vote with only a numerical majority. The November 21 proceedings highlighted key procedural details regarding the inability to extend debate on the appeal of the chair's ruling, which typically would require a supermajority vote to reach a decision. The Senate's new precedent allows a simple majority for confirming nominations, reducing the threshold from three-fifths to a numerical majority. This change in procedure may impact the selection of nominees. The parliamentary circumstances surrounding the setting of this new precedent will likely be examined for implications on future attempts to change Senate rules. On October 28, 2013, the Senate agreed to proceed to Executive Session to consider the nomination of Patricia Ann Millett as a United States Circuit Judge. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on the nomination on October 31, 2013, with a vote of 55-38. Majority Leader Harry Reid then moved to reconsider the failed cloture vote on November 21, 2013. The motion to proceed to reconsideration was not subject to debate. After the failed cloture vote on Patricia Ann Millett's nomination, the Senate voted to reconsider the cloture vote, 57-43, agreeing to bring it back for consideration. The majority leader then raised a point of order that cloture for nominations (excluding Supreme Court) is by majority vote. The majority leader appealed the chair's ruling on the three-fifths vote for cloture. The Senate voted to overturn the ruling, with 52 Senators in favor and 48 against. The minority leader then raised a point of order on the three-fifths threshold for cloture on a nomination, which was also ruled against by the chair. The Senate sustained the ruling on the cloture motion with a vote of 52-48. The cloture motion was then re-voted on and agreed to 55-43, allowing proceedings to continue on the nomination with a 30-hour time limit for consideration."
