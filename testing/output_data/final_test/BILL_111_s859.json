The John H. Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue and Rapid Response Fund allows the Secretary to enter into various agreements to carry out activities. It establishes an interest-bearing fund for marine mammal rescue, funded by deposits and contributions, available without restrictions on expenditure. The Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Act of 2000 limits support for individual projects to $200,000 per 12-month period and allows unexpended funds to remain available until expended. The non-Federal share of costs for activities funded under this section is typically 25 percent of the Federal costs, but the Secretary can waive this requirement for activities using emergency funds from the Fund. In-kind contributions from non-Federal sources can also be applied towards the non-Federal share. The term 'emergency assistance' refers to aid provided for stranding or entangling events that result in immediate increased costs exceeding regular expenses, and may be cyclical or endemic. The Secretary may solicit, accept, receive, hold, administer, and use gifts, devises, and bequests without further approval for emergency assistance. The John H. Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue and Response Funding Program authorizes appropriations for the Marine Mammal Unusual Mortality Event Fund for fiscal years 2010 through 2014."
