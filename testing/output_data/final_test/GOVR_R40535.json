    "content": "Disconnected youth, who are neither working nor in school, may struggle to transition to adulthood, lacking skills, knowledge, and social networks. This can lead to difficulties in attaining self-sufficiency, health insurance, and building a work history for future employability. The federal government has an interest in connecting these youth to school and work to avoid higher costs in adulthood and lost tax revenue. The report aims to provide Congress with a demographic profile of disconnected youth, who are neither working nor in school, to aid discussions on improving outcomes for at-risk high school students. Research has been conducted since the late 1990s to identify and characterize this population, with estimates varying based on definitions and methodologies used in studies. The Congressional Research Service analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau to gain a better understanding of disconnected youth. The Congressional Research Service analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) to the Current Population Survey (CPS) to define disconnected youth as noninstitutionalized individuals aged 16-24 not working or in school during the survey period. The analysis does not include individuals in institutional settings like college dorms or military quarters. The Congressional Research Service defines disconnected youth as noninstitutionalized individuals aged 16-24 not working or in school. In 2014, 2.4 million youth met this definition, representing 6.1% of the population in this age group. The CRS analysis excludes youth who are married to a connected spouse and parenting, resulting in a smaller number of disconnected youth compared to other studies. The CRS analysis of disconnected youth in 2014 found that a greater share of female and minority youth tend to be disconnected. Disconnected youth have fewer years of education, are more likely to live apart from their parents, and be poor. Parents of disconnected youth are more likely to be unemployed and have lower educational attainment. The analysis examines trends in disconnectedness from 1988 to 2014, with rates ranging from 3.9% to 7.5%. Disconnection rates for females are consistently higher than males, except in 2010. Black males had the highest rates of disconnection. Disconnection rates were highest among 19 to 24-year-olds. Congress is increasingly interested in youth not working or in school. The report discusses the characteristics of disconnected youth aged 16-24 and the legislative efforts to assist them. Congress has shown interest in policies to support youth not in school or working, with notable legislation including Performance Partnership Pilots (P3). The FY2014 and FY2015 appropriations laws authorized up to 10 Performance Partnership Pilot projects to assist disconnected youth aged 14 to 24 in achieving educational and employment goals. Federal agencies can use discretionary funding for projects targeting disconnected youth or preventing youth from becoming disconnected. The law allows federal agencies to enter agreements with states, localities, or tribal communities for flexibility in using discretionary funds across programs. Pilots must identify populations, outcomes, and measurement methods. Agencies must ensure participation does not restrict eligibility or harm vulnerable populations. Agencies may seek waivers for program requirements to achieve pilot outcomes, with limitations on waivers related to non-discrimination, wage standards, and fund allocation. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA, P.L. 113-128) replaced the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) as the primary federal workforce law in July 2015. It allows the Secretary of Labor to study eligible youth disconnected from education and workforce participation to provide them with better opportunities for education and employment. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5) provided federal funding for economic recovery programs. The omnibus law allocated $1.2 billion for programs under the Workforce Investment Act, extending eligibility for youth up to age 24. Businesses hiring disconnected youth could qualify for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. The College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2008 did not define disconnected youth but identified disconnected students as those with language barriers, disabilities, or from underrepresented groups in higher education. The law expanded eligibility for programs under the Higher Education Act to include students traditionally underrepresented in postsecondary education, such as those with disabilities, homeless children, youths, and those in or aging out of foster care. These students, along with other disconnected students, are now eligible for TRIO programs that offer college preparation services. Research on disconnected youth from 1999 to 2014 found 10 relevant studies that highlight the challenges faced by this population. The review identified ten studies on disconnected youth conducted by federal agencies or non-governmental organizations. The studies varied in methodology, definitions of the population, and findings. Estimates of the number of disconnected youth differed due to various factors. Most studies were cross-sectional, while some were longitudinal and tracked youth's connection to work and school over multiple years. The studies on disconnected youth tracked their connection to work and school over multiple years using various data sets. Estimates of the actual number of disconnected youth varied, with percentages ranging from 7% to 20% of the youth population. One study found that on average, 5.2 million youth ages 16 to 24 were not working or in school at a given point in time. The studies on disconnected youth tracked their connection to work and school over multiple years using various data sets. Estimates of the actual number of disconnected youth varied, with percentages ranging from 7% to 20% of the youth population. One study found that on average, 5.2 million youth ages 16 to 24 were not working or in school at a given point in time. The studies counted youth as young as age 16 and as old as age 24, with ages in between. Definitions of disconnected youth varied, including criteria such as not working or in school for at least the previous year before being surveyed, and not being married. The studies on disconnected youth tracked their connection to work and school over multiple years using various data sets. Estimates of the actual number of disconnected youth varied, with percentages ranging from 7% to 20% of the youth population. Definitions of disconnected youth varied, including criteria such as not working or in school for at least the previous year before being surveyed, and not being married. Some studies included incarcerated youth and youth in the Armed Forces, while others focused on non-institutionalized youth. Adding youth in institutional settings like prisons or juvenile justice facilities could affect the number and share of disconnected youth. The College Cost Reduction Act did not define \"disconnected youth\" but identified vulnerable youth like runaway and homeless youth as eligible for educational support services. Studies classified disadvantaged youth as vulnerable to becoming disconnected due to negative outcomes they face. Females were found to be an equal or greater share of disconnected youth. According to analysis of CPS data, disconnected youth aged 16-19, not in school or working, were found to be around 7-10% annually from 1986 to 2006. In 2006, 8.1% of females and 7.1% of males were disconnected. A study in 2001 showed 18% of females and 11% of males were disconnected, with 44% of them being high school dropouts. White and Asian youth were less likely to be disconnected than other racial and ethnic groups. In 2011, rates of disconnection among youth ages 16-19 varied by race. In 2011, disconnection rates among youth ages 16-19 by racial category were: 5% for non-Hispanic Asian and Pacific Islanders, 7% for non-Hispanic whites, 12% for Hispanics, and 13% for non-Hispanic blacks. Black and Hispanic youth were overrepresented among disconnected youth in a 2012 study. Factors contributing to disconnection include parental education, receipt of public assistance, race, and ethnicity. Disconnection was associated with being black and parental receipt of government aid. Long-term disconnected youth tended to have certain personal characteristics. Young men who are disconnected, defined as not working or in school for at least 26 weeks in three or more years, and unmarried, often come from backgrounds of family poverty, welfare receipt, and low parent education. For instance, 35% of disconnected men were from poor families, 26% from families receiving welfare, 28% from single-parent families, and 45% had a parent without a high school degree. Additionally, nearly 90% of those disconnected at age 20 to 23 were first disconnected as teenagers. Teens from low-income families and those with parents who did not finish high school were more likely to be disengaged. The CRS analysis provides a narrow definition of disconnected youth, excluding those not working or in school for an extended period. It also excludes youth who are married to a connected spouse and parenting, assuming they receive support from their spouses. The CRS analysis defines disconnected youth as those aged 16-24 who did not work in the previous year for reasons other than school attendance, marriage, or parenting. These youth are more likely to have unemployed parents with lower educational attainment. 2.4 million youth, or 6.1% of the population, meet this definition. The analysis includes youth aged 16 to 24 who were not working in the previous year for reasons other than school, and were not working or in school at the time of the survey. Reasons for not working could include being ill, disabled, taking care of family, or unable to find work. The study includes youth as young as 16 preparing for post-secondary education and older youth transitioning to adulthood. Many young people in their mid-20s may attend school, work, or live with relatives. According to social science research, factors like delayed marriage age, high living costs, and more educational opportunities have prolonged the transition from adolescence to adulthood. The analysis does not include individuals in institutional settings like prisons, jails, or homeless individuals, which could significantly increase the number of disconnected youth. The analysis of disconnected youth does not account for those in institutional settings like prisons or homeless individuals, which could increase the number significantly. Some disconnected youth may rely on informal networks for support, but these may not lead to long-term stability. Nearly half of disconnected youth live in poverty. The definition of disconnected youth does not capture those who are disconnected for periods. The analysis of disconnected youth shows that those disconnected for three years or more face more negative outcomes. Disconnected youth are more likely to be female, black or Hispanic, and in their early- to mid-twenties. Disability is a factor for some youth not working or in school, with about one-third citing disability as the reason. Among the disconnected youth, over two-fifths had a severe disability, while 26% had childrearing or homemaking responsibilities. Female parents were well represented in this population, although their rates have declined over time. It is unclear how much having a disability or home responsibilities affects their engagement in school or work. Some may respond to questions in a socially appropriate manner. Disconnected youth, including those with severe disabilities or childrearing responsibilities, may respond to questions in a socially appropriate manner. Over one-third of youth reported no limitations keeping them from work, potentially due to undiagnosed disabilities. Future research is needed to understand the reasons for disconnection and its impact on education and employment opportunities. About 3 out of 10 disconnected youth aged 19-24 lack a high school diploma, making it challenging for them to secure stable, well-paying employment. Even with additional education beyond high school, these youth still face high levels of poverty compared to their connected peers. Additional research is needed to understand how poor disconnected youth are managing financially, with some potentially receiving assistance through informal networks. The analysis in this report focuses on disconnected youth who may be eligible for federal assistance programs but are not captured in household surveys. The CPS does not include homeless individuals, those in jails or residential facilities, or youth in college dorms or military bases. Additional research is needed to incorporate these groups and understand the characteristics of disconnected youths' parents. The analysis in this report suggests that youth disconnection may be intergenerational, with a significant number of parents of disconnected youth not working or having a high school diploma. Family characteristics and related factors likely influence disconnectedness, as shown in Figures 9 and 10. Further research is needed to understand the characteristics of disconnected youths' parents. The connection between poverty, family background, living arrangements, and youth disconnectedness is complex. Disconnected youth living apart from parents have a higher poverty rate compared to connected youth. Even when living with parents, disconnected youth are more likely to be poor. This suggests that poverty and disconnectedness are interrelated factors influencing each other. Disconnected youth are more likely to live with only one parent (33.7%) compared to both parents (30.1%), while connected youth are more likely to live with both parents (46.6%) than just one (22.8%). Disconnected youth are also twice as likely to have parents who have not completed high school, with 25.6% in single-parent families and 25.4% in two-parent families. Additionally, disconnected youth are more likely to have a parent who is not working at the time of the survey. Among disconnected youth, those living with only one parent have a higher percentage of nonworking parents (49.7%) compared to connected youth (25.6%). Similarly, among disconnected youth living with both parents, the percentage of neither parent working is almost three times higher (16.1%) than connected youth (5.3%). Research shows that living in poverty negatively impacts children's outcomes, leading to lower test scores, lower educational attainment, and higher likelihood of teenage pregnancy among poor adolescents. Research indicates that poverty's lasting effects on children are most significant for those who experience persistent or deep poverty at a young age. Factors such as a safe home environment and parental characteristics play a crucial role in children's life chances, alongside income. Poverty among adolescents is linked to lower high school graduation rates, college attendance, and years of schooling. In 2009, the high school dropout rate for students from low-income families was more than double that of middle-income students and five times higher than high-income peers. Research indicates that poverty's lasting effects on children are most significant for those who experience persistent or deep poverty at a young age. Adolescents in poverty have lower high school graduation rates, college attendance, and years of schooling compared to their peers. The relationship between adolescent poverty and educational attainment weakens when controlling for variables like parental education and family structure. The researchers found that growing up in poverty during adolescence does not directly impact educational outcomes, but over a longer period, it does affect educational attainment. Data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics showed that the number of years spent in poverty during childhood predicts high school graduation. Additionally, growing up with a single parent decreases the likelihood of completing high school. Disconnected youth in 2014, not working or in school, had various reasons such as caring for family, illness, or inability to find work. A significant portion were taking care of home or family, with over half having a child. Data from the CPS shows trends in disconnection from 1988 to 2014, focusing on demographics like sex, age, and race/ethnicity. In 2014, about 34% of disconnected youth did not work due to illness or disability, with many having severe disabilities. Over two-fifths of disabled individuals received Supplemental Security Income or Medicare. Around 36% of disconnected youth couldn't find work and didn't have a disability or caregiving responsibilities. Demographic characteristics of disconnected and connected peers aged 16-24 in 2014 are compared in Table 1. In 2014, 2.4 million youth aged 16-24 were disconnected, with females slightly more likely to be disconnected. Minority youth were also more likely to be disconnected, with black youth having the highest disconnection rate at 10.8%. Younger youth were more likely to be disconnected compared to older peers. Disconnected youth had lower education attainment, lived apart from parents, and were more likely to be poor. In 2014, 2.4 million youth aged 16-24 were disconnected, with females slightly more likely to be disconnected. The higher rates for females may be explained by their higher likelihood of parenting responsibilities. Overall, 2.2% of females and 0.3% of males were disconnected and parenting, possibly impacting their ability to work or attend school. In 2014, an estimated 13.5% of youth were not connected due to caregiving responsibilities. Females without children were less likely to be disconnected compared to males without children. Minority youth had higher rates of disconnection than white peers, with black males showing a substantially higher disconnection rate. In 2014, black males had a disconnection rate of 13.1%, three times higher than white males (4.6%) and more than twice that of Hispanic males (5.3%). Black females also had a higher disconnection rate compared to white and Hispanic females. Parenting was associated with higher disconnectedness among females. Overall, 2% of disconnected females and 0.3% of disconnected males were parents in 2014. Disconnected black and Hispanic females had a higher rate of parenting compared to white females. If parenting status did not play a role, females would have a lower disconnection rate than males. CRS evaluated the educational attainment of disconnected youth aged 19-24 based on highest level of education completed. Higher educational attainment is linked to higher earnings and lower unemployment rates. Earnings differences have increased over time among workers with varying levels of education. In 2013, higher earnings and lower unemployment rates were associated with higher educational attainment among persons 25 and older. For example, those with less than a high school diploma had median weekly earnings of $488 and an unemployment rate of 9.0%, while high school graduates had $668 and 6.0%, respectively. Bachelor's degree holders earned $1,101 with a 3.5% unemployment rate. Disconnected youth, with lower education levels, face challenges in securing higher-paying jobs.Disconnected youth aged 19-24 have fewer years of schooling compared to connected youth. In 2014, 27.3% of disconnected youth in the 19-21 age group lacked a diploma or GED. In 2013, one-quarter of disconnected youth lacked a diploma or GED, compared to about one out of ten connected youth. Poverty may be both a cause and consequence of youth disconnectedness, with growing up poor contributing to the likelihood of being disconnected. Being disconnected may also lead to youth being poor, especially among those no longer living at home with family support. In 2013, 44.0% of all disconnected youth were considered poor, compared to 16.8% of their connected peers. Poverty thresholds vary by family size and composition, with different income levels determining poverty status for youth living alone or with family members. In 2013, poverty rates for disconnected youth increased with age, with over half of youth aged 22-24 in poor households. Educational attainment is strongly correlated with poverty status, as connected youth working or in school had lower poverty rates. Disconnected youth aged 19-24 with lower educational attainment are more likely to be in poverty compared to connected youth. However, higher educational attainment provides a buffer from poverty, with those with some schooling beyond high school having lower poverty rates than those without a high school diploma. The transition to adulthood for young people today is longer and more complex, with many relying on their families for financial support. Disconnected youth, who lack family or social supports, may be less likely to live with their parents. Disconnected youth tend to have different family structures compared to their peers, with a higher likelihood of living with only one parent or no parent at all. Research shows that children raised in mother-only families are more likely to experience negative outcomes, such as poverty-level incomes. Nearly one in five disconnected youth aged 16-18 live apart from parents, lacking parental support. Older connected youth aged 22-24 are more likely to live independently. Disconnected youth are more likely to be poor, even when living with both parents. Among youth living with both parents, disconnected youth were almost three times more likely than connected youth to be poor. Poverty rates were higher for youth living in single-parent families, but the poverty rate of disconnected youth in single-parent families was twice that of connected youth. Poverty rates were highest among youth living apart from their parents, with 65.3% of disconnected youth being poor. Approximately 1.5 million disconnected youth lived with their parents. The analysis compared the education and employment status of parents of disconnected and connected youth in single-parent and dual-parent households in 2014. Parents of disconnected youth were more likely to lack a high school diploma or its equivalent, especially in single-parent households. Disconnected youth have parents with lower education levels and higher unemployment rates compared to their connected counterparts, contributing to higher poverty rates among disconnected youth. Disconnected youths have higher poverty rates compared to their connected counterparts, often living in single-parent families with parents who have lower education levels and higher unemployment rates. These factors contribute to whether a youth becomes disconnected or stays connected during the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Trends over the past 27 years show a 6.1% overall rate of disconnection among youth ages 16 through 24. The overall rate of disconnection among youth ages 16 through 24 has varied over the past 27 years, ranging from 3.9% to 7.5%. Disconnection rates follow economic cycles, peaking during recessions. Unemployment is a key factor in disconnection, with rates rising during economic downturns. Disconnection rates among 16 to 24 year olds rose during the economic recession, peaking at 7.5% in 2010 before falling to 6.1% in 2014. Females consistently had higher disconnection rates than males, with single parenthood being a contributing factor. The presence of a child could make it difficult for young women to connect to work or school. The trends in disconnection rates for males and females paralleled each other from 1988 to 2014, with a divergence in 2005-2008. Disconnection rates were consistently lower for 16-18 year olds compared to older age groups. Male rates for 19-21 year olds were slightly higher than those for 22-24 year olds since 1998. Disconnection rates for males and females aged 22-24 have been higher since 1998, with some fluctuations in recent years. Females in this age group saw a significant increase in disconnection rates from 1999 to 2011. Disconnection rates doubled from 1999 to 2011, with females aged 19-21 experiencing a significant increase. Minorities, especially black males, are overrepresented among disconnected youth. The disconnection rate of black males was historically high in 2003, 9.8 percentage points above white males and 8.9 percentage points above Hispanic males. Black males were nearly five times more likely to be disconnected than white males. The rate dropped to 6.8% in 2008 but increased again in 2009 and 2010, reaching 13.1% in 2014. In contrast, Hispanic and white males saw decreases in disconnection rates during the same period. The disconnection rates among Hispanic and white males decreased from 2010 to 2014. Hispanic and white males had similar rates of disconnection in 2013 and 2014. Disconnection rates for black and Hispanic females were consistently higher than white females, with white females experiencing an increase since 2000. Black females saw a significant reduction in disconnection rates from 1993 to 1999, followed by an increase in subsequent years. The disconnection rates for black, Hispanic, and white females fluctuated over the years. Black females experienced a significant reduction in disconnection rates, particularly among youth, possibly due to fewer childbearing instances. The disconnection rates among black, Hispanic, and white females fluctuated over the years. In 1999, 6.3% of disconnected black female youth, with 2.9% having a child. Overall, there was an increase in youth disconnection rates in 2014 compared to 1988, with variations among racial and ethnic groups. Single parenting females, especially young black women, saw a decline in disconnection rates since the mid-1990s, following economic cycles. During economic expansions, rates of youth disconnection decrease. Factors contributing to this decline include the Earned Income Tax Credit, welfare reform, and declining teen birth rates. The data in the report end in 2013 and early 2014, four years after the last recession. Overall, the youth disconnection rates are expected to stabilize in the current economy. The rate of disconnection among females without children has been rising, but young single mothers are more likely to be connected to school or work. The overall rate of disconnection for females may not reach the levels seen in the early 1990s. Since the mid-1990s to around 2000, the likelihood of younger single mothers being connected to work or school increased, and their rate of disconnection decreased. However, their rate of disconnection has since increased, but not yet to the levels seen in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Being connected to work or school is important for youth and society, as the costs of disconnection are significant. Youth who are disconnected may face challenges in gaining experience for better job opportunities, leading to a higher likelihood of living in poverty. Additionally, the children of disconnected youth are at risk of growing up in poverty, with potential long-term consequences. There is a potential financial burden on society if disconnected youth rely on assistance programs or become homeless. Society has a strong interest in ensuring that all young people have the education and skills to become skilled workers and contributing taxpayers. Interventions to connect youth to school and work depend on various factors, including family stability, economic circumstances, and education. Timing of interventions can target early childhood, middle school, or high school years, influencing developmental outcomes. Markers of risk and problem behaviors in youth, influenced by innate and inherited characteristics, can impact their transition to adulthood. These markers include low school performance, involvement in the child welfare system, early sexual experimentation, truancy, substance use, running away from home, and association with delinquent peers. Investments in early childhood can help mitigate these risks and improve outcomes. Investments in early childhood can serve as a protective factor against poor outcomes, especially when coupled with interventions during the elementary school years. Research also suggests benefits of intervening at an older age for at-risk youth. Interventions targeting youth throughout their early life, from infancy to young adulthood, may be beneficial, particularly for those showing markers of risk like low school performance. Interventions can focus on various institutions or systems such as family, community, schools, and job training programs to address reasons why youth are not engaged in education or employment. Interventions for disconnected youth can include parenting support, early parenting classes, and community services for youth with disabilities. Involving fathers in childrearing through responsible fatherhood programs can also benefit young single mothers. Interventions for disconnected youth may involve child support, child care assistance, programs to delay childbearing, school/job training with wraparound services, and sexual education. These interventions aim to address various aspects of a youth's circumstances, as no single intervention is a cure-all."
