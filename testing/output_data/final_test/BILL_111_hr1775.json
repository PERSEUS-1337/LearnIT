    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Grants for Renewable Energy Education for the Nation Act\" or the \"GREEN Act\". Congress recognizes the importance of career and technical education in supporting the economy, the need for renewable energy development, and the potential for millions of workers to benefit from transitioning to a green economy. The American Solar Energy Society report attributed 8.5 million jobs in 2006 to renewable energy industries. The Apollo Alliance predicts 3 to 5 million more green jobs in the next 10 years. Over 40% of fast-growing occupations will require vocational training. The National Association of Manufacturers reported a shortage of qualified workers, with 13% facing severe shortages. Career and technical education graduates have better job prospects. Career and technical education graduates have better job prospects, are more likely to be in the labor force, and earn more than high school graduates. These programs require support in acquiring the latest technology to prepare students for the renewable energy field. Renewable energy curriculum development grants are available to support career and technical education programs in preparing students for the renewable energy field. The Secretary of Education can award grants to eligible partnerships to develop programs of study focused on emerging careers in renewable energy. Eligible partnerships must include local education agencies and postsecondary institutions. An eligible partnership seeking a grant under this section must submit an application to the Secretary, including partner descriptions, program details, and evidence of labor market need. The application for a grant must include a description of the program of study, the students to be served, how the program will be replicable and disseminated, applied learning components, delivery methods, accessibility for economically disadvantaged students, and placement strategies. The program must address student placement in non-traditional fields and prioritize applications using online learning for program delivery. A peer review process will assess grant applications and recommend grantees. The peer review committee for grants in renewable energy education includes educators and industry experts. Funds are to be used for developing and disseminating programs related to energy sustainability. SEC. 4. RENEWABLE ENERGY FACILITIES GRANTS. The Secretary of Education can award grants to eligible entities for developing energy-efficient career and technical education facilities that promote renewable energy practices. Eligible entities include local education agencies, area career and technical education schools, education service agencies, and postsecondary institutions. Applicants must submit a grant application to the Secretary. The Secretary will convene a peer review process to evaluate grant applications for energy-efficient career and technical education facilities. The peer review committee will include education administrators with experience in energy efficiency and business experts in renewable energy. Grants will be used for sustainability evaluations and stakeholder engagement. Initiating activities related to the construction, operation, and improvement of facilities promoting renewable energy practices, purchasing energy-efficient equipment for educational purposes, measuring facility effectiveness, and sharing lessons learned. Communicating lessons and practices learned from building upgrades to other institutions. Authorization of $100,000,000 for the Secretary of Education for grant program under this Act."
