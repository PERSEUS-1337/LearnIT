    "content": "The Act titled \"Fixing America's Inequities with Revenues Act of 2013\" or \"FAIR Act of 2013\" focuses on the distribution of revenues to coastal states, amending Section 9 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The curr_chunk defines \"alternative and renewable energy\" as energy from wind, solar, biomass, or ocean sources, and \"coastal political subdivision\" as a county-equivalent subdivision within a coastal State's coastal zone. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of terms related to coastal state revenue sharing for outer continental shelf energy sources, including the definition of a coastal state as a state with a seaward boundary within 200 nautical miles of a leased tract. The Secretary of the Interior is referred to as the \"Secretary\" in this context. For fiscal year 2013 and onwards, the Secretary of the Treasury deposits 37.5% of energy development revenues from outer Continental Shelf areas into the Treasury. 27.5% of these revenues are disbursed to coastal States and political subdivisions, with an additional 10% to coastal States with established funds. Coastal States establish funds in their treasuries to support projects related to alternative and renewable energy, research, development, efficiency, and conservation. Revenues from leases are excluded, and allocation among states is based on a formula established by the Secretary. The Secretary establishes a formula for allocating revenues from leased tracts among Coastal States based on distances from the coastline. Each state's share is limited to tracts within 200 nautical miles. 25% of the state's share is paid to coastal political subdivisions. The Secretary allocates revenues to coastal political subdivisions based on a formula, with 25% of the state's share allocated to them. In Alaska, 90% of the amount paid by the Secretary is allocated for this purpose. The Secretary allocates 90 percent of revenues to coastal political subdivisions based on a formula that considers the distances between points in each subdivision and the leased tract's center. The remaining 10 percent is divided equally among eligible subdivisions. The Secretary ensures that revenues from alternative and renewable energy sources on the outer Continental Shelf are distributed among coastal States based on distance from leased tracts and staging areas for oil and gas operations in Alaska. The Secretary of the Treasury disburses 50 percent of revenues from onshore energy sources to the State where the energy source is located. SEC. 3. DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUES TO GULF PRODUCING STATES. The definition of Qualified Outer Continental Shelf Revenues under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 is amended to include rentals, royalties, bonus bids, and other sums received from leases for specific areas. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 is amended to change dates in subsection (b) and limit the amount of distributed revenues to Gulf producing states in subsection (f). The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 is amended to limit the total amount of qualified outer Continental Shelf revenues distributed to Gulf producing states to $500 million per fiscal year, with an increase to $600 million for fiscal year 2014 and subsequent years increasing by $100 million annually. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 limits qualified outer Continental Shelf revenues distributed to Gulf producing states to $500 million per fiscal year, increasing by $100 million annually for subsequent years. Revenues for 2024 and beyond will be allocated without limitation to Gulf producing states. If the limit is reached, reductions will be made on a pro rata basis. Any remaining revenues will revert to the general fund. Continental Shelf revenues will revert to the Treasury's general fund. The Act and its amendments will be effective starting October 1, 2012."
