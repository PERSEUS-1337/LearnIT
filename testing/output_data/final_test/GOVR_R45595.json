    "content": "Several federal laws, including the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), impact students with disabilities in the P-12 public education system. The application of these laws may change during transitions between school levels or when moving to postsecondary education. Transitioning from the P-12 public education system to an institution of higher education may impact how students with disabilities are assessed, their eligibility for accommodations, and the supports available to them. This report examines the laws' impact on defining disability, determining eligibility, and ensuring students receive necessary accommodations. In 1973, Congress enacted civil rights statutes like Section 504 to protect individuals with disabilities. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides broad antidiscrimination protections for individuals with disabilities, ensuring their inclusion in programs receiving federal financial assistance. This provision extends beyond P-12 public schools to cover postsecondary education, employment, and access to public facilities. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides broad antidiscrimination protections for individuals with disabilities in various settings, including education and employment. The U.S. Department of Education enforces separate regulations for different education levels under Section 504, with nearly 1 million public school students receiving accommodations in the 2013-2014 school year. In the 2013-2014 school year, nearly 1 million public school students received services under Section 504. In the postsecondary level, approximately 19.5% of undergraduates and 12.0% of post-baccalaureate students reported having a disability. The Education for All Handicapped Children Act, later renamed IDEA, focused on children with disabilities' access to education, addressing the lack of appropriate services for many children with disabilities. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) mandates states to identify and evaluate all children with disabilities to ensure they receive a free appropriate public education. The act, administered by the Office of Special Education Programs, supplements funding for educating children with disabilities. Part B of the act is particularly important in protecting children with disabilities. Part B of the IDEA ensures children with disabilities, aged 3 through 21, receive a \"free appropriate public education.\" Approximately 7 million students fall under this provision, representing 13.6% of P-12 public school students. The ADA provides broad nondiscrimination protection for individuals with disabilities, with Title II specifically prohibiting discrimination in public entities like schools. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 broadened the scope of the ADA's definition of disabilities, extending coverage to public and some private P-12 schools and postsecondary IHEs. Approximately 12.7% of the population reported having a disability in 2017, including 4.2% of children under 18 and 6.4% of adults aged 18 to 34. These individuals are protected by the ADA when accessing most services. The IDEA defines a \"child with a disability\" as someone with one of 13 specified conditions, requiring special education services to benefit from public education. Eligibility for services under the IDEA is based on having a documented disability falling within the specified categories and needing special education. The IDEA provides specially designed instruction or special education tailored to a child's individual needs through an individualized education program (IEP). Disability categories are broadly defined, allowing states to adopt more specific requirements as long as they do not exclude eligible children. In its IDEA regulations, ED has provided a complex definition of the Other Health Impairment (OHI) category, listing examples of disorders that may qualify. Some states have further elaborated on this definition, particularly regarding the impact on a child's educational performance. Delaware, for instance, outlines criteria for determining if children with ADD or ADHD have an OHI, requiring evaluators to consider additional factors and symptoms. Some states have additional criteria for determining if children with ADD or ADHD have an Other Health Impairment (OHI), beyond what is outlined in ED's IDEA regulations. The definition of \"disability\" in Sections 504 and the ADA is broader and not limited to the educational context, protecting individuals with any impairment affecting bodily or intellectual functions. The ADA and Section 504 protect individuals with impairments affecting bodily or intellectual functions, not limited to specific disability categories. The ADA Amendments Act broadens the definition of disability to ensure broad coverage. The ADA Amendments Act broadens the definition of disability to ensure broad coverage, including interpreting \"substantially limits\" consistently with the findings and purposes of the Act, considering impairments that are episodic or in remission as disabilities, and making determinations without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures. The Act also applies more generous rules of construction to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The ADA Amendments Act broadens the definition of disability and applies more generous rules of construction to Section 504. ED enforces regulations implementing Section 504 and Title II of the ADA consistently with the ADA Amendments Act. The IDEA covers children with disabilities receiving financial assistance under the act, but not those in college or postsecondary programs. Section 504 applies to preschool, elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education. The ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities by public entities like public schools. The IDEA, Section 504, and the ADA have key provisions that apply in different education settings. The IDEA requires states to have policies for identifying children with disabilities, known as \"Child Find.\" Section 504 and the ADA also have similar provisions for recipients of federal money. Section 504 and the ADA require recipients of federal money in public schools to identify and evaluate qualified handicapped individuals. In colleges and universities, students must provide documentation of their disabilities and work with disability support services for accommodations. Individuals with disabilities must be evaluated by their LEA before receiving special education under IDEA or Section 504. The ADA does not have this requirement. To qualify for an IEP under IDEA, a student must have a qualifying disability that affects their educational performance. However, a student with a disability that does not impact their performance may still qualify for a plan under Section 504. Either a parent or the LEA can request an initial evaluation under IDEA, with parental consent needed before the evaluation. Parental consent for evaluation does not imply consent for special education. Under Section 504, parental consent is required for an initial evaluation, but not for special education services. The evaluation must be conducted within 60 days of receiving consent. If parental consent is withheld, due process hearing procedures can be used to override the denial. The IDEA and Section 504 regulations require LEAs to use valid assessment tools tailored to assess a child's educational needs and to gather information from multiple sources to determine eligibility for services. If parental consent is denied for an initial evaluation, due process hearing procedures can be used to override the denial. The IDEA and Section 504 regulations mandate LEAs to utilize various sources of information, including tests, teacher recommendations, and adaptive behavior, when interpreting evaluation data. Assessments must be non-discriminatory based on race or culture, administered in the child's preferred language, and consider academic, developmental, and functional abilities. Section 504 regulations do not address native language or cultural bias in evaluation materials but emphasize the importance of considering social or cultural background information. LEAs should consider social or cultural background information in interpreting evaluation data and making placement decisions for children with disabilities under the IDEA. While Section 504 regulations do not require parental participation in placement decisions, they do emphasize the importance of a group knowledgeable about the child, evaluation data, and placement options making these decisions. Additionally, Section 504 regulations mandate LEAs to have procedural safeguards in place, including notice and the opportunity for parents to examine relevant records. Under IDEA regulation, reevaluations are required if a child's teacher or parent makes a request or if the LEA determines that a child's educational and service needs warrant reevaluation. This may be necessary if a child's performance significantly improves, indicating they may no longer need special education services, or if they are not progressing towards their IEP goals. Reevaluations cannot be done more than once a year unless agreed upon by parents and the LEA, and must be conducted at least once every three years unless otherwise agreed upon. Reevaluations under IDEA and Section 504 regulations must be done at least once every three years, unless agreed otherwise. Parental consent is required for reevaluation, and changes to a child's eligibility for services cannot be made without it. Postsecondary institutions are not responsible for evaluating students for disabilities. Before the ADA Amendments Act in 2008, there was confusion among IHEs regarding documentation requirements for students requesting disability accommodations. Different institutions had varying criteria, with some requiring recent evaluations while others mandated comprehensive evaluations no more than three years old. Before the ADA Amendments Act in 2008, there was confusion among IHEs regarding documentation requirements for students requesting disability accommodations. IDEA guidelines required comprehensive evaluations no more than three years old for certain students, such as returning postsecondary students, those previously served under Section 504, and students with disabilities last evaluated in ninth grade or earlier. These students needed to be reevaluated at their own expense to receive accommodations at the postsecondary level. Several courts had previously struck down triennial evaluation requirements used by colleges and universities. The ADA Amendments Act broadened the protection for individuals with disabilities, emphasizing compliance with obligations and prevention of discrimination rather than focusing on the definition of \"disability.\" The Act aims to make it easier for people with disabilities to obtain protection under the ADA by interpreting the definition of \"disability\" broadly for expansive coverage. Since the passage of the ADA Amendments Act, guidance for disability support services in higher education emphasizes broad interpretation of \"disability\" and suggests using past evaluations or external information for determining accommodations. Similar considerations apply to determining public school placement for students with disabilities under IDEA and Section 504. Placement decisions for children with disabilities are governed by both the IDEA and Section 504. The IDEA has more specific provisions on placement decisions, requiring them to be determined annually based on the child's IEP by a knowledgeable group that includes parents. In contrast, Section 504 does not specify timing or require decisions to be based on the child's educational plan or involve parents in the process. Despite some differences, both laws have similarities in their placement provisions. Both the IDEA and Section 504 regulations emphasize placing children with disabilities in the regular educational environment to the maximum extent appropriate. While the IDEA specifies the least restrictive environment (LRE) for providing a free appropriate public education, Section 504 also requires educating children with disabilities alongside their nondisabled peers in academic and nonacademic settings. Under the IDEA, LEAs must provide a continuum of alternative placements for children with disabilities, including instruction in regular classes and supplementary services when needed. Section 504 focuses on preventing discrimination against children with disabilities in their placements, ensuring they can participate in academic and nonacademic activities alongside their nondisabled peers. The Section 504 regulations do not mandate an IEP for children with disabilities attending specialized facilities, but require services to be comparable to other facilities. Unlike the IDEA, Section 504 does not specify the composition of a student's educational plan team. Accommodations in a student's IEP or 504 plan must be implemented in all classes. IEP or 504 plan must be implemented in all classes, including accelerated programs like Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate. Denying students with disabilities access to these programs violates Section 504 regulations and IDEA. Both regulations make it unlawful to deny admission based solely on the need for special education. IDEA also provides benefits to eligible children in private schools. The IDEA and ED's regulations extensively address children with disabilities in private schools, covering funding, responsibilities of LEAs and SEAs, procedural safeguards, and private school placements. Provisions focus on children placed by public agencies or parents, outlining responsibilities of SEAs, LEAs, private schools, and parents based on who decided on the placement. In contrast, Section 504 regulations address access to programs like Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate for students with disabilities. Under Section 504 regulations, private schools receiving federal funds must not exclude students with disabilities if they can be accommodated within the school's program. They are also not allowed to charge more for educating students with disabilities unless justified by a substantial increase in cost. The IDEA requires IEP teams to include postsecondary transition goals and services for students starting at age 16. Transition services are individualized and may include assistance with college applications, accommodations, self-advocacy skills, and other services. However, these services end once students leave the P-12 system and enter an IHE. At the postsecondary level, Section 504 and the ADA provide nondiscrimination protection to students with disabilities. Section 504 and the ADA require postsecondary students with disabilities to self-identify, provide documentation, and arrange accommodations through campus disability support services. These laws protect students from discrimination in eligibility requirements, admissions policies, and post-admission. ADA regulations prohibit discrimination in admissions policies and procedures at institutions, as well as in activities, programs, aid, benefits, or services offered to students. Public accommodations, including IHEs, are also prohibited from imposing eligibility criteria that discriminate against individuals with disabilities. Section 504 regulations extend these protections to admissions testing and private entities offering examinations or courses related to education, requiring accessibility for persons with disabilities. The IDEA, Section 504, and the ADA guarantee students with disabilities a free appropriate public education, with differences in details. The IDEA provides individually tailored educational services, while Title II of the ADA and Section 504 promise nondiscriminatory access to public institutions. Judicial disagreement exists on how violations of these statutes relate to denying eligible children their guarantees. Some lower courts find overlap between violations of IDEA and Section 504, while others require more than just a failure to provide a free appropriate education for a Section 504 violation. Courts may demand a showing of bad faith or gross misjudgment for a Section 504 violation in the context of IDEA's requirements. Part B of the IDEA mandates that every state must provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to disabled children aged 3 to 21 within its borders. An eligible child has a right to this education once a state accepts IDEA's financial assistance, and denial of this education entitles students to legal relief. A FAPE includes special education and related services tailored to meet the unique needs of each disabled child, provided at public expense and meeting state standards. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) mandates that states must provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to disabled children aged 3 to 21. An IEP serves as the primary vehicle for providing FAPE by specifying special education services. The question of what constitutes an \"appropriate\" public education under IDEA is a commonly litigated issue. The Supreme Court's decision in Board of Education v. Rowley set a low bar, requiring adherence to procedural rules and basic conditions to meet FAPE requirements. The Supreme Court addressed the ambiguity in the IDEA's guarantee of a FAPE by setting a standard for what constitutes an appropriate IEP. Some courts required minimal educational benefit, while others demanded more meaningful benefit for the child. This led to a circuit split, prompting the Supreme Court to intervene in 2017. In 2017, the Supreme Court clarified the standard for providing a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) under the IDEA in Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District. The Court emphasized that an IEP must be reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate to their circumstances, with specific considerations for integration into the regular classroom. The Supreme Court's decision in Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District emphasized that an IEP must be ambitious and provide the chance for a child to meet challenging objectives, rejecting the minimalist view of a FAPE. Lower courts have interpreted this as requiring an IEP to confer a meaningful benefit on the child. The Supreme Court's decision in Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District emphasized the need for an IEP to be ambitious and provide a meaningful benefit to the child. The standard for an IEP includes the child's current educational level, short and long-term goals, objective criteria for measuring progress, and specific services. The IDEA only requires LEAs to provide a FAPE until students with disabilities exit high school, while Section 504 and the ADA have no such limit. Section 504 and the ADA protect students of all ages from discrimination based on disability during admissions and enrollment. To receive services under the IDEA, a child must be evaluated and found eligible for an IEP, requiring special education tailored to their unique needs at no cost to parents. Special education under the IDEA includes academic and nonacademic instruction for children with disabilities, along with related services like speech therapy, counseling, and physical therapy. These services aim to help students benefit from special education and may also include supplementary aids and supports in regular education classes. The IDEA ensures that children with disabilities receive special education, related services, and supports to be educated with nondisabled children. A FAPE includes services provided at public expense, meeting SEA standards, and conforming to the student's IEP. Each child must have an IEP outlining the special education and related services provided by the LEA. In contrast, Section 504 defines \"appropriate education\" as regular or special education and related aids and services. The IDEA ensures children with disabilities receive special education and related services, while Section 504 requires regular or special education and related aids and services. Students with disabilities at the postsecondary level must request accommodations from their institution's disability services office. Students with disabilities at postsecondary level can request accommodations from their institution's disability services office by providing necessary documentation. Regulations under Title II of the ADA provide specific requirements for considering such requests, giving weight to past accommodations received in similar situations. Once adequate documentation is provided, students are protected from discrimination based on their disabilities. Section 504 and Title II of the ADA protect students with disabilities from discrimination in postsecondary education. IHEs are responsible for providing accommodations, modifications, or adaptations in various areas such as exams, housing, counseling, and financial assistance."
