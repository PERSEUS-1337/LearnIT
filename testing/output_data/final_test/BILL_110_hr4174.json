    "content": "The \"Federal Ocean Acidification Research And Monitoring Act of 2008\" is also known as the \"FOARAM Act\" and includes sections on findings, definitions, interagency subcommittee, research plans, and activities by NOAA, NSF, and NASA related to ocean acidification. The Congress finds that the oceans act as a major carbon dioxide sink, but the rapid increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide is overwhelming their ability to absorb it. This influx is changing ocean chemistry, harming organisms like corals, shellfish, and others crucial to the marine food chain and economy. The Congress recognizes the impact of ocean acidification on the national economy, tourism, fisheries, and marine environmental quality. Existing Federal programs support research in ocean chemistry, but gaps in funding, coordination, and outreach hinder progress. A coordinated national investment in research and monitoring would enhance understanding of ocean acidification effects, socioeconomic impacts, and improve marine resource management. The Act aims to develop a comprehensive interagency plan to monitor and research ocean acidification's effects on marine organisms and ecosystems, assess regional and national impacts, and research adaptation strategies for conserving marine ecosystems. SEC. 3 of the Act defines key terms like ocean acidification, Secretary, and Subcommittee. The Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology coordinates Federal activities on ocean acidification. It develops a strategic research plan, assesses impacts on marine organisms, and facilitates communication with NGOs. The Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology coordinates Federal activities on ocean acidification, including working with NGOs and stakeholders, collaborating with other nations' research programs, and establishing an Ocean Acidification Information Exchange. Reports to Congress are also required. The Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology coordinates Federal activities on ocean acidification, including research and monitoring activities, budget summaries, and progress reports on developing required plans. Biennial reports are transmitted to relevant Congressional committees every 2 years. The Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology provides biennial reports to Congressional committees on federally funded ocean acidification research, monitoring activities, budgets, progress towards goals, and a strategic research plan developed under section 5 of the Act. The Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology provides biennial reports to Congressional committees on ocean acidification research. The Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives requires a revised plan to be submitted every 5 years. The Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology provides biennial reports to Congressional committees on ocean acidification research, with a revised plan required to be submitted every 5 years. SEC. 5. STRATEGIC RESEARCH PLAN. The Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology is tasked with developing a strategic plan for Federal research and monitoring on ocean acidification within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The plan will assess impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems, develop adaptation and mitigation strategies, and establish goals and priorities for a 10-year period. The strategic plan for Federal research and monitoring on ocean acidification will advance understanding of its impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems, assess socioeconomic impacts, and develop adaptation and mitigation strategies. Specific activities include determining user needs, research, monitoring, technology development, data collection, and database development. The strategic plan for Federal research on ocean acidification includes data collection, database development, modeling activities, assessment of impacts, and participation in international research efforts. It also involves identifying relevant programs of Federal agencies, utilizing reports and studies, and making recommendations for coordination with other nations and organizations. The strategic plan for Federal research on ocean acidification includes outlining budget requirements, identifying monitoring systems, prioritizing data collection, and facilitating outreach with stakeholders. Program elements involve monitoring ocean chemistry and biological impacts. The program elements for research on ocean acidification include monitoring ocean chemistry and biological impacts, understanding species-specific physiological responses, researching impacts on marine food webs, developing environmental indices, and modeling changes in the ocean carbon cycle. The program elements for research on ocean acidification include monitoring ocean chemistry and biological impacts, understanding species-specific physiological responses, researching impacts on marine food webs, developing environmental indices, and modeling changes in the ocean carbon cycle. This involves assessing impacts on marine ecosystems and organisms, developing technology for carbonate chemistry measurements, evaluating socioeconomic impacts, and consulting with various stakeholders. The Secretary will engage the National Academy of Sciences for evaluation and ensure public participation in the plan development process. When a plan, including revisions, is submitted to Congress, it will be published in the Federal Register for a 60-day public comment period. SEC. 6. NOAA OCEAN ACIDIFICATION ACTIVITIES. The Secretary will conduct research and monitoring activities on ocean acidification, establishing a program within NOAA. This program includes interdisciplinary research, a long-term monitoring program, and research on adaptation. Research will focus on developing adaptation strategies for marine ecosystems facing increased ocean acidification. Educational opportunities and national outreach activities will promote interdisciplinary exploration of ocean acidification impacts. Coordination of monitoring and research efforts will be integrated with other relevant initiatives. The curr_chunk discusses the collaboration with international ocean science bodies, grants for research on ocean acidification effects, and a competitive merit-based process for awarding grants. The Director of the National Science Foundation will continue research activities on ocean acidification, supporting competitive, peer-reviewed proposals focusing on impacts on marine organisms, ecosystems, biogeochemistry, and developing evaluation methodologies. Activities will align with the strategic research plan and encourage coordination with other nations and international organizations. NASA, in coordination with other agencies, will use space-based monitoring assets to monitor ocean acidification and its impacts. Research and monitoring activities will align with the strategic research plan and encourage coordination with other nations and international organizations. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for NOAA and NSF to carry out the purposes of the Act includes specific funding amounts for fiscal years 2009 to 2012.
