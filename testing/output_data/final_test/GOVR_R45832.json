    "content": "The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) is the largest energy consumer in the federal government, spending approximately $11.9 billion on energy in FY2017. Energy efficiency can help reduce agency expenses and improve operational efficiency, leading to less refueling and lower risks in combat zones. The report provides an overview of federal energy management rules applicable to DOD, including statutes and executive orders governing energy use. It excludes nuclear energy for certain military operations and highlights considerations for Congress. Requirements include reducing fossil fuel consumption, increasing renewable energy use, and improving energy efficiency in government fleets and buildings. The Department of Defense (DOD) has energy management requirements to ensure readiness of U.S. armed forces. DOD can suspend certain requirements for operational military needs. Legislation dating back to the 1970s mandates energy reductions for federal agencies, aiming to improve efficiency and reduce fossil fuel dependence. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act directed energy conservation plans and efficiency standards for government procurement. Congress established the Department of Energy in 1977 to address energy concerns. The Department of Energy was established by Congress through the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which authorized alternative financing methods for federal energy projects. Subsequent laws like the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 set energy management requirements for federal agencies. Federal agencies report their energy consumption annually to the Department of Energy. Federal agencies report energy consumption annually to the Department of Energy's Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) as required by EISA Section 527. This information is then summarized by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and evaluated for progress by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate. The compliance status of EISA requirements is compiled into an agency scorecard by the Director of OMB. Additionally, Appendix B contains federal energy management requirements for all agencies. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes provisions related to DOD energy management and authorities. For example, the Secretary of Defense has waiver authority for fuel acquisition. NDAA for FY2000 extended this authority to include \"a defined fuel source.\" This allows waivers for fuel purchase contracts affected by market conditions to expedite acquisition for government needs. Every NDAA since 1993 has a section on \"authorized energy conservation projects.\" The NDAA for FY2007 added renewable energy goals for DOD, requiring 25% of facility energy from renewable sources by FY2025. NDAA for FY2011 directed the development of an Energy Performance Master Plan, while NDAA for FY2015 mandates an annual report on budget adequacy for Operational Energy Strategy objectives. NDAAs address DOD energy security. The NDAA for FY2019 authorized $193 million for DOD energy resilience and conservation programs. Various statutes and executive orders establish guidelines for DOD energy management, with only Executive Order 13834 currently in effect. President Trump issued E.O. 13834 on May 17, 2018, revoking E.O. 13693 and its specific targets for federal agencies. E.O. 13834 directs agencies to meet statutory requirements efficiently, optimize performance, eliminate unnecessary resource use, and protect the environment. The White House Council on Environmental Quality Office of Federal Sustainability provided implementing instructions for E.O. 13834 in April 2019, offering resources, guidance documents, and energy performance data for federal agencies. The Office also lists relevant U.S. code provisions and resources for agencies to follow. DOD issues directives, memorandums, manuals, and guidance instructions to military departments and agencies on complying with statutes and executive orders. DOD Instruction (DODI) 4170.11 and DOD Directive (DODD) 4180.01 provide guidance for energy planning, use, implementation, and management. Military departments are tasked with following agency policies to issue internal energy strategies. The Energy Performance Master Plan requires each military department to develop their own master plans to meet federal requirements. Military departments can have their own goals and guiding documents. The Department of Defense issues directives and guidance to military departments on meeting federal energy requirements. Military departments can have their own goals and documents within statutory and executive order parameters. DOD is mandated to submit annual reports to Congress on energy progress, including the Operational Energy Annual Report and the Annual Energy Management and Resilience Report. DOE issues instructions for federal-wide requirements, such as the renewable electricity consumption mandate under EPAct05. The Department of Defense, under Section 203 of EPAct05, is required to ensure federal government energy requirements are met. DOE issued guidance to federal agencies on meeting these requirements. DOD categorizes energy as \"installation\" or \"operational,\" with installation energy historically representing 30% of DOD total energy. In FY2017, DOD spent $3.48 billion on installation energy and NTV fuels. Operational energy is used for military operations and training, including energy for tactical power systems and generators at non-enduring locations. The federal government reduced total site-delivered energy use by 19.2% from FY2003 to FY2017, with DOD reducing energy use by 20.9% during the same period. DOD's energy use has not been consistent, with an increase during the War in Iraq. Installation energy, representing 30% of DOD total energy use, is subject to federal energy management requirements. The federal energy management requirements for government buildings include energy efficiency targets, renewable energy goals, and fossil fuel reductions for the NTV fleet. The AEMRR FY2017 reported $5.67 billion in total savings compared to an FY2005 baseline. DOD increased installation energy consumption levels by 0.3% from FY2016 to FY2017. Federal agencies are required to achieve a 30% reduction in energy consumption per gross square foot for goal federal buildings by FY2015. Examples of goal buildings include the Army's Holston Ammunition Plant and the Navy's Camp Lemonnier. In FY2017, DOD did not meet the 30% reduction target for building energy intensity, achieving a 16.5% reduction from FY2003 levels. The Army awarded $289.3 million in ESPC and UESC projects in FY2017 to increase building efficiencies and reduce energy intensity. In FY2017, DOD awarded $289.3 million in ESPC and UESC projects to increase building efficiencies and reduce energy intensity, estimated to save 1,132 billion Btu annually. EISA Section 433 requires federal agencies to reduce fossil fuel consumption in new buildings by 80% by FY2020. EPAct05 mandates federal agencies to reach 7.5% total renewable electricity consumption by FY2013. In compliance with EPAct05, agencies must retain ownership of RECs. If DOD sells a REC without replacing it, the renewable electricity produced does not count towards EPAct05 goals. DOD achieved 5% renewable electricity consumption in FY2013 and nearly 6% in FY2017, with solar photovoltaic sources contributing significantly. RECs are created when renewable energy generates electricity, each with a unique ID and monetary value, used by utilities to meet state renewable standards. RECs, with unique IDs and monetary value, are used by utilities to comply with state renewable standards. Ownership of these credits is often a contract stipulation for developers, influenced by state and local requirements. DOD aims to achieve 25% renewable energy by FY2025, with a 2017 interim goal of 8.7% renewable energy consumption. The purchasing of RECs is not mandatory for DOD to meet its renewable energy goals. In FY2017, DOD reduced petroleum consumption in vehicle fleets by 27% compared to FY2005 baseline, reaching a 34.5% reduction in FY2017. The Air Force saw a 9.3% increase in consumption but continues to implement programs to reduce consumption and increase alternative fuel use. Federal agencies under EISA are also required to increase alternative fuel consumption by 10%. In FY2017, DOD met the alternative fuel consumption target of 10.6% but decreased to 9.4% in FY2017. Operational energy, which makes up 70% of DOD's total energy use, cost $8.2 billion in FY2017, with jet fuel accounting for 56% of total consumption. The FY2017 Operational Energy Annual Report shows stable operational energy demand around 87 million barrels of fuel per year from FY2013 to FY2017. The price of oil decreased by 60% in 2014, leading to a 45% reduction in fuel expenditures from $14.8 billion to $8.2 billion. Efficient fuel management by DOD can reduce fuel convoys, saving lives by decreasing exposure and risk in combat zones. Balancing mission operations with increasing efficiency is a challenge that Congress may need to address. Congress may consider federal energy efficiency requirements for DOD's operational energy, updating federal energy management targets, providing oversight on goal implementation, and supporting alternative financing mechanisms. DOD's operational energy policy is mandated by law, requiring a strategy with performance metrics and reports to Congress on budget support for implementation. The proposed Presidential budget supports the implementation of the strategy for DOD's operational energy, which comprises 70% of energy use. Congress may consider setting mission priorities and legislation for operational energy efficiency, including fuel efficiency targets and alternative fuel use requirements. The challenge lies in balancing combat readiness and mission operations while increasing equipment fuel efficiency. The Navy set ambitious energy goals in 2009, aiming to use alternative fuels for half of its consumption by 2020. This included deploying a carrier strike group using alternative fuels and energy-efficient technologies. Critics questioned the Navy's limited analysis in determining these targets. The Navy aimed to use alternative fuels for 50% of its consumption by 2020, with questions raised about how this goal was determined and its attainability. Supporters highlighted the benefits of a diverse fuel supply and domestically produced biofuels to reduce dependence on volatile oil prices. Assistant Secretary of the Navy emphasized the need for more domestically produced fuels to achieve the Navy's energy goals. In 2012 testimony, the Navy highlighted the need for more domestically produced fuels to avoid fuel price volatility. Congress could set targets for accountability. The Great Green Fleet used cost-competitive alternative fuel made from beef tallow and marine diesel. Federal agencies, including DOD, did not reach energy consumption targets for FY2015. Congress may consider new targets or remove statutory targets altogether. Congress may consider removing statutory targets and allowing federal agencies to establish protocols for efficiency and cost reductions that align with their mission. This approach could lead to more easily attainable targets based on budget and mission needs, potentially impacting federal energy use. In 2015, a Task Force convened by the Secretary of Energy reviewed target setting under E.O. 13693, suggesting that uniform energy goals may not be suitable for all agencies due to potential over-investment in energy performance at the expense of other priorities. Agency concerns may include the need for flexibility in setting energy goals. Some agencies may face challenges financing energy efficiency projects to reach targets due to varying energy needs and potential high costs. Setting ambitious targets could be costly and not based on consistent data, with early research and development costs being argued as acceptable for long-term cost reduction. If Congress directs DOD to set a standard, DOD may establish a goal that could impact federal energy use. Setting ambitious targets for energy efficiency projects could be costly, but may drive costs down in the long term. The Navy achieved competitive prices with biofuels, including a 90% diesel blend with 10% biofuel. The federal government's role in adopting new technologies can lead to faster commercial viability. Congress may consider directing DOD to set standards that could impact federal energy use. The 2014 DOE report recommends criteria for establishing baselines for energy efficiency goals, such as weather, data quality, and agency mission operations. A three-year average baseline could help reduce abnormal factors. Congress adjusting baselines could impact agency reporting data and progress perception. The federal government is mandated to reduce fossil fuel consumption by 80% by FY2020 and 100% by FY2030. The rulemaking for this legislation has not been finalized, making it difficult to track progress. Congress may need to direct DOE to finalize the rule or update the legislation. Tracking energy management compliance may incur costs but can show progress towards greater efficiency. The 2016 DOE Task Force report highlights challenges in evaluating energy efficiency in federal projects due to lack of data on building profiles, energy usage, and spending over time. Congress may need to clarify REC ownership in legislation instead of relying on DOE guidance. The 2016 GAO report emphasizes the importance of DOD project documentation for renewable energy goals. The 2016 GAO report found that DOD project documentation for renewable energy goals was unclear, especially in determining if a project contributed to a specific goal. Congress may consider requiring DOD to maintain ownership of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) for energy goals, but this could impact DOD's progress. Some military services may choose to relinquish REC ownership for certain projects, even if they do not qualify for certain energy goals like EPAct05. The Navy has struggled to meet renewable energy consumption targets under EPAct05, allowing others to monetize RECs from financed energy projects. In some cases, military services may give up REC ownership in ESPC/UESC contracts to fund project improvements. DOD has reduced building energy intensity through energy conservation projects but faces challenges in financing mechanisms. ESPCs are preferred for energy efficiency improvements due to their effectiveness. ESPCs and UESCs are preferred for energy efficiency improvements in DOD. With $2.9 billion awarded in FY2017, these contracts help meet renewable energy goals without upfront funds. Congress may enhance effectiveness by increasing training and awareness. DOD is directed to assess ESPCs for potential savings in a Senate Committee report. DOD disagrees with the need for increased training for ESPCs, citing financial risks and lack of guarantee for behavioral changes leading to energy and cost savings. Reports by GAO, DOD IG, and U.S. Army Audit Agency have highlighted challenges with ESPCs, including lack of guidance for training, data management, and contract administration. The DOD IG report in February 2019 found that ESPC project data was not collected by key officials due to decentralization and lack of request for performance data. Base contracting officials were not complying with measurement and verification requirements under EISA Section 432, citing reasons like lack of awareness. Challenges in utilizing ESPCs and UESCs persist, with inconsistent application of measurement and verification noted by FEMP Strategic Director Leslie Nicholls during a House Committee hearing in December 2018. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) aims to continue training at technical and contracting officer levels, as recommended in the February 2019 DOD IG report. Congress may need to assess the value of training and guidance for accurate measurement and data verification of Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) and Utility Energy Service Contracts (UESCs). Additionally, there are provisions in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2208 for working capital funds to address petroleum market volatility and for multiyear contracts for purchasing electricity from renewable sources. The Secretary of Defense can enter into contracts for renewable energy sources for up to 10 years if it is cost-effective. This does not limit the use of other multiyear contracting authority for purchasing renewable energy. The Department of Defense's energy policy focuses on ensuring energy security and resilience for the armed forces. The Secretary of Defense is authorized to establish metrics and standards for measuring energy resilience. The Secretary of Defense is authorized to establish metrics and standards for measuring energy resilience and select facility energy projects using renewables. The Energy Performance Goals require annual submission to congressional defense committees, and the Energy Performance Master Plan must be developed annually to achieve set goals. Special considerations include factors like energy resilience and conservation measures. The Energy Performance Goals and Master Plan require the selection of energy conservation measures that demonstrate economic return, align with goals, and have special considerations. A goal is set to use renewable energy for 25% of facility energy needs by 2025. The Secretary of Defense is directed to streamline shared energy savings contracts. Energy-related procurement outlines contracting and procurement procedures. Energy-related procurement outlines contracting and procurement specifications for various energy types, allowing the Secretary of Defense to waive contract procedures under certain conditions to expedite fuel acquisition for government needs. Operational Energy Activities provide DOD with an operational energy policy and establish authorities for procurement, with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment responsible for developing an operational energy strategy. The ASD EI&E establishes an operational energy strategy and reviews budgetary operational energy matters, granting access to records on military initiatives. Federal agencies are directed to increase alternative fuel use and decrease petroleum consumption for federal fleets. Federal building energy efficiency standards require new buildings to achieve energy consumption levels at least 30% below ASHRAE Standard 90.1. Starting December 2008, new federal buildings and those undergoing major renovations are required to reduce fossil fuel consumption by 80% in 2020 and 100% by 2030 compared to FY2003 levels. Federal agencies must also reduce building energy consumption by 30% per square foot by FY2015. Additionally, agencies are encouraged to participate in utility incentive programs to increase energy efficiency and water conservation. The federal government authorizes Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) for up to 25 years, where contractors cover energy-saving costs in exchange for a share of the savings. There is a requirement for federal fleets to acquire 75% alternative-fueled vehicles annually. The President must ensure that at least 7.5% of the federal government's electric energy consumption is renewable energy each fiscal year. The federal government mandates that at least 7.5% of its electric energy consumption be renewable each fiscal year. Additionally, there is a requirement for federal fleets to acquire 75% alternative-fueled vehicles annually."
