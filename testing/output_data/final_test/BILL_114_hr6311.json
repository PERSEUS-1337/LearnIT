    "content": "The Act titled \"National Opportunity for Lead Exposure Accountability and Deterrence Act of 2016\" introduces national primary drinking water regulations for lead and copper under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The national primary drinking water regulations for lead and copper, known as the lead and copper rule, must be revised by the Administrator within 9 months of the National Opportunity for Lead Exposure Accountability and Deterrence Act of 2016 enactment. Sampling requirements apply to public water systems for testing lead and copper in drinking water. The public water system must report sampling results for drinking water, whether required by the lead and copper rule or initiated voluntarily by customers. Reporting includes the number of facilities sampled, addresses, previous samples, and results. The public water system must report sampling results for drinking water, including material composition of service lines, sampling dates, lead and copper levels detected, 90th percentile levels, samples above action levels, and details of disinfectants and corrosion inhibitors used. The public water system must report on the type, method, and quantity of treatments used, history of violations and fines, number of invalidated samples, and explanation for sampling at residential facilities without lead service lines. Reports must be made publicly available. The public water system must offer the option for facilities to be identified by block number and street name when collecting sampling data. The Administrator is required to develop a sampling protocol for lead and copper rule compliance, including prohibiting techniques that minimize detection, mandating annual sampling, and prioritizing testing at high-risk buildings. The Administrator must develop a sampling protocol for lead and copper rule compliance, including prioritizing testing at high-risk buildings and requiring sampling at all school drinking water taps. On-site investigations are required for samples exceeding the action level. The action level for lead and copper concentrations in public water systems requires prompt completion of additional samples at various locations to assess the extent of contamination. Notification must be given within 2 days to affected facilities and within 10 days of sampling completion for a monitoring period. The lead and copper rule mandates that testing results be standardized, posted on relevant websites, and include consumer confidence reports, sampling results, and information on lead service line replacement materials and financial assistance forms. A public water system must develop and maintain an inventory of the material composition of service lines at residential and nonresidential facilities, including online maps showing lead service line locations and history of services performed. Owners have the option to be identified only by financial assistance forms and how to request a water test. The National Opportunity for Lead Exposure Accountability and Deterrence Act of 2016 requires public water systems to develop an inventory of service line ownership at residential and nonresidential facilities. When replacing lead service lines, the system must replace the line from the transmission line to the facility entrance. The lead and copper rule mandates public water systems to prioritize replacing lead service lines at high-risk buildings, defined as those with galvanized pipes, low water use, or long lead service lines. The lead and copper rule defines a lead service line as one that is not lead-free and requires public water systems to prioritize replacing them at high-risk buildings. The term 'publicly available' means that a report must be written in plain language and accessible on a public water system's website or distributed to those served by the system. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to lower the action level for lead in drinking water to 10 parts per billion by December 31, 2020, and to 5 parts per billion by December 31, 2026."
