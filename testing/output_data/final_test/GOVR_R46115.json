    "content": "On June 5, 2019, the SEC adopted Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI) as part of regulatory reforms for financial professionals. Reg BI changes broker-dealers' obligations to act in the best interest of retail customers and address conflicts of interest. The FY2020 Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill included an amendment that would have restricted the SEC from implementing Reg BI, but it was not included in the enacted Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020. This report examines Reg BI, providing background on broker-dealers, investment advisers, and the fiduciary rule, as well as describing the obligations of Reg BI. This report examines Reg BI, which outlines obligations for broker-dealers to act in the best interest of clients. Broker-dealers must register with the SEC and comply with FINRA rules. The report also discusses state-based fiduciary regulations, congressional concerns, and research on the costs and benefits of Reg BI. Broker-dealers, including registered representatives, are regulated by FINRA and state securities regulators. They offer a range of services, divided into full-service and discount brokerage firms, and are compensated through commissions for transactions. Their recommendations may involve buying or selling securities for retail customers or recommending proprietary products. Investment advisers provide advice directly to clients, including individuals and institutional investors. They must register with the SEC if they have over $110 million in assets under management. Advisers typically offer ongoing investment advice and services for client portfolio management. Investment advisers provide advice and services for client portfolio management, typically compensated based on AUM size or fixed fees. The fiduciary standard requires advisers to prioritize clients' interests and disclose conflicts of interest, contrasting with broker-dealers' suitability standard. FINRA's Rule 2111 establishes the suitability standard for broker-dealers when making investment recommendations. Unlike investment advisers, brokers do not have an ongoing duty to monitor clients' financial positions, but they are subject to a fiduciary standard in certain circumstances. The number of SEC-registered broker-dealers decreased from over 6,000 in 2005 to under 4,000 in 2018, while SEC-registered investment advisers increased from about 9,000 in 2005 to over 13,000 in 2018. Broker-dealers started offering financial advisory services similar to investment advisers in the late 1980s and early 1990s, leading to confusion among retail customers about the distinction between the two. This growth was supported by the \"solely incidental\" exemption from compliance with the act and the rise of dually registered firms. The complexity of distinguishing between investment advisers and broker-dealers is compounded by the multitude of titles in the broker world and misleading advertisements. Surveys show that retail customers are often confused about the different roles and obligations of financial professionals. This confusion is exacerbated by the increasing complexity and heterogeneity of financial firms. The Treasury issued a white paper recommending new legislation to align the fiduciary obligations of broker-dealers providing investment advice with those of registered investment advisers. This was driven by concerns over investor confusion regarding the roles of investment advisors and broker-dealers. The Dodd-Frank Act granted the SEC authority to impose fiduciary rules on broker-dealers and required a study on financial professionals' standards of retail customer care. The study recommended bolstering investor protection and reducing confusion between brokers and investment advisers. The SEC study recommended establishing a uniform fiduciary standard for investment advisers and broker-dealers when providing investment advice to retail customers. However, no such rulemaking was proposed or adopted by the SEC under Chair Schapiro or her successor, Chair Mary Jo White. In 2015, White suggested implementing a uniform fiduciary duty for broker-dealers and investment advisers to act in the best interest of the investor. In April 2016, the Department of Labor adopted new rules under ERISA. The 2016 DOL rules under ERISA changed the standard for securities brokers-dealers to be fiduciaries when providing recommendations to retirement plan participants. The Obama Administration argued for this reform due to the shift from traditional defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans like 401(k)s. In 2016, DOL rules changed standards for brokers-dealers to be fiduciaries for retirement plan recommendations. The shift to defined contribution plans like 401(k)s led to this reform. DC plan participants face more decision options than DB plan participants. Supporters of DOL's fiduciary rules argued against conflicts of interest, while detractors claimed increased costs and limited access to advice. President Trump ordered a reexamination in February 2017. In 2017, President Trump ordered a reexamination of DOL rules on fiduciaries for retirement plan recommendations. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the rules in March 2018, halting their implementation. The decision came after a lawsuit by various business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Financial Services Roundtable. The Trump Administration did not challenge the court's decision. The Trump Administration did not challenge the Fifth Circuit's decision on DOL rules for fiduciaries. In fall 2018, DOL announced it was considering new rules, projected for September 2019. In June 2019, DOL officials mentioned working with the SEC on new rules. President Trump nominated Eugene Scalia as Secretary of Labor in July 2019. Eugene Scalia succeeded Alexander Acosta as Secretary of Labor and was confirmed by the Senate on September 26, 2019. Scalia, a former partner at Gibson, Dunn, & Crutcher, presented arguments against the DOL's fiduciary rule. There are concerns about potential conflicts of interest that may require Scalia to recuse himself from developing a new fiduciary rule. In June 2019, the SEC approved final rules related to the duty of care for financial professionals. The SEC approved final rules related to the duty of care for financial professionals, including Reg BI and the Form Customer Relationship Summary. Reg BI aims to address conflict-of-interest concerns by requiring broker-dealers to act in the best interest of retail customers. Reg BI aims to address conflict-of-interest concerns by requiring broker-dealers to establish policies to disclose material facts about conflicts of interest and act in the best interest of retail customers. The SEC interprets Regulation BI to apply to recommendations made by broker-dealers. Reg BI, enforced by the SEC, applies to recommendations of securities transactions and investment strategies for retail customers, including retirement accounts like IRAs and 401(k) plans. Broker-dealers must comply with Reg BI by June 30, 2020. Under Reg BI, broker-dealers have until June 30, 2020, to comply with new sales practice requirements. FINRA officials noted that adjustments will be needed to align with Reg BI, which includes the general obligation for broker-dealers to prioritize retail customers' interests. This obligation consists of three component duties: disclosure, compliance, and customer care, with an additional duty to address conflicts of interest. Reg BI requires broker-dealers to provide full and fair disclosure of material facts related to the recommendation, including conflicts of interest. They must establish written policies for compliance with Reg BI. The compliance obligation under Reg BI allows broker-dealers to tailor their policies and procedures to their business models without specific requirements. A well-designed compliance program should include controls, remediation, training, and periodic review. The duty of care obligation mandates broker-dealers to exercise diligence, care, and skill when making recommendations to retail customers, considering risks, rewards, and costs. The broker-dealer must consider risks, rewards, and costs when making recommendations to retail customers, ensuring it is in the customer's best interest. Conflicts of interest must be addressed by disclosing material facts and mitigating or eliminating conflicts when necessary. The conflict of interest component obligation under Reg BI requires broker-dealers to have written policies and procedures to disclose or eliminate conflicts of interest, including mitigating conflicts that may prioritize their interests ahead of the customers'. Mitigation in Reg BI involves altering broker-dealer policies to reduce incentives that may lead to prioritizing the firm's interests over the customer's. This includes avoiding compensation targets that favor certain sales and implementing neutral factors for compensation to prevent biased promotion of investment accounts. Written policies should also eliminate sales contests and bonuses based on specific securities. Reg BI aims to prevent broker-dealers from prioritizing their interests over customers by implementing neutral compensation factors and eliminating sales contests and bonuses based on specific securities. Additionally, broker-dealers are subject to state securities laws and common laws that impose a fiduciary standard in certain states. Several states, including New Jersey, Nevada, Massachusetts, and New York, are working on imposing fiduciary requirements on broker-dealers for retail customers. Massachusetts' initiative, proposed in June 2019, came after the Reg BI proposal and final rule. The Massachusetts initiative for fiduciary requirements on broker-dealers began after the Reg BI proposal. Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin criticized Reg BI for not providing adequate investor protections. Concerns have been raised about potential loopholes in state-based fiduciary laws, with Nevada excluding insurance agents from the regulation. Brokerage industry groups are lobbying against state-based initiatives like in New Jersey. Brokerage industry groups, including the SEC, are lobbying against state-based fiduciary actions, arguing that they could conflict with federal standards and create a messy patchwork of laws. SEC Chair Jay Clayton and others believe that inconsistent state-level standards will increase costs and limit choice for investors. In contrast, SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson sees state fiduciary efforts as a potential fix to perceived issues with Reg BI. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act (NSMIA; P.L. 104-290) expanded federal regulators' authority and prohibited states from imposing additional requirements on broker-dealers. This could potentially conflict with state fiduciary proposals, leading to legal challenges. SIFMA requested the SEC to include language in Reg BI noting federal preemption under NSMIA, but the final rule did not address this. The final rule on Regulation Best Interest does not include language regarding federal preemption under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act. Attorneys General from several states filed a lawsuit to vacate Reg BI, alleging it harms retail investors by failing to restrict conflicted advice. The AGs argue that Regulation Best Interest fails to restrict conflicted advice as required by the Dodd-Frank Act and increases the likelihood of retail investors receiving biased information. They also criticize the standard of customer care in Reg BI for not going beyond FINRA's suitability obligation. Democratic members of Congress, including Maxine Waters and Sherrod Brown, have criticized the proposed regulation in a letter to the SEC Chair. Jay Clayton criticized the proposed Regulation BI, urging the SEC to revise it to require brokers to abide by the same high standard as investment advisers. Chair Waters expressed concerns about the best interests of consumers and seniors regarding investment advisors not acting in their best interest. The House passed H.R. 3351, an amendment sponsored by Chair Waters aimed at preventing the SEC from implementing Reg BI. President Trump signed H.R. 1865, which does not include the SEC restrictions. This raises concerns about investment advisors not acting in the best interest of consumers and seniors. The adoption of the final 2019 rule on Reg BI elicited a range of responses, with three broad reactions identified. Observers and stakeholders either support or criticize concerns regarding Reg BI, including its failure to provide for a broker-dealer fiduciary standard. Divisions in overall views on Reg BI include qualified support and broad support from various individuals. The final 2019 rule on Reg BI received mixed reactions, with some viewing it as a step in the right direction while others criticize its lack of a defined best interest standard. Stakeholders like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce support it, while groups like the Consumer Federation of America are critical. The debate surrounds key policy concerns such as the absence of a uniform fiduciary standard and whether Reg BI adequately addresses investor protection. Reg BI is praised for enhancing broker-dealer conduct rules by requiring a duty of loyalty and diligence in customer recommendations. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton supports Reg BI as a new standard of conduct for broker-dealers. Reg. BI, also known as Interest, imposes a higher standard of conduct for broker-dealers beyond suitability requirements. It includes four key obligations: Disclosure, Care, Conflict of Interest, and Compliance. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports Reg BI, stating it provides strong protections for investors, clearer information, and the ability to choose suitable advice. They also hope for similar protections for ERISA plans from the Department of Labor. The Department of Labor is moving forward with similar protections for ERISA plans that align with the SEC's approach. SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson criticized Reg BI for not prioritizing investor interests and being ambiguous. Micah Hauptman from the Consumer Federation of America called Reg BI a \"bait and switch\" for investors. Reg BI is a new best interest standard for brokers that codifies existing rules without changing industry practices. Critics like Barbara Roper from the Consumer Federation of America argue that it doesn't truly enhance investor protections. The SEC must clarify the definition of \"best interest\" under Reg BI to provide enhanced investor protections beyond existing FINRA rules. This should involve recommending suitable options that are the best match for the investor, considering their needs and the investments' characteristics. The standard should require brokers to narrow down acceptable options to better serve investors. The term \"best interest\" is not defined in the rulemaking package for Reg BI, leading to potential debates and litigation similar to the current \"suitability\" standard. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton emphasized applying the specific component obligations of Reg BI in a principles-based manner to determine if a broker-dealer acted in the retail customer's best interest. The SEC's Reg BI does not define \"best interest,\" leading to potential debates and litigation. The principles-based approach assesses if a broker-dealer acted in the retail customer's best interest based on specific components. This approach is similar to an investment adviser's fiduciary duty and allows investors to choose their desired level of protection. The SEC's Reg BI allows investors to choose their level of protection based on risk appetite and finances. Critics worry about investors understanding their advisor's duty of care, but SEC rules prevent brokers from using the title \"advisor.\" FINSUM criticizes the lack of a \"best interest\" definition in Reg BI, stating that a highly defined rule could lead to loopholes. The SEC declined to create a uniform fiduciary standard for broker-dealers and investment advisers. The SEC declined to adopt a uniform fiduciary standard for broker-dealers and investment advisers, citing concerns about reducing investor choice and access to products and increasing costs for firms and retail investors. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton favored the investment adviser model where clients pay a fee for financial advice from a fiduciary, stating it may better match the needs of many investors. The SEC declined to adopt a uniform fiduciary standard for broker-dealers and investment advisers, citing concerns about reducing investor choice and access to products. SIFMA's study supported the idea that a uniform fiduciary standard could negatively impact customer choice. Oliver Wyman's study for the SEC analyzed the impact of unifying the fiduciary standard for retail investors from financial advisers and broker-dealers. The survey found that broker-dealers play a crucial role in the industry, and standardization could negatively affect advisory model choice, product access, and affordability for retail investors. The Financial Planning Coalition stated that a uniform fiduciary standard would not impact investment advice availability or product range for moderate- or low-income individuals. The costs to broker-dealers to implement a fiduciary standard would be minimal. There will continue to be two somewhat different market conduct standards for identical advisory services. AARP is asking the SEC to adopt a uniform fiduciary standard for financial professionals that applies to all types of retail accounts. Retail investors are confused due to the different standards in the marketplace. SEC Commissioner Daniel M. Gallagher and SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce addressed the confusion among retail investors regarding the fiduciary duty standards, highlighting the need for uniformity and clarity in the evolving investment industry. The SEC addressed the fiduciary standard in Reg BI, stating that broker-dealers are not subject to the existing fiduciary standard under the Advisers Act due to differences in business models. They believe this approach would maintain retail investor access to various investment services and products. SEC Chairman Clayton stated that Reg. BI imposes a new standard of conduct for broker-dealers, requiring them to act in the best interest of retail customers. This principles-based approach is similar to an investment adviser's fiduciary duty and aims to enhance investor protection. Regulation Best Interest imposes heightened disclosure requirements for brokers and their investment offerings to better inform retail customers about conflicts of interest. SEC Commissioner Roisman highlighted that even the fiduciary standard under the Investment Advisers Act does not require the elimination or mitigation of conflicts. In 2016, the DOL adopted the \"Fiduciary Rule\" for retirement investment accounts, which proved unworkable for many providers, increasing compliance costs and limiting access to affordable financial advice for U.S. investors. Representative Trey Hollingsworth expressed relief that the rule is no longer in effect. The Financial Planning Coalition supports the adoption of a fiduciary standard of care, stating it will not negatively affect investment advice availability for low- and moderate-income consumers. Research shows minimal costs for broker-dealers to implement this standard, leading to stronger asset and revenue growth. The CFA Institute emphasizes the benefits of brokers providing non-incidental advice under a fiduciary standard. The Financial Planning Coalition and the CFA Institute support a fiduciary standard of care for brokers providing non-incidental advice. However, concerns have been raised about the lack of definition in Reg BI, allowing brokers to prioritize their own financial interests over clients'. This absence of a fiduciary standard is seen as dangerous for investors. The absence of a fiduciary standard in Reg BI has raised concerns about prioritizing brokers' financial interests over clients'. The SEC declined to firm up the definition of \"best interest,\" leading to a problematic grey area in holding professionals accountable. John Britt criticized this as fake regulation, emphasizing the need for a fiduciary duty when giving investment advice. The conflicts of interest in Reg BI regarding incentives and limitations were addressed by the SEC. The SEC believes that conflicts of interest related to incentives and limitations in the broker-dealer relationship must be addressed with specific disclosure and mitigation requirements. Sales contests, quotas, and bonuses based on specific securities create pressure to prioritize sales over clients' best interests. Former SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt emphasized the need to eliminate these conflicts. Former SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt stated that broker-dealers are not required to recommend the least expensive securities as long as they comply with disclosure and conflict of interest obligations. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton defended Reg. BI, stating that conflicts of interest are inherent in all broker-customer relationships. Conflicts of interest are present in all principal-agent relationships, including the broker-customer and investment adviser-client relationships. Reg. BI mandates firms to address these conflicts and provide recommendations in the best interest of retail customers. Critics argue that the best interest standard offers more protection than fiduciary duty, as brokers must mitigate conflicts, unlike under the fiduciary duty where disclosure sufficed. The Consumer Federation of America criticizes Reg BI for not prohibiting firms from creating incentives that may not align with customers' best interests or managing conflicts to benefit customers. Reg BI requires firms to manage conflicts to benefit customers. SEC Commissioner Jackson criticizes the rule for not limiting compensation practices that lead to conflicts of interest. He emphasizes the need to prevent brokers from prioritizing their interests over customers'. SEC Commissioner Jackson criticizes Reg BI for not adequately addressing troubling broker compensation practices that put investors at risk, such as sales competitions and high-pressure situations. He questions why rules should permit pay practices that could potentially harm investors. An industry observer notes that while some positive steps were taken in the rule, significant concerns remain regarding conflicts of interest, particularly in prioritizing growth over customer care. The SEC Commissioner criticizes Reg BI for not addressing troubling broker compensation practices like sales competitions and high-pressure situations. Concerns remain about conflicts of interest prioritizing growth over customer care. The Consumer Federation of America questions the effectiveness of mitigation measures in supporting compliance with the best interest standard. The SEC acknowledges limitations in quantifying economic effects due to data constraints. The SEC release discusses the challenges in quantifying the economic effects of Regulation Best Interest, highlighting the difficulty in forecasting broker-dealers' responses and their impact on the market. It also explores theoretical costs and benefits of an alternative fiduciary standard for broker-dealers to reduce customer confusion and potential costs. The SEC release argued that a uniform fiduciary standard could reduce customer costs and confusion by subjecting both brokers and investment advisers to the same standard of care. However, it also noted that this could lead to a standard of care for brokers that may not be suitable for their transaction-specific recommendations and compensation structure. This could result in a shrinking range of options in the financial advice market, with brokers potentially transitioning to offering advice as investment advisers instead. The release discussed the potential impact of brokers transitioning to a new fiduciary standard, which could increase compliance costs passed on to clients. This could lead to customers seeking cheaper advice outside regulated channels. The Deloitte-SIFMA Study in 2017 examined the impact of the fiduciary rule on brokers. 53% of respondents eliminated or limited brokerage advice services, and 67% shifted to fee-based services. The trend towards fee-based accounts was accelerated by the rule. The fiduciary rule accelerated the trend towards fee-based accounts, offering higher service levels than brokerage accounts. Some states impose a fiduciary standard on brokers, influencing their willingness to provide advisory services to retail consumers. The 2012 research found that the number of registered representatives conducting business within a state did not significantly change with a stricter fiduciary standard. There were no significant differences in financial professionals' abilities and behaviors in states with a strict fiduciary standard compared to those without. The analysis in 2019 focused on sales behavior for annuities by broker-dealers in adjacent counties with and without fiduciary standards. Brokers in counties with fiduciary duties shifted their investment products to retail investors, leading to increased costs but improved financial advice quality."
