    "content": "No relevant information provided in the curr_chunk. Congress finds that billing practices by telecommunications carriers may not accurately reflect the cost or basis of additional services provided to consumers due to regulatory actions since the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Certain providers have introduced new charges on customer bills known as \"line-item charges.\" The State of New York is considering action to protect consumers by requiring telecommunications carriers to disclose fee increases and reductions resulting from regulatory actions since the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners supports action by the Federal Communications Commission to address confusion among customers regarding universal service fees. The Federal Communications Commission is taking action to ensure interstate carriers provide accurate customer notice about end user charges. The purpose of this Act is to protect consumers by ensuring telecommunications carriers nationwide report costs accurately in billing practices. SEC. 2. INVESTIGATION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS BILLING PRACTICES. The Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission will jointly investigate the billing practices of telecommunications carriers to determine if bills accurately assess additional fees paid by customers due to the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other regulatory actions. The Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission will investigate additional fees imposed by telecommunications carriers on customers due to the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other regulatory actions. They will assess whether these fees accurately reflect the carriers' additional costs. The Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission will review telecommunications carriers' fees imposed on customers post the Telecommunications Act of 1996. They will assess if these fees accurately represent carriers' additional costs and financial benefits. The agencies have the authority to obtain relevant records from carriers for this investigation. The Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission may use records obtained for investigation purposes only. If discrepancies are found in telecommunications carriers' billing, the agencies can take disciplinary actions as authorized by law. The Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission will inform Congress if they determine they lack the necessary authority to take action. Within 45 days of the Act's enactment, they will submit a joint report to Congress on their investigation results, including any recommendations for further legislative action. SEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS IMPOSING CERTAIN FEES FOR SERVICES. Telecommunications carriers must specify reductions in charges due to federal regulatory actions and submit reports to the FCC for charges imposed on customer bills. This applies to specific charges after June 30, 1997. The FCC requires telecommunications carriers to report reductions in charges attributed to federal regulatory actions on customer bills, including specific charges before June 30, 1997 that are later changed to reflect this attribution."
