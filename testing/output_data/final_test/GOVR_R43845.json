    "content": "The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 provide broad nondiscrimination protection for individuals with disabilities in various areas. The ADA's purpose is to eliminate discrimination against individuals with disabilities by establishing clear and comprehensive national standards. The report focuses on Title I of the ADA, which prohibits discrimination in employment based on disability. To be protected by the ADA, a qualified individual must have a disability defined as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities. The ADA Amendments Act changed the interpretation of \"substantially limits\" in the ADA to be less demanding than the previous \"severely restricts\" standard. The EEOC issued regulations to provide guidance on interpreting this term in cases brought under the ADA. The ADA Amendments Act changed the interpretation of \"substantially limits\" in the ADA to be less demanding. Major life activities include caring for oneself, seeing, hearing, eating, walking, and major bodily functions. The focus should be on compliance with obligations and discrimination, not extensive analysis of impairment limitations. The ADA defines major life activities to include bodily functions like immune system, cell growth, digestive, neurological, and reproductive functions. It also explains the \"regarded as having\" a disability definition for individuals who have been subjected to discrimination due to a perceived impairment. The ADA defines major life activities to include bodily functions and provides rules for interpreting the term disability, favoring broad coverage and a less demanding standard for substantial limitations. The ADA governs the employment practices of covered entities, which include employers with 15 or more employees, and exempts certain entities like the federal government and Indian tribes. The determination of disability is based on whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity, without considering mitigating measures. The ADA governs employment practices for entities with 15 or more employees, excluding certain entities like the federal government and Indian tribes. The term \"employee\" is defined circularly in the ADA, leading to interpretation challenges. In Clackamas Gastroenterology Assoc. v. Wells, the Supreme Court examined whether owners of a medical professional corporation qualified as employees under the ADA. The Court relied on common law and EEOC guidance to determine employee status based on control. The EEOC guidance was deemed valid by the Court, focusing on factors like control, authority to hire and fire, supervision, and influence within an organization to determine employee status. The Court emphasized that no single factor is decisive in determining employee status. Despite indications that four doctors were not employees, the case was remanded to the district court for further review. The ADA prohibits discrimination against \"qualified individuals\" who can perform essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodation. An individual with a disability is considered \"qualified\" if they have the necessary skills, education, and experience for the job. Discrimination on the basis of disability is prohibited only if the individual is qualified for the position they are seeking. The ADA prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities who can perform essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodation. Reasonable accommodation may include making facilities accessible, job restructuring, modified work schedules, reassignment, equipment modifications, and other similar accommodations. The EEOC regulations define \"essential functions\" as the fundamental job duties of a position, excluding marginal functions. Determining essential functions involves factors like the purpose of the position and specialized skills required. Evidence includes job descriptions, time spent on functions, consequences of not performing them, and collective bargaining agreements. The ADA prohibits discrimination, including practices outlined in Section 12112(b)(1). Section 12112 of the ADA prohibits covered entities from discriminating against applicants or employees with disabilities in various ways, including limiting opportunities, entering into discriminatory relationships, and using discriminatory standards or criteria. This section also allows for disparate impact claims against discriminatory practices. Section 12112 of the ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities, including disparate impact claims. It also protects individuals with known relationships to those with disabilities and requires reasonable accommodation for qualified individuals. Employers must be aware of the relationship and disability to be liable under the ADA. The ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities and requires reasonable accommodation for qualified individuals. Employers may not be held liable for discrimination if an accommodation would impose an \"undue hardship\" on operations, defined as significant difficulty or expense. Factors to consider include the nature and cost of the accommodation, financial resources of the facility and covered entity, and impact on operations. The ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities and requires reasonable accommodation for qualified individuals. Employers may not be held liable for discrimination if an accommodation would impose an \"undue hardship\" on operations. Factors to consider include the composition, structure, and functions of the workforce, geographic separateness, and administrative or fiscal relationship of the facility to the covered entity. Undue hardship is measured in terms of the cost of the accommodation against the entire operations of the employer. An accommodation can be unreasonable if it imposes an undue hardship on business operations, such as violating a well-established seniority system with a job reassignment. Covered entities are prohibited from refusing to hire qualified applicants or afford employment opportunities to qualified employees due to the need for reasonable accommodations. The ADA requires covered entities to provide reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities. Negotiation is necessary to determine a reasonable accommodation, and outright rejection without negotiation is considered a failure to provide accommodation. Covered entities are prohibited from using qualification standards that screen out individuals with disabilities unless it is job-related and a business necessity. The ADA allows covered entities to use qualification standards and tests based on uncorrected vision if job-related and necessary. Discriminatory qualification standards that protect against direct threats to health or safety do not violate the ADA. The Supreme Court upheld a standard discriminating against a disabled individual to protect against direct threats. The EEOC regulations outline factors for determining if an individual with a disability poses a direct threat, considering the duration, nature, severity, likelihood, and imminence of harm. In most federal courts, direct threat is an affirmative defense raised by the defendant. Covered entities must select and administer tests reflecting actual skills and aptitudes. The ADA prohibits discrimination based on disability, including medical exams and inquiries. Covered entities cannot administer tests that focus on impairments rather than skills. Pre-hiring and pre-employment medical exams are restricted, but inquiries about an applicant's ability to perform job-related functions are allowed. Post-employment medical exams are treated differently. A covered entity can condition employment on the results of a medical exam before an applicant starts work, as long as all employees are subject to the same condition and the results are kept private and used consistently with the ADA. Once employed, a medical exam can only be required if it is job-related and consistent with business necessity. Inquiries about an employee's ability to perform job-related functions are allowed, and voluntary medical exams can be conducted as part of an employee health program. In Karraker v. Rent-a-Center, Inc., the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled that using the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) in promotion decisions violated the ADA. The MMPI, designed to detect mental illness, was considered a medical exam even without interpretation by a medical professional. The ADA excludes individuals engaged in illegal drug use from protection, including drug addicts and alcoholics in recovery. The ADA covers drug addicts and alcoholics in recovery or rehabilitation programs, as well as individuals regarded as using illegal drugs or abusing alcohol. Covered entities can implement policies like drug testing to ensure compliance. Religious organizations can give preference to individuals of a particular religion for work and require adherence to religious tenets. In Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC, the Supreme Court addressed a case involving a church school. In Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC, the Supreme Court upheld the ministerial exception to discrimination laws, allowing religious institutions to select employees responsible for their mission without government interference. This exception applies to ministers and ministerial employees only. Title I of the ADA allows for enforcement through the EEOC, state agencies, or private litigation, with remedies including injunctive relief and monetary damages to remedy discrimination. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 expanded remedies for intentional discrimination cases. The ADA allows for enforcement through the EEOC, state agencies, or private litigation, with remedies including injunctive relief and monetary damages for discrimination. Compensatory and punitive damages are available for individuals with disabilities who suffer nonpecuniary damages. Damages are capped based on the defendant's number of employees, with a \"good faith\" exception for failure to provide reasonable accommodation. The Fair Pay Act amended the ADA to address when discrimination is considered to have occurred. The Fair Pay Act addresses unlawful discrimination in compensation, allowing for back pay for up to two years preceding the filing of charges. It applies to Title I and Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act, prohibiting retaliation and coercion against individuals who file charges. The Act was amended to address when discrimination is considered to have occurred. The Eleventh Amendment prohibits lawsuits against states by individuals, with limits on Congress's ability to abrogate this immunity. In Garrett v. University of Alabama, the Supreme Court ruled that Title I plaintiffs cannot recover damages from states for employment discrimination but can seek injunctive relief."
