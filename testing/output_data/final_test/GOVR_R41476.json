    "content": "Retirement income sources include Social Security, employer-sponsored pensions (defined benefit and defined contribution), and participant-initiated retirement accounts like 401(k) plans. DB pensions provide monthly benefits based on years of employment and final salary, while DC pensions offer individual accounts with contributions from employees and employers. Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) can play a crucial role in providing workers with tax-advantaged savings accounts for retirement. Employers have shifted from offering Defined Benefit (DB) plans to Defined Contribution (DC) plans, placing more responsibility on individuals for their retirement income security. Workers can establish and contribute to an IRA, similar to 401(k) plans, regardless of employer sponsorship of a retirement plan. Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings, similar to 401(k) plans. Contributions and earnings accumulate for retirement income. IRAs can be traditional or Roth, with different tax implications. The report discusses IRA contributions, characteristics of households with IRAs, and policy proposals to increase IRA ownership rates. Individuals can contribute to traditional IRAs or Roth IRAs, with different eligibility requirements and tax treatments. Rollover IRAs allow individuals to transfer retirement assets from employer-sponsored pensions or IRAs. Traditional IRAs offer tax advantages such as deductible contributions and tax-deferred earnings. In 2011, the annual contribution limit for IRAs was $5,000. In 2011, individuals could contribute up to $5,000 or their taxable compensation to a traditional IRA, with an additional $1,000 for those aged 50 or older. Contributions are tax-deductible for individuals not covered by an employer-sponsored pension plan or with income below certain limits. The deduction phase-out begins at specific Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) levels for different filing statuses. Withdrawals from traditional IRAs are taxable, except for after-tax contributions. IRAs are meant for retirement security, not pre-retirement expenses or tax-free transfers. Early withdrawals before age 59\u00bd incur a 10% penalty tax, with exceptions. Account holders over 70\u00bd must take Required Minimum Distributions annually. Roth IRAs, authorized by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, have key differences from traditional IRAs. Contributions are not tax-deductible, and qualified distributions are tax-free. The annual contribution limit is $5,000 or the individual's taxable compensation, with an additional $1,000 for those aged 50 or older. Contributions are limited to individuals with incomes under $120,000 for single filers and $177,000 for joint filers. Roth IRAs have no Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) requirement due to tax-free distributions. Rollovers are transfers of assets between retirement plans, often done upon separation from an employer. Rollovers are transfers of assets between retirement plans, often done upon separation from an employer. Individuals may rollover account balances from employer-sponsored pension plans into traditional or Roth IRAs. Rollovers not completed within 60 days are considered taxable distributions. The amount of the rollover is not included in taxable income, is not subject to contribution limits, nor subject to rules that govern early distributions. Rollovers can come from traditional IRAs or from employers' pension plans. Prior to 2010, rollovers into Roth IRAs were limited to individuals with incomes under specified limits; these income limits were eliminated beginning in 2010. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) was enacted to encourage workers without pension plans to save for retirement. Keogh accounts allowed tax-deductible contributions for retirement income. IRA legislation since 1974 has impacted eligibility and contributions. Initially, only those not covered by an employer pension plan could contribute, but from 1982 to 1986, all workers could make tax-deductible IRA contributions. Tax-deductible IRA contributions were limited by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to non-covered workers and covered workers with incomes under $25,000. Workers without pension coverage or with incomes below certain limits can make tax-deductible contributions, while covered workers with higher incomes can make non-deductible contributions. The annual contribution limit has increased over the years and is currently set at $5,000 for 2011. Individuals aged 50 and older can make an additional $500 \"catch up\" contribution starting in 2002. Since 1987, workers covered by a pension plan may deduct 100% of their IRA contribution only if their incomes are under statutory limits. The deduction percentage gradually decreases from 100% to 0% for incomes exceeding the limits by $10,000 or $20,000 (depending on filing status). No deduction is available for taxpayers with higher incomes. Since 1998, workers with taxable income under statutory limits could make contributions to Roth IRAs. The maximum contribution to a Roth IRA is phased out for persons with income greater than limits specified in statute. Less than 3% of taxpayers made tax-deductible IRA contributions in 2007. Fewer tax returns had IRA deductions in 2006 and 2007 than in any year since 1977. Historical tax-deductible IRA contributions are shown in Figure 1 through Figure 4. Figure 1 displays the inflation-adjusted yearly amount of tax-deductible contributions to traditional IRAs from 1974 to 2007, while Figure 2 shows the inflation-adjusted average tax-deductible contribution. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the number and percentage of taxpayers who made tax-deductible IRA contributions from 1974 to 2007. The total amount of tax-deductible IRA contributions nearly doubled in 1981 compared to 1975, despite the average amount being 30% lower. The increase in 1982 was due to the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which expanded IRA eligibility. However, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 limited eligibility, leading to a decrease in contributions. This suggests that higher-income workers with pension coverage made most tax-deductible IRA contributions. Some taxpayers adjusted their contributions in response to contribution limit changes since the mid-1990s. Since the mid-1990s, taxpayers have adjusted their IRA contributions in response to changes in contribution limits. Total tax-deductible IRA contributions decreased by 46% from 1990 to 2001, with average contributions 16% lower. Income and contribution limits remained stagnant from 1987 to 2001, resulting in lower real limits. Increases in contribution limits in 1997, 2002, and 2005 led to corresponding rises in average contributions. However, there was no increase in the number of returns reporting IRA contributions or the percentage of returns. The introduction of Roth IRAs in 1998 did not affect total contributions to traditional IRAs or the average tax-deductible contribution. From 1998 to 2001, total and average IRA contributions were lower, possibly due to taxpayers making Roth IRA contributions instead. The decline in traditional IRA contributions may be due to the decreased real value of the contribution limit, rather than individuals shifting to Roth IRAs. The percentage of taxpayers making IRA contributions peaked in 1985 at 15.9% and gradually declined to 2.3% in 2007. Less than 3% of tax returns reported tax-deductible contributions to traditional IRAs since 1999, with an average contribution of $3,902 in 2007. In 2007, households with higher incomes made the majority of contributions to traditional IRAs. Those with Adjusted Gross Incomes below $50,000 accounted for 41.1% of households claiming deductions for IRA contributions. Higher-income households have a greater incentive to make tax-deductible IRA contributions due to being in higher tax brackets. The percentage of households making tax-deductible IRA contributions and the average contribution amount increased with household income. In 2007, higher-income households made the majority of contributions to traditional IRAs. Among taxpayers with incomes above $100,000, 4.1% claimed the IRA deduction, with an average contribution of $5,440. The Survey of Consumer Finances reported that 32.7% of working households owned an IRA, with 15.9 million having traditional IRAs, 10.2 million having Roth IRAs, and 9.4 million having Rollover IRAs. Roth IRAs, authorized in 1997, had two-thirds as many accounts as traditional IRAs in 2007. In 2007, IRA assets totaled $3.0 trillion, with a plurality held in Rollover IRAs ($1.4 trillion), traditional IRAs ($1.3 trillion), and Roth IRAs ($306 billion). The median Roth IRA account balance was $10,000, significantly lower than traditional IRAs. Rollover IRAs typically had larger balances due to transfers from other retirement accounts. In 2007, IRA assets totaled $3.0 trillion, with a plurality held in Rollover IRAs, traditional IRAs, and Roth IRAs. Most households with traditional IRAs did not make taxable contributions. IRA ownership is greater among households with pensions. Many individuals have not responded to tax incentives for IRA ownership. Pension coverage increased with firm size in 2007. In 2007, IRA ownership rates were highest in workplaces with fewer than 20 employees, especially in small professional offices. Professionals with high incomes and education levels are more likely to have IRAs. Pension plan coverage was highest in the public sector and manufacturing industries, while lowest in agriculture, mining, or construction industries. IRA ownership rates varied by industry, with low rates in agriculture, mining, and construction industries. The low rates of IRA ownership among households in agriculture, mining, or construction industries may be due to the transient nature of these occupations and lower education levels. In contrast, workers in financial services have higher IRA ownership rates, possibly due to greater education levels and knowledge about IRAs. Financial literacy efforts could play a crucial role in increasing IRA ownership among workers. Households with both pension coverage and IRAs were the wealthiest group in terms of retirement assets, total assets, and net worth. Those with IRAs, regardless of pension coverage, were wealthier than those without. IRA ownership was higher among households with pension coverage. Among households without pension coverage, those with IRAs had significantly higher net worth compared to those without. IRA ownership rates varied among households with different income levels and pension coverage. While IRA ownership increased with income for both groups, households without pension coverage had higher IRA ownership rates in certain income brackets, such as those earning between $50,000 to $75,000 and over $100,000. The reasons for this disparity could be attributed to the positive correlation between IRA ownership and income. The 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances data shows a positive correlation between IRA ownership and income. Households without pension coverage, especially in higher income tax brackets, had higher IRA ownership rates due to larger tax benefits. IRA ownership increased with age until 70, with lower rates for those aged 70 or older. Among households under 30, those without pension coverage had significantly lower IRA ownership rates. Among households without pension coverage, IRA ownership rates were higher for those in higher income tax brackets. IRA ownership increased with age until 70, with lower rates for those aged 70 or older. IRA ownership rates were lower for households without pensions and where the head did not have a college degree. This suggests a willingness to trade current income for larger future income, similar to college students anticipating higher future income. The IRA ownership rates vary among different demographic groups, with higher rates among white households without pension coverage compared to African-American and Hispanic households. Homeowners have higher IRA ownership rates than non-homeowners. Low IRA ownership rates among non-homeowners may indicate economic vulnerability and reliance on Social Security for retirement income. The higher IRA ownership rates among homeowners compared to non-homeowners may be due to factors such as household income, age, long-term planning, and financial literacy. Married households generally have higher IRA ownership rates than single households, especially among those without pension coverage. In 2007, 26.9% of married households without pensions had IRAs, compared to 23.5% of single male households and 22.5% of single female households. Interestingly, IRA ownership rates were only slightly higher among single male households compared to single female households. Some individuals may have a high preference for saving, leading to higher IRA ownership rates. The Survey of Consumer Finances asks about attitudes toward saving, which can indicate saving propensities and influence IRA ownership. Key questions relate to reasons for saving, planning time periods, and shopping around for saving and investment decisions. These factors may play a role in determining which households own IRAs. Efforts to increase financial literacy among less financially literate households may lead to higher IRA ownership rates. Analysis suggests that pension plan coverage is crucial for determining IRA ownership, especially among households without pension coverage targeted for IRA assistance. IRA ownership rates increase with longer savings horizons and more shopping when making saving decisions. Without pension coverage, IRA ownership rates are higher among households with pension coverage. Households without IRAs or pensions represent economically vulnerable populations. Many working households with neither pension coverage nor IRAs have inadequate savings for retirement, with some having to rely on public assistance. Policymakers need to consider factors such as pension coverage when formulating retirement savings policies. Policymakers must address how IRA ownership is influenced by factors like pension coverage, education, income, and saver behavior. Encouraging workers to save for retirement is a challenge, especially when faced with immediate financial needs. Retirement security is often likened to a three-legged stool: Social Security, private savings, and employer-provided pensions. Tax incentives play a role in promoting retirement savings, but may not be effective for all target groups. The Retirement Savings Contributions Credit (the Saver's Credit) is a non-refundable tax credit of up to $1,000 for eligible individuals contributing to retirement plans. It aims to encourage lower-income households to save for retirement. IRS data shows that 5.9 million households received the credit in 2007, with an average amount of $167. However, the credit may not be widely used, as only 5.9% of households with incomes under $50,000 claimed it. The Saver's Credit, a non-refundable tax credit for retirement plan contributions, may not be widely used by lower-income households. Factors limiting its effectiveness include non-refundability, ineligibility for form 1040EZ filers, and the possibility of credits being used for contributions that would have been made anyway. Policymakers suggest increasing access to retirement accounts to raise IRA ownership rates, especially for workers without employer-sponsored pension plans. The Automatic IRA (Auto IRA) proposal aims to increase workers' access to retirement accounts by requiring certain employers to establish IRAs for their employees. Employees would have a specified percentage of their pay directed into the IRA, with the option to opt-out or adjust contributions. Employers could choose to match contributions, but it is not mandatory. This initiative targets the approximately 39.1 million households without employer-sponsored pension plans. Employers without pension plans, about 50% of U.S. working households, may not all be covered by Auto IRAs due to exemptions for small employers or job tenure requirements. Implementing Auto IRAs for workers without pension coverage could be costly and administratively burdensome. Proponents aim to reduce employers' administrative burdens and fiduciary obligations. Questions remain about appropriate default investments for non-participating workers. Additionally, some workers already have traditional or Roth IRAs, with 25.3% of eligible households owning IRAs. Efforts to improve financial literacy may increase IRA contributions and ownership rates by increasing knowledge of the benefits of IRAs, the Saver's Credit, and the option to have federal income tax refunds deposited directly to IRAs. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration noted concerns about noncompliance with IRA contribution limits, with an estimated 146,976 taxpayers exceeding the limit in 2007. Efforts to improve financial literacy focus on increasing awareness of credit card fees and the importance of saving for retirement. Some policymakers are concerned about the fees charged by financial institutions for managing IRAs and 401(k) plans. Legislation has been introduced to increase fee transparency for 401(k) plans, but not for IRAs. The Department of Labor issued a rule for greater fee transparency in 401(k) plans, excluding IRAs due to owners being responsible for managing their accounts. IRAs give owners control over financial institution and investment choices, but decisions can be complex. This complexity may lead to higher fees charged by financial institutions. Unlike 401(k) plans, IRAs require separate record keeping for each account, potentially increasing administrative costs. Comparing fees between IRAs and 401(k) plans is challenging due to their different structures."
