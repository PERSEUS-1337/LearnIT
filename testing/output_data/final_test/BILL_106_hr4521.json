Infrastructure at developed areas is inadequate for cold-season operation, and maintenance backlogs exist. The historic hotels in Glacier National Park, including Many Glacier Hotel and Lake McDonald Lodge, are essential for public use but are significantly deteriorated and in need of substantial repair to meet basic needs and expectations.
