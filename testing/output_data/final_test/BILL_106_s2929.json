    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Master Teacher Act of 2000\" and includes a Master Teacher Demonstration Project. The \"Master Teacher Act of 2000\" defines a \"master teacher\" as an experienced educator selected based on excellence and recommendations from administrators and peers. The \"Master Teacher Act of 2000\" establishes a demonstration project where the Secretary of Education awards grants to increase teacher salaries and benefits in public schools. Master teachers are experienced educators who mentor others, develop curriculum, and commit to teaching for at least 5 more years. The \"Master Teacher Act of 2000\" aims to increase teacher salaries and benefits by awarding grants to local educational agencies. Priority is given to agencies in districts with economically disadvantaged students. To qualify for a grant, agencies must submit an application. The local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary for a grant under the demonstration project, detailing the use of funds for master teacher positions. The agency must also agree to provide non-Federal contributions equal to the grant amount. The Secretary will conduct a study and submit a report to Congress by July 1, 2005, analyzing the impact of the demonstration project on teacher recruitment, mentoring, and student achievement. Recommendations will also be included in the report. Authorization of Appropriations: $50,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2001 through 2005 to continue or terminate the demonstration project and establish a grant program for expansion to additional local educational agencies and school districts."
