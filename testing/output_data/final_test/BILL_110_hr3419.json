    "content": "The Act titled \"Reducing Barriers to Learning Act of 2007\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. The Congress finds that interventions promoting students' bonding to school, fostering engagement, and strengthening social, emotional, and decision-making skills positively impact academic achievement. Prevention and early intervention programs for at-risk elementary students have shown declines in special education referrals, suspension, and disciplinary issues. Students with barriers to learning, such as low resilience assets, have lower academic achievement. Increasing student engagement and sense of community in school leads to reductions in problem behaviors and better academic performance. School mental health programs improve educational outcomes by decreasing absences and discipline referrals. Students receiving social-emotional support achieve better academically. In a recent study, one-third of school districts reported decreased funding for school mental health services while two-thirds reported increased need. School counseling programs are crucial for students' personal growth, social skills, career goals, and academic potential. 70% of children receiving speech-language pathology services show progress in literacy skills, with over two-thirds of teachers noting improved reading skills in the classroom. Creative arts therapies in schools promote learning and skill acquisition, including enhanced literacy skills. School is a crucial site for identifying health and education risks in children. Whole-school interventions using positive behavior support improve academic performance and decrease behavior problems. Improving academic performance through standardized tests in reading and mathematics is crucial. Federal agencies should re-evaluate policies to enhance school-based mental health for America's children. Approximately 20 percent of US school children may require intervention for diagnosable mental illnesses. Over 10 million children may need help to meet emotional well-being goals in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. More than three-quarters of schools, two-thirds of school districts, and half of the States have coordinators for mental health and social services. However, there is no one overseeing or promoting these services in the Department of Education. The Department of Education Organization Act is amended to include a new section for the Office of Specialized Instructional Support Services. The Department of Education will establish an Office of Specialized Instructional Support Services, led by a Director appointed by the Secretary. The Director will work to improve support services in schools, address barriers to student learning, and enhance academic achievement. The Office of Specialized Instructional Support Services will identify effective practices, provide training for personnel, and offer technical assistance to improve academic achievement and educational outcomes for students. The Office of Specialized Instructional Support Services will coordinate programs and services in schools between the Department and other Federal agencies. The Office of Specialized Instructional Support Services will coordinate programs and services in schools to reduce barriers to learning through grants provided to State Educational Agencies. The purposes of this part are to build state capacity for specialized instructional support services at the district level, promote comprehensive service delivery, implement evidence-based practices, and monitor resources for reducing barriers to learning. The purpose of this part is to build state capacity for specialized instructional support services at the district and individual school level, recruit and retain staff for students with barriers to learning, and improve accountability for student outcomes by school personnel. \"SEC. 1902. GRANTS TO STATE EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES.\" The Secretary may award competitive grants to State educational agencies to establish specialized instructional support services and programs at the State level, addressing barriers to learning within local educational agencies and schools. This includes hiring specialized instructional support services coordinators for assistance and coordination. The term 'barriers to learning' encompass various factors that hinder a student's academic success, including social, emotional, behavioral, physical, environmental, and academic issues. The Secretary prioritizes grant applications that show the greatest financial need to support students in overcoming these barriers and achieving academic success. The State educational agency must provide non-Federal matching funds equal to at least 50% of the grant amount to be eligible for a grant under this section. Grants awarded will last for a maximum of 5 years, with up to 15% of the funds allowed for administrative costs. The grant funds must be used to supplement, not supplant, any other federal, state, or local funds available for the activities assisted under this part. \"State applications must adhere to the guidelines outlined in Section 1903.\" Each State educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary for a grant under this part, detailing the state's needs, qualifications for specialized instructional support services coordinators, and the leadership activities to be carried out to meet the purposes of this part. The coordinators must address school population, student outcomes, staffing adequacy, recruitment strategies, evaluation methods, and community involvement for specialized instructional support services. Community groups, social service agencies, and public/private entities collaborate to reduce barriers to learning. SEC. 1904. EVALUATION AND REPORTING. The Secretary will evaluate programs assisted under this part and report publicly on the results, demonstrating how each State educational agency reduced barriers to learning and improved coordination of support services at the local level. \"SEC. 1905. AUTHORIZATIONS.\" The text authorizes necessary funds for fiscal year 2008 and the following 5 years. It amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to replace \"pupil services\" with \"specialized instructional support services\" and \"pupil services personnel\" with \"specialized instructional support personnel.\" It also updates the definition of \"Specialized instructional support personnel; specialized instructional support services.\" The text replaces \"pupil services\" with \"specialized instructional support services\" and \"pupil services personnel\" with \"specialized instructional support personnel.\" It defines specialized instructional support personnel as school counselors, social workers, psychologists, and other professionals providing necessary services to meet student needs. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to redesignate sections and update the table of contents. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to update sections and the table of contents, including provisions related to reduced barriers to learning and general provisions such as federal regulations, state administration, and spending audits. Amendments include changes to section numbers and references within the Act."
