    "content": "The \"Strong Families Act of 2017\" continues the evidence-based home visiting program through fiscal years 2017 to 2022 and aims to demonstrate results to support families. The \"Strong Families Act of 2017\" extends the home visiting program and requires service delivery models to show improvement in benchmark areas. It also mandates continued tracking and reporting of improvements in subsequent years. The \"Strong Families Act of 2017\" requires eligible entities to demonstrate improvements in at least 4 specified areas through their selected service delivery models. If improvements are not shown, a corrective action plan must be developed and implemented. The entity must develop and implement a plan to improve outcomes in specified areas through selected service delivery models, subject to approval by the Secretary. The plan includes provisions for monitoring by the Secretary and submission of regular reports. The Secretary will provide technical assistance to eligible entities as needed. The Secretary may provide technical assistance directly or through grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to eligible entities implementing improvement plans. If an entity fails to show improvement in at least 4 specified areas, the Secretary may take action. The Secretary may terminate a grant if an eligible entity fails to submit a required report. Unexpended grant funds may be reallocated to nonprofit organizations. Additionally, information on applicable benchmarks must be included in the application. Section 511(b)(1) of the Social Security Act is amended to require each State to conduct a statewide needs assessment to receive payments under section 502. Section 511(d)(4)(A) is amended to improve success in high-risk communities by considering staffing and resources for home visiting programs. Option to fund evidence-based home visiting on a pay for outcome basis is provided in Section 6. Section 511(c) of the Social Security Act is amended to allow eligible entities to use up to 25% of a grant for outcomes or success payments related to a pay for outcomes initiative without reducing funding for services. The definition of a pay for outcomes initiative is also clarified in Section 511(k) of the Act. The term 'pay for outcomes initiative' refers to a performance-based agreement where a public entity commits to paying for improved outcomes that result in social benefit and cost savings. It includes a feasibility study and a rigorous evaluation to determine if the initiative has achieved its proposed outcomes. The pay for outcomes initiative includes an annual progress report and a requirement for payments to be made only when agreed upon outcomes are achieved. Funds availability is extended with certain exceptions. Funds for pay for outcomes initiatives under this section shall remain available for expenditure by the eligible entity for up to 10 years after allocation. SEC. 7. DATA EXCHANGE STANDARDS FOR IMPROVED INTEROPERABILITY. Data exchange standards for improved interoperability are designated by the head of the department or agency responsible for administering a program funded under the Social Security Act. This is done in consultation with an interagency work group established by the Office of Management and Budget, considering State government perspectives. These standards are for necessary categories of information that a State agency operating the program is required to electronically exchange. The program must electronically exchange data with another State agency under Federal law. Data exchange standards must be nonproprietary and interoperable. The Secretary should incorporate interoperable standards developed internationally. The curr_chunk discusses the use of interoperable standards for data exchange, including those developed by international voluntary consensus standards bodies, intergovernmental partnerships like the National Information Exchange Model, and Federal entities with authority over contracting and financial assistance. The department or agency responsible for administering a program shall designate data exchange standards in consultation with an interagency work group and considering State government perspectives. The standards should incorporate a widely accepted, nonproprietary, searchable, computer-readable format. The department or agency administering a program shall designate data exchange standards in consultation with an interagency work group. The standards should incorporate a widely accepted, nonproprietary, searchable, computer-readable format and implement applicable accounting principles in a cost-effective manner. Additionally, they should be continually upgradeable and incorporate existing nonproprietary standards. The amendment made by subsection (a) regarding data exchange standards for Federal reporting programs will take effect two years after the enactment of this Act."
