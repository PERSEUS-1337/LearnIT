Following this, incidents such as Shamai Leibowitz's prison sentence for leaking classified materials and Wikileaks publishing over 600,000 classified documents have raised concerns about classified information policy. The Department of Defense is purchasing and destroying a book by a former employee that contains classified information on military operations in Afghanistan. Former U.S. assistant attorney general Jack Goldsmith alleges that senior government officials leaked classified information to journalist Bob Woodward. The report discusses classified information policy, focusing on Executive Order 13526 and identifying oversight issues for Congress. Various authorities and policies restrict access to federal government information. The federal government has policies in place to restrict access to information, including classified information policy. Classified information is defined as material requiring protection by statute or Executive order. Classified information policy refers to federal practices that restrict access to information for national security reasons. Presidents have historically established these policies through executive orders since 1940. President Obama also revised classified information policy through an executive order. President Obama revised classified information policy with E.O. 13526 in 2009, defining who can classify information, levels of classification, access rules, and declassification procedures. Executive orders limit classification use to prevent concealment of violations, inefficiency, or embarrassment. Some orders mandate declassification or establish new agencies. The declassification of documents and establishment of new agencies to implement classified information policy is often done through executive orders. While most executive orders repeal previous policies, E.O. 10104 (1950) remains in effect, limiting the dissemination of information on military installations. Congress has also enacted statutes related to classified information, including prohibitions on gathering and transmitting national defense information. Congress has enacted statutes related to classified information, including prohibitions on gathering and transmitting national defense information, authorizing sanctions, protecting covert intelligence agents, and establishing the Public Interest Declassification Board. The FY1995 intelligence authorization act (P.L. 103-359) assigned the President the responsibility to establish procedures for access to classified information. The Reducing Over-Classification Act (P.L. 111-258) aims to prevent unnecessary classification of information and promote information sharing. The Reducing Over-Classification Act (P.L. 111-258) requires executive branch agencies' inspectors general to assess compliance with classified information policies. The total annual expenditures for classifying and declassifying information by the federal government are not publicly available. The Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) releases a report on agencies' estimated classified information policy costs, but these estimates are not audited and do not include costs from certain intelligence agencies. The ISOO reports that total government classified information policy costs were $8.8 billion in FY2009, with nearly 55% attributed to \"information security.\" This amount is slightly higher than in previous years. Approximately 15% ($1.3 billion) of classified information policy costs are for security management, oversight, and planning, while the remaining 30% ($2.7 billion) is for personnel security, training, and physical security of facilities. In FY2009, $44.7 million was spent on declassifying information, accounting for 0.5% of total classified information policy costs. Executive branch agencies are responsible for classifying, securing, and training personnel in handling classified information. The Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) was established by President James E. Carter via E.O. 12065 in 1978. It is responsible for implementing directives related to classified information policy and ensuring agencies' compliance. Other entities like the Public Interest Declassification Board (PIDB), Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP), and National Declassification Center (NDC) also have classified information policy responsibilities. The ISOO establishes standards for classification, safeguarding classified information, security education, self-inspection programs, and classification guides. It conducts on-site evaluations and addresses complaints about agencies' compliance with E.O. 13526. The ISOO produces annual reports on classified information policy and government classification costs. President Clinton established the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel via E.O. 12958, with President Obama making modest changes to its role. The ISCAP, established by President Obama's E.O. 13526, serves as a forum for resolving declassification disputes. Its members include senior representatives from various government departments, with the ISOO providing administrative support. The ISCAP decides on disputes over classification levels, exemptions from declassification, and other related issues. The Public Interest Declassification Board (PIDB) was established by Congress in 2000 to advise the President and other officials on the systematic declassification of information. It is an independent agency with nine members appointed by the President and Congress, with the Director of the ISOO serving as the executive secretary. The Public Interest Declassification Board (PIDB) was created to oversee the identification, collection, review, and release of declassified records of archival value to Congress, agencies, and the public. It aims to provide public access to a reliable record of national security decisions, support oversight functions, policymaking, public interest, and historical analysis in national security matters. The PIDB also offers recommendations to the President for declassification of information. The Public Interest Declassification Board (PIDB) advises the President on declassification of information of public interest without compromising national security. They also provide recommendations on policies related to classification and declassification of national security information. The PIDB published a report on Improving Declassification and participated in the process leading to the issuance of E.O. 13526. President Obama has been involved in discussions on declassification issues. President Obama established the National Declassification Center via E.O. 13526 to expedite the declassification of information at NARA. Classified information policy was set by E.O. 12958 amended by E.O. 13292 under Presidents Clinton and Bush. Obama ordered a review of this policy in 2009, emphasizing a commitment to openness while safeguarding national security and privacy. The National Security Advisor was tasked with submitting recommendations and proposed revisions to the current policy on declassification, including establishing a National Declassification Center and addressing over classification. This was in line with President Obama's commitment to transparency and national security. The National Security Advisor was tasked with submitting recommendations for changes to the current declassification policy, including increased accountability, greater information sharing, and prohibiting reclassification of declassified material. This is part of President Obama's transparency and national security efforts. The National Security Advisor requested public input on improving classified information policy, receiving approximately 150 comments. The Obama Administration issued revisions to classified information policy in Executive Order 13526 on December 29, 2009. Executive Order 13526, issued on December 29, 2009, established a new policy for classifying, safeguarding, and declassifying national security information. It maintained the three classification levels of top secret, secret, and confidential, with specific criteria for each level. The original classification authority is responsible for classifying information. Executive Order 13526 requires agencies to review their classification guidance regularly to ensure alignment with current policy. Classification is limited to military plans, foreign government information, and intelligence. The Executive Order 13526 outlines the types of information that can be classified, including military plans, foreign government information, intelligence activities, foreign relations, scientific matters, and weapons of mass destruction. It also prohibits classification to conceal violations of law, inefficiency, prevent embarrassment, restrain competition, or delay information release. Section 1.7 of Executive Order 13526 prohibits classification of basic scientific research information not related to national security. Authorized individuals can challenge the classification or level of classification of information. Disputes are resolved by the ISCAP. Original classification occurs when previously unclassified information is classified, while derivative classification occurs when already classified information is reclassified. Derivative classification involves reproducing or using originally classified information to create other classified material. E.O. 13526 grants original classification authority to certain officials who can delegate this power to others. The guidance accompanying the order lists individuals with original classification authority. The order grants original classification authority to agency heads and officials, specifying their classification levels. All classifiers must mark classified information and receive training in classification and declassification policies. E.O. 13526 requires classifiers to set a declassification date based on national security sensitivity, with a maximum classification duration of 10 years. Certain sensitive information can be classified for 25 years, as outlined in Section 3.3 policies. Declassification is the process of making classified information unclassified, with a maximum classification duration of 50 years. The agency or person responsible for classification reviews the information to determine if it should be declassified, exempted, or referred to another agency. E.O. 13526 provides five means for declassification based on the reasons for classification no longer holding. Declassification can occur when the reasons for classification no longer apply or when one agency challenges another's classification. E.O. 13526 outlines three additional means: automatic declassification after 25 years, systematic declassification review, and mandatory declassification review. The NDC oversees declassification activities to ensure compliance with current policy. Other agencies may also review records to determine if any information should remain classified. E.O. 13526 provides guidelines for declassification, including automatic declassification after 25 years, systematic declassification review, and mandatory declassification review. Agencies can request exemptions for information to remain classified, subject to systematic review for up to 50 years. The process of mandatory declassification review is initiated in response to a request for declassification. Certain types of information are exempt from this review, such as information exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, documents originated by the President or Vice President, and those required for prepublication review. The National Declassification Center (NDC) was established by E.O. 13526 at the National Archives in College Park, MD. The National Declassification Center (NDC) in College Park, MD, overseen by a director appointed by the Archivist, aims to expedite declassification of government records. With 75 employees, the NDC was created in 2006 to address a backlog of 418 million pages of classified documents. Its goal is to eliminate this backlog by December 31, 2013. The National Declassification Center (NDC) aims to speed up the declassification process by addressing delays caused by \"multiple agency equity\" in classified information. This involves referring documents to other agencies for review and agreement on declassification. The NDC implements measures to streamline this process, such as closer collaboration between declassifiers from multiple agencies and reducing unnecessary referrals. The Executive Order 13526 sets standards for access to classified information, including eligibility determination, signing nondisclosure agreements, and having a need-to-know. It also mandates regular training on handling classified information and outlines conditions for distribution outside the original agency. The ISOO is empowered to issue regulations on safeguarding, storing, distributing, transmitting, and destroying classified information. The ISOO sets standards for safeguarding, storing, distributing, transmitting, and destroying classified information. E.O. 13526 continues the tradition of congressional deference to the executive branch in setting classified information policy. Congress may reevaluate the benefits and costs of this decision. E.O. 13526 bases classification levels on the criterion of damage to national security. The classification markings represent varying levels of possible damage, with the highest security protection given to information that could cause exceptionally grave damage. No other values or criteria are considered. E.O. 13526 defines national security to include harm to national defense or foreign relations from unauthorized information disclosure. Congress may review the criteria for harm and assess if they are too broad or narrow. E.O. 13526 assigns classified information policy responsibilities to ISOO, NDC, and NARA. Congress can assess agency resources. Agencies must review classification guides within two years to reduce over-classification. Congress can request progress reports on this task. The President ordered the National Declassification Center to clear 400 million pages of classified records over 25 years old by December 31, 2013. Agencies lag in declassifying information, with only 11 million out of 15 million new pages becoming available to the public each year. Congress may monitor progress in reducing the backlog. The Reducing Over-Classification Act was enacted by Congress in October 2010 to complement Executive Order 13526. It promotes transparency, information sharing, and security by appointing a classified information advisory officer within the Department of Homeland Security. The Reducing Over-Classification Act aims to increase information-sharing among agencies by appointing a classified information advisory officer in DHS to develop educational materials and training programs for sub-federal actors. Congress may need to assess implementation challenges and alignment with ISOO standards. The Office of Management and Budget has ordered agencies to establish a security assessment team to review procedures for safeguarding classified information. Congress may hold a hearing to aggregate agency reports on improvements in safeguarding classified information. Unauthorized leaks involve persons authorized to access classified information, prompting Congress to investigate commonalities in motivations and instances. The unauthorized leaks of classified information prompt Congress to investigate commonalities in motivations and instances, including the level of supervision and the format of the information. Increasing consequences for unauthorized releases may deter future incidents."
