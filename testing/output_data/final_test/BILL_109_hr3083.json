    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protection of Homes, Small Businesses, and Private Property Act of 2005\". The Protection of Homes, Small Businesses, and Private Property Act of 2005 emphasizes the fundamental principle of protecting private property rights against government seizures. The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution ensures that private property cannot be taken for public use without just compensation, safeguarding liberty against the abuse of eminent domain power. The United States Supreme Court's decision in Kelo v. City of New London allowed for the seizure of private property for economic development, despite the Fifth Amendment's restriction on eminent domain for \"public use.\" This decision raised concerns about government overreach and property rights. Justice O'Connor, in her dissenting opinion in Kelo v. City of New London, criticized the Court for essentially removing the words \"for public use\" from the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause. She warned that the decision opens the door for the government to seize any property for the benefit of private parties, leading to potential abuse of eminent domain powers. The Kelo v. City of New London decision allows for the transfer of property from those with fewer resources to those with more power, benefiting large corporations and development firms. This could disproportionately harm economically disadvantaged groups, racial and ethnic minorities, and the elderly. Congress should consider taking action to address this issue. Congress and States should act to restore Fifth Amendment protections and limit eminent domain power to protect private property rights. States have the ability to further restrict their exercise of the takings power. The Act limits the power of eminent domain to public use only, excluding economic development. It applies to all exercises of eminent domain by the Federal Government and by State and local governments using Federal funds."
