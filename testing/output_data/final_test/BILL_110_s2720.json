Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 prohibits assistance to countries that hinder repatriation of individuals removed from the US. Funds under this Act cannot be given to a foreign country that unreasonably delays accepting their citizen with a final removal order. A country is considered to have refused or delayed acceptance if they do not take back the individual within 90 days of a repatriation request from the US. The Secretary of Homeland Security must provide quarterly reports listing countries that refuse or delay repatriation of aliens. Sanctions will be imposed on countries that do not issue travel documents for their citizens with final removal orders. The Immigration and Nationality Act requires timely issuance of travel documents for aliens convicted of crimes in the US. The President can request a waiver from Congress for certain countries. The Senate and the House of Representatives must vote on a joint resolution authorizing a waiver request. If either fails to vote before the specified time period, the waiver request is denied. Victims of crimes committed by certain aliens can sue in Federal court to enforce related provisions. No attorney's fees or monetary judgments can be awarded in such suits. SEC. 2. DISCONTINUING GRANTING VISAS TO NATIONALS OF COUNTRY DENYING OR DELAYING ACCEPTING ALIENS. Section 243(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to restrict visa issuance to nationals of countries denying or delaying accepting aliens listed in the Secretary of Homeland Security's report, unless certain conditions are met or waived by Congress. Any visa issued in violation of this provision is deemed null and void. The President or designated cabinet member can request a waiver from Congress to exempt a country from visa restrictions. If Congress does not vote on the waiver request within 7 days, it is effectively denied.
