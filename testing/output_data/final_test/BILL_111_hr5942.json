    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"FFSCC Act of 2010\" and includes findings and purpose. The Congress finds that over 60 million low- and moderate-income consumers in America are unbanked, underbanked, or underserved. Certain racial and ethnic groups, such as Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indian/Alaskans, are more likely to be unbanked, while Asians and Whites are less likely. Minorities are also more likely to be underbanked than the population as a whole. Households with income under $30,000 make up 71% of unbanked households, with nearly 20% of lower-income households in the US not having a bank account. As income increases, the percentage of unbanked households decreases significantly. Households with yearly income of $75,000 or higher are unbanked due to lack of access to affordable banking products and services, hindering economic advancement for low- and moderate-income consumers and communities. The purpose of this Act is to establish a market for underbanked and unbanked individuals to access financial services. The Act aims to establish a Federal Financial Services and Credit Company to provide financial services to underbanked and unbanked individuals. The Comptroller of the Currency is authorized to establish Federal Financial Services and Credit Companies (FFSCCs) under specific regulations. Companies seeking an FFSCC charter must have at least 10 years of experience providing certain financial services to underbanked individuals. The Comptroller of the Currency can establish Federal Financial Services and Credit Companies (FFSCCs) under regulations. These companies must have 10 years of experience serving underbanked individuals. The FFSCCs can offer various financial services to consumers and small businesses, including open-end credit, non-recourse credit, reloadable stored value cards, ancillary financial services, and short-term consumer credit. The Comptroller of the Currency can establish Federal Financial Services and Credit Companies (FFSCCs) under regulations. These companies must have 10 years of experience serving underbanked individuals. FFSCCs can offer various financial services to consumers and small businesses, including short-term consumer credit services determined appropriate by the Comptroller. The company must not be a depository institution or credit union and must submit a business plan addressing statutory and policy considerations. The plan should reflect sound financial principles, realistic risk assessments, and market conditions for serving underbanked and unbanked populations. The company seeking to be established as a Federal Financial Services and Credit Company (FFSCC) must demonstrate management ability to serve underbanked and unbanked populations, comply with banking laws, and have senior officials knowledgeable about banking regulations and customer needs. The company applying for an FFSCC charter must have competent management with experience in designing financial services for underbanked and unbanked customers. The term \"company\" includes the applying entity, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and affiliated entities. Requirements placed on FFSCCs include credit disclosures. Requirements placed on FFSCCs include providing clear and prominent credit disclosures for short-term and long-term credit extensions, stating the true cost of the loan in terms of a finance charge per dollar of credit instead of the annual percentage rate disclosure required by the Truth in Lending Act. Each FFSCC must disclose the finance charge as an annual percentage rate, provide continuous account access, implement financial literacy programs, and comply with additional requirements for offering financial services. The FFSCC offers a range of financial services to the underbanked, unbanked, and those with low credit scores. They aim to provide access to credit products for unbanked or underbanked consumers by filing necessary documents and submitting a detailed business plan to the Comptroller of the Currency. The FFSCC has the power to provide financial services to unbanked and underbanked individuals, with penalties for violations and an annual fee requirement. State laws may be preempted. Preemption of State Law: A law of a State or political subdivision is preempted if it discriminates against a company chartered as an FFSCC. The Comptroller of the Currency is required to conduct a study on credit rates and terms, and develop financial products for underbanked individuals that are fair and economically viable for FFSCCs to offer. The Act defines key terms such as \"consumer,\" \"depository institution,\" \"insured credit union,\" \"long-term credit,\" and \"short-term credit.\" The Act defines key terms related to credit, including \"small business,\" \"underbanked,\" and \"underbanked person.\" The Comptroller of the Currency may issue regulations to define other terms. The Comptroller of the Currency may issue regulations to define additional terms related to credit as necessary for implementing the Act."
