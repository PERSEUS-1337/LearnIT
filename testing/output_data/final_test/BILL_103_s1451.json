    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"SSI Outreach Act of 1993\" and includes a statement of findings and purpose. Congress finds that many individuals, including senior citizens, homeless individuals, children, and disabled individuals, face difficulties in securing benefits under various Federal programs due to barriers such as communication issues, disabilities, and lack of resources. The purpose of this Act is to overcome barriers to securing benefits under the Social Security Act, including homelessness coupled with mental illness, drug addiction, distrust of government bureaucracy, concern about future work attempts, lack of transportation and access to a telephone, lack of understanding of how to contact Social Security Administration offices, lack of connections to social service organizations, and cognitive impairments limiting understanding of benefits and procedures. The Social Security Act and Food Stamp Act of 1977 face barriers for homeless individuals and hard-to-reach populations. An office in the Social Security Administration will coordinate outreach activities and services, including a grant program to help identify and assist eligible individuals in applying for benefits. Establishment of Office of Outreach Coordination. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish an Office of Outreach Coordination within the Social Security Administration. The Director of Outreach Coordination will administer a grant program, provide technical assistance, and offer information on outreach policies and activities to field offices.

If such limitations are present, the Secretary must take appropriate action. The Secretary must take affirmative steps to locate and assist homeless individuals in filing an appeal for benefits and securing necessary evidence. This includes trying to contact the individual by telephone, making a personal visit to their last known address, and reaching out to social agencies for assistance.
