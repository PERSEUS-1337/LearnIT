    "content": "We present a data-driven approach to construct a library of feedback motion primitives for non-holonomic vehicles, ensuring bounded error in following trajectories. The library is built on local abstractions of dynamics, allowing for addition of new motion primitives. Sufficient conditions are provided for constructing robust motion primitives for various nonlinear dynamics, including the Reeds-Shepp model. The algorithm is applied to motion planning and control of a rover with slipping, without prior modeling. Vehicles use the bicycle model for trajectory planning, which can lead to challenges if the model does not closely match the actual vehicle dynamics. Recent approaches incorporate vehicle dynamics in planning to ensure collision avoidance using model predictive control. In this work, the authors propose a method for trajectory planning using locally linear abstractions and local feedback rules to ensure bounded state error when applying motion primitives. This approach aims to address the limitations of model predictive control in non-convex problem settings. The authors propose a method for trajectory planning using locally linear abstractions and local feedback rules to ensure bounded state error when applying motion primitives for non-holonomic vehicles. They introduce the concept of robustifiability and define the problem of finding a sequence of state subsets for an agent with translation invariant dynamics. The authors propose a method for trajectory planning using locally linear abstractions and local feedback rules to ensure bounded state error when applying motion primitives for non-holonomic vehicles. They introduce the concept of robustifiability and define the problem of finding a sequence of state subsets for an agent with translation invariant dynamics. Their approach involves defining motion primitives as a composition of constant inputs and feedback control terms, with coarse motion primitives created by splitting the input space using a coarse grid. Feedback control laws are designed around each center to ensure state uncertainty remains within a certain bound over a number of time steps. The authors introduce the concept of robustifiability for trajectory planning of non-holonomic vehicles. They define robustifiability as the ability to steer the state in any direction and provide assumptions for finding feedback control bounds. An example of a robustifiable system is the Reeds-Shepp model. The authors introduce the concept of robustifiability for trajectory planning of non-holonomic vehicles. Robustifiability is the ability to steer the state in any direction, better conditioned when controlled through both steering angle and velocity. For a linear system, robustifiability is equivalent to controllability. Bounded state uncertainty is ensured, and a sequence of motion primitives satisfying a planning problem on a discrete graph is sought. The feedback control term ensures the system ends up within the desired \u03b5-ball. If a satisfying plan cannot be found, an over-approximation of the reachable set is computed. The algorithm for trajectory planning of non-holonomic vehicles is asymptotically complete for deterministic systems. Motion primitives are constructed without needing a model of the dynamics, ensuring bounded state uncertainty through input sampling. The feedback strategy can be extended for environments with moving obstacles, allowing for robustifiability and steering in any direction. If a plan cannot be found, the grid is refined on the input space to determine existence. The feedback strategy for motion primitives can be extended using the vehicle's relative position to obstacles. However, the reach-avoid problem is non-convex and may not converge to the goal if obstacles move close to it. The approach was tested on an Erle-Rover UGV in a room with motion capture and a slippery floor, using MATLAB and ROS for communication."
