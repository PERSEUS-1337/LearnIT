    "content": "In 1999, a settlement agreement and consent decree were approved in Pigford v. Glickman, a discrimination suit between the USDA and black farmers. Congress enacted legislation in 2008 to address concerns about applicants who did not receive a determination on their claims. This led to the consolidation of multiple claims into a single case known as Pigford II, resulting in a settlement agreement. The Pigford consent decree and Pigford II settlement addressed discrimination against African American farmers by the USDA. Black farmers had long complained of unfair treatment in loan applications, leading to foreclosure threats. Many black farmers faced financial ruin due to USDA's denial of timely loans and discrimination complaints. A study from 1990 to 1995 found that minorities received less than their fair share of USDA money for crop payments, disaster payments, and loans. A study from 1990 to 1995 revealed disparities in USDA loans and payments, with minority complainants facing slow processes, lack of confidence in decision makers, and bureaucratic hurdles. The largest USDA loans mostly went to corporations and white male farmers, while black males received less funding. White farmers received 97% of disaster payments, raising concerns about racial discrimination in USDA practices. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman suspended farm foreclosures nationwide to investigate these disparities further. In response to racial discrimination in the USDA loan program, a Civil Rights Task Force recommended 92 changes in 1997. A class action lawsuit was filed by black farmers, including Timothy Pigford, alleging discrimination in federal financial assistance from 1983 to 1997. The Pigford lawsuit was filed by black farmers alleging discrimination in USDA loans. The government agreed to mediation and settlement discussions, but the Justice Department opposed blanket mediation. USDA acknowledged past discrimination but struggled to resolve individual complaints from minority farmers. The court lifted the stay and set a trial date for the class action lawsuit filed by black farmers against the USDA for discrimination in loans. Judge Friedman certified the class of farmers who filed complaints between 1983 and 1997. Congress waived the statute of limitations on civil rights cases against the USDA to address the issue. The court approved a consent decree in the Pigford and Brewington cases, allowing for a revised settlement agreement for African American farmers who faced discrimination by the USDA between 1981 and 1996. Checks were disbursed to qualifying farmers starting in November 1999. Eligible recipients had to have farmed during that period, applied for USDA benefits, believed they were discriminated against based on race, and filed a complaint. The Pigford consent decree established a system for claims submission and review for African American farmers who faced discrimination by the USDA. It provided a two-track dispute resolution mechanism, with Track A offering a $50,000 monetary settlement, loan forgiveness, and tax liability offsets for claimants who could prove discrimination. The Pigford consent decree allowed African American farmers to file claims if they were treated unfairly by the USDA in loan applications, leading to economic harm. Claimants could seek compensation through Track A with a $50,000 settlement or through Track B by proving greater damages with evidence reviewed by an arbitrator. The Pigford consent decree allowed African American farmers to file claims for unfair treatment by the USDA in loan applications. Claimants could seek compensation through Track A with a $50,000 settlement or Track B by proving greater damages with evidence reviewed by an arbitrator. The consent decree also provided injunctive relief, priority consideration for loans and purchases, technical assistance, and the option for plaintiffs to pursue individual cases in federal court or through the USDA administrative process. Claimants had 180 days to file their claim with the facilitator and could seek review by the monitor if deemed ineligible as a class member. Late-filing claimants had until September 15, 2000, to request permission to submit a late claim to the arbitrator, who would assess if extraordinary circumstances justified the delay. Lack of notice was not accepted as a valid reason for late filing, given the extensive publicity about the settlement agreement. The lack of notice was deemed an unacceptable excuse for late filing in the Pigford I case. Issues arose due to underestimating the number of claims, leading to concerns over the high denial rate, particularly in Track A. Interest groups attribute the low approval percentages to the requirement for claimants to prove less favorable treatment compared to white farmers, worsened by limited access to USDA files. Court Monitor statistics as of December 30, 2011, show the status of Track A claims. As of December 30, 2011, there were 169 eligible Track B claimants (1% of total eligible class members). Many farmers did not have their cases heard on the merits due to late filing, making them eligible to file under Pigford II. Approximately 73,800 Pigford II petitions were filed under the late filing procedure, with 2,116 allowed to proceed under Pigford I. Out of 20,700 timely requests for reconsideration, 17,279 had been decided by the end of 2005. Many argued that the late filings for Pigford II cases by the end of 2005 indicated ineffective notice. Some blamed the class counsel for mismanagement, with Judge Friedman criticizing their representation as bordering on legal malpractice. He also expressed disappointment in USDA's reluctance to ensure compliance with discrimination laws in the future. The Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association (BFAA) filed a $20.5 billion class action lawsuit against the USDA for alleged racial discriminatory practices. The lawsuit was dismissed in March 2005 due to lack of standing. Approximately 22,721 claimants were eligible for the Pigford I claims process, with 15,645 prevailing in Track A. Approximately 15,645 claimants prevailed in Track A, while 104 claimants settled their claims in Track B. The Monitor directed reexamination of about 50% of the claims. The federal government provided around $1.06 billion in cash relief to prevailing claimants. The 2008 farm bill allowed late-filing claimants under Pigford to petition in federal court for a determination on their claims. This led to multiple lawsuits consolidated into Pigford II, with a $1.25 billion settlement announced in 2010. The funding for the settlement came from the Judgment Fund. The Pigford II settlement required an additional $1.15 billion in funding, which was approved by Congress in the Claims Resolution Act of 2010. The legislation included measures to prevent fraud and was signed into law in December 2010. The Pigford II settlement agreement, revised in May 2011, allows eligible claimants who filed late under the original Pigford consent decree to receive fast-track payments of up to $50,000 or choose a longer process for damages of up to $250,000. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted final approval of the settlement on October 27, 2011. The Pigford II settlement agreement was approved by the court, allowing claims to be submitted from November 14, 2011. The deadline for claims was May 11, 2012. Approximately 89,000 claim forms were mailed out, with nearly 40,000 filed and 34,000 deemed complete and eligible. An information website was established for claimants to access information and monitor the claims process. The claims administrator implemented internal controls to ensure valid claims were processed. Hearing officers, approved by the court, underwent training and conducted multiple reviews. Statistical analysis and oversight by GAO and USDA's Office of the Inspector General ensured a fair review process. The Claims Resolution Act of 2010 mandated GAO to evaluate the process, with a report published in December 2012. The GAO published a report in December 2012 on the review process, identifying weaknesses in the internal control design that could expose the claims process to risks. Some weaknesses were due to constraints from the settlement agreement and originated in the Pigford I settlement. GAO recognized that certain weaknesses could not be modified by parties implementing Pigford II, but noted that internal controls could be improved to prevent claimants who obtained prior judgments on discrimination complaints. Under the Pigford II settlement, claims will not be paid until all claims have been reviewed for validity. The claims administrator expects to complete this process by June/July 2013 and begin distributing payments to successful claimants. Preliminary estimates suggest that 17,000-19,000 Track A claims are likely to be approved, a rate of 50%-56%. This is lower than the success rate of approximately 69% for Track A claims under Pigford I. Additionally, a final judicial review of the claims process will occur before the settlement is finalized. The provision mandates a moratorium on loan acceleration and foreclosure proceedings in cases of discrimination against USDA. It waives interest and offsets on loans under this title during the moratorium. The moratorium ends when the discrimination claim is resolved by the Secretary of Agriculture or the court makes a final decision. Questions have been raised about the eligibility of black farmers for settlement under Pigford or Pigford II. Determining the number of African American farm operators eligible for settlement under Pigford or Pigford II is challenging due to how the Census of Agriculture defined farm operators. Prior to 2002, only principal operators were counted, leading to inaccuracies in the number of African American-operated farms. In 2002, the Census collected data for up to three principal operators per farm, enumerating 29,090 African American farm operators, a more accurate representation. The Census of Agriculture in 2002 enumerated 29,090 African American farm operators, capturing a more accurate count of those engaged in farming. The varying definitions of farm, farm operator, and farm owner explain why the number of initial claimants in the Pigford case was higher than the number of farms/farm operators counted between 1982 and 1997. The estimated number of potential Pigford II claimants may be greater than the number of farms/farm operators enumerated in Census data between 1982 and 1997. Discrepancies between farm Census data and claimants may be due to individuals denied loans or farm assistance, deceased farmers' estates, and possible fraud in claim filings. Some individuals who are not eligible may have filed or may file claims under Pigford or Pigford II, but such claims would not be entitled to an award. Nearly 7,000 Track A claims in Pigford were denied relief, indicating a lack of merit or other defects. The number of claims filed does not accurately represent the number of awards made under the settlements. Bills have been introduced in Congress to provide relief to late-filers who did not receive assistance under the original Pigford settlement. The Farmers Benefits Relief Act of 2007 aimed to provide relief to claimants whose petitions were not considered. The 2008 farm bill included provisions from these bills, allocating up to $100 million for settlement costs. Additional funding was requested in the FY2010 budget but not provided. Senator Grassley and Senator Hagan introduced a bill to access the Judgment Fund for successful claims, with a similar bill introduced in the House. During the 111th Congress, a settlement of Pigford II claims was announced by Attorney General Holder and Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack. The Administration requested $1.15 billion for the settlement in a 2010 supplemental appropriation bill. However, the Senate did not include the funding in the final bill, H.R. 4213, which passed without the Pigford II funding. The House version of H.R. 4899 included funding for Pigford II, but the Senate version did not. After some back and forth between the House and Senate, the Claims Resolution Act of 2010 was passed, providing the $1.15 billion appropriation for Pigford II on November 19, 2010."
