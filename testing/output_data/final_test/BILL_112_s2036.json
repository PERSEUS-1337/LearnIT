The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum opened in 1939 in Cooperstown, New York. It honors excellence and connects generations through the history of baseball, which reflects the nation's history since the Civil War. Only one percent of Major League Baseball players have been inducted into the Hall of Fame. The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, houses the world's largest collection of baseball artifacts, including documents, photographs, and recorded media. Since opening in 1939, over 14 million fans have visited to learn about baseball history. The museum serves as an educational institution, reaching 10 million Americans annually through interactive lessons led by educators. Teachers participate in interactive lessons led by educators from the National Baseball Hall of Fame Museum, using baseball to teach important lessons on various topics to students nationwide. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint and issue $5 gold coins, $1 silver coins, and half-dollar clad coins in recognition of the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

The half-dollar clad coins will weigh 11.34 grams, have a diameter of 1.205 inches. The coins minted under this Act will have a diameter of 1.205 inches and be legal tender.

The coins minted under this Act will have a diameter of 1.205 inches and be legal tender, resembling a baseball with a convex reverse and concave obverse design chosen pursuant to section 4(c). The design of coins under this Act will be determined according to section 4. Design requirements for coins minted under this Act include being emblematic of baseball, featuring a value designation, the year 2015, and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design will be selected by the Secretary in consultation with the National Baseball Hall of Fame and the Commission of Fine Arts, and reviewed by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. Additionally, there will be an obverse design competition. The Secretary will hold a competition to design the common obverse of baseball coins minted under this Act. The design must be emblematic of baseball and judged by an expert jury. The winner will receive compensation of at least $5,000. A plaster model must accompany the design for consideration. The common reverse design of the coins will also be determined. The common reverse design of the baseball coins minted under this Act will depict a baseball similar to those used in Major League Baseball. SEC. 5 of the Act specifies that coins will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities, and they can only be issued during a 1-year period starting on January 1, 2015. SEC. 6 addresses the sale of these coins. SEC. 6 of the Act outlines the sale of coins, including pricing, bulk sales, and accepting prepaid orders. The coins will be sold at a price including face value, surcharge, and design costs. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will receive a reasonable discount as well. All sales of coins minted under this Act will include surcharges: $35 per $5 coin, $10 per $1 coin, and $5 per half-dollar coin. Surcharges received will be promptly paid to the National Baseball Hall of Fame to support its operations. The Hall of Fame will be audited for the amounts received. No surcharge may be included for any coin issuance in a calendar year if the issuance has already occurred. The Secretary of the Treasury may issue guidance to limit the number of commemorative coin programs issued in a calendar year to comply with the annual issuance limitation under title 31, United States Code. SEC. 8. BUDGET COMPLIANCE. The budgetary effects of this Act must comply with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. The determination will be based on the latest statement submitted by the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives before the vote on passage."
