    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Baseball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act\" and includes findings related to the Hall of Fame. The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum opened in 1939 in Cooperstown, New York with an inaugural class of Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson, Christy Mathewson, Babe Ruth, and Honus Wagner. Since then, only one percent of all Major League Baseball players have been inducted. The Hall of Fame is dedicated to preserving history, honoring excellence, and connecting generations through the rich history of baseball, which mirrors the nation's history since the Civil War. The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, opened in 1939 in Cooperstown, New York, houses the world's largest collection of baseball artifacts, including 38,000 3D artifacts, 3 million documents, 500,000 photographs, and 12,000 hours of recorded media. More than 14 million baseball fans have visited the museum since its opening to learn about the game's history and its connection to American history. The museum serves as an educational institution, reaching 10 million Americans annually through interactive lessons led by educators. Teachers participate in interactive lessons led by educators from the National Baseball Hall of Fame Museum, using baseball to teach students important lessons on various topics like mathematics, geography, civil rights, women's history, economics, technology, arts, and communication. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS. The Secretary of the Treasury shall mint and issue $5 gold coins, $1 silver coins, and half dollar clad coins with specific weights, diameters, and metal compositions in recognition of the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The coins minted under this Act for the National Baseball Hall of Fame should have a diameter of 1.205 inches and be minted to specific specifications. They will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. Congress suggests minting the coins in a domed fashion similar to the 2009 International Year of Astronomy coins. The design of coins for the National Baseball Hall of Fame under this Act will have a diameter of 1.205 inches and be minted to specific specifications, suggested to be in a domed fashion similar to the 2009 International Year of Astronomy coins. The design of the coins minted under this Act shall symbolize baseball and American sports, with inscriptions including the coin's value, year \"2015\", and words like \"Liberty\" and \"In God We Trust\". The design will be chosen by the Secretary in consultation with the National Baseball Hall of Fame and reviewed by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. The Secretary will hold a design competition for the obverse of the coins minted under this Act, with a jury consisting of members from the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee and the Commission of Fine Arts. The winning design will receive compensation of at least $5,000, and a plaster model must accompany the design. The reverse design of the coins minted under this Act will feature a baseball similar to those used in Major League Baseball. Coins minted under this Act will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities. Any United States Mint facility can strike uncirculated and half-dollar coins, but only the facility at West Point, New York, can strike coins in proof quality. The Secretary may issue these coins only during a 1-year period starting on January 1, 2015. The Secretary will sell coins issued under this Act at a price including face value, surcharge, and design costs. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will receive a reasonable discount. Surcharges will also be applied. All sales of coins minted under this Act will include surcharges: $35 for the $5 coin, $10 for the $1 coin, and $5 for the half dollar coin. The surcharges received will be promptly paid to the National Baseball Hall of Fame to support its operations. The Hall of Fame will be audited for the amounts received. No surcharge may be included for any coin issuance during a calendar year if the issuance has already occurred. The Secretary of the Treasury may issue guidance to limit the number of commemorative coin programs issued in a calendar year to comply with the annual issuance limitation under title 31, United States Code. SEC. 8. BUDGET COMPLIANCE. The budgetary effects of this Act shall be determined by reference to the latest statement for compliance with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010."
