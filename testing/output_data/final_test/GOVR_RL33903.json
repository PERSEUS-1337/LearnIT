    "content": "In considering legislation to address genetic discrimination, Congress must understand genetic information, current laws affecting employers and insurers, proposed legislative changes, and arguments for and against new laws. Defining genetic information in nondiscrimination laws is crucial, as it determines permissible and prohibited activities. Genetic information can be obtained through genetic testing, other laboratory testing, physical examination, or family medical history. Understanding what constitutes discrimination based on genetic information is crucial in the current legislative debate in Congress. Genetic discrimination is the potential use of an individual's genetic information by employers or health insurers to discriminate in employment or health insurance coverage decisions. Federal laws and a presidential order provide some regulation in this area, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, HIPAA, and Executive Order 13145. The ADA protects against discrimination in employment based on disability, including genetic information. HIPAA limits coverage denial for pre-existing conditions to 12 months and does not consider genetic risk predictions as pre-existing conditions. The HIPAA privacy rule restricts the disclosure of health information, including genetic information, by health plans. The HIPAA privacy rule allows health plans to use health information, including genetic information, in underwriting. State laws prohibit discrimination based on genetic test results and the requirement for individuals to take genetic tests. Legislation in Congress aims to extend federal protections against discrimination to health insurers in the individual market and limit the use and disclosure of genetic information. The bills S. 358 and H.R. 493 aim to limit the use and disclosure of genetic information, prohibit insurers from using genetic information in underwriting, and prevent discrimination in employment based on genetic information. The bills also include provisions for enforcement and do not address life or disability insurance. President Bush called on Congress to pass bipartisan genetic nondiscrimination legislation in 2007, supported by consumer groups, the medical profession, researchers, and the medical products industry. Opposition has come from some members of the insurance industry and employers represented by the GINE Coalition. Supporters argue that current laws do not clearly protect against discrimination based on genetic information. Supporters argue that proper protections for genetic information are necessary to allay fears of discrimination and encourage individuals to seek health services and participate in clinical research. Many groups believe individuals should not be penalized for genetic predispositions without effective treatments available. The ACLU emphasized in 2001 that individuals should be judged on their abilities, not potential genetic conditions. Opponents argue against special legislation to prevent genetic discrimination, stating current protections are sufficient. The insurance industry opposes additional regulation, claiming it would be confusing and costly. Some groups support federal nondiscrimination legislation, while others seek to limit the definition of genetic information. Some employers question the necessity of legislation against genetic discrimination, citing few documented cases and existing protections. Consumer groups want insurance and employment provisions in nondiscrimination laws. The policy should be narrowed to allow employers to consider genetic risk factors when making employment decisions. Business coalition members suggest revising the definition of \"family member\" and support federal preemption. The report discusses genetic discrimination, the impact of fear of discrimination, and key issues raised by genetic nondiscrimination bills. For more information on genetic testing and public policy, refer to CRS Report RL33832, Genetic Testing: Scientific Background. Genetic testing and public policy are discussed in relation to the use and regulation of health information, including genetic information. The challenge of protecting privacy in the face of increasing electronic data capabilities is highlighted. Federal laws, such as HIPAA, provide some protection against genetic discrimination in health insurance. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 and the Social Security Act (SSA) contain provisions to prevent genetic discrimination in health insurance. HIPAA prohibits preexisting condition exclusions based on genetic information, but allows for higher premiums based on genetic information. The SSA prohibits discrimination in Medigap policies based on health status, but these protections expire after six months and do not cover genetic information. The privacy rule under HIPAA allows health plans and providers to use and disclose medical information for treatment, payment, and operations without authorization. This includes genetic tests and family history information. Group health plans can share health information with employers for administration purposes. Individuals or groups may be charged higher insurance premiums based on their health risk factors. Factors such as age, sex, occupation, financial stability, and prior healthcare costs are used to determine premiums. In smaller groups, the health of individual members plays a larger role in determining premiums. Those seeking individual health insurance may face higher costs without group coverage. Insurers may find genetic information useful for underwriting in the future, as it can improve the prediction of future medical expenses. This could make individual health insurance more expensive for sick individuals who are not part of a group coverage. Some health care providers and consumers fear that genetic information could be used for underwriting health insurance. The model's author suggests insurers support screening for genetic mutations with preventive interventions. However, health insurers may disagree due to the uncertainty of reducing medical costs and the reluctance to bear preventive care expenses. The predictive power of genetic testing raises concerns for insurers about adverse selection, where applicants with health risks may purchase insurance with greater coverage at lower premiums. Some argue insurers need access to genetic information to prevent adverse selection, while others believe these concerns may be unfounded. The majority of Americans receive insurance through their employers. Some argue insurers need genetic information to prevent adverse selection, but concerns may be unfounded. Majority of Americans get insurance through employers, which are group rated. Genetic information about disease risk may be too complex for insurers to use effectively. ADA may protect against employers using genetic information for promotion decisions. The ADA prohibits employers from using health information for promotion decisions. Genetic screening cannot be required by employers according to the EEOC. Employers can request medical exams for prospective employees with conditional offers. ADA protections for genetics are unclear, leading to debates among supporters and opponents of genetic nondiscrimination legislation. Opponents argue that proposed legislation lacks clarity on genetic makeup's impact on workplace functions and potential harm. OSHA allows genetic testing for monitoring exposure to hazards, differentiating between acquired damage and inherited predispositions. Genetic screening can determine if an employee is developing DNA damage from asbestos exposure or if they are more susceptible to asbestos damage. The definition of genetic information is crucial for genetic nondiscrimination legislation, as it affects the scope of discrimination prohibitions. Genetic information includes genes, gene products, inherited traits, family medical histories, and genetic test results. It is distinct from current health status and raises questions about the need for genetic-specific nondiscrimination legislation. Genetic information is considered unique due to its stability, predictive qualities, potential for identification, and fear of discrimination. Some argue for special protections to prevent misuse and promote public health benefits from genetic research. Opponents believe genetic information does not warrant special protections compared to other health data. The Senate report for S. 1053 stated that genetic information may not need special protections compared to other health data. A study compared experiences of individuals with genetic conditions to those with other medical conditions, finding that patients often felt strongly about their health. Patients with genetic conditions felt strongly about the need to protect their health information, including non-genetic stigmatizing conditions. Separate privacy policies for genetic and non-genetic health information were deemed unnecessary based on the study findings. However, other research suggests that additional protections for genetic information may be desired by patients and the community. Individuals with high levels of concern are less likely to meet with healthcare professionals for genetic testing discussions or undergo testing. A 2004 survey showed that most people oppose employers and insurance companies accessing their genetic test results. Critics argue that genetic discrimination legislation may not be necessary due to few reported cases in health insurance and employment. Rothenberg and Terry suggest reasons for this low number of cases, including limited use of genetic information by employers and insurers, lack of awareness of genetic basis for adverse decisions, and underreporting due to disincentives. Reports of genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment are presented below. A study found that 22% of respondents were denied health insurance due to a genetic condition, although this was disputed by the Health Insurance Association of America. Another study identified discrimination by health and life insurance companies, healthcare providers, and blood banks. Several institutions, including insurance companies, adoption agencies, and employers, were reported to engage in genetic discrimination against asymptomatic individuals. Cases included an insurance company treating a genetic diagnosis as a preexisting condition, an adoption agency denying a woman at risk for Huntington's disease from adopting, and an employer firing an employee after disclosing a risk of Huntington's disease. Individuals shared their stories of genetic discrimination with the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health and Society. Mr. Hardt faced discrimination due to his hemophilia and family's genetic conditions, leading to denial of insurance, lower wages, and rejection for long-term care insurance. Another individual, Rebecca Fisher, experienced concerns from her employer regarding exceeding healthcare cost caps. Tonia Phillips, with a BRCA1 mutation, underwent surgery to reduce cancer risk. Her employer increased her health insurance by $13,000 and suggested switching to her husband's policy with a wage increase. Paula Funk, also with a BRCA1 mutation, paid for testing out of pocket to avoid discrimination. She struggled to find affordable group insurance for herself and her husband, who co-own a small business. Heidi Williams, diagnosed with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, faced insurance denial for her children due to being carriers of the disease. After pressure from advocacy groups and the media, the insurance company reversed its decision and provided six months of free coverage. Terri Seargent, also diagnosed with the same condition, submitted a statement to the Senate committee in July 2000. Heidi Williams faced insurance denial for her children due to her alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency diagnosis. Terri Seargent submitted a statement to the Senate committee indicating discrimination under the ADA. The weight of individual stories in policy decisions is debated, as obtaining representative genetic information from the population is challenging. Employers testing for genetic markers is not widespread. Employers have shown interest in identifying optimal employees using non-health characteristics like behavior or intelligence to predict productivity. Behavioral genetic testing is not yet ready for commercial use due to the complex interaction of genes and the environment, but other forms of testing are common. The American Management Association has surveyed employers' medical testing practices, revealing the use of various testing methods. In a 1998 survey by the AMA on medical testing practices, only two out of 1,627 employers performed genetic testing as defined by the National Institutes of Health. A larger percentage (14.3%) tested for \"susceptibility to workplace hazards.\" A 1999 follow-up survey revealed that not all testing characterized as \"genetic\" actually was. In a 1998 survey by the AMA on medical testing practices, only 9 out of 44 employers with testing programs had genetic testing. Some employers confused blood tests with genetic testing, while others considered diagnostic testing as genetic testing. A 2001 survey showed that 68% of major U.S. firms required medical examinations, with testing for illegal substance use being the most common. Some employers also tested for genetic diseases like sickle cell anemia. Some employers tested new or current employees for genetic diseases like sickle cell anemia and Huntington's disease, and asked about family medical history. Medical test results were used for hiring decisions. A 1996 study found that 13% of respondents were denied a job due to a genetic condition in the family, with a higher impact on those with genetic conditions. A man with a disorder was denied a job after the disorder was mentioned in his medical report. A woman with a skeletal disorder was fired after disclosing her diagnosis but got her job back with legal help. A study interviewed individuals with various health conditions about their experiences with health insurance, revealing that 27% had been denied coverage or offered expensive rates. Respondents with genetic diseases like sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis were more likely to report being denied health insurance or facing unaffordable rates. Legislation like S. 358 / H.R. 493 aims to limit genetic discrimination but may not address insurance availability or costs for those with genetic conditions. Previous cases, such as Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Corporation settling charges related to genetic testing discrimination, highlight the issue of genetic discrimination in healthcare. Employees were tested for a genetic marker associated with carpel tunnel syndrome without their knowledge. Burlington Northern halted the testing after a lawsuit was filed, and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory settled a case involving pre-employment genetic screening. The employees filed a court case against Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory for genetic testing without their knowledge, settling out of court in 1999. The laboratory tried to dismiss the case, claiming the statute of limitations had expired, but an appellate court sided with the employees, stating that material facts existed and precluded summary judgement. Studies have shown that public fear of genetic discrimination influences the use of genetic testing and information, leading to potential refusal of beneficial therapies and participation in research. Concerns have been raised about whether genetic counseling may increase fear of discrimination, impacting behavior. In January 2000, the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing sponsored a public forum focusing on the fear of genetic discrimination. Anecdotal cases of discrimination were revealed, leading to the committee urging support for nondiscrimination protections. Many Americans fear genetic discrimination by third parties like health insurers and employers, leading to reluctance in undergoing genetic testing or research. This fear hinders advancements in genetic testing and limits its benefits. Testimonies in October 2004 highlighted the impact of genetic discrimination on behavior. Despite strong personal and family history, individuals are hesitant to undergo genetic testing due to fear of discrimination from health insurers and employers. This fear has led to missed opportunities for health benefits and advancements in genetic testing. Surveys show that people are likely to withhold genetic testing information from insurance companies and employers, with genetic counselors also avoiding submitting charges to insurance companies out of fear of discrimination. Twenty-five percent of individuals would use an alias when getting genetic tests to avoid discrimination. While most would share results with physicians and family, 60% would not share with colleagues due to privacy concerns and fear of job discrimination. Only 4% would share results with insurance companies, and 20% with employers, showing a reluctance to disclose genetic testing information. A study on individuals with a history of breast or ovarian cancer found that before receiving genetic testing results, about half were concerned about insurance discrimination. A group of scientists at the University of Michigan offered genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility to 184 individuals, who had to pay for the consultation and testing through Myriad Genetics. Myriad charged varying fees for different types of genetic analysis. Patients could choose to self-pay or bill their insurance companies for the testing. Patients undergoing genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility had the option to self-pay or bill insurance. Concerns about cost, confidentiality, and insurance discrimination led to 26% declining testing. Approximately 14% of eligible patients may not undergo testing due to these concerns. In a study involving 184 patients, 15% paid out of pocket for medical services to avoid involving their insurance companies. 38% had no issues obtaining insurance coverage, with 23 patients only requesting payment for consult and surgery. Patients' family income influenced their decision to seek insurance reimbursement. Another study of 68 patients offered genetic testing for breast cancer showed that 37 chose to pay out of pocket due to concerns over insurability and confidentiality. Some patients chose to pay out of pocket for genetic testing due to concerns over insurability and confidentiality. Fear of genetic discrimination may be influenced by income level and government healthcare coverage. Genetic counseling sessions often discuss the risk of discrimination by employers and insurers, even though actual cases are few. Genetic counselors address potential discrimination concerns by varying their practices to reassure patients about privacy during testing. Some patients decline testing due to fear of discrimination, while others accept it for health benefits despite the risk. Genetic counselors take measures to protect patient privacy during testing, including maintaining separate medical records and forwarding coded samples to laboratories. They note that fears of discrimination are less apparent in prenatal and pediatric testing due to the crisis atmosphere surrounding potential birth defects. Concerns about insurability may be alleviated for children covered under their parents' policies. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2007 aims to restrict insurers' and employers' use of genetic information, sparking debates in employment and insurance sectors. Proposed restrictions in S. 358 and H.R. 493 would extend current HIPAA protections against discrimination by health plans and insurance issuers. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2007 aims to restrict insurers' and employers' use of genetic information in both group and individual markets. Current HIPAA protections against discrimination in group plans and insurance issuers include not denying enrollment or charging more based on genetic information. The bills would prohibit group health plans and insurers from requesting or requiring genetic tests for individuals or their family members. Health care professionals can still suggest tests, but insurers cannot use genetic information to set premiums or deny coverage in the individual market. The bills would prohibit group health plans and insurers from requesting genetic tests for individuals or their family members. Insurers cannot use genetic information for underwriting, eligibility determination, premium rating, or enrollment processes. Premiums cannot be adjusted based on genetic information in group plans or individual market. The bills prohibit insurers from using genetic information for underwriting or adjusting premiums. The Secretary can impose penalties for noncompliance. Title II makes it illegal for employers to discriminate based on genetic information. The Employee Rights Act of 1991 prohibits employers from requiring genetic testing of individuals or their family members. It also prohibits the use of genetic information in hiring, promotion, or training decisions. The proposed bills aim to restrict the acquisition of genetic information by employers, employment agencies, and labor organizations, except in specific circumstances such as health service programs or monitoring biological effects of toxic substances in compliance with regulations. The proposed bills would allow employers to obtain genetic information in specific situations, treating it as confidential medical records and requiring separate storage. Disclosure would only be permitted to the individual or employee upon request. The proposed bills would allow employers to obtain genetic information in specific situations, treating it as confidential medical records. Disclosure would be limited to the individual or employee upon request, occupational health researchers, court orders with notice to challenge, and government officials investigating compliance with Title II. Limitations on disclosure would apply to employers, employment agencies, labor organizations, and labor-management committees. Disclosure under a court order would be limited to authorized genetic information, with an exception for compliance with the Family and Medical Leave Act. The bills would not limit employees' rights under other federal or state statutes. The bills propose establishing a commission to review the science of genetics and make recommendations on the necessity of \"disparate impact\" protections under the ADA or Rehabilitation Act. The debate on genetic nondiscrimination legislation has been ongoing since the 103rd Congress. Understanding how the HIPAA privacy rule governs insurers' and employers' use of health information is crucial. The privacy rule covers individually identifiable health information for health plans and providers, allowing for use and disclosure without patient authorization. However, it does not apply to entities like financial institutions offering life insurance. Employers sponsoring health plans present challenges due to their relationship with insurers or HMOs. Employers sponsoring health plans may seek health information for plan functions. The rule allows disclosure of health information to employers by group health plans, insurers, or HMOs, with limitations on use and disclosure. Employers must certify not to use the information for employment decisions and establish firewalls for privacy. S. 358 and H.R. 493 aim to extend privacy rule protections to insurance and employment functions, clarifying the permitted uses of health information exchanged between employers and group health plans. Title II of the bills would require employers to keep genetic information separate from other medical information of employees. Some question the necessity of these additional privacy provisions, while others argue they address the acquisition of information more specifically than HIPAA. Title I of the bills aims to extend privacy protections to health insurers, including those sponsored by employers, without affecting services within group health plans. Concerns have been raised about the separate file requirement potentially increasing costs for genetic services, but proponents argue it is not overly burdensome. Violations of Title I could result in a minimum penalty of $2,500 for willful neglect. The bills aim to extend privacy protections to health insurers, prohibiting employers from requesting genetic information. Violations could result in penalties of $2,500 for willful neglect and $15,000 for severe violations. Some argue penalties are necessary to deter discriminatory practices. The legislation aims to extend privacy protections to health insurers by prohibiting employers from accessing genetic information. Supporters believe the bills would clarify the role of genetic information in health information privacy and establish specific protections for genetic data. Opponents argue that restrictions may lead to confusion about which health information insurers can release to employers. The bills aim to establish specific protections for genetic information, allowing individuals to sue without first filing a complaint with the EEOC. Some argue that penalties are necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions, while others fear frivolous litigation due to the absence of a cap on compensatory and punitive damages. Employers would not be allowed to make employment decisions based on predictive genetic information, even if there is a risk to public health. Some argue that bills should allow employers to use predictive genetic information in certain situations, like when public safety is at risk. Others believe it's unfair to deny opportunities based on potential illness. Using predictive genetic information could create bias and discrimination against those predisposed to certain diseases. Some argue for the inclusion of a sunset clause in genetic nondiscrimination legislation to allow for evaluation and modification as needed, while supporters believe Congress can assess effectiveness without a set expiration date. Discrimination issues are not expected to disappear. The House Committee on Education and Labor adopted an amendment to H.R. 493 on February 14, 2007, specifying that genetic information protected by the act could be maintained with and treated as a confidential medical record under ADA \u00a7102(d)(3)(B). S. 358 requires employers to keep employees' genetic information in separate medical files, but contains no parallel provision. No federal or state law mandates a separate file requirement for group health plans providing medical services. Executive Order 13145 already mandates federal agencies to keep genetic information separate from personnel files. Some concerns exist about potential medical errors due to this requirement. S. 358 and H.R. 493 do not override state laws and allow states to have their own genetic nondiscrimination regulations. The bills do not offer a safe harbor provision. The bills S. 358 and H.R. 493 propose comprehensive genetic nondiscrimination legislation without a safe harbor provision to protect federally-compliant employers. Supporters argue for a federal floor while opponents suggest including a safe harbor. The key question is how the bills would protect genetic information, depending on the types of protections and the definition of genetic information itself. The bills S. 358 and H.R. 493 propose genetic nondiscrimination legislation to protect genetic information from being used in health insurance and employment decisions. Genetic information is defined as knowledge from genetic tests on individuals or their family members related to disease occurrence. Protections apply to predictive genetic tests for future health status. Definitions of genetic information hinge on factors like family medical history and predictive versus manifested conditions. The bills S. 358 and H.R. 493 define genetic information as knowledge from genetic tests on individuals or their family members related to disease occurrence. Family medical history is emphasized as important in genetic nondiscrimination legislation to protect against the use of genetic information in health insurance and employment decisions. The report discusses the concept of family medical history and the debate over who should be considered family. The risk of sharing genetic traits is highest in first and second-degree relatives, decreasing with more distant relationships. Proponents argue that genetic nondiscrimination legislation is important to protect against the misuse of genetic information in health insurance and employment decisions. Proponents of genetic nondiscrimination legislation argue for the inclusion of adoptive children to ensure insurability as a family unit. Opponents fear extended litigation risks with non-blood relatives. H.R. 493 defines family members as blood-related within four generations, while S. 358 lacks similar provisions. An amendment to include fetuses in the definition was rejected during a committee markup. The Chairman's amended version of the bill includes provisions specifying that genetic information of a fetus would be covered under Title I and Title II. Prenatal testing can be diagnostic or predictive, but insurance coverage usually starts at birth. Any genetic information collected about a fetus would likely be attributed to the woman as the insured individual, protecting it from discrimination. The bills' two titles define genetic information differently, with Title I excluding medical information not genetic, while Title II has a broader scope for employers. Health insurers can use current health status, not genetic test results, under the bills. Title I of the bills focuses on protecting predictive genetic information by exempting certain analyses related to manifested diseases. The definition of genetic test in the bills is more limited than the medical or scientific definition, potentially causing confusion if enacted. The definition of genetic test in Title II protects analyses of DNA or RNA regardless of manifested diseases, while Title I excludes analyses on proteins or metabolites directly related to manifested diseases. This could lead to confusion when a single test yields results related to both manifested diseases and predictive information. The definition of genetic tests in Title II protects DNA or RNA analyses, while Title I excludes analyses on proteins related to manifested diseases. This lack of clarity may create issues when a test provides results for both manifested diseases and predictive information. Pharmacogenomic tests reveal variability in how individuals process medications, leading to personalized medicine. It is uncertain if these tests are protected under current legislation. Concerns arise regarding the use of test results by health insurers, especially if only one treatment option is available."
