    "content": "The Act titled \"Contractors and Federal Spending Accountability Act of 2008\" establishes a database for contracting officers and suspension and debarment officials. The \"Contractors and Federal Spending Accountability Act of 2008\" establishes a database maintained by the Administrator of General Services for information on integrity and performance of persons awarded Federal contracts and grants. The database covers any person awarded a Federal contract or grant if information exists regarding civil or criminal proceedings or administrative proceedings for the most recent 5-year period. The \"Contractors and Federal Spending Accountability Act of 2008\" establishes a database for information on integrity and performance of persons awarded Federal contracts and grants. It includes details of administrative proceedings resulting in dispositions like convictions, findings of liability, or settlements over $5,000, and terminations of contracts or grants due to default. The database established by the \"Contractors and Federal Spending Accountability Act of 2008\" includes information on Federal suspension and debarment, administrative agreements, findings of non-responsibility, and requirements for direct input and update by Federal agencies. The \"Contractors and Federal Spending Accountability Act of 2008\" requires Federal agencies to input and update information in a database regarding actions taken with contractors or grant recipients. The Administrator must ensure timely and accurate data input, notify individuals affected by the information entered, and allow for comments to be added. The database is accessible to all Federal agencies and the public. The Administrator is required to make a database on contractor actions available to the public on the General Services Administration website, with exemptions for certain information. Prior to awarding a contract or grant, officials must review the database established under section 2. If a prospective awardee has multiple judgments or convictions within a 3-year period for the same offenses, the official must document why they are considered presently responsible. Additionally, disclosure in applications is required. Federal regulations will be amended to require disclosure of information in applications for Federal grants or contracts. This applies to contracts and grants above a certain threshold. An interagency committee will have a defined role in the process. The Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension is responsible for resolving lead agency issues, coordinating actions among agencies, promoting cooperative efforts, recommending changes to the suspension and debarment system, and authorizing the issuance of implementing guidelines by the Office of Management and Budget. The Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension is responsible for implementing recommendations, authorizing subcommittees, and submitting an annual report to Congress on progress and efforts to improve the suspension and debarment system. The term \"Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension\" refers to the committee constituted under Executive Order 12549. SEC. 6. Any federal agency not covered by Executive Order 12549 can participate in the suspension and debarment system. SEC. 7. Funds are authorized for the Administrator of General Services to establish the required database. SEC. 8. A report to Congress is mandated. The Administrator of General Services must submit a report to Congress within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The report should list all databases containing Federal contracting and grant information, along with recommendations for creating a centralized database."
