The National Employment Dispute Resolution Act of 2000 (NEDRA) acknowledges the high costs and emotional toll of litigation in employment civil rights cases. It promotes mediation as a more cost-effective and cooperative way to resolve disputes, allowing for creative solutions and potentially preserving employment relationships. The Act proposes a national program of mandated mediation for certain employment and contract disputes to improve the enforcement of workplace civil rights.

It seeks to provide a fair and effective alternative for resolving discrimination disputes between employees and employers.

AMENDMENTS TO THE AGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT ACT OF 1967. The Act is amended to provide counseling services for claims of unlawful discrimination and require employers to provide materials to employees. SEC. 5. AMENDMENT TO AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990. SEC. 5 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to include counseling services for claims of unlawful discrimination using certified contract mediators. Additionally, SEC. 6 introduces mediation services. The term \"employer\" refers to any Federal agency or business receiving over $200,000 in Federal funds or having 20 or more employees. A \"mediator\" is a neutral third-party trained in mediation and employment law, appointed by a court, EEOC, mediation center, or chosen by disputants. A \"trained mediation professional\" is someone with experience in employment mediation. A certified mediation professional is someone who has completed 40 hours of employment mediation training or has co-mediated at least three employment or contract dispute cases for a minimum of 15 hours each. Certified mediation centers include entities qualified to facilitate employment or contract mediation and provide training on dispute resolution. Employers must establish an internal dispute resolution program that allows access to certified mediators. They must participate in mediation if requested by the employee or claimant, even if a charge or lawsuit has been filed. The outcome of the mediation settlement is voluntary, but the employer must participate if the employee expresses a desire to mediate. The employee-disputant is entitled to legal representation and has 30 days to decide on participating in mediation. If mediation is agreed upon, the statute of limitations is tolled, and the dispute must be resolved within 90 days. If mediation fails, the employee has the right to pursue the matter under applicable laws. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and State or local authorities must provide technical assistance to unrepresented or self-represented parties involved in proceedings. This assistance includes pre-mediation counseling, understanding relevant case law, determining appropriate remedies, and drafting settlement agreements. Submission of a claim for mediation does not prevent either party from seeking other relief. The mediation process allows for voluntary and confidential settlements, preserving the privacy and confidentiality of all parties involved. Attorneys are required to inform their clients about mediation options and obligations under the Act. Judicial enforcement can be sought for mediation agreements. Judicial enforcement of mediation agreements can be pursued in Federal district court, with confidentiality provisions protecting discussions and materials from being used in future legal proceedings. Internal conflict management programs or agreements are also safeguarded from third-party attacks."
