The \"Integrity of the United States Courts Act of 2001\" allows for judicial review of binational panel decisions under the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act within 30 days after publication in the Federal Register. If a party alleges misinterpretation of US law, misconduct, bias, departure from procedure, or exceeding of powers by the panel, they can seek review in the Court of International Trade. If a binational panel exceeds its jurisdiction or fails to apply the correct standard of review, a party can appeal to the United States Court of International Trade.

The Court of International Trade will vacate the original panel decision and enter judgment accordingly if actions are established. Decisions of the Court under this section are binding on the parties.
