    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Act for Lyme Education and Research and Tick-Borne Diseases\" or the \"ALERT Act\". The United States has 82 species of ticks causing 10 major diseases, including Lyme disease. Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the US, with an estimated 200,000 to 240,000 new cases each year. Tests can detect serum antibodies for Lyme disease. Lyme disease tests can have high false-positive and false-negative results, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. If not treated early, Lyme disease can result in chronic illness affecting various body systems, including the central nervous system. Diagnosis is complex as Lyme disease can mimic other diseases like meningitis, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's. Patients with persistent Lyme disease experience physical disability similar to congestive heart failure, severe pain comparable to post-operative pain, and profound fatigue akin to multiple sclerosis, as per a study by the National Institutes of Health. The goals outlined in Section 3 are important for addressing the challenges faced by patients with persistent Lyme disease. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a Five-Year Plan to address Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases, coordinating federal programs. The first goal is to develop a definitive diagnostic test. The Five-Year Plan aims to develop a sensitive test for Lyme disease, improve diagnostic testing efficiency, and adopt new test methods. The second goal is to accurately determine the prevalence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases in the United States. The Five-Year Plan aims to develop a sensitive test for Lyme disease, improve diagnostic testing efficiency, and adopt new test methods. The second goal is to accurately determine the prevalence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases in the United States. Additionally, the plan includes evaluating the feasibility of developing a reporting system for collecting data on physician-diagnosed cases that do not meet the surveillance criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as creating a national uniform reporting system to include mandatory reporting by laboratories in each State for more accurate disease outbreak monitoring. The Five-Year Plan aims to provide access to peer-reviewed information on Lyme and other tick-borne diseases, expand public education programs, create a physician education program, and sponsor scientific research. The Five-Year Plan includes sponsoring scientific conferences on Lyme and other tick-borne diseases to discuss clinically-based knowledge. It also aims to establish research goals for long-term illness and treatment outcomes for Lyme disease. SEC. 4. STUDY BY INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE. The Secretary will request the Institute of Medicine to conduct a study on chronic Lyme disease, including an assessment of treatment guidelines and research gaps. A report on the study results must be provided within one year of the agreement. The results of the study on chronic Lyme disease must be submitted to the Secretary and the Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee. Increased funding of $20,000,000 annually from 2006 to 2010 is authorized for research, education, and prevention of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. Additionally, a study will be conducted with a reserved amount of $500,000. A Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee will also be established. The Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee (referred to as the Committee) will be established within the Office of the Secretary to advise on interagency coordination, communication, and scientific viewpoints in public health policy decisions related to tick-borne diseases. The Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee will advise on public health policy decisions related to tick-borne diseases, ensuring balanced information dissemination and advising Federal agencies on priorities. Membership includes individuals from the scientific community representing various viewpoints. The Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee includes representatives from various sectors such as voluntary organizations, health care providers, patient representatives, and State and local health departments. Members are appointed based on certain requirements. The Secretary appoints members to the Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee to ensure a diverse representation of scientific perspectives. Ex officio members include representatives from federal agencies like the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, and Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health. The Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee members are appointed by the Secretary, including representatives from various federal agencies. The Committee selects a chair from its members for a two-year term, while members serve for four years, with vacancies filled in the same manner as the original appointment. Members can serve beyond their terms until replaced. The Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee members are appointed by the Secretary and serve for four years, with vacancies filled in the same manner as the original appointment. The Committee holds public meetings at least twice a year, with additional meetings as needed. $250,000 is authorized for each of the fiscal years 2006 and 2007 for the Committee's expenses. The Committee's expenses are incurred in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, with voting members not being permanent salaried employees. The Secretary is required to submit reports to Congress on activities related to the development of diagnostic tools and treatment modalities for Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases, public awareness initiatives, and other significant activities. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is defined as the \"Secretary\" for the purposes of this Act."
