    "content": "The energy tax provisions in H.R. 6899 are similar to those in H.R. 5351 and H.R. 6049, with a total cost of about $19 billion over 10 years. It includes tax incentives for renewable energy, such as extending a renewable energy production tax credit at a cost of $6.9 billion over 10 years. The bill extends tax credits for renewable energy production, including wind facilities and other renewables, through 2011. It also extends credits for solar energy, fuel cells, energy-efficient buildings, homes, and appliances. Additionally, it allocates funds for energy conservation bonds, clean renewable energy bonds, and energy security bonds to finance natural gas pump installations at gas stations. The tax title of H.R. 6899 includes tax-credit bonds for projects that must comply with Davis-Bacon requirements, a new tax credit for plug-in electric vehicles, an accelerated recovery period for smart electric meters and grid systems, and $1.1 billion in tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration projects. It also restructures the New York Liberty Zone tax incentives for new transportation projects. The bill raises $19 billion in taxes, including energy tax increases on oil companies, mainly by denying the manufacturing deduction to certain major integrated oil companies. The tax provisions in H.R. 6899 include ending the deduction for major integrated oil companies, freezing the deduction for other oil and gas producers at 6%, and streamlining the tax treatment of foreign oil-related income. This would raise $13.9 billion over 10 years, with an additional $4.0 billion from foreign oil income. The Republican leadership introduced H.R. 6566, which expands energy tax incentives without tax increases. The Senate is focusing on passing the Energy Independence and Investment Act of 2008, a $40 billion energy tax bill introduced by Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus and ranking Republican Charles Grassley. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid considers this bill a priority, especially for renewable energy incentives, and hopes to bring it to the floor soon. Senate Republicans' agreement will determine the schedule for the legislation. The Energy Independence and Investment Act of 2008, a $40 billion energy tax bill, includes tax incentives for renewable energy. To pay for the legislation, proposed offsets include repealing the manufacturing deduction for major oil and gas producers, implementing a 13% excise tax on oil and natural gas from the Outer Continental Shelf, and increasing the oil spill tax. These measures would generate $31 billion from the oil and gas industry. Additionally, securities brokers would be required to report on transaction cost basis. The tax offsets in S. 3478 include repealing the IRC \u00a7199 manufacturing deduction for major oil and gas producers, expected to raise $8 billion over 10 years. Republicans have objected to raising taxes on the oil and gas industry, considering it an extension of current tax policy. Senate Republicans have also opposed the idea of raising taxes to offset extension of expiring energy tax provisions. The Bush Administration threatened to veto any energy tax bill that would increase taxes on the oil and gas industry, particularly by repealing the IRC \u00a7199 deduction. The inclusion of the \u00a7199 deduction repeal as an offset might prevent the energy tax bill from reaching the Senate floor. The Senate debate on energy tax incentives and extenders involves three separate proposals, including the Gang of 20 proposal, a Bingaman/Baucus bill, and the Republican Gas Price Reduction Act. Table 1 compares H.R. 6899 and S. 3478, with revenue estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation."
