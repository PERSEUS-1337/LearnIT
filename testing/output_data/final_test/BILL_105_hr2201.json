    "content": "The Act titled \"Lower East Side Tenement National Historic Site Act of 1997\" is established for the purpose of preserving historical sites. Congress finds that immigration and cultural diversity are key factors in defining American identity, with the majority of citizens tracing their ancestry to immigrants. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a significant influx of immigrants to the United States, particularly to the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. The Lower East Side Tenement at 97 Orchard Street in New York City is a notable survivor of the humble buildings that housed immigrants during this period. The Lower East Side Tenement at 97 Orchard Street in New York City is a museum dedicated to interpreting immigrant life during the greatest wave of immigration in American history. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1994 and found suitable for inclusion in the National Park System. The purposes of the Act are to preserve and interpret the themes of immigration, tenement life, housing reform, and architecture in the United States. It also aims to continue interpreting the immigrant phenomenon in New York City's Lower East Side and enhance the interpretation of national monuments like Castle Clinton, Ellis Island, and the Statue of Liberty.
