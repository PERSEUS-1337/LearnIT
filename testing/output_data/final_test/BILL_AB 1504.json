    "title": "AB 1504",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 4001 of the Elections Code is amended to allow pilot programs for all-mailed ballot elections in select counties if certain conditions are met. This includes obtaining authorization from the governing body and ensuring the election does not coincide with other major elections or fill vacancies in state offices. At least one ballot drop-off location per city or fixed based on population size, open during business hours 28 days before the election. For San Mateo and Yolo County, one polling place per city. For Monterey and Sacramento County, one polling place for every 50,000 registered voters, with a minimum of one per city. The elections official may provide additional ballot drop-off locations and polling places upon request. Voters can request a ballot between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on election day if needed. All necessary supplies for mail ballots are delivered to voters, along with a list of drop-off locations and polling places. The polling places and ballot drop-off locations must be accessible to individuals with disabilities and meet specific requirements. Elections in the county can only be held on a maximum of three different dates. The county conducting an all-mailed ballot election must report to the Legislature and Secretary of State on the election's success, including cost, turnout statistics, reasons for rejected ballots, voter fraud, and other issues. The report should compare the all-mailed ballot election to similar elections not conducted by mail. The county must submit a report to the Legislature within six months after an all-mailed ballot election. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2018, unless extended or deleted by a later statute enacted before that date."
