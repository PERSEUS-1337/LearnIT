    "content": "The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 aimed to promote competition among financial services providers and modernize their regulation. Despite expectations of cross-sectoral mergers, consolidation mainly occurred within sectors. The Act maintained the Federal Reserve Board's oversight of holding companies and preserved state regulation of insurance. National banks were allowed to underwrite and sell insurance, with activities required to comply with state regulations. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 implemented the concept of \"functional regulation,\" ensuring that banking, securities, and insurance activities are regulated by their respective regulators. This approach has been both praised and criticized for promoting communication among sectoral regulators. The GLB Act implemented functional regulation to regulate banking, securities, and insurance activities. It has been praised for promoting communication among sectoral regulators but criticized for not modernizing financial services regulation. The report examines how functional regulation is evolving in practice, with state insurance regulators and federal banking regulators coordinating efforts and sharing information. The NAIC has consulted with federal banking supervisors to enhance examination procedures and exchange information. The Federal Reserve Board has established successful partnerships with state insurance regulators to facilitate sharing of supervisory information and consumer complaints. The Board has also set up resource centers to monitor developments in the insurance industry and has undertaken cross-training with state insurance supervisors. The GLB Act established a preemption standard for insurance-related activities of national banks, leading to disagreements between state insurance regulators and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Comptroller's ruling in Cline v. Hawke, preempting certain provisions of West Virginia's insurance law. The Comptroller's ruling in Cline v. Hawke preempted certain provisions of West Virginia's insurance law, leading to disagreements between state insurance regulators and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regarding the definition of \"insurance.\" The Supreme Court decision allowed the Comptroller to expand the scope of preemption under the GLB Act. The dispute revolves around whether debt cancellation contracts issued by national banks should be classified as insurance. State insurance regulators argue they are insurance and fall under their jurisdiction, while the Comptroller maintains they are banking products and not subject to insurance regulation. The GLB Act aimed to address this conflict by stating that insurance activities should be regulated by the states. The disagreement over whether debt cancellation contracts issued by national banks should be classified as insurance or banking products has led to regulatory conflicts. Some states exclude their insurance supervisors from regulating these contracts, while others consider them insurance but choose not to regulate them. This debate impacts the regulatory burdens on different product designations, with credit insurance being more heavily regulated than debt cancellation contracts offered by national banks. The debate over classifying debt cancellation contracts as insurance or banking products has led to regulatory conflicts. Redefining the coverage as a \"banking product\" eases banks' regulatory burdens by eliminating state insurance requirements. Regulatory arbitrage exists under the GLB Act's paradigm of \"functional regulation.\" Efforts are being made to streamline state insurance regulation by imposing federal standards without federal regulation. Representative Baker aims to find a middle ground for insurance regulatory reform while retaining the benefits of state-based regulation for consumers. Senator Hollings has introduced the Insurance Consumer Protection Act to mandate federal regulation of insurance, aiming to improve the operation of the risk transfer marketplace and the regulation of insurers as financial intermediaries.
