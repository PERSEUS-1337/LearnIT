    "content": "The State Long-Term Care Partnership Act of 2005 allows for additional state long-term care partnerships. The Social Security Act is amended to allow for adjustments in medical assistance eligibility and define a Qualified State Long-Term Care Insurance Partnership. A Qualified State Long-Term Care Insurance Partnership is a State plan amendment that allows for the disregard of assets equal to long-term care insurance benefits payments under specific conditions. The policy must cover a resident of the State or a Qualified Long-Term Care Insurance Partnership State, be a qualified long-term care insurance contract, provide inflation protection, and meet any additional requirements. The policy for a Qualified State Long-Term Care Insurance Partnership must meet State or other applicable law requirements, provide necessary information to the Secretary and State, and comply with minimum reporting requirements. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with relevant parties, will develop minimum reporting requirements for issuers of long-term care insurance policies within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop reporting requirements for issuers of long-term care insurance policies, including those under Qualified State Long-Term Care Insurance Partnerships. States can also require data from issuers of long-term care insurance policies sold within the state. The Secretary will establish reporting requirements for long-term care insurance policies issued under Qualified State Long-Term Care Insurance Partnerships, including additional data to be reported to the State. Reciprocity standards will ensure portability of these policies across states. Consumer education procedures will be implemented, and annual reports to Congress will be submitted. The Secretary will annually report to Congress on the Qualified State Long-Term Care Insurance Partnerships established under the Social Security Act. The amendments made by subsections (a) and (b) will take effect on October 1, 2005."
