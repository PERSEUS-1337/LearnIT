Some policymakers have raised concerns about the security vetting procedures for Syrian refugees, leading to calls to halt admissions. Governors have also expressed reluctance to accept Syrian refugees in their states. This report outlines the U.S. refugee admissions process and the resettlement of refugees in the country, authorized by the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Refugee Act of 1980. The Refugee Act of 1980 aimed to establish a uniform procedure for refugee admissions and provide federal assistance for their resettlement. It defined a refugee as someone outside their country unable to return due to persecution. The Refugee Act of 1980 defines a refugee as someone outside their country unable to return due to persecution. INA Section 207 sets the maximum annual number of refugee admissions and the allocation of these numbers by region, determined by the President after consultation with Congress. Congressional consultation is required but not approval, with the President issuing a Presidential Determination to set the refugee ceiling. The President issues a Presidential Determination setting the refugee ceiling and regional allocations for the fiscal year. Additional refugee admissions can be allowed in response to an emergency refugee situation. The Obama Administration proposed a refugee ceiling of 75,000 for FY2016, with consultations held with Congress. At least 10,000 Syrian refugees were to be admitted in FY2016. In 2015, the Obama Administration set the FY2016 refugee ceiling at 85,000, with 79,000 admissions allocated among regions and 6,000 as reserve. The Near East/South Asia region had 34,000 allocations. In FY2015, 69,933 refugees were admitted, with 24,579 from Near East/South Asia, including 1,682 Syrians. By August 31, 2016, 72,354 refugees were admitted in FY2016, with 30,356 from Near East/South Asia and 10,740 Syrians. From October 1, 2010, to August 31, 2016, 12,623 Syrian refugees were admitted. To meet the INA definition of a refugee, individuals must meet requirements in INA Section 207(c)(1) to be eligible for admission to the United States. These requirements include not being firmly resettled in another country, being of special humanitarian concern to the U.S., and being admissible under the INA. The refugee processing system is responsible for implementing these statutory requirements. Successful applicants are admitted to the U.S. as refugees and can apply for lawful permanent resident status after one year. The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program is managed by the Department of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM), and prospective refugees can be referred by the UNHCR, a U.S. embassy, or a designated entity. The U.S. refugee program is managed by the Department of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM). Prospective refugees can be referred by the UNHCR, a U.S. embassy, or a designated NGO. PRM arranges for a Resettlement Support Center (RSC) to assist in refugee processing, with staff conducting pre-screening interviews to determine access to the program based on processing priorities. Priority 1 (P-1) covers refugees referred by UNHCR, a U.S. embassy, or a designated NGO for whom resettlement is deemed appropriate. Priority 2 (P-2) is another category for consideration. Priority 2 (P-2) and Priority 3 (P-3) in the U.S. refugee program cover special humanitarian groups and family reunification cases, respectively. P-2 cases can access the program directly, while P-3 cases require an affidavit of relationship from a relative in the U.S. All eligible refugee cases go through the same processing steps with assistance from Resettlement Support Centers (RSCs) before interviews with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The Department of Homeland Security's USCIS conducts biographic name checks for refugee applicants as part of the security screening process. USCIS officers interview applicants in person, collect fingerprints for biometric checks, and assess eligibility based on various criteria including refugee status, resettlement, and admissibility to the United States. The USCIS conducts rigorous security screening for refugee applicants, including biographic and biometric checks against various databases. Security checks are a crucial part of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for applicants of all nationalities. The USCIS conducts rigorous biographic and biometric screening for refugee applicants, including checks against various databases such as the State Department's Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS). These security measures have been enhanced since the launch of large-scale Iraqi refugee resettlement in 2007. The USCIS conducts thorough biographic and biometric screening for refugee applicants, including checks against databases like TSDB, HHS, DEA, Interpol, and FBI. Refugee applicants undergo Security Advisory Opinions (SAOs) and Interagency Checks (IACs) for law enforcement and intelligence community checks. SAOs are for applicants aged 16-50, while IACs are for those aged 14 and older. Biometric checks are also conducted for applicants aged 14-79 against FBI NGI, DHS IDENT, and other holdings. USCIS conducts thorough security checks on refugee applicants, including biometric screening and database checks. They review Syrian refugee cases for national security concerns and provide case-specific context for interviewing officers. USCIS also provides Syria-specific training for officers adjudicating Syrian cases. USCIS engages with law enforcement and intelligence communities to enhance vetting for Syrian refugee applicants. The \"Syria Enhanced Review\" involves collaboration between USCIS and FDNS to provide intelligence-driven support for refugee adjudicators, including threat identification and monitoring of terrorist watch lists. The United States faces challenges in performing security checks on Syrian refugee applicants due to limited data and lack of diplomatic relations with Syria. RSC staff assist refugees through post-adjudication steps, including medical exams and cultural orientation programs, before referring them to the International Organization for Migration for transportation to the U.S. In FY2016, refugees accepted for U.S. resettlement are placed in communities throughout the United States, regardless of initial placement. Some governors have expressed reluctance to accept Syrian refugees post-Paris attacks, raising legal questions. Refugees can relocate freely once admitted to the U.S. and are eligible for resettlement assistance. The DOS's Reception and Placement Program is responsible for resettling refugees in the United States. Resettlement agencies match refugees with local communities based on their needs and available resources. If refugees have relatives in the U.S., they are likely to be resettled near them. Otherwise, the sponsoring agency decides on the best match between community resources and the refugee's needs. The Office of Refugee Resettlement and resettlement agencies work together to match refugees with local communities based on their needs and available resources. State and local governments, along with nonprofit agencies, are consulted regularly in the sponsorship process. Resettlement agencies provide services to refugees in their first 30 to 90 days in the United States, including reception, basic needs support, and referrals to health, employment, and education services. The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) administers a transitional assistance program for refugees, Cuban/Haitian entrants, and specified groups, providing cash and medical assistance, social services for self-sufficiency, and targeted aid for impacted areas through state-administered programs. States must meet conditions to receive assistance under INA Section 412. States receiving resettlement assistance must submit a plan to ORR, meet standards for effective refugee resettlement, and report on fund usage. They are not obligated to run a resettlement program but must provide 120 days notice if withdrawing. Operating all program components is expected for participation. As of August 31, 2016, 10,740 Syrian refugees arrived in the United States in FY2016 and were placed in 40 states. When a State withdraws from the refugee program, a replacement designee may be authorized to provide assistance to refugees in that State."
