    "content": "The United States, Iraq's neighbors, and Iraqi political groups have different views and interests regarding Iraq's future. Iraq's neighbors are interested in influencing changes in areas such as the regional strategic balance, sectarian violence, terrorist groups, refugees, and economic opportunities. The priorities and actions of the United States and regional parties in these areas will shape Iraq's future and its relations with its neighbors. The removal of the Saddam Hussein regime disrupted the political and economic balance in the Persian Gulf region. The fall of Saddam Hussein's regime disrupted the political and economic balance in the Persian Gulf region. The removal of Iraq's armed forces eliminated a potential military threat to Arab Gulf states but also removed a strategic counterweight to Iran. The Shiite-dominated government in Iraq has friendly ties to Iranian interests, and the end of U.N. sanctions created new trade opportunities. However, ongoing violence limits economic growth, and the region faces concerns over ethnic and sectarian tensions, as well as the rise of armed non-state actors challenging established rule.

The Shiite-dominated government in Iraq has friendly ties to Iranian interests, and the end of U.N. sanctions created new trade opportunities. Ongoing violence limits economic growth, and the region faces concerns over ethnic and sectarian tensions, as well as the rise of armed non-state actors challenging established rule. The U.S. military presence in the region now focuses on stabilization, training efforts in Iraq, regional counterterrorism activities, and potential confrontation with Iran. Developments in Iraq and Iran will impact future U.S. basing, access, and pre-positioning needs, affecting bilateral relations with regional governments. Anxiety among Iraq's neighbors due to religious and ethnic diversity, with concerns about the empowerment of Iraq's Shiite Arabs and close ties with Iran. Sunni Arab governments fear a \"Shiite crescent\" and past sectarian violence. Turkish worries about Kurdish separatism and Turkoman minority group in Iraq. The fate of Iraq's ethnically Turkish Turkoman minority group drives Turkish policy towards Iraq. The strengthening of Iraqi Shiite political parties and the Shiite hawza in An Najaf have regional implications, causing concern in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain about the political activity of indigenous Shiite Arabs. Sectarian tension persists in Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia's minority Shiite population faces scrutiny despite recent reconciliation efforts by King Abdullah. Iran may also be concerned about clerics in An Najaf challenging its influence. Shiite interference in An Najaf raises concerns about clerical authority in Qom. Iraq's security progress and potential as a terrorist haven worry neighboring countries. Al Qaeda in Iraq, under Zarqawi, created a regional terrorist network. Ethnic nationalist groups like PMOI/MEK/MKO also pose threats. The PMOI/MEK/MKO, PJAK, and PKK are transnational threats to Turkey and Iran, potentially causing regional instability. Concerns also arise from foreign fighters in Iraq who may return to their home countries after fighting coalition forces. Recent research has found that \"Afghan Arab\" veterans of the anti-Soviet war in Afghanistan played a key role in forming Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Efforts are needed to prevent the reverse flow of foreign volunteers from Iraq to other regions, as the conflict has led to a humanitarian crisis for millions of Iraqis. Iraq's neighbors are dealing with the challenges of accommodating displaced Iraqis, both those who have crossed borders and those internally displaced. Strong religious and ethnic ties have led to calls for increased involvement, while the influx of Iraqi refugees has caused economic and political disruptions in some countries. The United Nations is urging regional countries and the international community to coordinate a more effective relief response. The potential for renewed civil conflict in Iraq could further escalate the humanitarian needs. Source: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Iraq Fact Sheet, September 2008 and July 31, 2009. Iraq's energy resources, consumer market, and strategic location make it an appealing economic partner for neighboring countries. Iraq's strategic location as a geographic crossroads makes it an attractive economic partner for its neighbors and the international community. However, the effects of international sanctions, postwar violence, and underdeveloped commercial laws have limited trade and investment potential. Despite increased bilateral and intra-regional trade, violence has hindered business activities in Iraq. The rehabilitation of Iraq's oil production infrastructure is expected to boost oil availability in the region. The diverse political landscape in Iraq and regional/international policy issues complicate predicting future events. Changes in US policy and regional dynamics since 2003 have influenced Iraq's neighbors' perspectives and policies. Different reactions can be expected based on various scenarios and US policy choices. Challenges facing the US and Iraq's neighbors during the 111th Congress are illustrated using a scenario-based framework. The Sunni-led insurgency, foreign terrorist operatives, and organized criminal activities in Iraq led to sectarian violence and the beginnings of a civil war. US efforts in 2007 aimed to reduce violence and stabilize the Iraqi government. Statistics since November 2007 show a significant drop in sectarian violence attributed to the US troop surge. The drop in sectarian violence in Iraq is credited to the US troop surge and ceasefire of the Shiite Jaysh al Mahdi militia. Iran and Turkey are involved in Iraq's affairs to protect their interests. However, Iran's support for Shiites may fuel Sunni resistance, and Kurds are cautious of Turkish actions. US Congress may need to consider responses to neighboring countries' influence in Iraq. The U.S. may need to consider responses to Iraq's neighbors' efforts to influence developments in Iraq. Sunni Arab governments have limited engagement with Iraq, fear chaos, and are divided on the impact of the U.S. military presence. Arab citizens oppose the U.S. military presence and view the Iraqi government as illegitimate. The current Iraqi government is seen as illegitimate by some due to its origins in the U.S. military occupation. Reconciling these differing views may complicate efforts to secure cooperation from Iraq's Arab neighbors in consolidating security gains and supporting Iraq's transition to stability. The Bush Administration credited the troop surge strategy for reducing violence, while the Obama Administration backed the U.S.-Iraqi Security Agreement to maintain security gains. U.S. troops were required to withdraw from Iraqi cities by June 2009 under the agreement. The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraqi cities was completed by June 2009, with further withdrawals not expected until after the January 2010 Iraqi elections. The Administration plans to shift to a support and training role, with troop numbers decreasing to 35,000-50,000 by August 31, 2010. A full withdrawal of U.S. forces is planned by December 31, 2011, based on sequential reductions and training of Iraq's security forces.

Security improvements in Iraq have not fully led to political reconciliation among key communities, with concerns from neighboring countries about the presence of U.S. forces. In the longer term, the United States and Iraq's neighbors are working to shape the future of Iraq. Neighboring countries may support a strong central government in Iraq to prevent violence and terrorist threats. Some analysts argue for a united, democratic Iraq with representation from various groups. The future of Iraq's government involves representation of parties, Shiites, and ethnic minority groups, creating political pressure on neighboring countries. Key unresolved issues include Iraq's role in OPEC, military projection, presence of foreign military bases, and relations with regional and global powers. Iran's interests in Iraq reflect its regional ambitions and desire to influence its dispute with the United States, amidst broader regional and international issues. Iran seeks to ensure that Iraq cannot pose a threat to Iran, viewing Iraq's Shiite population as a strategic asset. Iran's goals in Iraq align with establishing a democratic process and maintaining control through Shiite parties to protect its interests. Iran's support for Iraqi Shiite parties has sometimes impeded U.S. efforts in the region. Iran's support for Iraqi Shiite parties has hindered U.S. efforts in Iraq. Iran faces challenges as Shiite factions in Iraq are now competing and fighting each other. Iran's strategy to unite Shiite factions in Iraq led to the victory of the Shiite Islamist bloc in the 2005 National Assembly elections. Iran's support for Iraqi Shiite parties, including ISCI and the Dawa party, has hindered U.S. efforts in Iraq. The Sadr faction withdrew from the UIA in 2007 due to U.S. pressure to pursue Mahdi Army militiamen. Nouri al Maliki, the current Prime Minister, is from the Dawa Party, while ISCI leaders have strong ties to Iran. The Sadr faction also has ideological ties to Iran. The Sadr clan has ties to Iran, with historical connections to Ayatollah Khomeini. The 2009 elections in Iraq showed a setback for Iran as Maliki's faction outperformed ISCI in Shiite provinces. Maliki's slate won in Baghdad and Basra, limiting ISCI's ability to form coalitions. The 2009 U.S. Defense Department report acknowledged Iran's setback in the Iraqi elections, favoring parties supporting a strong central government. Despite reducing support for militants, Iran continues to pose a challenge to Iraq's stability and independence by improving training and weapons for proxy militants. Iran also supports Sadr's religious studies in Qom, posing a long-term threat to Iraq's political independence. Iran's influence in Iraq may not be diluted despite Maliki's strong showing in provincial elections. Iraqi officials acknowledged responsibility for starting the Iran-Iraq war and signed agreements with Iran on military cooperation. This has occurred in an environment where Iraqi nationalism has reduced Iraq's willingness to compromise with Iran on certain disputes. Iraqi officials have acknowledged responsibility for starting the Iran-Iraq war and signed agreements on military cooperation with Iran. Tensions persist over issues such as Iran's alleged support for Kurdish separatist groups and the unresolved cases of missing individuals from the Iran-Iraq war. The U.S. Treasury Department designated PJAK as a terrorism-supporting entity. Territorial disputes between Iran and Iraq were mostly resolved in 2000, with ongoing discussions on border demarcations. Foreign Minister Zebari urged Iran to finalize border demarcations in 2009. Iran is trying to use the U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement to eliminate its opposition in Iraq, specifically the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) at Camp Ashraf near the Iraq-Iran border. Iranian leaders are pressuring Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki to expel the group, including possibly extraditing its members to Iran. Iraqi leaders, influenced by Iran, have stated that the PMOI activists are no longer welcome in Iraq. The State Department stated in December 2008 that Iraqi leaders had pledged to respect the human rights of Camp Ashraf residents and not force them to leave Iraq. In July 2009, the Iraqi Security Forces tried to assert control over Ashraf, leading to clashes with the unarmed PMOI residents. The U.S. position, as stated by Secretary of State Clinton, is that the issue of Camp Ashraf is now an Iraqi matter, allowing Iran to exert influence over Iraq through its ties with Iraqi leaders. Iran has significant political and economic influence in Iraq, with reports suggesting efforts to derail the U.S.-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement. Iran's opposition to the pact may stem from fears of U.S. military encirclement. General Ray Odierno mentioned possible Iranian attempts to bribe Iraqi parliamentarians against the agreement. Iran's Supreme Leader warned Iraq's leader about U.S. trustworthiness under the pact. Iran has welcomed post-Saddam Iraqi leaders' positions on unresolved diplomatic disputes, with Prime Minister Maliki visiting Iran four times to consult and sign agreements. Visits resulted in agreements on various issues such as cross-border migration, intelligence sharing, pipeline construction, mine clearance, and electricity purchase. During Ahmadinejad's visit to Iraq in 2008, Iran announced $1 billion in credits for exports to Iraq and signed seven cooperation agreements in various sectors. In 2005, Iran agreed to provide 2 million liters of kerosene per day to Iraq. In 2009, Iraq awarded a $1 billion contract to an Iranian firm for reconstruction projects in Basra and historical sites in southern Iraq, indicating growing trade relations between the two countries. Trade relations between Iran and Iraq have significantly increased, with bilateral trade reaching $4 billion in 2009. Plans were made to boost trade to $5 billion annually, focusing on oil and electricity trade. The two countries established a free trade zone around Basra, with Iraq buying electricity from Iran. The United States engaged in bilateral meetings with Iran in Baghdad in 2007, led by respective ambassadors, to discuss the Iraq issue. Talks scheduled for December 2007 were postponed by Iran. Iran postponed talks in Baghdad in December 2007 and later decided to not continue dialogue with the U.S. due to civilian casualties in Sadr City. The Iranian government may have felt they did not need to make concessions as the U.S. finalized its withdrawal plans from Iraq, signaling a diminishing of U.S. influence. Even if Iraq stabilized under current leadership, Iran may face challenges if a strong Arab nationalist leader emerged. Iran's clerical leadership fears a successful non-cleric-led democracy in Iraq as it could lead to pressure for political liberalization in Iran. A stable Iraq may help An Najaf reassert itself over Qom, benefiting Iran if ISCI remains empowered. Iran's substantial influence in Iraq is evident, particularly in attempts to control Camp Ashraf. Some aspects of Iranian influence in Iraq are waning, particularly in sustaining Shiite militias. Experts predict Iran's influence will fade as Iraq asserts its nationhood and Arab-Persian differences reemerge. Turkey's relationship with Iraq was defined by fears of Kurdish separatism and ambiguity towards Saddam Hussein's regime. Turkey allowed US and British planes to enforce a no-fly zone over northern Iraq after the Gulf War to protect Kurds and monitor Iraq's armed forces. Iraq's Kurds were protected by a no-fly zone enforced by US and British planes after the Gulf War, allowing for the development of an autonomous Kurdish administration. Turkish leaders were initially uneasy about this model for Turkish Kurds. Turkey later opposed US regime change plans for Iraq and refused to authorize the deployment of US forces for a northern front against Iraq. Turkey seeks a stable, democratic, and unified Iraq to maintain regional stability, with concerns about Iran's influence over a Shiite-dominated Iraq and the potential chaos after a US military withdrawal. Turkey is concerned about the potential chaos in Iraq and the region following a U.S. military withdrawal. They are engaging in dialogue with Iraqi parties to promote reconciliation and participation in the Baghdad government. Turkey emphasizes the importance of the federal structure of Iraq and the constructive role of Kurds. They also prioritize the well-being of Iraqi Turkomen and aim to strengthen economic ties with Iraq. Turkish Foreign Minister highlighted Iraq as a strategic partner, emphasizing that developments in Iraq impact Turkey. Turkey is committed to regional stability and has worked to reduce tensions between Iraq and Syria. Turkey prioritizes Iraq's territorial integrity to prevent the emergence of an independent Kurdish state that could inspire separatist movements. They have deployed military forces in northern Iraq to combat PKK terrorists and have engaged in diplomacy with Iraqi and Kurdish officials. Turkey has engaged in diplomacy with Iraqi and Iraqi Kurdish officials to address the threat of PKK terrorists using Iraqi territory against Turkey. Ankara challenged Washington's authority in Iraq and mobilized military forces on the border in 2006 to signal impatience with the PKK presence. The Bush Administration appointed General Joseph Ralston as Special Envoy to coordinate with Turkey and Iraq to eliminate the PKK threat. The Turkish government initially viewed Ralston's appointment positively as an indication of high-level U.S. interest in addressing the threat of the PKK operating across the border. However, Ralston never achieved concrete results and resigned in October 2007, leading to a Turkish military buildup in spring 2007. Later that year, Ankara opened a diplomatic track with Iraqi and Iraqi Kurdish officials. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al Maliki visited Ankara to sign a memorandum of understanding on countering terrorism, including the PKK. However, the MOU needed parliamentary approval and cooperation from the Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq. Turkey hesitated to engage with the KRG due to President Barzani's support for the PKK. After PKK attacks in Turkey, Turkish forces massed on the border, leading President Bush to promise real-time intelligence to Turkey during a meeting with Prime Minister Erdogan. After receiving real-time intelligence from the United States, Turkish forces conducted targeted air strikes against the PKK and launched a week-long incursion into the Iraqi border area of Zap in February 2008. The operation significantly degraded PKK communications, supply depots, and training facilities, with Turkish officials expressing satisfaction with U.S. intelligence assistance. The Kurdistan Regional Government was not involved in these discussions. Turkish officials were pleased with U.S. intelligence assistance during a military operation against the PKK in February 2008. However, tensions arose when President Bush and Secretary of Defense Gates called for Turkish troops to withdraw quickly. Subsequently, efforts were made to ease tensions, including a visit by Turkish President Gul to Iraq in 2008 and President Gul becoming the first Turkish president to visit Iraq in 33 years in 2009. President Talabani of Iraq urged the PKK to resolve issues through non-military means. In Baghdad, President Talabani gave the PKK two choices: lay down arms or leave Iraq. KRG Prime Minister Barzani vowed not to allow Kurdistan to be a base for attacks. Despite Turkey's diplomatic efforts, terror attacks continued, with casualties in October 2008. The Turkish parliament extended authority for cross-border operations into northern Iraq for another year. Turkey engaged with Massoud Barzani and authorized a delegation to meet the KRG. In October 2008, authorized Special Envoy to Iraq Murat Ozcelik and a delegation to meet KRG leader in Baghdad. KRG Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani reported progress in diplomatic relations with Turkey. A trilateral mechanism with Turkey, Iraq, and the US was established to counter terrorism, with KRG involvement. Massoud Barzani stated PKK cannot sustain armed struggle and urged peaceful means for Kurdish rights. Turkish parliament extended mandate for cross-border operations into Iraq. Turkey and Iraq signed a military training agreement in June 2009. In October 2009, the two countries' deputy chiefs of staff signed a memorandum of understanding on military training and technical cooperation. The High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council is set to establish a common security framework, political dialogue, economic interdependence efforts, and cultural cooperation. Ankara is concerned about the Iraqi Turkomen's displacement and outnumbering by Iraqi Kurds in northern Iraq. The Turkomen issue in northern Iraq, particularly in Kirkuk, remains a concern for Ankara. They fear that a referendum on Kirkuk's fate could favor the Kurds over Turkomen residents and lead to the financing of an independent Kurdish state with the city's oil resources. Turkish officials advocate for equitable resource sharing among all Iraqis. Despite some relief due to postponed referendum and census, Turkey remains vigilant. Turkey remains watchful of the fate of the city, taking advantage of economic opportunities in post-Saddam Iraq. Closer economic ties with Iraq are hoped to stimulate development on both sides of the border. Bilateral cooperation in trade and energy is growing, with plans for a free trade agreement and a common industrial zone on the border. Turkish officials aim to increase trade to $20 billion by 2011. Turkey and Iraq are increasing cooperation in the oil sector, with agreements signed between BOTAS and Shell Oil Company for exploration in northern Iraq. TPAO is also involved in rehabilitating oil fields in Basra. The Kirkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline is a key source of income for both countries, with plans to construct a twin pipeline to increase capacity. Oil flow from KRG-administered fields to the Turkish terminal at Ceyhan is expected to double by mid-2010. Turkey hopes Iraq will use the Nabucco gas pipeline to export gas to Europe, depending on increased gas production. Prime Minister Nuri al Maliki attended the signing ceremony. Turkey and Iraq are increasing cooperation in the oil sector, with agreements signed for exploration and rehabilitation of oil fields. The Kirkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline is a key income source, with plans for a twin pipeline. Iraq hopes to export gas to Europe through the Nabucco pipeline, depending on increased gas production. Bilateral water issues between Turkey and Iraq are sometimes problematic, with Iraq claiming reduced water flow from the Euphrates. Turkey insists on providing the agreed amount despite drought conditions. Both sides aim to address the issue cooperatively. Turkey, Iraq, and Syria signed a memorandum of understanding to establish joint measurement stations on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Turkey has multiple diplomatic representations in Iraq, including an ambassador in Baghdad and plans for consulates in Mosul, Basra, and Irbil. Despite security concerns, Turkey has kept its embassy in Baghdad open. Turkey has made efforts to improve relations with various Iraqi ethnic groups, including Sunni Arabs and Shiites. They have also strengthened ties with Iran and Syria, consulting them regularly about Iraq. Turkish authorities have accepted the Iraqi Kurds' claim that independence is not their goal, and have made overtures to promote Iraqi unity and bilateral relations. There have been reports of Turkish military operations with Iranians against Kurdish groups in northern Iraq. Turkey has cooperated with various Iraqi ethnic groups and strengthened ties with Iran and Syria. Turkish officials insist on multilateral contact groups involving all of Iraq's neighbors. Public opinion polls show a low favorability rating of the United States in Turkey. The United States has a low favorability rating in Turkey, mainly due to U.S. policies towards Muslim-majority countries like Iraq. Turks lack confidence in Iraq's stability efforts, leading to continued anti-American sentiment. Despite this, Turkey is likely to assist in the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq through its Incirlik Air Base and Mercin port, with the condition that arms do not reach the PKK in northern Iraq. Saudi Arabia has a historically tense relationship with Iraq but has cooperated during the Iran-Iraq war. They opposed the 2003 invasion but provided logistical support. Saudi Arabia aims to prevent instability in Iraq, protect Sunni interests, and limit Iran's influence. They also want to ensure Iraq's oil industry doesn't threaten their global energy market dominance. Saudi Arabia has refrained from overt intervention in Iraq since 2003 to prevent instability and protect Sunni interests. They have provided aid to displaced Iraqis and taken security measures to prevent violence spillover. Some analysts suggest Saudi Arabia has not fulfilled aid pledges due to concerns about supporting a Shiite-led Iraqi government. Observers speculate that the Saudi government may be offering financial support to Sunni Arab individuals and groups in Iraq, including tribal leaders associated with the \"Awakening\" movement. Saudi clerics and citizens are willing to provide support to combatants in Iraq, despite official religious judgments against participating in violent activities. Saudis traveling to Iraq to fight alongside foreign fighters pose a long-term security risk for both countries. The Al Qaeda-affiliated group responsible for terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia from 2002 to 2006 had fighters from Bosnia, Chechnya, and other regions. Saudi efforts to control exit visas led to fewer Saudi fighters reaching Iraq. Estimates suggest that 12% of foreign fighters killed or captured in Iraq were Saudi nationals. Saudi officials are implementing a border security improvement program to prevent the return of Saudi volunteers from Iraq. They awarded a $2 billion contract to build a security system along the borders with Yemen and Iraq. Concerns about Iraq's Shiite Arab population and Iranian influence in the region are reflected in Saudi views. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al Faisal expressed concerns about U.S. policy in Iraq, warning of increased Sunni-Shiite violence. The historically tense relationship between Saudi Arabia's Sunni Arab majority and Shiite Arab minority complicates the situation. Clashes between Saudi Shiites and security forces in 2009 have elevated Sunni-Shiite tensions on Saudi Arabia's domestic agenda. Sectarian and strategic anxieties hinder Saudi efforts to engage the Iraqi government. Saudi efforts to engage the Iraqi government are complicated by sectarian and strategic anxieties. Despite increased cooperation between Saudi and Iraqi security services, Iraqis are frustrated by the slow pace of official Saudi-Iraqi rapprochement. Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari has expressed concerns about the strained relations and the need to correct them. Saudi efforts to engage the Iraqi government are hindered by security concerns, leading to delays in establishing a Saudi diplomatic presence in Baghdad. Despite initial plans to open an embassy, security worries continue to limit Saudi Arabia's willingness to send high-level diplomatic personnel to Iraq permanently. As of September 2009, Saudi Arabia has not opened an embassy in Iraq or publicly identified an ambassador. Debt forgiveness is a key issue in Iraqi-Saudi relations, with Iraq owing $9 billion to Saudi Arabia for debt incurred under Saddam Hussein. U.S. officials have encouraged Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to forgive Iraq's debt to support Iraqi reconstruction and economic recovery. Saudi Arabia has pledged $500 million for Iraqi reconstruction and economic recovery efforts, along with $90 million in humanitarian relief. Trade between Iraq and Saudi Arabia has been limited since 2003. The Saudi government refrains from overt interference in Iraq but reportedly provides private support for anti-coalition activities. They are likely to avoid direct support for anti-government forces to prevent confrontation with the US and to prevent strengthening of terrorist elements. Saudi Arabia has refrained from overt interference in Iraq but has provided private support for anti-coalition activities. There have been calls within Saudi Arabia to support Iraq's Sunni Arab community and counter perceived Iranian influence. Despite official statements forbidding Saudis from traveling to fight in Iraq, popular support for anti-U.S. or anti-Iranian actions may still be strong. Prince Saud al Faisal has dismissed calls for direct involvement, emphasizing the Kingdom's stance of neutrality towards Iraqi groups and sects. Saudi Arabia has refrained from overt interference in Iraq but has provided private support for anti-coalition activities. Despite official statements forbidding Saudis from traveling to fight in Iraq, popular support for anti-U.S. or anti-Iranian actions may still be strong. The Saudi government remains distant from Iraqi groups and sects, expressing frustration with Prime Minister Al Maliki's policies and close ties with Iran. Reconciliation and stability in Iraq could ease Saudi fears of instability, but the reintegration of returning Saudi militants remains a concern. The outcome of Iraqi government decisions will determine Saudi Arabia's concerns about Shiite empowerment and Iranian influence. The rivalry between Syria and Iraq ended after the 2003 U.S. invasion, leading to Syria struggling to adapt to the new political landscape in Iraq. Syrian opposition to the U.S. presence hindered the formulation of a coherent Iraq policy. However, during the sectarian warfare in 2006-2007, Syria re-engaged with Iraq. During the height of sectarian warfare in 2006-2007, Syria re-engaged with Iraq as Iraqi refugees flooded Damascus. Syria improved ties with various Iraqi religious and sectarian actors, playing different sides of the sectarian equation. Relations further improved in 2009 due to stronger U.S.-Syrian ties, focusing on tightening security along the Syrian-Iraqi border. Syrian officials, including the CENTCOM, held meetings in Damascus to discuss Iraqi border security. A tripartite committee was agreed upon to monitor the Syrian-Iraqi border. Syria expressed willingness to cooperate with the Obama Administration on Iraq, aiming for stability and refugee return. Despite progress, old Syrian-Iraqi enmities still exist. Despite improved Syrian-Iraqi relations and U.S. support, old enmities resurfaced after bombings in Baghdad in 2009. Syria denied involvement, leading to a diplomatic dispute with Iraq. Ambassadors were recalled, highlighting lingering tensions despite efforts for cooperation. Despite improved Syrian-Iraqi relations and U.S. support, Syria continues to harbor groups opposed to the Maliki government, hindering progress on joint economic and political fronts with Iraq. The U.S. Department of Defense report highlights the need for Syria to address border security and foreign fighter networks crossing into Iraq. Syria's tolerance of Al Qaeda in Iraq activity obstructs further cooperation. While some AQI facilitators have been detained and the flow of foreign fighters has decreased, Syria remains the primary gateway for Iraq-bound fighters. Syria continues to harbor Al Qaeda in Iraq operatives and former Baath party officials as leverage in negotiations with the US and Iraqi government. The Maliki government insists on Syria demonstrating greater resolve to limit foreign fighters into Iraq. Despite some Syrian cooperation, reports indicate ongoing challenges. Despite Syrian cooperation along the border with Iraq, Al Qaeda in Iraq operatives and former Baath party officials continue to operate inside Syria, facilitating personnel, arms, and funds to fighters in Iraq. The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Syrian-based individuals for supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq. Syrian harboring of these elements and lax border security have strained Syrian-Iraqi relations. Syrian-Iraqi relations were strained after a U.S. air strike in Syrian territory killed an Al Qaeda operative. Despite initial support from Iraq, they later condemned the attack as aggression. Iraqi Foreign Minister visited Syria to discuss security coordination, with President Asad expressing readiness for professional discussions. The Syrian government demanded that the U.S.-Iraqi SOFA include provisions to prevent raids from Iraqi bases into neighboring countries. Syrian-Iraqi relations were strained after accusations of hosting terrorist training camps following Al Qaeda attacks in Iraq. Diplomatic relationship damage ensued from heated exchanges between Syrian and Iraqi leaders. The diplomatic relationship between Syria and Iraq was damaged after accusations of sheltering armed organizations and wanted individuals. Prime Minister Maliki presented evidence to Syrian officials of Baathists and Al Qaeda operatives meeting in Syria. This crisis is not new, with tensions escalating over activities against Iraq from Syrian lands. Syrian President Bashar al Asad criticized accusations of Syria killing Iraqis while hosting 1.2 million Iraqis. Iraq demands extradition of two suspects believed to be in Syria. Iraq also calls for an international tribunal similar to the Hariri tribunal. Relations between the two countries have deteriorated further, with Iraq increasing security at the Syrian border. On September 8, 2009, Iraq's Presidency Council, led by President Jalal Talabani, objected to the prime minister's tough stance against Syria, calling it illegal and not in the interest of Syria, Iraq, or other Arab nations. The Iraqi refugee crisis has strained Syrian-Iraqi relations, with Syria hosting an estimated 1.3 million Iraqi refugees, leading to economic challenges and changing neighborhoods in Damascus. The Iraqi refugee crisis in Syria has led to economic challenges and changing neighborhoods in Damascus. Syrian authorities initially had an open-door policy for new arrivals but imposed a visa requirement in September 2007. The Iraqi government has provided minimal assistance, and international aid organizations have faced difficulties working with Syria's bureaucracy. Despite claims of insufficient support, only the most destitute Iraqis have been forced to return to Iraq. Syria and Iraq have engaged in discussions on various issues, including energy cooperation, water, and border security. Both countries have withdrawn their ambassadors due to a bilateral dispute over security issues. In the past, there have been visits between the two countries to discuss security, commercial agreements, and the reopening of an oil pipeline. Despite tensions, there have been talks of possible cooperation with Iraq. Syria and Iraq have faced challenges in energy cooperation due to tensions over alleged support for terrorists. Efforts to revive the Kirkuk-Banias pipeline have stalled, with a Russian firm failing to start repairs. Despite announcements of agreements, there has been no progress on the pipeline. Syria has developed ties with various Iraqi parties, including the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq and the Sadrists. President Bashar al-Asad met with Iraqi Shiite leader Amar Abdul Aziz al-Hakim and hosted Muqtada al-Sadr in Syria. Syrian-Iraqi trade reached $6.6 billion in 2008, and President Asad maintains a good relationship with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani. Syrian-Iraqi relations are strained due to alleged Syrian support for Sunni insurgents and terrorists in Iraq. The situation may remain static unless Syria prioritizes improving relations with Iraq over supporting these groups. There is a possibility that Syrian support for terrorist activity in Iraq is indirect, as the Asad regime may not want to jeopardize its improved relations with the United States. Without sustained bilateral cooperation, neither party can fully benefit. Jordan's relations with Iraq have been complex, with Jordan providing support to the U.S.-led campaign against Saddam Hussein in 2003. Since then, Jordan has been concerned about Iraq's influence on its own politics, trade, and security. Jordan is both a source of foreign fighters for the Sunni insurgency in Iraq and a target of terrorist groups. The industrial town of Zarqa, northeast of Amman, is a source of Sunni militancy with young men joining the insurgency and traveling to Iraq as suicide bombers. Despite the killing of Abu Musab al Zarqawi in 2006, the threat of Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorists using Iraq remains a concern for Jordan. The threat of Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorists using Iraq to destabilize Jordan is a concern. In 2005, bombings in Amman killed 58 people, with Al Qaeda in Iraq claiming responsibility. Jordan thwarted a bomb attack in 2006 at Queen Alia Airport. The kingdom has dealt with refugee issues for decades, with an estimated 400,000-500,000 Iraqis living there having an ambivalent relationship with the government. Iraqis living in Jordan face difficult day-to-day circumstances and have an ambivalent relationship with the government. The influx of Iraqis is causing economic and social changes in Jordan, leading to inflation and hardships for middle-class Jordanians. Jordan has sealed its borders to prevent further inflow of Iraqis, with concerns rising about sectarian tensions. The government is treating the Iraqi refugee influx as a national security issue, imposing restrictions on young Iraqi males entering the country. Jordan classifies displaced Iraqis as \"visitors\" or \"guests\" due to lack of refugee law. Those able to deposit $150,000 in banks are granted residency instantly. Most Iraqis in Jordan are illegal aliens. In 2008, Jordan normalized relations with Iraq, with King Abdullah II visiting Iraq, the first Arab leader to do so since 2003. Jordan appointed an ambassador to Baghdad, the first Arab nation to do so since 2005. Jordan normalized relations with Iraq in 2008, becoming the first Arab nation to do so since 2005. Iraq provided most of Jordan's oil needs during Saddam Hussein's regime, but after the U.S. invasion in 2003, Jordan had to seek oil from other sources due to strained relations with Iraq. However, in September 2008, Iraqi crude oil shipments began arriving in Jordan as part of a tentative oil deal. Jordan was supposed to receive around 10,000 barrels of oil per day under the agreement. Jordan and Iraq signed an agreement for Jordan to receive 10,000 barrels of oil per day at a discounted price. The quantity was set to increase to 30,000 barrels later on. Due to rising global oil prices, Iraq revised the deal in 2008 to provide oil at $22 per barrel. Plans for a pipeline from Iraq to Jordan were scrapped due to cost projections, with Jordan now seeking international financing for a 600-mile railroad to transport Iraqi crude oil to its refinery in Zarqa. Jordanian Prime Minister Nader Dahabi visited Iraq in September 2009 for discussions with Prime Minister Maliki. Jordanian Prime Minister Nader Dahabi visited Iraq to meet with Prime Minister Maliki and President Talabani. They signed an agreement to establish a free trade zone to boost bilateral trade, which reached $1 billion in 2008. Discussions also addressed Iraqi debts to Jordan, with the Iraqi central bank owing over $1 billion. The presence of militant Islamist groups in Iraq poses a threat to Jordan as U.S. forces withdraw. The status of Al Qaeda in Iraq and other terrorist groups with foreign elements remains uncertain. Jordan's intelligence services are strong, and the country is more vulnerable to a large-scale terrorist attack than an Islamist-led revolution. Government relations between Jordan and Iraq are expected to improve, but ties between their Sunni tribal elite and Saddam Hussein regime may hinder progress. Both countries will need to address issues such as Iraqi refugees, energy deals, border security, and their relationship with Iran in the future. Jordan, like other Sunni Arab states, is wary of Iran's intentions in the region. Gulf Cooperation Council governments were cautious about supporting U.S. military intervention in Iraq, with Kuwait and Qatar being more openly supportive. The fall of Saddam Hussein initially relieved Gulf states of a conventional threat, but instability in Iraq and concerns about an emboldened Iran have since arisen. During the period of sectarian violence in Iraq, Gulf leaders feared conflicts drawing in Iraq's neighbors and Iran. The rise of Shiite factions post-Saddam created residual threat perceptions in the Gulf. Some Gulf states reached out to Iraq to improve bilateral relations, with the UAE appointing an ambassador and forgiving $7 billion in Iraqi debt. Bahrain also made diplomatic appointments. In response to security concerns, Gulf states and the United States have renewed security discussions regarding Iraq. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki visited Washington, DC in July 2009 to address issues with the United Nations Security Council from the Saddam era. The U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement under Article 25 commits the United States to help Iraq return to its pre-invasion standing. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1859 reviews outstanding resolutions from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, with Kuwait seeking to keep issues open while Iraq wants them closed. Iraq and Kuwait have differing views on the continuing reparations process from the 1990 Iraqi invasion. Iraq sees it as draining oil revenue that could be used for economic development, while Kuwait argues for full compensation. The United States, a close ally of Kuwait, remains dependent on Kuwait for logistical support as it withdraws from Iraq. The Amir of Kuwait, Shaykh Sabah al Ahmad al Jabir Al Sabah, visited the United States and met with President Obama on August 3, 2009. The meeting likely discussed the Chapter VII issue, despite official statements not mentioning it. Kuwait's government system may allow the emir to shift blame to the parliament for delays in reaching an agreement with Iraq. The differing interests of Iraq's neighbors and the U.S.'s need to balance its Iraq policy with broader regional interests present challenges. The challenging context for U.S. policy makers and Members of Congress involves considering policy proposals to modify U.S. policy in Iraq and ensure regional support for Iraq's stabilization. Funding is provided for Iraqi government support, IDPs, refugees, economic reform, and reintegration in the region. Congress may influence the new Administration's use of national power to pursue U.S. objectives in Iraq and the Persian Gulf region's security and stability. The reintegration of Iraq in the region's security balance is a pressing issue as U.S. military presence in the Middle East remains unpopular. Changes in perceptions of the United States in the region may occur as forces withdraw from Iraq. Disputes between Iran and the United States over Iraq, Iran's nuclear program, and support for terrorist groups are ongoing. Iran's nuclear program and support for terrorist groups continue to create regional tension. Insurgent and terrorist threats to energy infrastructure pose a security risk. Greater coordination between the United States and its allies may help overcome these challenges. However, political rivalries and local developments could hinder effective responses. The success of U.S. efforts in Iraq depends on Iraqi security forces and regional cooperation. Concerns remain about Iraqi government cooperation with terrorist groups. The concern over potential Iraqi government cooperation with terrorist groups in 2002 and early 2003 has shifted to a wider concern about instability in Iraq creating safe havens for Al Qaeda and regional terrorist entities. Success against Al Qaeda in Iraq has reduced these threats, but Iranian and Turkish concerns about Kurdish militants persist. Sunni governments are wary of returning fighters from Iraq. Al Qaeda's presence in Iraq is now small, but could regenerate in a renewed atmosphere of instability. Tensions between Iraq and Syria highlight the potential for ongoing cross-border interference. Iran's role in the Persian Gulf region remains a central policy concern for the United States. The Persian Gulf region has been a key policy concern for the United States since World War II. The removal of Saddam Hussein and Iraq's armed forces has shifted the balance of power in favor of Iran. However, barriers like political divisions among Iraq's Shiite Arab population and Arab-Persian differences limit Iran's influence. Israel and Sunni Arab-led governments share U.S. concerns about Iran's ambitions and nuclear program. Political sensitivities and individual government priorities complicate U.S. consultations in the region. The Bush Administration focused on promoting political and economic reform in the Middle East despite challenges in balancing reform goals with other national priorities. Some countries have initiated parallel reform efforts to address political dissatisfaction and limited economic prospects among young populations. Observers have noted that events in Iraq have influenced Islamist parties and opposition groups in the region. Events in Iraq have encouraged Islamist parties, opposition groups, and minorities to push for greater representation and reform. Iraq's instability and political paralysis have tarnished the image of groups promoting change. Regional governments may prioritize short-term stability over long-term reforms in the event of renewed conflict. Iraq's successful transition could increase demands for more participatory government. Members of the 111th Congress will have opportunities to discuss proposals for Iraq's development. Efforts by Members and committees aim to strengthen Iraq's relationships with neighbors through diplomatic engagement, containing conflict effects, and facilitating reintegration into the regional security and economy. The United States engaged with Iraq's neighbors from 2003 to 2007, excluding Syria and Iran, on common concerns. Diplomatic efforts included the 2004 international conference on Iraq in Egypt, involving high-level representatives from various organizations. During the Bush Administration, the U.S. engaged with Iraq's neighbors through various multilateral fora, including the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the International Compact for Iraq meetings. Efforts focused on ministerial conferences and dialogue with Syria and Iran, with increased engagement since 2007. Iraq is now part of the \"GCC plus three\" group, which met in New York in September 2009. The Bush Administration engaged with Iraq's neighbors through multilateral fora, including the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the International Compact for Iraq meetings. Efforts focused on dialogue with Syria and Iran, with increased engagement since 2007. The Obama Administration continued and expanded this dialogue since March 2009. Key questions remain about the willingness of Iraq's neighbors to support Iraqi reconciliation arrangements and which Iraqis will cooperate with regionally supported initiatives. Despite statements and commitments made in regional conferences since 2003, implementation has been limited, but some neighboring states have increased engagement with Iraq as security conditions improved. Some neighboring states have expanded engagement with Iraq as security conditions improved. The U.S. may need to provide increased military and counterterrorism assistance to contain potential insurgency and conflict in Iraq, requiring new congressional authorization and appropriations. The U.S. may need to provide increased military and counterterrorism assistance for Iraq and its neighbors, including border security cooperation and efforts to target transnational groups. This could involve modifying sanctions laws targeting Iran and Syria, restricting the flow of foreign fighters from Iraq, and providing emergency support for humanitarian operations."
