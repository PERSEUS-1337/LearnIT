    "content": "The Act titled \"Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Tax Incentive Act of 2003\" excludes gain from the sale of qualified farm property under section 121A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Act \"Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Tax Incentive Act of 2003\" excludes gain from the sale of qualified farm property to first-time farmers, with varying percentages for different types of buyers based on the intended use of the property for farming purposes. The exclusion of gain from the sale of qualified farm property is limited to $500,000 ($250,000 for married individuals filing separately) per taxable year, with a special rule for joint returns. Qualified farm property is defined as real property located in the United States. The exclusion of gain from the sale of qualified farm property in the United States is limited to $500,000 per year. To qualify, the property must have been used for farming purposes by the taxpayer or their family, with material participation in the farm's operation. Definitions for terms like 'member of the family', 'farm', and 'farming purposes' are provided in the subsection. Special rules apply, similar to those in section 2032A. The rules of section 2032A apply to the exclusion of gain from the sale of qualified farm property. If there is a recapture event, the taxpayer's tax will increase based on the recapture percentage and adjusted basis of the property. The applicable recapture percentage is determined from a table for recapture events related to the exclusion of gain from the sale of qualified farm property. The recapture percentage for different years after a recapture event is as follows: \nYears 1 through 5 - 100%, Year 6 - 80%, Year 7 - 60%, Year 8 - 40%, Year 9 - 20%, Years 10 and thereafter - 0%. A recapture event is defined as the cessation of operation. The cessation of operation of a property described as a farm for farming purposes results in recapture liability, unless the new owner agrees in writing to assume it. The new owner of a farm property must agree in writing to assume recapture liability to avoid any increase in tax under this subsection. Any recapture liability will be computed as if there had been no change in ownership. The increase in tax under this subsection does not apply to any disposition of property or cessation of farm operation due to hardship as determined by the Secretary. The amendment excludes gain from the sale of qualified farm property. Effective for sales or exchanges after the enactment date, in taxable years ending after that date."
