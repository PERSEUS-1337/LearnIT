The text discusses the authority of States to require the use of registered fuel additives, defining terms related to fuel control or prohibition. The text discusses temporary waivers for fuel control or prohibition during supply emergencies under the Clean Air Act. The Administrator may temporarily waive regulations for fuel or fuel additives in certain circumstances. The Administrator may grant a temporary waiver for fuel or fuel additives under specific conditions, including extreme supply circumstances due to natural disasters or equipment failures, with consultation and concurrence from the Secretary of Energy, and if it is in the public interest to do so. Requirements for Waiver: A waiver can only be granted for the smallest necessary geographic area to address extreme fuel supply issues, lasting for 15 days or a suitable period determined by the Administrator to resolve the situation. The waiver allows for a transitional period determined by the Administrator after the temporary waiver ends, permitting wholesalers and retailers to blend down inventory. It applies to all persons in the motor fuel distribution system and requires public notice for consideration and granting of the waiver. The waiver authority covers the State or region specified and does not limit other waiver authorities or subject anyone to enforcement actions solely based on actions taken under the waiver."
