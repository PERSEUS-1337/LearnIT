    "content": "The Clean Water Act, enacted in 1972, aims to restore and maintain the integrity of the nation's waters by regulating pollution from both point and nonpoint sources. Despite progress, water quality issues persist, including runoff from farms, cities, and industrial discharges. The Clean Water Act, enacted in 1972, aims to eliminate pollution and achieve zero discharge of pollutants. Federal financial assistance is provided for municipal wastewater treatment plant construction. The Environmental Protection Agency administers federal programs, while state and local governments implement CWA programs. The goal is to make waters \"fishable and swimmable\" by controlling pollutants. Progress has been made in controlling conventional pollutants discharged by industries and sewage treatment plants. However, efforts to control toxic pollutants, which can harm human health and the environment even in small amounts, have been mixed. Nonpoint source pollution from urban, suburban, and agricultural areas is a more recent focus. Data shows that a significant percentage of river and stream miles and lake acres do not meet water quality standards. In 2006, EPA reported that 67% of U.S. stream miles are in poor or fair condition due to nutrients and streambed sediments. 95,000 lakes and 544,000 river miles in the U.S. have fish-consumption advisories, with mercury and PCBs being major concerns. Mercury concentrations in game fish exceed health limits in 49% of lakes. The Clean Water Act was last amended in 1987 with the Water Quality Act (P.L. 100-4), which extended and revised the act significantly. Authorizations for various programs expired in the early 1990s, but Congress has continued to appropriate funds for their implementation. The act has been successful in achieving its goals and is widely supported by the public. Criticism of the Clean Water Act has arisen from industry, developers, and property rights groups, questioning the cost and impact of new regulations. States and cities support water quality programs but oppose potential unfunded mandates. Environmental groups advocate for further adjustments to maintain progress. Several groups believe that further fine-tuning is needed to maintain progress achieved under the Clean Water Act. Despite measurable improvements, significant water pollution problems persist. Key issues include implementing existing provisions, achieving overall goals, preventing loss of progress, and determining the federal role in clean water infrastructure. The Clean Water Act faces challenges in determining the appropriate federal role in guiding and funding clean water infrastructure. Efforts to amend the act have stalled due to debates on how to address issues such as economic impacts, scientific uncertainty, and governmental responsibilities. Congress has focused on narrow bills to extend or modify selected CWA programs instead of comprehensive proposals, partly due to political dynamics and reluctance to address controversial environmental issues. The 2008 election raised expectations for increased focus on environmental issues, including clean water, by the 111th Congress and the Obama Administration. Candidate Obama supported various water quality issues during his campaign, such as wetlands preservation, Great Lakes restoration, water conservation, regulation of animal feeding operations, and funding for clean water infrastructure programs. The 111th Congress focused on environmental issues, including clean water. Funding for water infrastructure projects was a priority to stimulate the economy. The Congress enacted two bills amending the Clean Water Act, addressing issues such as CWA permitting for vessels and federal agencies paying localities for costs. The 112th Congress enacted two bills amending the Clean Water Act, extending moratorium for CWA permitting of vessels and authorizing funds for the Lake Pontchartrain Basin program. Legislative focus shifted after the 2010 election, with attention on water infrastructure financing and wetlands protection. Various water quality issues were addressed through oversight and legislation. Since 1972, Congress has provided over $88 billion in financial aid for municipal wastewater treatment plant construction to meet Clean Water Act requirements. State and local governments have also contributed over $25 billion. However, there is still a high funding need of an additional $298 billion for construction purposes. The funding needs for wastewater treatment and collection systems remain high, with an additional $298 billion required according to the most recent Needs Survey estimate by EPA and states. This estimate includes $187.9 billion for wastewater treatment, $63.6 billion for combined sewer overflow corrections, $42.3 billion for stormwater management, and $4.4 billion for recycled water distribution systems. EPA attributes the increased total needs to improvements for water quality standards, infrastructure rehabilitation, and capacity expansion. The EPA estimates that the United States needs to spend nearly $390 billion over the next two decades to replace and build wastewater infrastructure systems. This includes funding for water quality standards, infrastructure rehabilitation, capacity expansion, and stormwater management, with an additional $17 billion needed for \"green\" infrastructure. Funding needs do not explicitly address security issues or climate change impacts. The EPA estimates that the US needs $390 billion over the next 20 years to replace and build wastewater infrastructure. An additional $148 billion is needed for operation and maintenance. Without increased investment, there will be a $6 billion gap in annual capital expenditures. Increasing wastewater spending by 3% annually could reduce this gap by 90%. Debate continues over the federal role in funding wastewater infrastructure. The 1987 amendments to the act extended grants for sewage treatment project construction and initiated a program of grants for State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRFs). States are required to deposit at least 20% of the federal capitalization grant in a state fund. The revolving fund concept allows for repayment of funds for future construction, providing ongoing financing. The 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act introduced State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRFs) to assist in transitioning to full state and local financing by FY1995. SRF monies can be used for various activities, including providing loans for project costs, refinancing debt obligations, and issuing state bonds. These funds have been a key focus in recent Clean Water Act reauthorization discussions due to ongoing funding needs delaying the shift to full state responsibility. Since the introduction of State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRFs) under the 1987 Clean Water Act amendments, states have used $3.8 billion for over 12,650 nonpoint management projects. States have established mechanisms to administer loan programs and receive SRF capitalization funds, but have faced challenges with federal rules complicating the program. Congressional oversight has focused on reducing the backlog of wastewater treatment facilities to meet water quality objectives. The State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRFs) have been used by states for over 12,650 nonpoint management projects since the 1987 Clean Water Act amendments. Congress has continued to appropriate SRF capitalization grants to states, providing an average of $1.35 billion annually in recent years. Congressional oversight has focused on reducing the backlog of wastewater treatment facilities to meet water quality objectives. The State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRFs) have been used for nonpoint management projects since the 1987 Clean Water Act amendments. Congressional earmarks represented about 15% of water infrastructure funds. Small communities face challenges in accessing SRF loans due to limited resources. Congress is exploring options to address clean water funding needs, including extending SRF assistance or establishing a grant program. The EPA is considering extending SRF assistance to address clean water funding needs, including high-cost projects for sewer overflows and stormwater runoff. The estimated cost for these projects nationwide is nearly $64 billion, with concerns about funding adequacy. Wastewater utilities are also seeking assistance to upgrade physical protection against possible terrorist attacks on water infrastructure. EPA officials during the Bush Administration supported infrastructure funding. During the Bush Administration, EPA officials supported infrastructure funding beyond federal capabilities, proposing that federal funding would end after 2011. EPA's water infrastructure initiative focused on promoting better management, full-cost pricing, efficient water use, and watershed protection. They also encouraged water-efficient products to reduce national infrastructure needs. The Obama Administration's EPA supports sustainable practices to reduce water infrastructure needs through conservation measures. In October 2010, EPA issued a \"Clean Water and Drinking Water Infrastructure Sustainability Policy\" to encourage conservation and provide long-term funding for capital needs. EPA is working with water utilities and states to promote planning processes that prioritize public health, water quality, and natural resource conservation. The EPA is working with states to target SRF assistance for system upgrades and replacements in existing communities, reflecting full life cycle costs of infrastructure assets and promoting conservation of natural resources. The Obama Administration has supported increased appropriations for SRFs, but no legislation other than appropriations has been enacted. In the 107th Congress, bills were approved to extend the SRF program and increase federal assistance, but neither bill received further action. In the 108th Congress, bills were introduced to reauthorize the Clean Water Act SRF program and grant funding. In the 109th and 110th Congress, various bills were introduced to authorize funding for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure programs, including the Clean Water Act SRF program. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved legislation in both Congresses, but no further action was taken on the bills. The House also approved three wastewater infrastructure financing bills in the 110th Congress. In the 110th Congress, the House approved three wastewater infrastructure financing bills, but the Senate did not act on them. The bills included reauthorizing CWA Section 221, providing funding for sewer overflow projects, and extending a pilot program for alternative water source projects. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved a similar bill, but no further action was taken. In the 111th Congress, the House passed H.R. 1262, and a Senate committee reported S. 1005. The House passed H.R. 1262, reauthorizing SRF capitalization grants for five years and including provisions for sewer overflow and alternative water supply projects. The Senate committee bill authorized $20 billion for clean water SRF grants, $14.7 billion for drinking water SRF grants, and added grant programs for sewer overflows and agriculture-related water quality issues. Difficulty in moving the bills further was due to Bush Administration opposition. The Bush Administration opposes higher authorization levels for water infrastructure projects, including disputes over prevailing wage requirements and clean water grant allocations. The Davis-Bacon Act's application to SRF-funded projects is controversial, with critics citing increased costs and reduced competition, while supporters argue it stabilizes local construction industries. The recent issue revolves around restoring Davis-Bacon requirements for SRF-funded projects and the allocation of SRF capitalization grants among states, which has not been revised since 1987 despite changing needs. This is crucial for clean water infrastructure legislation in the 111th Congress. The 111th Congress clean water infrastructure legislation included revised allotment formulas based on states' funding needs. The Senate did not consider S. 1005 due to concerns about the allocation formula. Despite issues, the water infrastructure program is widely supported, and reauthorization legislation was introduced in the House (H.R. 3145). Congress is considering reauthorization legislation for water infrastructure services, with various policy options discussed in hearings. These options include the establishment of a Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program and a national infrastructure bank. Some options aim to provide long-term solutions to challenges faced by communities in providing water infrastructure services. Some policy options in the 112th Congress aim to support infrastructure financing programs and private participation in wastewater services. There is no consensus on a preferred policy, with many advocating for a combination of options to expand the financing toolbox. The debate on wetlands protection and regulation, particularly under the Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 404 permit program, remains contentious. This program requires permits for disposal of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, including wetlands, and has evolved through judicial interpretation and regulatory changes. The Section 404 permit program under the Clean Water Act has become a key tool for wetlands protection, but is criticized for being intrusive and burdensome. The program is administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, with input from other federal agencies like the Fish and Wildlife Service and Natural Resource Conservation Service. The tension between regulatory goals and wetlands protection has been a longstanding issue. The tension between regulatory goals and wetlands protection has been a longstanding issue, with conflicts arising in administrative and judicial proceedings over wetlands regulation. Controversies include federal jurisdiction, impacts on private property, permit procedures, and the roles of federal agencies and states in issuing permits. One contentious issue is the jurisdiction of Section 404 over isolated waters. The Supreme Court ruling in SWANCC v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 2001 questioned the authority of the Corps and EPA over isolated waters under the Clean Water Act. The 5-4 decision stated that denying a permit based solely on migratory bird usage exceeded the act's authority. The impact of this ruling on the regulatory program remains unclear even a decade later due to differing interpretations in subsequent court cases. The SWANCC decision in 2001 raised questions about federal regulatory authority over wetlands, leading to differing interpretations in subsequent court cases. The responsibility to protect affected wetlands now falls on states and localities, with environmentalists criticizing the Court's interpretation of congressional intent while industry groups welcomed the ruling. The government's view on the decision's impact was outlined in EPA-Corps guidance issued in January 2003. The EPA-Corps guidance issued in January 2003 provided a legal interpretation of the SWANCC decision, allowing federal regulation of some isolated waters to continue. Interest groups criticized the confusion in implementing the guidance, with environmentalists concerned about diminished protection and developers highlighting the need for new regulations. Federal courts play a key role in interpreting the SWANCC decision, with cases like Rapanos v. United States and Carabell v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers seeking to narrow its scope. The Supreme Court ruling in Rapanos v. United States in 2006 aimed to clarify the scope of the Clean Water Act (CWA) permit program for wetland development. The Court, led by Justice Scalia, held that the lower court had applied an incorrect standard in determining CWA coverage for wetlands. Justice Kennedy joined the plurality in vacating the lower court's decision. The Supreme Court ruling in Rapanos v. United States in 2006 aimed to clarify the scope of the Clean Water Act (CWA) permit program for wetland development. Justice Kennedy joined the plurality in vacating the lower court's decision. Following the ruling, the EPA and Corps issued guidance for field staff to make CWA jurisdictional determinations, asserting regulatory jurisdiction over certain waters. The EPA and Corps issued guidance in 2008 to clarify CWA jurisdiction over waters, including traditional navigable waters and adjacent wetlands. The guidance allows for case-by-case determinations for non-navigable tributaries and wetlands adjacent to them, based on their significant nexus with traditional navigable waters. The 2008 revisions added clarification on key terms like \"adjacent wetlands,\" following public comments and 18 months of implementation. Some environmental groups criticized the revised guidance for limiting CWA jurisdiction. Industry analysts and groups criticized the 2008 revised guidance for limiting the scope of protected waters under the CWA. The Obama Administration proposed new guidance in 2011 to clarify regulatory jurisdiction over U.S. waters and wetlands, aligning with Supreme Court decisions and agency regulations. The 2011 guidance proposed by the Obama Administration aimed to clarify the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act (CWA) in light of Supreme Court rulings. The agencies concluded that previous guidance did not fully utilize the CWA's authority to include waters within its scope. As a result, the extent of waters under CWA jurisdiction is expected to increase compared to existing guidance, but not to the full extent prior to Supreme Court decisions. The EPA and Corps proposed guidance in 2011 to clarify Clean Water Act jurisdiction following Supreme Court decisions. Critics argue it may overreach agency authority, but the agencies believe the impact on regulated entities will be limited. Public comments were accepted until July 31, 2011, with plans for further clarification through new regulations after finalizing the guidance. Legislation has been introduced regularly since the 107th Congress to overturn decisions on federal jurisdiction over wetlands and other waters. Environmental advocates argue that Congress must clarify the issues left unresolved. Environmental advocates and others argue that Congress needs to clarify important issues left unsettled by Supreme Court rulings and Corps/EPA guidance regarding CWA jurisdiction. Critics question the constitutionality of proposed legislation, fearing it would expand federal authority and increase confusion. Obama Administration officials have acknowledged uncertainties and supported the need for legislative action. The Obama Administration and the Council on Environmental Quality wrote to congressional leaders supporting legislative clarification on water issues. Principles were outlined to guide legislative actions, including protecting the nation's waters and promoting consistency between the Clean Water Act and agricultural wetlands programs. Legislation similar to the Clean Water Restoration Act was advanced in the 111th Congress but not considered by the full Senate. The bill filed in the 111th Congress aimed to amend the Clean Water Act by defining \"waters of the United States\" to include various water bodies while excluding certain areas like prior converted cropland. It also aimed to protect existing regulatory exclusions and ensure consistency with EPA and Corps interpretations. The bill aimed to clarify the regulatory scope of the Clean Water Act by defining \"waters of the United States\" to include specific water bodies while excluding certain areas. It sought to align with EPA and Corps interpretations prior to the SWANCC and Rapanos rulings. Companion legislation in the House also aimed to restore jurisdiction as it was interpreted before these rulings. H.R. 5088 aimed to amend the Clean Water Act by redefining \"waters of the United States\" without the term \"navigable,\" drawing from existing EPA-Corps definitions with modifications. Despite criticism for potentially expanding federal jurisdiction, the bill differed from previous proposals based on public input. Future prospects for similar legislation are uncertain due to differing views among proponents. Efforts to develop revised Rapanos guidance by EPA and the Corps have been controversial, with legislative provisions to prohibit funding for these activities. Bills such as S. 2245 and H.R. 4965 aimed to prevent finalizing the 2011 draft guidance, while S. 2122 / H.R. 4304 proposed amending the CWA with a narrow definition of jurisdictional waters. Despite interest in similar legislation, none of these bills were enacted. Recent attention has been focused on issues affecting efforts to achieve the goals of the Clean Water Act (CWA), with some legislators critical of regulatory initiatives by the EPA. Over the past four years, the EPA has proposed and implemented numerous regulations related to the CWA, leading to accusations of overreach and underestimation of costs. Republican leaders in Congress conducted oversight and introduced bills to overturn regulations or limit the agency's authority. Environmental groups and EPA officials defend the agency's regulatory pace, emphasizing the benefits of new regulations. Despite efforts to improve the Chesapeake Bay, restoration goals have not been met. EPA's initiatives under the Clean Water Act have also faced scrutiny. Despite some improvements in specific indicators like blue crabs and bay grasses, the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries still suffer from poor health due to polluted water, reduced fish populations, and degraded habitat. President Obama declared the Bay a \"national treasure\" in 2009, leading to the establishment of a Federal Leadership Committee to develop a strategy for restoration. The primary pollutants causing issues are nutrients and sediment from various sources around the Bay. The strategy released in May 2010 for protecting and restoring the Chesapeake region included new clean water regulations, agricultural conservation practices, and habitat restoration. A key aspect was the establishment of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for Chesapeake Bay, which sets a pollution budget to achieve water quality standards. EPA requires states to identify impaired waters and establish TMDLs if needed. The EPA established a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for the Chesapeake Bay watershed to address water quality standards violations. The TMDL, issued in December 2010, aims to reduce nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment discharges by 2025. It is the largest TMDL developed to date, allocating pollutant reductions to all jurisdictions in the 64,000 square mile watershed. The EPA established a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for the Chesapeake Bay watershed in December 2010 to reduce nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment discharges by 2025. States are developing Watershed Implementation Plans (WIPs) to identify specific pollutant reductions from point and nonpoint sources, with EPA reviewing Phase II WIPs for localized control measures. The EPA's TMDL plans for the Chesapeake Bay watershed are controversial, with legal challenges from agricultural and home builder groups. Environmental activists support federal leadership in Bay restoration and legislation to codify TMDL requirements in the Clean Water Act. Legislation introduced in Congress did not pass, but the House Agriculture Committee approved a bill for an expanded role for the Department of Agriculture. Legislation (H.R. 5509) proposed an expanded role for the Department of Agriculture in Chesapeake Bay restoration. Congress held oversight hearings on the impact of the plan on agriculture. The Clean Water Act directs states to adopt water quality standards, with EPA authorized to intervene if necessary. Florida waters face severe nutrient pollution from various sources. EPA determined in 2009 that Florida's water quality standards for nutrients must be revised to numeric criteria to control pollution. A consent decree with environmental litigants required EPA to establish these standards by November 15, 2010. The rule does not directly apply to regulated entities but must be translated into permit limits by the state. The EPA delayed the effective date of the 2010 rule in Florida multiple times to allow for the state to develop its own numeric nutrient water quality criteria. EPA indicated that it would likely approve the state's revised standards, leading to the initiation of administrative action to repeal the 2010 federal rule. EPA delayed the effective date of the 2010 rule in Florida multiple times to allow the state to develop its own standards. Legal challenges were filed, and a federal court ruling largely upheld EPA's authority in setting numeric criteria for nutrient pollution. The deadline for issuing the second phase of standards was extended, and EPA approved the standards submitted in November 2012. The EPA approved Florida's nutrient pollution standards in November 2012, which cover only 15% of the state's waterways. To comply with a federal court order, EPA proposed two rules: one for the remanded portion of the 2010 rule and a Phase II rule for estuaries and coastal waters. Deadlines for finalizing these rules are set for August and September 2013. EPA approved Florida's nutrient pollution standards in November 2012, covering only 15% of the state's waterways. Deadlines for finalizing Phase II rule for estuaries and coastal waters are set for September 13, 2013. EPA may request an extension for portions of Phase I rule not remanded in February. Controversy surrounds the proposal due to disputes over data, compliance costs, and administrative flexibility. Industry groups endorse EPA's approval, while environmental groups find the state rule inadequate and may challenge EPA's decision. Some industry groups fear EPA's actions in Florida will set a precedent for similar regulatory action elsewhere. Environmental advocacy groups have petitioned for numeric nutrient water quality standards in Kansas and the Upper Mississippi River Basin. Legislation in the 112th Congress aimed to restrict EPA's oversight of state water quality standards. The House Appropriations Committee included a provision in FY2012 appropriations for EPA that would have barred EPA from implementing or enforcing standards issued in 2010. Separate legislation was introduced to limit EPA's authority to set numeric nutrient criteria in Florida. Mountaintop removal coal mining involves removing the top of a mountain to access coal seams, creating excess spoil that is often placed in nearby valleys, impacting streams. Mountaintop mining involves removing the top of a mountain to access coal seams, creating excess spoil that is typically placed in nearby valleys, impacting stream water quality and wildlife habitat. The mining industry argues that this method is essential for surface coal mining in the Appalachian region, regulated under laws like the CWA Section 404 permit program and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. In 2009, officials signed a Memorandum of Understanding to reduce environmental impacts. The government has taken administrative actions to reduce environmental impacts of mountaintop mining and surface coal mining in Appalachia. These actions include regulatory proposals, guidance documents, and review of permit applications. The Army Corps suspended a CWA general permit for surface coal mining in Appalachia and issued more stringent rules in 2012. In 2011, EPA issued guidance tightening oversight of permit reviews for surface coal mining in the region. The guidance tightened oversight of permit reviews for surface coal mining in Appalachia by establishing benchmarks for stream conductivity. It has been controversial with industry, leading to hearings in Congress and the introduction of legislation to restrict mountaintop mining practices. The bills introduced in Congress aimed to restrict the discharge of materials into U.S. waters under Section 404 permits, which are more lenient than Section 402 permits. Supporters wanted to limit environmentally harmful activities, while critics argued that economically important activities like coal mining would be infeasible under the stricter Section 402 requirements. In the 112th Congress, H.R. 1375 was introduced, similar to H.R. 1310 in the 111th Congress. Legislation introduced in the 111th and 112th Congress aimed to restrict the Administration's regulatory actions regarding environmental policies. A bill in the 111th Congress, H.R. 6113 and S. 3933, sought to limit EPA, the Corps, and OSM from enforcing policies announced in 2009 and 2010 without promulgated regulations. Critics argued that these policies should undergo full administrative rulemaking procedures. In 2012, a federal court invalidated the 2011 guidance document, leading to a government appeal. The government has appealed a ruling related to legislation introduced in the 112th Congress regarding environmental policies. Various bills were included in appropriations bills for FY2011 and FY2012, but were not enacted. Congressional attention was also drawn to EPA's veto of a CWA Section 404 permit for a surface coal mining operation in West Virginia. Several bills were introduced in the 112th Congress to limit EPA's veto authority over 404 permits. One bill (H.R. 2018) aimed to prevent EPA from vetoing a permit without state concurrence. The bill passed the House in July 2011. A federal court overturned EPA's veto of the Spruce No. 1 permit in March 2012, ruling that EPA had exceeded its authority. Federal courts have also ruled that aerial pesticide application into U.S. waters requires authorization under the CWA's NPDES permit program. In November 2006, EPA finalized a rule to clarify when a CWA permit is required for pesticide use under FIFRA. However, in January 2009, a federal court rejected EPA's argument and vacated the rule. EPA requested a delay in the court's ruling to develop a general CWA permit. EPA requested a delay in the court's ruling to develop general CWA permits for pesticide applications. The pesticide general permit was issued on October 31, 2011, covering approximately 5.6 million annual applications by 365,000 applicators across four use patterns. Pesticide discharges before January 12, 2012, were automatically covered, while those after that date will need to apply for permits. In response to a court ruling, EPA and states are implementing permit requirements for pesticide applications. Congress has considered legislation to exempt FIFRA-approved pesticides from CWA permit requirements. Bills such as H.R. 872, S. 1720, and S. 2365 have been proposed but not enacted. In Northwest Environmental Defense Center v. Brown (640 F.3d 1063 (9th Cir. 2011)), the Ninth Circuit ruled that stormwater runoff from logging roads collected and discharged through ditches, culverts, and channels requires a CWA NPDES permit. This decision overturned EPA regulations since 1976, which classified such runoff as nonpoint source pollution exempt from permits. Environmental groups argue that timber hauling on logging roads contributes significant sediment pollution to streams, harming aquatic life. Critics of the ruling disagree. Critics of the court's decision argue that the existing process of states regulating runoff and EPA not requiring permits has been effective for 35 years. Legislation was introduced in Congress to amend the Clean Water Act and exempt silviculture activities from needing NPDES permits. Timber industry groups and states petitioned the Supreme Court to review the ruling on logging roads runoff. The U.S. solicitor general agrees with petitioners that the Ninth Circuit judges erred in not deferring to EPA on logging roads runoff regulations. EPA will issue a rule stating that logging roads do not need discharge permits for stormwater runoff. A ruling is expected in 2013, with potential legal challenges to EPA's actions. Clean water policy issues have been addressed by Congress. In the context of annual appropriations acts, Congress addresses policy and program issues, including EPA's appropriations. President Obama's FY2011 budget requested a freeze on non-security discretionary expenditures, resulting in a $10.02 billion budget for EPA. The request included $2.0 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants, with a focus on \"green infrastructure\" projects. The FY2011 budget requested $300 million for Great Lakes restoration activities, continuing an initiative from the previous year. Only 8% of the 2010 funds had been obligated by February 2010, with some funds not spent until 2011. EPA aimed to target significant environmental problems in the Great Lakes ecosystem and coordinate federal agencies' efforts in restoring the lakes. In FY2011, Congress delayed funding for EPA until April 2011, passing multiple short-term CRs before enacting a bill (P.L. 112-10) that reduced EPA funding by 15% below FY2010 levels. The final bill (P.L. 112-10) reduced EPA funding by 15% below FY2010 levels and allocated $1.522 billion for the clean water SRF program, 27.5% below FY2010 levels. It did not include amendments to prohibit funding for EPA regulatory activities like mountaintop mining and Chesapeake Bay TMDL. The President's FY2012 budget request sought $9 billion for EPA, a $1.3 billion decrease. The President's FY2012 budget request on February 14 sought $9 billion total for EPA, a decrease of $1.3 billion from the FY2010 enacted level. It requested $1.55 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants and $350 million for the Great Lakes Initiative. The House debated H.R. 2584 in July for EPA appropriations but did not take final action before the August recess. The bill provided $7.3 billion for EPA, 17% less than FY2011 funds and 19% less than the President's request. It reduced funds for clean water SRF grants to $689 million and included no funds for earmarks. The bill included reductions in funding for the Section 319 grant program and the Section 106 grant program. It also allocated $250 million for the Great Lakes Initiative, which was below previous funding levels. The bill had provisions to prohibit funding for certain EPA water quality rules. However, final congressional action on FY2012 appropriations for EPA did not occur until the end of December 2011. Overall funding for EPA in the bill was $8.4 billion. Overall, the omnibus appropriations act, P.L. 112-74, provided $8.4 billion in funding for the EPA, which was 3% below FY2011 levels. It included $1.47 billion for the clean water SRF program and $299.5 million for the Great Lakes Initiative. President Obama's FY2013 budget request sought $8.34 billion for EPA, with $1.175 billion for clean water SRF grants and $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. The House Appropriations Committee approved legislation providing FY2013 funds for EPA in July 2012 (H.R. 6091), including $689 million for clean water SRF capitalization grants, $250 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, and provisions to prohibit funding for certain EPA water quality rules and initiatives. The House did not take up H.R. 6091, nor did the Senate act on an EPA appropriations bill. Congress passed a continuing resolution bill providing funding for government agencies through March 27, 2013. Final action on FY2013 appropriations is expected in early 2013."
