    "content": "This report examines the fiscal impacts of foreign-born individuals in the United States on federal, state, and local governments. It considers tax-funded expenditures for public services and tax revenues received through various taxes. Congressional interest in this topic focuses on immigration policy and budget concerns related to public service usage by foreign-born individuals. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 was passed due to concerns about public service consumption by unauthorized aliens and foreign-born individuals. This report specifically focuses on the fiscal impacts of the foreign-born population, excluding economic, demographic, socio-cultural, and environmental impacts. The report examines the fiscal impacts of the foreign-born population, including costs to the federal government for enforcing immigration laws. It distinguishes between the entire foreign-born population and the unauthorized alien population, with limited studies focusing on the legally residing foreign-born population. The report evaluates the fiscal impacts of the foreign-born population, focusing on both legal and unauthorized individuals. Studies included in the report quantified the cost of public services, tax revenues contributed, and used a range of methodologies from basic arithmetic to sophisticated economic models. The report evaluates fiscal impacts of the foreign-born population, using various methodologies from basic arithmetic to economic models. It distinguishes between cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, with most studies reviewed completed after 1996. The report refrains from synthesizing results beyond its conclusion section. The report discusses challenges in enumerating the foreign-born population and estimating their fiscal impacts. It reviews four sets of studies, including evaluations of short- and long-term fiscal impacts, scholastic research, and policy studies at national and state levels. Analysts have long attempted to estimate the fiscal impacts of immigrants to the United States, using conceptual and analytic frameworks to guide their research. These frameworks define the foreign-born population analyzed, differentiate by legal status, education, and decade of U.S. arrival, and determine the appropriate unit of analysis for computing fiscal impacts. Analysts face methodological hurdles in estimating fiscal impacts of immigrants to the United States, including determining the population of interest and which public service costs and tax revenues to include. Studies can be evaluated based on how well they address these elements. The population of interest for estimating fiscal impacts of immigrants in the United States is challenging to determine due to the lack of distinction between legal and unauthorized aliens in data sets like CPS, Census, and ACS. Studies reviewed in the report estimate fiscal impacts for all foreign-born individuals, but to evaluate impacts for legally residing foreign-born, analysts must isolate this population from unauthorized aliens. To estimate fiscal impacts of legally residing foreign-born individuals, analysts face methodological challenges in isolating this population from unauthorized aliens. This difficulty has led to a lack of fiscal impact studies on legal immigration, resulting in ambiguous policy implications due to the distinct educational profiles and employment trajectories of these two groups. Legal status also plays a significant role in determining fiscal impacts according to federal law. Legal status impacts fiscal effects based on federal law, affecting tax obligations and access to public services for foreign-born individuals. Estimating fiscal impacts of unauthorized aliens is challenging due to difficulties in accurately counting this population. National surveys like CPS, Census, and ACS do not capture immigration or legal status, requiring researchers to use alternative methods to assess public service costs and tax contributions of unauthorized aliens. Estimates of unauthorized alien population in the US are challenging due to methodological issues. Pew Hispanic Center estimated 11.2 million unauthorized aliens in March 2010, while Department of Homeland Security's Office of Immigration Statistics estimated 10.8 million in January 2010. Different datasets were used for these estimates. The Pew Hispanic Center and OIS use different datasets to estimate the number of unauthorized aliens in the US, leading to discrepancies. Producing realistic fiscal impact estimates requires analysts to choose which costs and revenues to include, such as public education, criminal justice, and healthcare costs. Some studies also consider federal income transfers like SSI and SNAP. The fiscal impact of foreign-born individuals in the United States includes costs for programs like SSI, SNAP, Medicaid, and TANF, as well as public infrastructure and service costs. Revenues are estimated through state and local income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, and excise taxes. Some studies also consider federal income transfers. The fiscal impact of foreign-born individuals in the United States includes state and local costs and revenues, as well as federal taxes like FICA and Medicare withholdings. Researchers face challenges in selecting an appropriate time frame for analyzing fiscal impacts, as they often measure the difference between annual tax revenues and government service costs. This static perspective may obscure the more substantial costs of foreign-born individuals over their lifetimes. Estimates of the fiscal impact of foreign-born individuals in the United States often use a cross-sectional perspective, which may overlook their long-term costs and contributions. Changes in the size, age, and education of the foreign-born population affect public service consumption and tax revenue. Some studies use longitudinal approaches to account for these dynamics and estimate fiscal impacts over the expected lifespans of foreign-born residents in the U.S. Some studies estimate fiscal impacts of foreign-born individuals in the U.S. over their expected life spans, using households as the unit of analysis. \"Mixed status\" households with citizens and noncitizens complicate fiscal analyses due to federal program eligibility variations. For example, The New Americans included revenues and expenditures for noncitizen households, but only for children living in the household, leading to overstated costs to U.S. taxpayers. The analysis overstated costs to U.S. taxpayers of noncitizen households due to the inclusion of children during costly school-age periods. Different approaches to estimating fiscal impacts include only foreign-born individuals and their children or include U.S. citizen children under the assumption they reside in the U.S. because of their foreign-born parents. The New Americans report was commissioned by Congress in 1990 to recommend immigration policy reforms. The report addressed the impact of immigration on the U.S. population, economy, and government finances. It used data prior to 1996 and did not account for changes from the 1996 Act. A similar analysis post-1996 would likely show larger surpluses and smaller deficits due to stricter restrictions on federal assistance programs. The report analyzed the impact of immigration on government finances, estimating revenues and costs associated with foreign-born households and U.S.-born children. It differentiated between short-term and long-term impacts, cautioning that excluding U.S.-born children not residing in foreign-born households in the short-term analysis likely overstated the fiscal burden of immigrants. The report analyzed the impact of immigration on government finances, estimating revenues and costs associated with foreign-born households and U.S.-born children. It differentiated between short-term and long-term impacts, cautioning that excluding U.S.-born children not residing in foreign-born households in the short-term analysis likely overstated the fiscal burden of immigrants. The study found that foreign-born-headed households in New Jersey and California had a net cost to native-headed households, with estimates ranging from $232 to $1,178 in 1996 dollars. At the federal level, the impact was a smaller net benefit of about $3 for each state. The study analyzed the impact of immigration on government finances, estimating costs and benefits of foreign-born households on native-headed households. Foreign-born households were found to have a higher cost to native households due to factors like more children and lower income levels. The fiscal impact of foreign-born households is influenced by factors such as lower incomes, higher receipt of income transfers, and less contribution to taxes. However, long-term fiscal impacts are complex and cannot be accurately determined through annual estimates due to timing distortions and other unpredictable changes. Short-term analyses cannot predict changes in public service consumption or tax contributions, including tax rate changes and eligibility criteria. The fiscal impacts of foreign-born individuals in the United States vary based on economic, demographic, and regulatory factors. The New Americans study extended their methodology to estimate long-term fiscal impacts by considering future taxes, public service expenditures, and characteristics of the foreign-born population. The analysis compared the fiscal impact of foreign-born and native residents, finding little difference in long-term public service costs. While foreign-born individuals incurred higher social program costs at younger ages, they had lower costs in old age. The study compared the fiscal impact of foreign-born and native residents, showing differences in tax contributions and social benefit consumption. It estimated a net fiscal impact of $80,000 for a new foreign-born individual arriving in 1994, varying based on personal characteristics and assumptions. Figure 1 illustrates the net present value of this total fiscal impact. The fiscal impact of foreign-born individuals varies based on age at arrival in the United States. A study estimated a net fiscal impact of $80,000 for a new foreign-born individual arriving in 1994, showing that they are costly to society at young and old ages but are net revenue generators during working ages. Foreign-born individuals between ages 10 and 25 produced a net fiscal surplus, while those arriving at retirement age produced a net fiscal deficit. Foreign-born individuals arriving at retirement age produced a net fiscal deficit, while those between ages 10 and 25 generated a net fiscal surplus. Estimates show that the federal government reaps surpluses over the individual's lifetime, while state and local governments incur deficits. Educational attainment significantly impacts fiscal estimates, with those with less than a high school diploma creating a deficit and those with more than a high school education producing a surplus. The fiscal impact of foreign-born individuals varies based on education level, with a difference of $270,000 between those with less than a high school education and those with more than a high school education. Descendants of the foreign-born show a smaller difference of $23,000. Education also affects fiscal impact within the same education categories, with deficits for foreign-born individuals with less than a high school education and surpluses for their descendants. The authors' estimated fiscal impact of $111,000 was based on average characteristics of the foreign-born. The study analyzed the fiscal impact of foreign-born individuals on U.S. immigration policy. Age-adjusted sensitivity analyses showed that foreign-born individuals paid less taxes and received fewer benefits than native residents. Foreign-born individuals generated federal fiscal surpluses nationwide, while states with large foreign-born populations experienced state and local fiscal deficits. The study analyzed the fiscal impact of foreign-born individuals on U.S. immigration policy, showing that states with large foreign-born populations incurred net fiscal costs while others benefited. George Borjas critiqued findings from The New Americans, questioning the estimated fiscal benefits of admitting foreign-born individuals in 1994. George Borjas critiqued a study on the fiscal impact of admitting foreign-born individuals to the US in 1994, challenging assumptions about tax increases and the long-term time frame. He argued that removing these assumptions changed the estimated net fiscal surplus to a deficit. According to George Borjas, variations in estimated fiscal impacts of admitting foreign-born individuals to the US stem mostly from assumptions about the appropriate time frame. Short-run estimates suggest foreign-born households cost each native household between $166 and $226 annually, while long-term estimates show an annual fiscal surplus of just $450. The authors estimated the fiscal impacts of foreign-born individuals at the national level using a cross-sectional approach. Data from the 1994 and 1995 Current Population Surveys showed 40.4 million persons, including foreign-born individuals, their U.S.-born children, and grandchildren. Four categories of public expenditures were estimated. The authors estimated the fiscal impacts of foreign-born individuals at the national level using a cross-sectional approach. They analyzed public goods, public debt servicing, congestible public goods, and transfer programs. Data from the 1994 and 1995 Current Population Surveys were used to estimate public service costs and tax revenues generated by foreign-born individuals and their descendants. The study estimated a net fiscal deficit of $27.4 billion in 1994 dollars, with foreign-born individuals costing more in public services and paying lower taxes compared to native-born individuals. However, at the federal level, foreign-born individuals and their descendants had a net fiscal surplus of $50.9 billion, with a per-capita surplus of $1,260 versus $1,340 for native-born individuals. The study compared the net fiscal impacts of foreign-born individuals and native-born individuals, showing a per-capita surplus of $1,260 for foreign-born individuals versus $1,340 for native-born individuals. Different formulations including foreign-born households with U.S.-born children resulted in varying fiscal impacts, with state and local costs for public education being a significant factor. The study analyzed the fiscal impacts of foreign-born individuals and their descendants, showing a net surplus of $29.5 billion. Including grandchildren reduced the surplus to $23.5 billion, with increased deficits for states and localities. High immigration states had different impacts compared to other states. If foreign-born individuals and their descendants had vanished in 1994, native residents would have had to pay an average of $107 more in taxes. In a national-level empirical analysis, the authors used generational accounting to assess the long-term fiscal impact of the foreign-born population projected as of 2000. Native residents in high immigration states would have received a net benefit of $49, while residents in all other states would have had to pay $182 more in taxes. The analysis did not differentiate legal status and utilized various macroeconomic assumptions. The analysis did not distinguish legal status and used macroeconomic assumptions related to variables such as taxes paid, public goods consumed, time spent in host countries, and population growth. Total fiscal impacts were based on the difference between tax payments and income transfers for foreign-born individuals. Three sets of results were produced for different scenarios involving native residents, immigration policies, and policy environments. The analysis in the year 2000 differentiated two policy environments regarding the fiscal impact of foreign-born residents. If future generations addressed fiscal imbalances, eliminating immigration would raise the net fiscal burden by 3.7%, suggesting that foreign-born residents helped restore fiscal balance. If current taxpayers bore the burden, halting immigration in 2000 benefitted future generations. Halting immigration in 2000 benefitted future generations by reducing the net fiscal burden by an estimated average present value of 5.4%. The impact of foreign-born individuals on the fiscal balance was deemed \"extremely small\" relative to the overall imbalance, indicating that U.S. immigration was neither a cause nor a solution for national-level budget imbalances. The analysis considered how changes in immigration policy could affect the nation's fiscal condition in light of impending retirements and public service demands of baby boomers. The author derived national-level conclusions on the net present value (NPV) of foreign-born persons based on individual-level computations. High-skilled foreign born, ages 40-44, without taxpayer-sponsored public education costs, had the highest NPV of $177,000. Family migration scenarios yielded lower NPVs. The analysis also compared NPVs of native-born residents and unauthorized aliens. Selective immigration policies were implied. The author suggested that selective immigration policies could offset the need for fiscal reforms related to baby boomer aging. To achieve this, annual immigration would need to increase to 1.6 million highly skilled individuals aged 40-44. However, the author proposed an even larger increase to 2.7 million individuals, all high-skilled and aged 45-49, which was deemed impractical. The authors analyzed the impact of foreign-born status on tax contributions and public service consumption in New Jersey for individuals aged 45-49. They found that foreign-born households in the state had unique characteristics compared to other states, with individuals originating from various countries and being more educated. The authors analyzed the fiscal impacts of immigration in New Jersey, finding that foreign-born households paid higher taxes and consumed fewer state government services compared to native households. Differences by region of origin were noted, with Latin American immigrant households consuming less state services than European households. At the local level, being foreign-born had no statistical effect on benefit use but resulted in a net surplus for local tax contributions. The study concluded that if foreign-born households had the average characteristics of native households, they would consume fewer state-level services and the same quantity of local services. The author reviewed studies on the fiscal impact of immigration, finding that skilled foreign-born individuals made net fiscal contributions, while unskilled foreign-born individuals imposed costs on native taxpayers. However, unskilled foreign-born individuals could also be net fiscal contributors if they did not settle in host countries and used public services sparingly. Most studies showed minor fiscal impacts, typically within +/-1% of GDP, across various methodologies and countries. Initial studies in the US during the 1960s and 1970s suggested that foreign-born families used public services less than native families, but subsequent studies found an increase in usage. Subsequent studies in the 1970s showed a significant increase in foreign-born use of public services at all age levels, attributed to their weaker labor market position. Different research findings were due to varying emphases on quantity and frequency of public service use, leading to conflicting conclusions on the fiscal impact of foreign-born individuals. Overall, academic literature suggested modest fiscal impacts compared to nations' GDPs. The academic studies reviewed consisted of experiments, simulations, and analyses estimating fiscal impacts. Policy studies focused on national and state levels, estimating costs of public services for foreign-born individuals. A national-level analysis in FY2004 examined low-skilled immigrant households, comprising 5% of the U.S. population. 59% had legal status, while 41% were unauthorized aliens. The authors estimated fiscal costs of foreign-born individuals, with 41% headed by unauthorized aliens. Over 50 expenditures were analyzed, divided into six categories including direct benefits, means-tested benefits, public education, and population-based services. Two additional cost categories were excluded from the analysis. The authors analyzed fiscal costs of foreign-born individuals, excluding two additional cost categories related to public expenditure over the longer term from low-skilled immigrant households. They tallied 31 sources of taxes and revenues paid by low-skilled immigrant households, with five main sources accounting for almost 80% of the total paid. In FY2004, low-skilled foreign-born households received $30,160 in immediate benefits and services. Foreign-born households received $30,160 in immediate benefits, three times their estimated tax contributions of $10,573. The fiscal gap of $19,588 occurred for low-skilled foreign-born households, resulting in an average lifetime cost of nearly $1.2 million to U.S. taxpayers per household. This amounts to an estimated annual cost of $89.1 billion for the nation's 4.5 million low-skilled foreign-born households. The report evaluated fiscal impacts of foreign-born individuals on Minnesota and highlighted that they are subject to the same tax requirements as others. The authors noted that foreign-born individuals in Minnesota are subject to the same tax requirements as native residents, but the Department of Revenue does not collect information on immigration status. While differences in revenue contributions between foreign-born and native residents were not clear, foreign-born individuals accounted for a slightly disproportionate share of some state expenditures, such as food support programs and state public financial assistance. The report highlighted that foreign-born individuals in Minnesota contribute to state expenditures, including food support programs and public financial assistance. However, the report did not quantify their consumption of other costs like public infrastructure due to difficulties in attributing consumption patterns. Minnesota's foreign-born population includes a significant number of refugees, making up half of the state's new foreign-born in 2004 and 44% of noncitizens receiving public health care benefits. The authors highlighted that refugees in Minnesota have higher levels of public service consumption compared to other foreign-born individuals. They also noted that Minnesota's immigrants are generally younger and better educated than immigrants nationally, suggesting greater potential for earnings and tax revenues over time. The long-term impact of immigrants on taxpayers depends on the success of immigrants' children and grandchildren in Minnesota's schools. The report focused on taxes paid by foreign-born individuals in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area. It highlighted their significant contributions, with foreign-born households contributing $9.8 billion in taxes in 1999, representing 18% of all taxes paid in the area. The report also noted that the area's foreign-born population made up 20% of the total population, compared to the national average of 12%. Foreign-born households in the Washington, DC, metro area paid an average of 28% of their incomes in taxes in 1999-2000, compared to 31% for native households. Taxes paid by foreign-born households were correlated with citizenship status, education, English proficiency, and origins. In 2004, Arkansas estimated the economic impact of its foreign-born population, totaling $2.9 billion surplus through purchasing power. Expenditures for public services for the foreign-born included $237 million for K-12 education, healthcare, and criminal justice. State income tax revenues were estimated at $47 million, corporate income tax at $5 million, and property tax at $30 million. The foreign-born population in Arkansas contributed an estimated $257 million in direct and indirect tax contributions to the state. After accounting for education, health care, and corrections costs, there was a $19 million net surplus in the state's budget, roughly $158 per foreign-born person. The economic benefits were geographically concentrated in four counties. The report highlighted the economic benefits concentrated in four counties from foreign-born residents in Florida. It compared taxes contributed by foreign-born and native residents from 2002 to 2004, without evaluating costs of public services used by foreign-born individuals. The authors estimated the cost of public services used by foreign-born residents in Florida, viewing education and health spending as investments. They used data from the CPS ASEC and a tax return simulation model to estimate contributions from income taxes, FICA withholdings, and property taxes. Sales taxes were estimated using an income-based model. Foreign-born residents contributed $3,314 per capita in federal and FICA taxes compared to $3,554 for native residents. Property taxes for homeowners were also analyzed. The authors estimated property tax contributions of Florida foreign-born and native residents, with homeowners paying $388 and $448, respectively. Additional estimates were made for indirect property tax contributions due to a higher proportion of foreign-born residents renting. After modeling income, property, and sales tax contributions based on income, estimated per capita property tax contributions increased to $421 for foreign-born and $528 for native residents. Sales tax contributions were estimated at $1,020 for foreign-born and $1,180 for native residents. Transfer payment benefits were estimated using the ASEC, including cash benefits and public assistance. The authors estimated that foreign-born residents received $1,619 in public cash benefits and assistance grants, compared to $2,218 for native residents. They also received $1,255 in Medicare and $385 in Medicaid, while native residents received $1,331 and $324, respectively. Foreign-born residents had a total estimated per-capita tax contribution of $4,756 compared to $5,262 for native residents, a difference of $506 or 11%. The study estimated the fiscal impacts of foreign-born residents' state and local tax contributions and costs for public education, public assistance, and criminal justice services in 2007. It found that foreign-born residents received $3,259 in public benefits compared to $3,873 for native residents. The net estimated difference between taxes paid and benefits received was a positive contribution of $1,497 for foreign-born residents and $1,388 for native residents. The analysis separated naturalized citizens, legal permanent residents, and unauthorized aliens in assessing fiscal impacts. In 2007, naturalized citizens, legal permanent residents, and unauthorized aliens contributed an estimated total of $1,163 million, $902 million, and $256 million, respectively, in various taxes. The study also estimated fiscal expenditures for the foreign-born, including public education, criminal justice costs, and public assistance. In 2007, public education costs dominated estimated fiscal expenditures for naturalized citizens, authorized foreign-born residents, and unauthorized aliens. The net fiscal impact at the state level was $234 million for naturalized citizens, $103 million for authorized foreign-born residents, and -$109 million for unauthorized aliens. When federal tax estimates were included, the net impact increased significantly. The authors addressed methodological omissions in their report, such as not estimating fiscal impacts of foreign-born residents' health care utilization and revenue contributions for various Indiana taxes. They provided conservative estimates for costs of providing public services to foreign-born residents in Arizona in 2004. The report in 2004 estimated foreign-born residents in Arizona contributed $2.4 billion in state revenue, exceeding the $1.4 billion costs for education, health care, and law enforcement services. Costs included $540 million for English Language Learner programs in public schools and $150 million for other public education expenses. The foreign-born residents in Arizona accounted for $790 million in uncompensated health care costs, Medicaid program expenses, and incarceration costs in 2004. Immigrant workers contributed $2.4 billion in state tax revenues, with naturalized citizens and noncitizens contributing $860 million and $1.5 billion, respectively. Personal, business, and sales taxes made up the tax revenue generated. Cost Pressures from the Immigrant Population in Nebraska: In 2006, foreign-born residents contributed $155 million in taxes, representing 4.6% of total state revenues. They consumed $145 million in public services, representing 4.3% of state expenditures. Native residents contributed $3,243 million in taxes and consumed $3,239 million in public services. The demographic and economic profile of foreign-born residents in Massachusetts, based on 2007 ACS data, showed that their per-capita revenue contributions and public service consumption were lower than native residents. However, their ratio of contributions to costs was slightly higher. The study compared estimates of tax contributions and public service costs between foreign-born and native residents, focusing on various taxes and expenditures for public school enrollment, institutionalization, and transfer payments. Federal income taxes were not included in the analysis. The study compared tax contributions and public service costs between foreign-born and native residents in Massachusetts. Foreign-born residents had lower tax contributions due to their lower incomes and wealth compared to native residents. The study also highlighted the narrowing income gap between recent and established foreign-born residents in the United States. The study in Massachusetts compared tax contributions and public service costs between foreign-born and native residents. Foreign-born households accounted for 14.5% of the state's sales and excise tax receipts in 2006. Children from foreign-born households made up 19.1% of all school enrollments in 2007, with a third of the difference attributed to younger foreign-born household heads. If foreign-born households had the same school enrollment rates as native households, an estimated 39,000 fewer foreign-born children would have been enrolled. In Massachusetts, a study compared tax contributions and public service costs between foreign-born and native residents. Foreign-born households contributed 14.5% of the state's sales and excise tax receipts in 2006. Foreign-born children accounted for 19.1% of all school enrollments in 2007, with 39,000 fewer children estimated to attend public schools if their enrollment rates were similar to native households. Foreign-born residents were less likely to be in taxpayer-funded institutions, saving an estimated $440 million in educational expenditures and $300 million in institutionalization costs. In 2007, foreign-born households received food stamps and public assistance, with lower amounts compared to native households. Foreign-born wage-earners also received unemployment compensation, but at a lower rate and amount than native wage-earners. Established foreign-born residents were more likely to receive unemployment compensation compared to recent foreign-born residents. However, eligible foreign-born residents received higher amounts in Social Security compared to native residents. In 2007, foreign-born residents received an average of $8,674 in total transfer payments, while native residents received $10,453. The difference in per-capita transfer payments was $1,779, mainly due to variations in Social Security receipts. Studies on the fiscal impacts of unauthorized aliens on federal, state, and local governments are reviewed in this section. The fiscal impact analysis for unauthorized aliens is challenging due to the lack of reliable estimates. Accurate data on public service costs, tax revenues, and socioeconomic characteristics are necessary, but often not available. Studies rely on assumptions, leading to varying and unknown margins of error in estimating the net fiscal impacts of unauthorized aliens. Studies on the fiscal impact of unauthorized aliens face challenges due to unreliable estimates and varying margins of error. State and local governments bear the cost of providing public services, such as education, healthcare, and law enforcement. Researchers use limited methodologies to quantify costs and revenues, often focusing on specific geographic regions or issues like medical care and criminal justice. Studies on the fiscal impact of unauthorized aliens face challenges due to unreliable estimates and varying margins of error. Researchers use limited methodologies to quantify costs and revenues, often focusing on specific geographic regions or issues like medical care and criminal justice. Some studies used proxies to determine unauthorized status, while others relied on published data and quantitative modeling. The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) examined estimates of the net cost of unauthorized aliens in a 1995 report, which found wide variations in estimates from 13 studies published between 1984 and. Net Cost Estimates Vary Widely, with GAO examining 13 studies from 1984 to 1994 on the net costs of unauthorized aliens. Only three studies provided national estimates, showing significant variations in the fiscal impact. GAO found that the methodologies used to estimate costs were often based on unknown assumptions, leading to uncertainties in quantifying the fiscal impact. The GAO criticized the methodologies used in studies on unauthorized aliens' costs, citing data limitations and varying approaches that made comparisons difficult. They noted that small changes in assumptions led to large differences in estimated costs and that unauthorized aliens generate revenues that offset some government expenses. Researchers disagreed on the amount of taxes paid and the extent to which they offset costs. The GAO criticized studies on unauthorized aliens' costs, noting data limitations and varying approaches. They found that unauthorized aliens generate more costs than revenues, with debates on the magnitude of these costs. Huddle's study estimated a national net cost of $11.9 billion in 1992, while the Urban Institute disagreed on the tax revenue estimates. The Urban Institute authors criticized Huddle's estimates on taxes paid by unauthorized aliens, job displacement, and overall cost. They re-estimated the net cost to be $1.9 billion, much lower than Huddle's $11.9 billion. Huddle later revised his estimate to $19.3 billion, increasing it by $7.4 billion, with a key difference being the treatment of Social Security contributions. The United States/Mexico Border Counties Coalition received a grant from the Department of Justice to measure costs to the general funds of all 24 border counties for providing law enforcement, criminal justice, and emergency medical services to unauthorized aliens for FY1999. Data was collected through site visits, interviews with various officials, and consultation with Border Patrol and state agencies. The study used CPS and Census data, as well as border crossing data. The study by the United States/Mexico Border Counties Coalition in FY1999 estimated that border counties spent $23.3 million in Texas, $5.0 million in New Mexico, $24.2 million in Arizona, and $55.7 million in California on law enforcement, criminal justice, and emergency medical services for unauthorized aliens. The average per-capita cost for all residents in the 24 county region was $17.31 per year. The study used statistical modeling to estimate the cost of emergency medical services provided to unauthorized immigrants. The researchers identified 117 non-border counties with a comparable demand for emergency medical services to U.S.-Mexico border counties. They used a linear regression model to estimate that hospitals in the 24 Southwest border counties spent $189.6 million in 2000 on uncompensated care for unauthorized aliens, mainly for emergency medical treatment. The Center for Economic Development at the University of Illinois at Chicago conducted a study on unauthorized aliens in the Chicago metro area, estimating that they spent $2.89 billion annually on services. The study focused on recent low-wage workers of Latin American and Eastern European ancestry seeking social services. The survey data, 2001 CPS data, and INS estimates were used to make these estimations. The Center for Economic Development at the University of Illinois at Chicago estimated that unauthorized aliens in the Chicago area spent $2.89 billion annually and generated an additional $2.56 billion in local spending. The study used CPS and Census data, assigning legal status based on socioeconomic characteristics. In FY2002, unauthorized households paid $4,200 in federal taxes but consumed $6,950 in federal public services, resulting in a net federal cost of $2,736. In FY2005, unauthorized aliens cost Minnesota between $176 million and $188 million. The study estimated costs of public services to unauthorized aliens but did not consider taxes and other public revenues. The study estimated that Minnesota spent $176 million to $188 million on public services for unauthorized aliens, including $146 million to $158 million on K-12 education, $17 million on healthcare, and $13 million on incarceration. The study used population estimates from various sources to determine the fiscal impact of unauthorized aliens in Texas. The report estimated that unauthorized aliens in Texas consumed $1.16 billion in state services, including $968 million for education, $58 million for healthcare, and $130.6 million for incarceration. It also estimated that in FY2005, unauthorized aliens contributed $1,581 million, or 3.6%, of state revenues. The study estimated that unauthorized aliens in Texas contributed $1,581 million, or 3.6%, of state revenues in FY2005. This resulted in a net fiscal surplus of $425 million at the state level. However, local governments incurred $1.44 billion in uncompensated health care and law enforcement costs for unauthorized aliens, leading to a net fiscal deficit of $929 million at the local level. The study extrapolated results from the 1992 Los Angeles County study to estimate that $1.1 billion was spent on medical costs for nonelderly unauthorized aliens in the United States in 2000, representing 1.3% of all public spending. Total medical costs for nonelderly unauthorized aliens were estimated at $6.5 billion, or 1.5% of national public spending. The study estimated that unauthorized aliens accounted for $6.5 billion, or 1.5% of national medical costs, with $2.4 billion paid by them. This left $4.1 billion in unreimbursed public and private spending on medical care, with $1.1 billion from public sources. Each U.S. household paid $56 for medical care for nonelderly foreign-born individuals, but only $11 for unauthorized aliens due to lower healthcare utilization rates. The Bell Policy Center estimated that Colorado spends $224.9 million annually on services for unauthorized aliens, including $175.6 million on K-12 education, $31.3 million on emergency Medicaid, and $18.0 million on incarceration. The cost of education was calculated by multiplying the estimated number of unauthorized alien students by the average cost per student. The study estimated that Colorado's unauthorized alien population included 28,480 children aged 5-17. Incarceration costs were calculated based on the number of inmate days of illegal aliens. Another study found that unauthorized alien households paid between $159 million and $194 million in state and local taxes in 2005. In 2005, unauthorized alien households in Colorado paid $194 million in state and local taxes, compensating for 70% to 86% of government costs for services. Researchers used tax data and estimates on unauthorized aliens' population, income, and remittances to calculate taxes paid. In 2005, unauthorized alien households in Colorado paid an average of $1,861 in taxes, including $1,265 in sales taxes, $491 in income taxes, and $105 in property taxes. Overall, unauthorized alien households in Colorado paid between $159 million and $194 million in taxes, with sales taxes accounting for $125 million to $151 million, state income taxes for $24 million to $30 million, and property taxes for $10 million to $13 million. The Missouri Budget Project estimated sales and property tax payments of unauthorized aliens in 2005 at $25 million to $50 million and state income tax payments at $4 million. Estimates of public service costs for unauthorized aliens in New Mexico in 2004 focused on K-12 education, totaling between $17.5 million and $32.6 million. The report by the Fiscal Policy Project of New Mexico Voices for Children presented estimates of public education costs and state tax revenues for unauthorized aliens in the state. In 2004, a study in New Mexico estimated education costs for unauthorized aliens at $49.1 million to $67.4 million, excluding federal contributions. State and local tax revenues from unauthorized aliens were estimated at $50.4 million to $69.3 million, potentially exceeding the cost of public education for these individuals. The study compared tax revenues and social service costs of unauthorized aliens in Iowa in 2007, focusing on the cost of public education to state and local taxpayers. The analysis included estimating withholdings for state taxes, unemployment insurance taxes, Social Security, and Medicare for unauthorized alien employees and their employers. The study analyzed the costs and contributions of unauthorized aliens in Iowa in 2007. It estimated that unauthorized aliens contributed between $40 million and $62 million in state revenue through taxes, while costing the state an estimated $54 million to $81 million in public education, medical care, and incarceration services. The study did not include costs of other public services. The study in Iowa estimated that unauthorized aliens contributed between $52 million and $81 million in withholdings for unemployment insurance, Social Security, and Medicare. They are ineligible for certain benefits like unemployment benefits and in-state public university tuition. The Comptroller of the Treasury in Tennessee also estimated costs of public education, emergency medical care, and law enforcement attributed to unauthorized aliens. Tax revenues of unauthorized aliens in Tennessee were not estimated. In Tennessee, the state and local funding for English Language Learner (ELL) students totaled $32 million in FY2006, with additional appropriations for lower teacher-student ratios in ELL classes. TennCare spent $4.9 million on emergency treatment for unauthorized aliens in FY2005, and $1.7 million in FY2006. The Tennessee Department of Children's Services spent about $8,000 to provide services for unauthorized children. The Tennessee Department of Children's Services spent $8,000 to provide non-emergency medical care for unauthorized alien children. The Tennessee Department of Corrections spent $3.2 million annually incarcerating unauthorized aliens. The United States/Mexico Border Counties Coalition measured the public cost for law enforcement and criminal justice services for apprehended unauthorized aliens in border counties. County operations for law enforcement and criminal justice services for unauthorized aliens apprehended on state felonies or multiple misdemeanors were detailed for FY1999 through FY2006. Data was collected through site visits, interviews with various officials, and estimates were based on general fund budgets and workload attributed to unauthorized aliens. Legal status of clients was not tracked by county agencies. The report by the Federation for American Immigration Reform estimated that border counties spent $1.23 billion between FY1999 and FY2006 on processing unauthorized criminal aliens. In FY2006 alone, these counties spent $191.9 million, with Arizona spending $26.6 million, California $82.6 million, New Mexico $7.3 million, and Texas $75.4 million. The report also estimated a national net fiscal deficit of $99.2 billion, with federal deficits at $19.3 billion and state and local deficits at $79.9 billion. This represents a cost of $1,075 to each household headed by a U.S. citizen. The authors estimated the net fiscal costs at the federal level of the unauthorized population at $28.8 billion, with expenditures for education, medical services, justice administration, welfare benefits, and general expenditures. They also estimated federal tax receipts from unauthorized aliens at $9.5 billion, including Social Security, Medicare, and excise taxes. The estimated net fiscal deficit at the federal level for the unauthorized population is $19.3 billion. This includes costs for education, medical services, justice administration, welfare benefits, and general expenditures. The estimated federal tax receipts from unauthorized aliens are $9.5 billion, comprised of Social Security, Medicare, excise and miscellaneous taxes, employer taxes, and income taxes. The total costs at the state and local level were estimated at $83.9 billion, with a net fiscal deficit of $79.9 billion after subtracting revenues. The costs included education, Medicaid, SCHIP, justice administration, welfare benefits, and general expenditures. Tax receipts were estimated at $4.0 billion, consisting of property, sales, and income taxes. Attention should be given to the fiscal impacts of changes in the current economic downturn and budgetary constraints. In times of fiscal stress, attention is focused on the fiscal impacts of changes in immigration policy, which intersect with budget concerns over public service costs. Congress passed the PRWORA in 1996 to restrict federal assistance programs for legal permanent residents and noncitizens. Calculating the net fiscal impacts of the foreign-born population or unauthorized aliens remains a challenge. Calculating the fiscal impacts of the foreign-born population and unauthorized aliens is challenging due to methodological hurdles and data limitations. State-level policy studies diverge in analyzing public service costs and revenue streams, influenced by the lack of data. Age composition is a significant factor in the fiscal impacts of both the total foreign-born population and unauthorized aliens. The age composition of the foreign-born population significantly affects their fiscal impact, with costs incurred as children through education and as elderly through healthcare services. Despite this, many foreign-born individuals pay taxes and contribute to programs like Social Security, leading to long-term fiscal surpluses. Educational attainment also plays a crucial role in determining their net fiscal impact. The fiscal impact of the foreign-born population is influenced by factors such as age composition and educational attainment. A study showed that those with less than a high school education created a deficit, while those with more education generated a surplus. These impacts vary at state and federal levels based on contributions, public services, and taxing schemes. Legal permanent residents could potentially contribute more in federal taxes than the cost of programs like Social Security and Medicare. Legal permanent residents could potentially contribute more in federal taxes than the cost of programs like Social Security and Medicare. However, their children attending public schools could lead to a net fiscal deficit at the state level. Foreign-born residents, with a younger age distribution, incur greater fiscal costs for states and localities compared to the federal government. This is due to federal programs focusing on the elderly, while state and local jurisdictions provide services for younger individuals. Studies on the fiscal impact of unauthorized aliens show less consensus. Studies on the fiscal impact of unauthorized aliens show less consensus, with estimates of net fiscal deficits due to their younger age, lower education levels, and lower wages compared to all foreign-born workers. These deficits are attributed to higher usage of public education and lower tax contributions. Unauthorized aliens contribute less in tax revenues compared to all foreign-born individuals and can generate significant fiscal expenditures. Studies show that some unauthorized aliens can still obtain public services despite being nominally ineligible. Additionally, unauthorized aliens pay taxes at all government levels and contribute to the Social Security program without necessarily receiving benefits."
