    "content": "The \"Military Dependents Education Act of 1993\" is cited as the short title. Funding responsibility for military connected children is added as a new section to Title I of the Act of September 30, 1950. The \"Military Dependents Education Act of 1993\" adds funding responsibility for military connected children in local educational agencies. The Secretary computes the amount based on the number of children in different categories under sections 2, 3, or 4 residing on military installations or with parents employed there. Total payments for all agencies are determined accordingly. The Secretary of Defense transfers necessary funds to the Secretary of Education for payments to local educational agencies for military connected children. These funds are the only ones used for such payments and are distributed according to the Act's provisions. The Act allows for the transfer of funding responsibility for military connected children from the Department of Education to the Department of Defense. Military connected children are defined as those described in specific subsections, and the term \"military installation\" is defined accordingly. The Act addresses military connected children with disabilities.
