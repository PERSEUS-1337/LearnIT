    "content": "Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are happening at various levels, with proposals in the U.S. Congress focusing on market-based approaches like cap-and-trade or carbon tax. Both mechanisms would increase fossil fuel prices, impacting consumers. The choice between a carbon tax and cap-and-trade depends on whether one wants to directly control emissions or costs. The Obama Administration's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions has sparked interest in developing a program, contrasting with the previous Administration's focus on voluntary initiatives. States have also taken action, with 23 joining regional partnerships for emission reductions. Industry stakeholders are concerned about potential state-created programs. Industry stakeholders are concerned about potential state-created climate change regulations, leading some to call for a federal program. The Environmental Protection Agency's actions to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and President Obama's plan to integrate federal standards are driving market-based federal legislation. The Administration finalized GHG and fuel economy standards in May 2010, driven by California's rulemaking action. Members in the 111th Congress introduced proposals for market-based approaches to reduce GHG emissions. Nine bills were introduced with provisions for market-based controls on GHG emissions. H.R. 2454, passed in June 2009, includes cap-and-trade provisions. H.R. 2454 proposes a cap-and-trade system to reduce GHG emissions from covered sources by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 and 83% below 2005 levels by 2050. Covered entities would represent about 85% of U.S. total GHG emissions and could use offsets for compliance. The program would have a rolling two-year compliance period and distribute allowances to both covered and non-covered entities at no cost, with some allowances sold through auction to support policy objectives. S. 1733, introduced by Senator Kerry, is similar to H.R. 2454 in establishing an economy-wide GHG cap-and-trade program. Six key distinctions include a more stringent emissions cap, different allocation of emissions allowances and auction revenue, varied treatment of offsets, and differences in carbon market regulation. Both H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 propose measures to limit EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. H.R. 594 suggests a carbon-content tax on fossil fuels, while H.R. 1337 introduces a different approach. H.R. 1337, introduced by Representative Larson, proposes a carbon-content tax on fossil fuels starting at $15/ton, increasing annually by $10. If emission targets are not met, the tax would increase by $15. Revenues would support a payroll tax rebate, industry transition assistance, and clean energy technology. Additionally, a carbon equivalency fee would be imposed on imported carbon-intensive goods. The bill H.R. 1683, introduced by Representative McDermott in 2009, proposes a hybrid approach to greenhouse gas emission control. It includes a managed price program from 2012 to 2019, overseen by a Climate Program Oversight and Coordination Board. Any excess emissions would need to be offset through additional reductions from 2020 to 2030. Auction revenues would be placed in an Auction Revenue Trust Fund at the Department of the Treasury. The bill H.R. 1862 proposes a dynamic carbon-content tax for GHG emission control. Producers and importers would need to purchase emission permits for each ton of emissions, with prices set by the Department of the Treasury based on annual emission caps. Permits cannot be traded, and if sold permits exceed allocations, subsequent year allocations would be reduced. H.R. 1862, introduced by Representative Van Hollen, proposes capping CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Fossil fuel producers and importers must surrender carbon permits based on emissions from the previous year, with a yearly decline leading to an 85% reduction by 2050. Carbon permits would be auctioned, with proceeds redistributed monthly. H.R. 2380, introduced by Representative Inglis, suggests a carbon-content tax starting at $15/ton, increasing annually to $100/ton by 2040. The proposal in S. 2877, introduced by Senator Cantwell, aims to combine emission and price control by imposing a tax on carbon-intensive imported goods. It would require fossil fuel producers and importers to submit \"carbon shares\" for CO2 emissions, with the President capping the quantity available each year. The Department of Treasury would distribute carbon shares through monthly auctions with a price floor and ceiling. The proposal in S. 2877 includes auctions with a price floor and ceiling for carbon shares. Additional shares would be sold if the price ceiling is reached, with revenues used for domestic mitigation activities. 75% of auction revenue would go to individuals monthly, while 25% would support various policy objectives. H.R. 1759 and S. 2729 address specific issues related to the proposal. Doyle on March 26, 2009, proposed an allowance distribution scheme to assist energy-intensive industries at risk of carbon leakage. S. 2729, introduced by Senator Stabenow on November 4, 2009, includes comprehensive offset provisions as an alternative to other cap-and-trade proposals. Senators Kerry and Lieberman released a draft of new climate change legislation on May 12, 2010, with GHG reduction goals similar to H.R. 2454. The proposal includes a market-based cap-and-trade scheme for electric generators and industry, with allowances allocated to benefit energy consumers and low-income households. The Kerry-Lieberman proposal includes a market-based cap-and-trade scheme for electric generators and industry, with allowances allocated to benefit energy consumers and low-income households. The bill also contains other energy initiatives such as incentives for nuclear power, carbon capture and storage technology, and natural gas vehicles. H.R. 2454 was modified and offered as a \"Manager's Amendment\" on May 18, 2009, before beginning markup in the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The House passed H.R. 2454 on June 26, 2009. Senators Kerry and Boxer introduced S. 1733 on September 30, 2009, which was later amended and reported by Senator Boxer on November 5, 2009."
