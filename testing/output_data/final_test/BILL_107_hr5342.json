SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n(1) The term ``council'' refers to the community management council appointed under section 7.\n(2) The term ``demonstration project'' is for the Black Hills National Forest in South Dakota and Wyoming.\n(3) The term ``panel'' is the group of non-Federal scientists assembled by the Secretary under section 6.\n(4) The term ``Secretary'' is the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service. SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\nCongress finds that the Forest Service, responsible for the National Forest System, is plagued by ineffective public involvement, management inefficiency, and lengthy analyses. This has led to mistrust and divisiveness in forest policy, hindering resource management in the Black Hills National Forest. These issues require urgent attention to improve forest management and conditions in the area. The Act aims to increase community involvement in decision-making for the Black Hills National Forest, reform the Forest Service appeals process, enhance contracting mechanisms, and improve NEPA administration. Additionally, a demonstration forest management project is proposed for the Black Hills National Forest in South Dakota and Wyoming. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a demonstration project in the Black Hills National Forest to increase community involvement in decision-making and evaluate methods to improve forest management. The project will start after a phase 2 amendment to the forest's management plan and will last for 10 years. During the demonstration project in the Black Hills National Forest, the Secretary will manage the forest according to all applicable laws and regulations, except as provided in the Act. SEC. 6. INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC REVIEW AND MONITORING. The Secretary will assemble a panel of non-Federal scientists to assess the sustainability of the Black Hills National Forest in terms of ecological, social, and economic factors. The panel will use accepted measures to evaluate forest health, fire susceptibility, biodiversity, and the forest's ability to support communities and economies. A report with the assessment results must be submitted to the Secretary and Congress within one year. Additionally, the panel will develop a monitoring plan for a demonstration project. The panel will prepare a monitoring plan to track the demonstration project's implementation and assess its impacts on the Black Hills National Forest's sustainability. This assessment will include evaluating positive and negative effects on ecological, social, and economic aspects. SEC. 7. COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT COUNCIL. The Secretary will establish a community management council for the Black Hills National Forest to advise on environmental, economic, and social issues, as well as develop priorities for management activities. The council will consist of 13 members representing a diverse range of forest policy stakeholders. The Black Hills National Forest will establish a community management council with 13 members from specific counties in South Dakota and Wyoming. Members must be willing to compromise on forest issues and respect diverse values and cultures. The Forest Supervisor will serve as an ex officio member, and vacancies will be filled in the same manner as the original appointment. Members who are not federal employees will not receive compensation. The council members, excluding federal employees, will serve without compensation. The council may request staff assistance from the Secretary and must announce meetings in advance, keep records available for public inspection, and is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. SEC. 8. Predecisional review process for demonstration project. The Secretary will establish a predecisional review process for site-specific projects in the Black Hills National Forest. This process does not replace required environmental analysis and includes notice and review opportunities before final decisions are made. The Secretary will establish a predecisional review process for site-specific projects in the Black Hills National Forest, allowing individuals or entities who submitted written comments during the project preparation stage to request a review of proposed decisions. The review must be completed within 30 days before a final decision is issued. The Secretary may exempt proposed decisions responding to unexpected or serious events threatening human health, safety, or natural resources. The predecisional review process must be exhausted before challenging a site-specific project in court under the demonstration project. Deference to the Secretary's expert judgment in scientific data interpretation is required during predecisional review or litigation. This is related to Forest Service decision-making and appeals reform. Section 322 of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1993 does not apply to activities conducted under the demonstration project. SEC. 9. STEWARDSHIP CONTRACTING AUTHORITY.\n\nThe Secretary may enter into stewardship contracts for the Black Hills National Forest to achieve land management goals. These contracts are in addition to existing contracts authorized by previous Acts.\n\nSEC. 10. RETENTION OF DEMONSTRATION PROJECT RECEIPTS. During the demonstration project, the Secretary retains proceeds from timber sales and permit fees for the Black Hills National Forest. The funds are used for forest projects prioritizing health, restoration, fuels reduction, and species control. The Secretary consults with a council for project selection. During the demonstration project in the Black Hills National Forest, the Secretary must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and its rules. Rules for implementation must be established within 180 days, allowing flexibility for line officers and the council."
