    "content": "The \"Reduce Unnecessary Spending Act of 2010\" aims to establish a fast-track procedure for the President to submit rescission requests to Congress for an up-or-down vote without amendments. This Act also amends the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to expedite the consideration of proposed rescissions through specific rules and definitions. The terms in this section have specific meanings, such as 'appropriations Act', 'budget authority', 'new budget authority', 'account', 'current year', 'CBO', 'OMB', 'days of session', and 'entitlement law'. The calculation of days of session excludes weekends and national holidays, and certain rules apply when neither chamber of Congress is in session. The United States cannot incur a financial obligation without explicit funding appropriation. The terms 'funding', 'rescind', and 'withhold' have specific meanings related to budget authority and obligation limits. 'Withhold' refers to actions that prevent funding obligation. Preparatory actions taken before financial obligation in budget implementation. SEC. 1023. TIMING AND PACKAGING OF RESCISSION REQUESTS. The President must propose funding rescissions to Congress within 45 days of enactment, following specific procedures. Each legislation can only have one package of rescissions, which must be delivered to Congress when not in session. The transmittal message must be made publicly available. After specific legislative actions, the President can propose up to 2 packages of funding rescissions within 45 days. Each package must contain different funding cuts and cannot include the same rescission in both packages. If multiple funding cuts are requested from the same subcommittee, they must be included in the same package. \"SEC. 1024. REQUESTS TO RESCIND FUNDING.\" \"For each funding rescission request, the transmittal message must specify the dollar amount, agency, program, and reasons for the request. Each request must be numbered and include proposed legislative language.\" The requested rescissions must not include changes in existing law or supplemental appropriations, transfers, or reprogrammings. \"Grants of and limitations on presidential authority are outlined in Section 1025.\" Presidential authority to withhold funding under specific conditions is granted by OMB, with time limits provided. The President can only use these procedures once per funding Act. OMB must release withheld funding when it no longer serves the purpose of legislative consideration. The President can withhold funding under specific conditions for a limited time, with OMB oversight. The withheld funds must be used for deficit reduction or increasing the surplus. The Chairs of the Budget Committees must adjust budget levels within 5 days of an approval bill. The Budget Committees of the Senate and House must adjust budget levels to reflect repeal or cancellation, with revised suballocations reported by the applicable committees. \"Congressional consideration of rescission requests under SEC. 1026.\" The House of Representatives prepares a bill to rescind requested amounts in a package of expedited rescission requests. The bill includes all numbered rescission requests except those excluded by the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget. The House of Representatives, in consultation with relevant committees and agencies, determines if a rescission request is valid. The majority or minority leader must introduce a bill for expedited rescissions within a specific timeframe. The House committee of jurisdiction must report on an expedited rescission bill within 5 days of referral, without amendment. If the committee fails to report within this timeframe, it will be automatically discharged from further consideration of the bill. After a bill for expedited rescission is reported or committee discharged, a motion to proceed in the House can be made. If the Speaker doesn't set a time within 3 days, any Member can move to proceed. After a bill for expedited rescission is reported or discharged, a motion to proceed in the House can be made. If 5 calendar days of legislative session pass without a motion to proceed, the bill will be removed from the calendar. A bill for expedited rescission is considered as read, with waived points of order except for language not requested by the President. The previous question is ordered on the bill for passage without debate, except for 4 hours of debate. The House bill enacting rescissions is sent to the Senate committee of jurisdiction, which must report on it within 3 days of session without amendment. The committee can recommend the bill favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation. The Senate committee must report on the bill within 3 days, or it will be automatically discharged. After that, any Senator can move to proceed with the bill for debate, which is limited to 10 hours. The Senate debate on a bill is limited to 10 hours, with motions and appeals restricted to 1 hour. Amendments, striking provisions, and recommittal motions are not allowed. A Senate point of order prohibits consideration of a bill with rescissions not requested by the President. The bill may not be considered under this part if the subsection is sustained. Technical and conforming amendments are made to the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, specifically regarding expedited consideration of proposed rescissions. Amendments are made to the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, including sections on applicability, definitions, timing of rescission requests, presidential authority limitations, and congressional consideration. Temporary withholding is also addressed, along with rulemaking changes to the Congressional Budget Act. SEC. 4 of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 is amended to include a provision on severability in case parts B or C are found unconstitutional. SEC. 5 states that Part C of the Act will expire on December 31, 2014."
