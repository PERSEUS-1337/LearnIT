    "content": "The Department of Defense has increasingly relied on contractors to support troops since the end of the Cold War. Budget cuts led to hiring contractors to fill the gap in logistical and support personnel. In Iraq and Afghanistan, there were 200,000 DOD contractors compared to 180,000 military personnel in 2008. The Department of Defense has relied on contractors for support since the Cold War. In Iraq, DOD obligated $54 billion for contractors from 2003 to 2007, providing logistical and combat support. Civilian contractors may make up 50% of future DOD personnel. This raises questions about the military's force structure. The Department of Defense relies heavily on contractors for support, with concerns about managing them during operations. While DOD has an acquisition workforce, most are not deployed with the military during operations. As the number of contractors increases, military personnel are increasingly responsible for managing them, but many lack adequate information and training for this task. The military lacks sufficient training to effectively manage contractors in Iraq, as highlighted by the Gansler Report. Contacting Officer Representatives (CORs) receive little to no training on working with contractors, leading to concerns about the ability to oversee them. This is crucial due to the significant role contractors play in supporting military operations and the billions spent on them by the DOD. Inadequate contract management can have negative impacts on troops. Effective contractor management is crucial for the military, as poor oversight can lead to troops not receiving necessary support and wasteful spending. Inadequate management can also undermine the credibility and effectiveness of the U.S. military, as seen in incidents like Abu Ghraib. Experts suggest that the military needs to improve its coordination with contractors through increased training and education. The Gansler Report emphasized the need for increased training and education for non-acquisition personnel in the military, particularly operational commanders. It called for courses on contractors in expeditionary operations to be included in command schools and officer educational programs. The U.S. Army Materiel Command also stressed the importance of integrating contractor logistics support into doctrine and teaching it at all levels of professional schooling. Calls for more robust training have been ongoing, with the lack of contract training for commanders highlighted as a concern since 2003. The lack of contract training for commanders, senior personnel, and some contracting officers' representatives can adversely affect the effectiveness of the use of contractors in deployed locations. Congress amended the law to mandate training for non-acquisition military personnel with contracting responsibilities during expeditionary operations to ensure readiness. The Gansler Report recommendations were evaluated by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Army, with a report submitted to Congress detailing implementation plans. The GAO was tasked with analyzing DOD compliance with the amended section of Title X. Congress allocated funds for training programs to improve contractor coordination and management during expeditionary operations. Military services are responsible for training military forces, leading to debates on the implementation of training initiatives for contractor coordination. Expeditionary operations training initiatives led by DOD aim to integrate contract support and management. A roadmap was developed in 2008 for training officers in key contracting documents. Joint logistics doctrine has also been published to enhance coordination during operations. DOD is developing training courses for non-acquisition personnel and military leaders to integrate contractors into force plans and manage them during operations. Courses on Contingency Contract Management Training are being developed for Staff Colleges and Senior Staff Colleges, with plans to offer similar courses throughout the military's educational system in 2009. DOD is developing online courses for non-acquisition personnel to focus on pre-deployment training needs related to working with contractors during military operations. The Joint Contingency Acquisition Support Office (JCASO) was established to assist in planning and overseeing contingency contracting activities during the initial phases of a contingency operation. JCASO was tested in a military exercise in Germany in 2008, validating its concept and structure. It provides visibility on contracts and contractors to joint force commanders. DOD plans to integrate JCASO into future war games and exercises to improve mission planning and execution during expeditionary operations. The Army is improving program management during expeditionary operations by implementing initiatives based on the Gansler Report. This includes familiarizing the operational force with the importance of contracting support, educating and training individuals to better manage contractor support, and collectively training units at the brigade level and above. Army officials are conducting educational classes and seminars to emphasize the significance of contracted support. The Army is conducting classes and seminars to educate personnel on the importance of contracted support. Logisticians will receive training at various career levels, while non-logisticians will also have educational opportunities. Majors and attendees of the Army War College will have specific requirements, and selected generals will take a Senior Leader Course. Informational pamphlets and handbooks have been developed to aid military personnel in understanding the contracting process. The Army is developing a course on operational contract support to educate personnel on contracting responsibilities and skills. It will focus on tactical unit commanders and staff roles, teach how to create requirements packages, and integrate contractor personnel into military operations. The course will be taught at the Army Logistics Management College and made available to all Army personnel. Operations contract support has been incorporated into mission-readiness exercises. The Army has integrated operations contract support into mission-readiness exercises and is collaborating with the joint community to expand its use. During PANAMAX 2008, a military exercise focused on defending the Panama Canal, a Joint Contracting Command element was provided by the Army. The After Action Review highlighted the importance of contracting for mission success and recommended developing acquisition training programs for operational commanders. The report recommended training programs for operational commanders and establishing policies for managing contractors. DOD has taken steps to comply with the National Defense Authorization Act of FY2008, including incorporating contractor support scenarios into exercises. Congress may consider including contractor management in performance evaluations. Including contractor management in performance evaluations could help ensure attention is given to this issue for military personnel whose mission involves or relies on contractor support. Congress could consider requiring this as part of personnel management discussions or other related factors. This would be similar to requirements in the FY2009 Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act. The Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-417) mandates a report from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to Congress on joint education courses in the DOD. This report can help Congress oversee military progress in preparing for working with contractors during operations and maintain focus on this issue. Despite previous plans to create training courses on contracting, DOD only took concrete steps after Congress mandated training for non-acquisition military personnel. The DOD has made efforts to improve collaboration with contractors and integrate them into mission-readiness exercises. Analysts emphasize the need for sustained congressional attention to ensure desired outcomes."
