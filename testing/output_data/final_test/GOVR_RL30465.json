    "content": "President George W. Bush signed the USA PATRIOT Act in 2001, which impacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by expanding the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and allowing for roving electronic surveillance under FISA. The USA PATRIOT Act amended FISA provisions, expanding the reach of business records provisions and allowing for the production of tangible things with a FISA court order. It changed the certification required for electronic surveillance or physical search orders to include a significant foreign intelligence purpose. This amendment allows FISA to be used for investigations with a primary criminal purpose as long as a significant foreign intelligence purpose is present. Additionally, FISA now provides a private right of action for individuals affected by inappropriate use. The USA PATRIOT Act amended FISA provisions to allow for the production of tangible things with a FISA court order and expanded the reach of business records provisions. It also provided a private right of action for individuals affected by inappropriate use of information gathered through FISA surveillance. Amendments made by subsequent acts extended the sunset provisions of certain FISA provisions to later dates. In the 109th Congress, the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 and the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006 made significant changes to FISA, extending the duration of electronic surveillance and adding requirements to applications for sensitive records. It also created a new petition review pool within the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. In the 109th Congress, the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 and the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006 made significant changes to FISA, extending the duration of electronic surveillance and adding requirements to applications for sensitive records. It also created a new petition review pool within the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Additionally, P.L. 109-178 amended procedures for judicial review of production and nondisclosure orders under FISA, expanding congressional oversight of electronic surveillance and physical searches. In response to a letter from Senators Leahy, Grassley, and Specter, the FISC granted the Department of Justice's motion to vacate minimization and 'wall' procedures, releasing an unclassified opinion to the public. The FISC granted the Department of Justice's motion to modify minimization procedures in response to a letter from Senators. The Court of Review reversed and remanded FISC orders for electronic surveillance, marking its first public opinion since 1978. This report will discuss the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and review the decisions. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) addresses the tension between national security interests and privacy concerns. In the Supreme Court cases of Katz v. United States and United States v. United States District Court, the Court ruled on the extension of Fourth Amendment protections to electronic surveillance and the need for privacy in governmental incursions. The Keith Court addressed the issue of presidential power to authorize electronic surveillance without judicial approval, highlighting the importance of balancing government's need for security with citizens' right to privacy. The Keith Court emphasized the need for judicial approval in domestic security surveillance to protect citizens' privacy rights against unreasonable government intrusion. The Court did not address the scope of the President's surveillance power regarding foreign powers, but provided guidance that influenced Congress's approach to foreign intelligence surveillance. Surveillance for domestic security intelligence focuses on long-range prevention of unlawful activity and enhancing government preparedness for future crises. Congress may need to consider protective standards for domestic security surveillance distinct from surveillance for ordinary crime. Congress may need to establish protective standards for domestic security surveillance that differ from those for ordinary crime, ensuring they are reasonable in relation to the government's need for intelligence information and citizens' rights. This may include adjusting warrant application requirements, court authorization procedures, and time/reporting regulations to better suit domestic security cases. The court emphasizes the need for prior judicial approval for domestic surveillance, with standards set by Congress. Court decisions have addressed warrantless electronic surveillance in the context of foreign intelligence gathering. In various court cases, warrantless wiretaps for foreign intelligence purposes were upheld as legal, even when conversations of American citizens were incidentally overheard. Different circuits had varying opinions on the legality of warrantless electronic surveillance, with some allowing it if the primary purpose was gathering foreign intelligence information. The District of Columbia Circuit had a different view, stating that warrantless wiretaps of domestic organizations not linked to foreign powers may not be lawful. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) was passed to regulate electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes, striking a balance between national security interests and constitutional rights. FISA governs the collection of foreign intelligence information through electronic surveillance, ensuring that all warrantless surveillance is considered unconstitutional unless under exigent circumstances. Executive Order 12333 sets the broader context within which FISA operates, governing the collection, retention, and dissemination of information concerning United States persons within the Intelligence Community. The Executive Order 12333 governs the collection, retention, and dissemination of information concerning United States persons within the Intelligence Community. Information collected includes publicly available data, foreign intelligence, and information obtained during lawful investigations to protect safety. The Executive Order 12333 governs the collection, retention, and dissemination of information concerning United States persons within the Intelligence Community, including data related to international terrorism investigations, protection of safety, foreign intelligence sources, and lawful security investigations. The Executive Order 12333 governs the collection, retention, and dissemination of information within the Intelligence Community, including data related to international terrorism investigations, protection of safety, foreign intelligence sources, and lawful security investigations. Agencies are instructed to use the least intrusive collection techniques feasible and are not authorized to use techniques such as electronic surveillance or unconsented physical search. The Executive Order 12333 governs the use of surveillance techniques within the Intelligence Community, requiring approval from the Attorney General for methods like electronic surveillance. The Attorney General must determine probable cause before using these techniques against foreign powers or their agents. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978 governs electronic surveillance against foreign powers or their agents, providing a framework for obtaining foreign intelligence information. It also allows for the use of pen registers, trap and trace devices, and orders for tangible things in federal investigations related to foreign intelligence or international terrorism. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) establishes special courts to address applications for court orders authorizing electronic surveillance, physical searches, and other intelligence gathering activities. The Chief Justice of the United States designates eleven U.S. district court judges for this purpose. The U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) consists of eleven judges, three of whom must reside within 20 miles of the District of Columbia. The court has jurisdiction over applications for electronic surveillance, physical searches, and other intelligence activities under FISA. If an application is denied by one judge, it cannot be considered by another judge on the court. The Chief Justice also designates three judges for the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review, which reviews denials of orders under FISA. The Court of Review has jurisdiction to review denials of orders under FISA. If the United States appeals a FISC denial, the record must be transmitted to the Court of Review. The United States can petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court for review. All FISA proceedings must be conducted expeditiously and records maintained securely. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) and the Court of Review, consisting of judges designated by the presiding judge, have jurisdiction to review petitions challenging production orders and non-disclosure orders under FISA. They serve for seven-year terms and may establish rules and procedures as necessary. The FISC has established rules of procedure, while rules for the Court of Review are not identified. Any rules and procedures must be recorded and transmitted accordingly. The rules and procedures of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) and Court of Review must be recorded and transmitted to designated parties in an unclassified form. Electronic surveillance under FISA is typically conducted under an FISC order, with exceptions for certain foreign powers upon Attorney General certification. Subsection 506(a)(5) of P.L. 109-177 defines \"Attorney General\" as the top officials in the Department of Justice. The President, through the Attorney General, can authorize electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence without a court order if specific criteria are met. The Attorney General can authorize electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence without a court order if certain criteria are met, including the use of minimization procedures and reporting to congressional committees. The Attorney General can authorize electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence without a court order if certain criteria are met, including the use of minimization procedures and reporting to congressional committees. The surveillance must be conducted in accordance with the Attorney General's certification and minimization procedures, with a copy of the certification transmitted to the FISC. The Attorney General may direct a communications carrier to provide necessary assistance for the surveillance. The Attorney General can authorize electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence without a court order if certain criteria are met, including the use of minimization procedures and reporting to congressional committees. The carrier may be directed to provide technical assistance for the surveillance, with compensation provided by the Government. If authorized by the President, the Attorney General can approve applications to the FISC for court orders for electronic surveillance of a foreign power. The court may grant an order approving electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes under certain conditions, including the involvement of communications of a United States person. An application for such a court order can be sought under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1804. An application for a court order for electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1804 must be made by a federal officer to an FISC judge and approved by the Attorney General. The application must include the identity of the officer, authority from the President, target description, and justification for surveillance. The application for electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes must include details such as the facilities being targeted, proposed minimization procedures, nature of information sought, and certifications from designated officials. The application for electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes must include details such as the facilities being targeted, proposed minimization procedures, nature of information sought, certifications from designated officials, means of surveillance, previous applications history, and the time period for surveillance. The application for electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes must include details such as the facilities being targeted, proposed minimization procedures, nature of information sought, certifications from designated officials, means of surveillance, previous applications history, and the time period for surveillance. Additionally, the application should specify the period of time for which the surveillance is required, reasons for continued surveillance, and details on multiple surveillance devices and their minimization procedures. The application for electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes must include details such as the facilities being targeted, proposed minimization procedures, and certifications from designated officials. If the target is a foreign power and the facilities are owned, leased, or exclusively used by that foreign power, physical entry may be required for surveillance. The Attorney General must personally review the application if requested by specified officials. The Attorney General must personally review the application for electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. If the Attorney General determines that an application should not be approved, he must give written notice to the official requesting the review. The responsibility for such a determination may not be delegated unless the Attorney General is disabled or unavailable. Plans must be made in advance to ensure clear delegation of authority in case of disability or unavailability. The Attorney General must personally review and approve applications for electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. If the application is not approved, the Attorney General must provide notice of necessary modifications. The responsibility for supervising modifications is non-delegable, except in cases of disability. If a judge makes the required findings, an ex parte order approving the surveillance must be entered. The Attorney General must personally review and approve applications for electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. The application must show probable cause that the target is a foreign power or agent, and the facilities are being used by a foreign power. The proposed minimization procedures must meet the defined standards, and the application must contain all required statements and certifications. The application for electronic surveillance must contain all required statements and certifications under section 1804. The judge can consider past activities of the target when making a probable cause determination under section 1805(a)(3). Specifications and directions for FISA electronic surveillance orders are outlined in section 1805(c). The application for electronic surveillance must include details such as the nature and location of facilities, type of information sought, means of surveillance, approved time period, and minimization procedures for multiple surveillance devices. An order approving surveillance must direct the use of minimization procedures and compliance with requests. The order for electronic surveillance must ensure that minimization procedures are followed, and require specified persons to provide necessary assistance while maintaining secrecy and minimizing interference with their services. The order for electronic surveillance must ensure minimization procedures are followed and require specified persons to provide necessary assistance while maintaining secrecy. The applicant must compensate carriers, landlords, custodians, or other persons for furnishing aid. Special directions for certain orders include providing notice to the court within ten days of directing surveillance at any new facility or place. The applicant must justify the belief that the new facility is used by the target of surveillance, propose any necessary minimization procedures, and disclose the total number of surveillances conducted under the order. Changes in the law allow for \"multipoint\" or \"roving\" electronic surveillance to combat surveillance evasion tactics. The multipoint wiretap amendment to FISA in the USA PATRIOT Act allows the FISA court to issue generic orders of assistance to any communications provider, enabling immediate surveillance implementation if the target changes providers to evade surveillance. This change was aimed at individuals who try to avoid surveillance by switching wireless phone providers or using pay phones. The amendment to FISA in the USA PATRIOT Act allows for generic orders of assistance to be issued for multipoint wiretaps, enabling immediate surveillance implementation if the target changes providers to evade surveillance. The addition of the phrase \"if known\" clarifies the specification required for electronic surveillance in cases where the facility to be monitored is not known in advance. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) allows for electronic surveillance on facilities owned, leased, or exclusively used by a foreign power. The order must describe the information sought, type of surveillance used, and whether physical entry is required. Surveillance can be approved for the time needed or up to ninety days, unless targeting a foreign power or agent, in which case it can be approved for up to one year. An order under FISA for surveillance can be for the period specified in the order or 120 days, whichever is less. An extension of an order must include new findings and can be granted on the same basis as the original order. Extensions for surveillance targeted against certain foreign powers may have different time limits. An order for surveillance under FISA can be up to one year if targeting a non-U.S. person, with extensions allowed. Certifications and applications for electronic surveillance must be retained for at least ten years. Emergency situations can be addressed with electronic surveillance upon Attorney General certification. The Attorney General can authorize emergency electronic surveillance if an emergency situation exists before obtaining a court order, with compliance required for minimization procedures. An application for a court order must be made within 72 hours of the authorization. In emergency electronic surveillance, compliance with minimization procedures is required. Surveillance must end when information is obtained, application is denied, or after 72 hours from Attorney General's authorization. If no court order is issued, information gathered cannot be used in any legal proceedings without consent. Federal officers or employees can conduct electronic surveillance without consent if approved by the Attorney General in cases of threat of death or serious bodily harm. This surveillance is not targeted at any specific individual and is solely for testing equipment capabilities, with acquired communication contents used only for that purpose. Federal officers can conduct electronic surveillance without consent for testing equipment capabilities, with information disclosed only to test personnel and destroyed upon completion. Surveillance can exceed ninety days with Attorney General approval. Surveillance can also be used to determine unauthorized surveillance equipment or train intelligence personnel in equipment use. Training intelligence personnel in the use of electronic surveillance equipment is allowed without consent if it is necessary, limited in extent and duration, and no communication contents are retained. Section 1805(i) protects providers of communication services from legal action for providing information or technical assistance for surveillance. The disclosure of information acquired under FISA electronic surveillance for law enforcement purposes requires compliance with minimization procedures and prior authorization from the Attorney General to use in criminal proceedings. Information gathered through electronic surveillance under FISA must be handled according to statutory guidelines, including protection of privileged communications. The United States Government and State authorities must give prior notice to the aggrieved person and court before disclosing information acquired under FISA electronic surveillance in legal proceedings. Procedures for notification and court review are outlined in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1806. The district court follows specific procedures when an aggrieved person seeks to discover or obtain information related to FISA electronic surveillance. The Attorney General can file an affidavit to prevent disclosure if it would harm national security. The court's focus is on determining the lawfulness of the surveillance, and if it is found to be unlawful, the evidence must be suppressed. If surveillance was lawfully authorized and conducted, the motion of the aggrieved person must be denied except for due process requirements. Court orders granting motions for a determination that surveillance was not lawful are final and binding. Unintentionally acquired radio communication contents must be destroyed unless authorized by the Attorney General. The Attorney General must authorize the destruction of contents unless they indicate a threat. Emergency electronic surveillance under Section 1805 requires court approval promptly. If unsuccessful, notice must be served to U.S. persons named in the application. Postponement of notice for up to ninety days is allowed with good cause shown. The court allows postponement of notice for up to ninety days with good cause shown, and federal officers conducting FISA electronic surveillance can consult with law enforcement officers to coordinate efforts against foreign threats. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) allows for coordination between federal officers conducting electronic surveillance and law enforcement officers to combat foreign threats. Reporting requirements under FISA include annual reports on surveillance applications and orders, as well as semiannual briefings to congressional committees on electronic surveillance activities. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) mandates reporting to the Senate Judiciary Committee semiannually on electronic surveillance activities. Reports must include details on surveillance applications, criminal cases using surveillance information, and emergency surveillance orders. Section 1809 imposes criminal penalties for unauthorized electronic surveillance or disclosure of information obtained through surveillance. Section 1809 imposes criminal penalties for unauthorized electronic surveillance or disclosure of information obtained through surveillance, with Federal jurisdiction over such offenses if the defendant is a Federal officer or employee. Civil liability is also provided for violations of electronic surveillance laws under Section 1810. Section 1811 allows the President, through the Attorney General, to authorize electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 15 days following a declaration of war by Congress. Physical searches for foreign intelligence purposes are addressed in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821 et seq, with similar provisions to electronic surveillance. Definitions from 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801 also apply to foreign intelligence physical searches, with minimization procedures in place. Physical searches for foreign intelligence purposes are conducted under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(4) with minimization procedures to minimize acquisition and retention of nonpublicly available information concerning U.S. persons. The President, through the Attorney General, may authorize physical searches without a court order for up to one year if directed at certain foreign powers. The Attorney General must certify that physical searches for foreign intelligence purposes will not involve U.S. persons' information or property. Minimization procedures are in place to ensure compliance with the law. The Attorney General must report to congressional committees at least 30 days before implementing minimization procedures for foreign intelligence searches. Immediate action can be taken if necessary, with compliance assessments also reported. Certification for searches is sealed and transmitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The Director of National Intelligence certifies the legality of physical searches under specific circumstances, such as when an application is made to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or when needed to determine the legality of a search. The Attorney General can direct assistance from specified individuals to conduct physical searches while protecting secrecy and minimizing interference. The Attorney General can direct individuals to conduct physical searches while protecting secrecy and minimizing interference. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has jurisdiction over applications for physical searches, and if an application is denied, a written statement of reasons must be provided. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has jurisdiction over applications for physical searches. If an application is denied, a written statement of reasons must be provided and transmitted under seal to the court of review. Proceedings for a physical search under FISA must be conducted expeditiously and kept under appropriate security measures. The requirements for application for a physical search under FISA are similar to those for electronic surveillance. Section 1823(a)(7)(B) was amended to require certification that a significant purpose of a physical search is to obtain foreign intelligence information. Section 1823(d) parallels Section 1804(e) in requiring the Attorney General to personally review an application for a FISA physical search if requested by certain officials. U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(b)(2) pertains to targets engaging in clandestine intelligence activities involving violations of federal laws on behalf of a foreign power, sabotage, terrorism, aiding or conspiring in such activities, or entering the U.S. under false identity for a foreign power. The Attorney General must review applications for physical searches for foreign intelligence information under Section 1823. If the application is not approved, written notice must be provided with suggested modifications. The responsibilities under Section 1823 are non-delegable, and certain findings by the FISC judge are required before authorizing a physical search. Under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1824(a), an FISC judge must approve physical searches for foreign intelligence purposes based on specific findings, including authorization by the President and the Attorney General, probable cause regarding the target being a foreign power or agent, and the premises being connected to a foreign power. The FISC judge must approve physical searches for foreign intelligence purposes under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1824(a), based on specific findings including authorization by the President and the Attorney General, probable cause regarding the target being a foreign power or agent, and the premises being connected to a foreign power. The proposed minimization procedures must meet the defined criteria, and the application must contain all required statements and certifications. The judge may consider the target's past activities and relevant facts when making a probable cause determination. An order approving a physical search under FISA must specify the target's identity or description, the location of the premises to be searched, the type of information to be seized, the manner of the search, and the approved period of time. The order must also direct the use of minimization procedures. The order approving a physical search under FISA must specify the target's identity, location of premises, type of information to be seized, search manner, and approved time period. Additionally, the order must direct the use of minimization procedures and require the applicant to provide necessary assistance while maintaining secrecy and compensating for aid. The federal officer must promptly report the circumstances and results of a physical search to the court. Subsection 1824(d) sets limits on search duration and allows for extensions. Subsection 1824(e) deals with emergency orders for physical searches, allowing the Attorney General to authorize a search under certain circumstances, with an application to the FISC judge required within 72 hours. The Attorney General can authorize an emergency physical search for foreign intelligence information if there is no judicial order in place. The search must follow minimization procedures and terminate once the information is obtained, the order is denied, or after 72 hours. The Attorney General can authorize emergency physical searches for foreign intelligence information without a judicial order. If the search is denied or terminated without approval, any information obtained cannot be used as evidence. Approval from the Attorney General is required for disclosure if the information indicates a threat of harm. The application made under this subsection may be reviewed as provided in section 302 [50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1822]. Subsection 1824(f) requires retention of applications and orders granted under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821 et seq. for a minimum of ten years. Information secured under a FISA physical search can only be used or disclosed by Federal officers for lawful purposes, with compliance to minimization procedures for information concerning a United States person. If a physical search involving a US person's residence is authorized under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1824, the Attorney General can determine if there is no national security interest in continuing the search. The Attorney General must notify the United States person whose residence was searched under FISA, including details of any seized property. Information obtained from a FISA physical search can only be used in a criminal proceeding with authorization. Disclosure or use of information from a FISA physical search is subject to similar notice requirements as electronic surveillance. The United States must give notice to an aggrieved person and the court before using information from a FISA physical search in legal proceedings. Similarly, a State or political subdivision must notify the aggrieved person, relevant authorities, and the Attorney General before using such information in legal proceedings. An aggrieved person may move to suppress evidence obtained from a FISA physical search if unlawfully acquired or not in conformity with the authorization. The United States district court may conduct an in camera, ex parte review upon receiving notice or a motion to suppress. The Attorney General may file an affidavit under oath to prevent disclosure of any adversary hearing that could harm U.S. national security in relation to a motion or request made under federal or state law to discover or obtain materials from a FISA physical search. The U.S. district court may review the application and order in camera and ex parte to determine the lawfulness of the physical search. The U.S. district court may disclose portions of the application, order, or other materials to the aggrieved person under security procedures if necessary to determine the legality of a search. If the search was unlawful, evidence obtained must be suppressed, but if lawful, the motion will be denied unless due process requires disclosure. The U.S. district court's final orders regarding FISA physical searches are binding on all federal and state courts except the U.S. Court of Appeals or the U.S. Supreme Court. In cases of emergency physical searches, notice must be served to relevant individuals, and disclosure of information may be postponed. The U.S. district court's final orders on FISA physical searches are binding on all federal and state courts except the U.S. Court of Appeals or the U.S. Supreme Court. Notice for emergency physical searches must be given, and disclosure of information can be delayed for up to 90 days with court approval. Consultation by federal officers conducting FISA searches with federal or state law enforcement officers is allowed under certain circumstances. Under the amended language, federal officers conducting physical searches for foreign intelligence information may coordinate with federal, state, or local law enforcement to investigate or protect against attacks, sabotage, terrorism, or clandestine intelligence activities by foreign powers or their agents. This coordination does not negate the certification or court orders required under FISA, with semiannual congressional oversight provided. The Attorney General must inform congressional intelligence committees about all physical searches conducted under FISA, provide reports on applications and orders for FISA physical searches, and disclose details on searches involving US persons and emergency searches. The Attorney General must report all physical searches conducted under FISA to congressional intelligence committees, including details on applications, orders, and searches involving US persons. Section 1827 imposes criminal penalties for unauthorized physical searches for intelligence gathering purposes, including fines up to $10,000 and imprisonment for up to five years. Federal jurisdiction applies when the offense is committed by a US officer or employee. It is a defense if the search was authorized by a court order. An aggrieved person can bring a civil action for damages if their property was searched under FISA. The President can authorize searches in times of war. In times of war, the President can authorize physical searches under FISA without a court order for up to 15 days. Title IV of FISA was added in 1998 and amended multiple times. The Attorney General can apply for an order to use a pen register or trap and trace device for investigations related to terrorism or intelligence activities, as long as it does not violate the first amendment rights of a US person. The FBI conducts activities protected by the first amendment under guidelines approved by the Attorney General. Applications for pen registers or trap and trace devices must be approved by a designated judge and the Attorney General. Each application must identify the federal officer and certify the relevance of the information to be obtained. Under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1842, pen registers and trap and trace devices can be used for tracking electronic communications like email in investigations related to international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. A judge must approve the installation and use of these devices through an ex parte order if the application meets the requirements of the section. The installation and use of pen registers or trap and trace devices can be authorized for up to 90 days, with possible extensions. In cases involving foreign intelligence information, the authorization can be up to one year. Section 1842(f) protects providers of communication services from legal action for cooperating with orders. Section 1843 of Title 18 focuses on authorization for installation. Section 1843 of Title 18 of the United States Code authorizes the installation and use of pen registers or trap and trace devices under FISA during emergencies for obtaining foreign intelligence information or protecting against terrorism, with safeguards to prevent investigations solely based on First Amendment activities. The Attorney General may authorize the installation and use of a pen register or trap and trace device under Section 1842(c) if certain criteria are met, including informing a judge and applying for a court order within 48 hours. If a pen register or trap and trace device is authorized, it must be terminated when the information is obtained, the application is denied, or 48 hours after the Attorney General's emergency authorization. If denied, no information obtained can be used in any legal proceedings. The use of a pen register or trap and trace device requires authorization and must be terminated once the information is obtained or the application is denied. Information acquired cannot be used in legal proceedings if the application is denied. Additionally, information concerning a United States person acquired from the use of these devices cannot be used or disclosed without consent, except in cases of threat of death or serious bodily harm, or during a declared war where the President can authorize their use for up to 15 days for foreign intelligence information. Federal officers and employees can only use information obtained from a pen register or trap and trace device under FISA for lawful purposes. Disclosure for law enforcement purposes requires authorization from the Attorney General. Information acquired from these devices cannot be used in legal proceedings if the application is denied. When using information from a FISA pen register or trap and trace device in federal trials, notice requirements must be met by the Government to the aggrieved person and the court. State or local governments must also give notice if using such information in their trials, and notify the Attorney General of the United States. District Court considers motions to suppress evidence obtained from a FISA pen register or trap and trace device. The Attorney General may have national security concerns regarding disclosure of information related to the use of such devices. The United States district court may review in camera and ex parte the application, order, and relevant materials to determine the lawfulness of using a pen register or trap and trace device. If unauthorized, the court can suppress the unlawfully obtained evidence. The court may suppress unlawfully obtained evidence from a pen register or trap and trace device. Final orders on the use of these devices are binding on all federal and state courts except U.S. courts of appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court. Congressional oversight of FISA pen registers and trap and trace devices is covered in Section 1846. The Attorney General must inform various congressional committees semiannually about the use of FISA pen registers and trap and trace devices, including the number of applications, orders granted, and emergency authorizations. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded the reach of FISA Section 1861, allowing the FBI to apply for orders to obtain tangible things for foreign intelligence and terrorism investigations. The Act was modified by several laws, including P.L. 107-56, P.L. 107-108, P.L. 109-177, and P.L. 109-178. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded FISA Section 1861 to allow the FBI to obtain tangible things for foreign intelligence and terrorism investigations. Subsection 1861(a)(2) requires investigations to be conducted under approved guidelines and prohibits targeting individuals based solely on First Amendment protected activities. Subsection 1861(a)(3) added by P.L. 109-177 allows for the production of library records under certain conditions. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded FISA Section 1861 to allow the FBI to obtain tangible things for foreign intelligence and terrorism investigations. An application for an order under Section 1861 must be made to an FISC judge or a U.S. magistrate judge designated by the Chief Justice of the United States. The application must show reasonable grounds to believe that the tangible things contain relevant information. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded FISA Section 1861 to allow the FBI to obtain tangible things for foreign intelligence and terrorism investigations. An application for an order under Section 1861 must show reasonable grounds to believe that the tangible things sought are relevant to an authorized investigation. If the judge finds the application meets the requirements, an ex parte order is entered approving the release of tangible things with minimization procedures to be followed. The order must describe the tangible things to be produced with sufficient particularity and include a deadline for their provision. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded FISA Section 1861 to allow the FBI to obtain tangible things for foreign intelligence and terrorism investigations. An order under Section 1861 must include a date for providing tangible things, notice of nondisclosure requirements, and must not disclose the investigation's purpose. Disclosure of FBI's request for tangible things is prohibited except to those involved in production. The disclosure of tangible things under FISA Section 1861 is restricted to individuals involved in production, attorneys for legal advice, or as permitted by the FBI Director. Recipients of such disclosures must adhere to nondisclosure requirements and may not waive any privilege by producing tangible things. Liability is waived for those who produce tangible things in good faith under Section 1861 orders. The recipient of a production order under FISA Section 1861 can challenge the legality of the order by filing a petition with the FISC petition review pool. They must wait at least one year to challenge the nondisclosure order imposed with the production order. The presiding judge must review the petition within 72 hours, and if deemed frivolous, it will be dismissed immediately. If a petition challenging a production order under FISA Section 1861 is not deemed frivolous by the assigned judge within 72 hours, it will be considered under established procedures. An order setting aside a nondisclosure order may be stayed pending review by the Court of Review. A petition to modify or set aside a production order can only be granted if the judge finds it unlawful. If not modified, the judge must affirm the order and order compliance. A petition to modify or set aside a nondisclosure order can only be granted if it does not endanger national security, interfere with investigations, diplomatic relations, or endanger lives. Certification by specified officials will be conclusive unless made in bad faith. If denied, the recipient cannot file another petition. If a petition to modify or set aside a nondisclosure order is denied, the recipient cannot file another petition for one year. A production or nondisclosure order not explicitly modified remains in full effect. The Court of Review can review decisions on such orders, with reasons provided for the record. Judicial proceedings under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861(f) must be concluded promptly, with records maintained securely. The security measures for maintaining petitions under Subsection 1861(f) involve ex parte and in camera review of classified information by the court. The Attorney General must adopt minimization procedures for retention and dissemination of information obtained by the FBI. Information acquired from tangible things concerning any U.S. person may be used and disclosed. Information acquired from tangible things pursuant to an order under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861 concerning any U.S. person may be used and disclosed by federal officers and employees only in accordance with minimization procedures. Privileged information retains its character, and can only be used for lawful purposes. Congressional oversight is addressed in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1862, requiring the Attorney General to inform relevant committees annually. The Attorney General is required to report annually to Congress on the total number of applications for orders for the production of tangible things under Section 1861, including specific types of records such as library circulation records, firearms sales records, tax return records, educational records, and medical records containing identifying information. Additionally, an unclassified report must be submitted on the total number of applications made for such orders under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1862. The Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Justice is directed to audit the effectiveness and use of investigative authority under FISA for fiscal years 2002-2006. Reports are to be submitted to various congressional committees. Additional reporting requirements were created under the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The new language mandates semiannual reporting to key congressional committees on the number of persons targeted for surveillance orders under FISA, including breakdowns for different types of surveillance. Additionally, it requires reporting on the number of individuals covered by orders and the authorization of information by the Attorney General. The USA PATRIOT Act mandates semiannual reporting to congressional committees on FISA surveillance targets, including breakdowns for different types of surveillance, individuals covered by orders, and authorization of information by the Attorney General. It also requires reporting on legal interpretations and decisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The USA PATRIOT Act amended FISA and created new provisions related to FISA. It included a private right of action for violations of certain sections of FISA, allowing for monetary damages to be sought in U.S. district court. The Act also set a sunset date for many provisions, except for the increase in FISC judges. The USA PATRIOT Act amended FISA, creating new provisions and setting a sunset date for many sections. Section 224 was repealed by the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, increasing the number of FISC judges. Certain FISA sections were set to sunset on December 31, 2009, but exceptions were made for ongoing investigations or offenses. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 expanded the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" to include individuals involved in international terrorism. The \"lone wolf\" terrorist provision is set to expire on December 31, 2009, with exceptions for ongoing investigations or offenses. The FISC considered vacating minimization and 'wall' procedures in cases before the court. The FISC granted the DOJ's motion with modifications to proposed minimization procedures, requiring the continuation of the Attorney General's 1995 procedures and the preservation of a \"wall\" procedure to separate FBI criminal activities. The FISC approved the DOJ's motion with modifications to minimization procedures, emphasizing the need to maintain a \"wall\" between FBI criminal investigators and DOJ prosecutors to prevent collaboration in FISA surveillances. The FISC expressed concerns about allowing law enforcement to control FISA surveillance for law enforcement objectives rather than foreign intelligence gathering, citing past instances of false information in FISA applications. The FISC expressed dissatisfaction with past instances of false information in FISA applications and violations of orders regarding information sharing and dissemination. The FBI and DOJ had been investigating these incidents for over a year without providing explanations for the misrepresentations. The court's analysis was based on statutory language and the fact that the USA PATRIOT Act did not amend FISA's minimization requirements. The FISC noted that the minimization provisions under FISA had not been amended, despite other provisions being modified. The court applied a standard mandated by the statute to evaluate proposed procedures, emphasizing the need to minimize acquisition and retention of information on unconsenting US persons. The court also discussed its jurisdiction in the memorandum opinion. The FISC concluded that its jurisdiction is limited to granting FISA orders for electronic surveillance and physical searches for collecting foreign intelligence information, as supported by relevant provisions of the act and executive orders. The FISC focused on interpreting minimization procedures in the context of FISA authorizing electronic surveillance and physical searches for foreign intelligence purposes, not primarily for law enforcement. It emphasized that its findings on minimization apply to communications involving U.S. persons. The FISC approved minimization procedures for U.S. persons in electronic surveillance and physical searches, excluding foreign powers and non-U.S. persons. It also reviewed supplementary minimization procedures adopted by the Attorney General regarding intelligence sharing procedures. The FISC reviewed minimization procedures for U.S. persons in electronic surveillance and physical searches to minimize acquisition and dissemination of nonpublic information concerning unconsenting U.S. persons. The procedures were measured against the standard set forth in relevant statutes. The FISC reviewed minimization procedures for U.S. persons in electronic surveillance and physical searches to minimize acquisition and dissemination of nonpublic information concerning unconsenting individuals. The court relied on the Attorney General's procedures for FBI contacts in foreign intelligence investigations, allowing consultation with the Criminal Division for reporting federal crimes in FISA cases and providing guidance without directing the investigation towards law enforcement objectives. The Criminal Division may consult with the U.S. Attorney's Office on FISA cases, FBI provides monthly briefings to Justice Department officials on intelligence cases, FBI reports on counterintelligence investigations now include identifying federal criminal violations, FISA requests must identify possible federal criminal violations. The FISC routinely approved information screening 'walls' in FISA applications to prevent the use of surveillance for criminal investigations. OIPR's presence in FBI-Criminal Division meetings for FISA cases has been suspended since September 11, 2001. The FISC was advised of numerous errors in FISA applications related to information sharing and unauthorized dissemination to criminal investigators. The court implemented supervisory measures to address compliance with \"wall\" procedures and the government sought to eliminate these procedures in international terrorism surveillances and physical searches under FISA. The FISC approved new 2002 procedures proposed by the Attorney General for cases involving overlapping investigations and interests in international terrorism surveillances under FISA. The FISC approved 2002 proposed minimization procedures for overlapping investigations involving international terrorism surveillances under FISA, allowing extensive consultations between the FBI and criminal prosecutors. Prosecutors would have access to all information developed in FBI counterintelligence investigations, including through FISA. The FISC approved proposed minimization procedures for overlapping investigations involving international terrorism surveillances under FISA, allowing consultations between FBI and criminal prosecutors. Prosecutors would have access to all information developed in FBI counterintelligence investigations, including through FISA, to enhance criminal investigation and prosecution. The FISC approved procedures giving criminal prosecutors a significant role in directing FISA surveillances and searches in cases involving international terrorism. The court found the proposed procedures aimed at enhancing law enforcement purposes rather than obtaining foreign intelligence information as mandated by FISA. The FISC rejected procedures allowing criminal prosecutors to direct FISA surveillances and searches in cases of international terrorism, stating it would prioritize law enforcement objectives over obtaining foreign intelligence information as required by FISA. The 2002 minimization procedures allow criminal prosecutors to instruct the FBI on FISA use for U.S. persons, including surveillance techniques and evidence collection, without notifying the target unless arrested. This is done to minimize collection of U.S. person information while obtaining foreign intelligence. The court found proposed minimization procedures inconsistent with statutory standards for obtaining foreign intelligence information. Substituted language allowed consultation between FBI, DOJ's Criminal Division, and OIPR to coordinate efforts in investigating foreign attacks, terrorism, or clandestine intelligence. The substitute language allowed consultation between FBI, DOJ's Criminal Division, and OIPR to coordinate efforts in investigating foreign attacks, terrorism, or clandestine intelligence, while prohibiting law enforcement officials from directing or controlling FISA procedures for criminal prosecution. The substitute language allowed consultation between FBI, DOJ's Criminal Division, and OIPR to coordinate efforts in investigating foreign attacks, terrorism, or clandestine intelligence. OIPR had to be invited to all consultations, and if unable to attend, be informed in writing. The FISC approved modified minimization procedures for future electronic surveillances and physical searches under FISA, with a new administrative rule for compliance monitoring. Rule 11 required FISA applications to include descriptions of ongoing criminal investigations of FISA targets and consultations between the FBI and criminal prosecutors. The Department of Justice sought review in the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review of an FISC order authorizing electronic surveillance of a foreign power agent with restrictions. The Court of Review's analysis focused on surveillance, with broader implications for FISA. In a first-ever decision, the Court of Review reversed and remanded the FISC's decision in a lengthy opinion issued on November 18, 2002. The Court of Review reversed and remanded the FISC orders, emphasizing the May 17th decision as the basis for their ruling. They concluded that FISA, as amended by the Patriot Act, supported the government's position and that the restrictions imposed by the FISC were not required by FISA or the Constitution. The Court of Review disagreed with the FISC's interpretation of FISA, stating that the FISC did not provide relevant statutory language to support its assumption of a barrier between intelligence and law enforcement. The Court of Review highlighted that the FISC's reliance on \"minimization procedures\" was not sufficient to justify its restrictions on electronic surveillance applications. The Court of Review disagreed with the FISC's interpretation of FISA, stating that the FISC did not provide relevant statutory language to support its assumption of a barrier between intelligence and law enforcement. The government raised arguments regarding the restrictions imposed by the FISC, including the contention that the primary purpose test for using FISA was not supported by the statutory language or legislative history. The government also argued that the amendments made by the USA PATRIOT Act eliminated the concept of the primary purpose test. The government argued that the FISC's interpretation of the minimization procedures provisions was incorrect and went against the USA PATRIOT Act amendments. They also contended that the FISC's procedures exceeded the constitutional authority of Article III judges. Additionally, the government stated that the primary purpose test in a FISA case was not constitutionally required under the Fourth Amendment. The Court of Review noted that FISA allowed electronic surveillance if there was probable cause to believe the target was a foreign power or agent, and the facilities were being used for intelligence purposes. The reviewing court focused on the connection between criminal activity and the definitions of \"agent of a foreign power\" under FISA, which includes engaging in clandestine intelligence activities involving violations of US criminal laws, sabotage, or international terrorism. FISA defines \"international terrorism\" as violent or dangerous acts that violate US or state criminal laws. The Court of Review focused on the connection between criminal activity and the definitions of \"agent of a foreign power\" under FISA, which includes engaging in clandestine intelligence activities involving violations of US criminal laws, sabotage, or international terrorism. FISA covers activities that involve violations of criminal laws or would involve such violations if committed against the United States. The court stated that it is virtually impossible to exclude the prosecution of foreign intelligence crimes from the purpose of electronic surveillance under FISA. The Court of Review found that the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" under FISA includes engaging in criminal conduct, with support from legislative history. The court viewed FISA surveillances as primarily for obtaining foreign intelligence information, not for gathering evidence of a crime. The decision in United States v. Truong Dinh Hung was seen as the basis for interpreting the \"primary purpose\" test cases under FISA. The Court of Review interpreted FISA provisions and upheld FISA surveillances against Fourth Amendment challenges. They found that FISA did not limit the government's use of foreign intelligence information in criminal prosecutions. The Court also determined that FISA did not require the [FISC] to inquire into the government's purpose in seeking foreign intelligence information. The FISC rejected the characterization of the Attorney General's procedures as minimization procedures and adopted new \"Intelligence Sharing Procedures\" in March 2002 to allow complete exchange of information between intelligence and law enforcement officials. The FISC adopted new \"Intelligence Sharing Procedures\" in March 2002 to allow complete exchange of information between intelligence and law enforcement officials. The government filed a motion with the FISC seeking to adopt 2002 procedures in all matters and vacate prior orders. The FISC decision to adopt the 2002 procedures with modifications was referenced in the Court of Review's November 18, 2002 decision. The FISA court erred by imposing Attorney General's 1995 Procedures as minimization procedures without a constitutional basis. The Court of Review interpreted \"minimization procedures\" to protect against the acquisition of nonpublic information not related to foreign intelligence. This interpretation contradicted the FISC's reliance on the procedures. The Court of Review found that the FISC had misconstrued its authority under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1805 and misinterpreted the definition of minimization procedures under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(h), expressing concern that the FISC may have exceeded constitutional bounds in imposing modified 1995 procedures on the Department of Justice. The Court of Review criticized the FISC for not considering the legal significance of the Patriot Act's amendments, specifically changing the requirement for FISA surveillance to have \"a significant purpose\" instead of \"the purpose.\" This change was seen to blur the lines between law enforcement and foreign intelligence gathering, making it easier for law enforcement to obtain FISA court orders. The Court of Review criticized the FISC for not considering the legal significance of the Patriot Act's amendments, specifically changing the requirement for FISA surveillance to have \"a significant purpose\" instead of \"the purpose.\" This change blurred the lines between law enforcement and foreign intelligence gathering, making it easier for law enforcement to obtain FISA court orders. The court disagreed with the FISC interpretation of the consultation authority under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1806(k), seeing it as reflecting the elimination of barriers between law enforcement and intelligence or counterintelligence. The Court of Review criticized the FISC for not considering the legal significance of the Patriot Act's amendments, specifically changing the requirement for FISA surveillance to have \"a significant purpose\" instead of \"the purpose.\" This change blurred the lines between law enforcement and foreign intelligence gathering, making it easier for law enforcement to obtain FISA court orders. The court found that the term \"significant\" imposed a measurable foreign intelligence purpose, other than just criminal prosecution. The Court of Review interpreted the Patriot Act's amendments to FISA, stating that the FISA court can review the government's purpose in seeking information, excluding a sole objective of criminal prosecution. As long as the government has other options besides prosecution, it satisfies the significant purpose test. The Court of Review's analysis found that the government's purpose in seeking information under FISA must go beyond solely criminal prosecution. If the purpose includes broader objectives like stopping ongoing conspiracies and non-prosecutorial responses, the government meets the statutory test. The FISA process cannot be used to investigate wholly unrelated ordinary crimes, and the government's purpose is judged by the FISC based on the national security officer's articulation. The FISC determines the government's national security purpose based on the national security officer's articulation, not through an inquiry into the investigation's origins. The Director of the FBI certifies the purpose, approved by the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General. If the FISA court doubts the government's non-prosecutorial purpose, further inquiry can be demanded into the certifying officer's or senior officials' reasons for approval. The focus is on the senior officials in the Executive Branch responsible for assessing national security needs. The Court of Review compared FISA procedures with those for criminal investigations, citing the three criteria for a valid warrant under the Fourth Amendment. The Court of Review compared FISA procedures with those for criminal investigations, noting differences in standards and safeguards. Title III requires probable cause for a specific criminal offense, while FISA requires probable cause for a foreign power or agent of a foreign power. The definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" under FISA includes involvement in clandestine intelligence activities for a foreign power, possibly involving criminal conduct. FISA requires probable cause to believe the target is acting for a foreign power, and specific designation of the type of foreign intelligence information being sought. The FISA investigation targets foreign intelligence information. For U.S. persons, the FISC reviews for clear error in certification, not probable cause. The government must provide additional information if needed. Certification must be made by a national security officer and approved by the Attorney General. Title III requires probable cause for surveillance related to criminal activity. FISA requires less nexus between facility and communications compared to Title III, but more nexus between target and communications. Court of Review compared both statutes on necessity, duration of surveillance, minimization, and notice. The Court of Review compared Title III and FISA on minimization requirements. FISA mandates minimization of acquired, retained, and disseminated information, while Title III focuses on minimizing interception of communications not subject to interception. The Court noted that FISA surveillance devices are often left on continuously, with minimization occurring during indexing and logging of communications. The reasonableness of less minimization during acquisition depends on the circumstances, such as ambiguous or coded language in intercepted communications. The Court of Review compared Title III and FISA on minimization requirements, noting that FISA mandates minimization of acquired, retained, and disseminated information, while Title III focuses on minimizing interception of communications not subject to interception. FISA surveillance often involves coded language and complex plots, requiring extensive surveillance to determine the scope of the enterprise. FISA does not require notice to a person whose communications were intercepted unless the government intends to. The Court of Review noted that notice is not required for intercepted communications under FISA unless they will be used in legal proceedings. Congress has justified this lack of notice to protect sensitive counterintelligence sources. The difference in notice between Title III and FISA was also highlighted. Under Title III, a defendant can challenge the legality of surveillance by obtaining the application and order. However, under FISA, the government must notify the aggrieved person and the court before disclosing or using communications obtained from surveillance. The U.S. district court may review materials related to the surveillance in camera and ex parte if the Attorney General files an affidavit stating that disclosure would harm national security. The Court of Review compared Title III and FISA, noting that determinations on surveillance legality are made on a case by case basis by U.S. district judges. They found that FISA orders may not align with Fourth Amendment requirements in certain areas. The court questioned whether FISA, as amended by the Patriot Act, strikes a balance between government intelligence needs and citizen rights. The Court of Review analyzed whether FISA aligns with Fourth Amendment requirements and balances government intelligence needs with citizen rights. They questioned if FISA amplifies the President's power and discussed the Truong case's relevance in warrantless searches for foreign intelligence. The Court of Review found that in the context of criminal prosecution, foreign policy concerns do not recede, and the government's primary purpose in counterintelligence is to halt espionage or terrorism efforts. Criminal prosecutions are interrelated with other techniques used to frustrate foreign power's efforts. The court criticized the FISA court's method of determining when an investigation became primarily criminal, stating it led to organizational confusion and discouraged cooperation. The court also found the primary purpose test administered by the FISC to be at odds with Fourth Amendment cases. The Court of Review examined the constitutionality of warrantless government searches for foreign intelligence purposes, considering the balance between government interests and personal privacy. They referenced the Keith case and \"special needs\" cases where searches without warrants were upheld in extraordinary circumstances. In City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a highway checkpoint program aimed at catching drug dealers did not qualify under the \"special needs\" exception for searches without individualized suspicion. The Court emphasized that the primary purpose of the program must be considered, not just the gravity of the threat. It was noted that a properly tailored roadblock could be used to prevent a terrorist attack. The Court of Review emphasized the nature of the threat in the case of Edmond, stating that the gravity of the threat is a critical factor in analyzing the reasonableness of a search under the Fourth Amendment. It highlighted the programmatic purpose of FISA to protect against terrorism and espionage threats from foreign powers, which is distinct from ordinary crime control. The Court also discussed the procedures and government showings required under FISA in relation to Fourth Amendment warrant standards. The Court of Review held that surveillances under FISA, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, were reasonable and constitutional, despite the lack of a definitive answer on the Fourth Amendment issue. Comparing wiretapping to random stops, the Court acknowledged the greater intrusion of wiretapping into personal privacy. The Court of Review reversed the FISC's orders for electronic surveillance, vacated the FISA court's Rule 11, and instructed to grant the applications as submitted. The United States can file a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court if the FISC denies a FISA application. There is no provision for an appeal to the Supreme Court from a decision of the Court of Review by anyone other than the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court denied a motion to intervene and file a petition for a writ of certiorari in a case related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The motion to file an amicus curiae brief was also denied. The Act provides guidelines for electronic surveillance, physical searches, and pen registers or trap and trace devices. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) allows for electronic surveillance, physical searches, and the use of pen registers or trap and trace devices for foreign intelligence gathering purposes. It provides procedural protections for U.S. persons and less stringent standards for surveillance involving foreign powers. The USA PATRIOT Act increased the number of FISC judges and expanded FISA's scope. The PATRIOT Act, P.L. 107-56, expanded FISA's electronic surveillance and physical search capabilities by increasing FISC judges to 11. It allowed surveillance if \"a significant purpose\" is to gather foreign intelligence, rather than \"the purpose\" or \"the primary purpose.\" The constitutionality of these changes under the Fourth Amendment is still pending Supreme Court review. The Court of Review found that FISA orders, even if not fully meeting the warrant requirement, are close to doing so. The USA PATRIOT Act amended FISA to allow roving electronic surveillance without specific identification requirements, as long as the court determines the target's actions may thwart identification. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded surveillance authority under FISA, allowing for pen registers and trap and trace devices for emails and phone conversations. It also granted access to business records for foreign intelligence investigations. FISA, as amended, provides broader protections for targets of investigative techniques. The USA PATRIOT Act amended FISA to expand surveillance authority, including pen registers, trap and trace devices, and access to business records for foreign intelligence investigations. It also created a new private right of action for individuals affected by inappropriate disclosure of information from surveillance. The inclusion of a sunset provision allows for review and utilization of the new authorities. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 amended FISA to allow federal officers conducting surveillance to consult with law enforcement personnel at the state level to coordinate efforts in investigating or protecting against foreign threats. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 amended FISA to allow federal officers to consult with state law enforcement in investigating foreign threats. Section 6001 of Title VI of FISA expanded the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" to include those involved in international terrorism. The USA PATRIOT Act, as amended, includes a new definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" to encompass individuals involved in international terrorism. The Act also imposes detailed reporting requirements for congressional oversight and sets a sunset date of December 31, 2009, for certain FISC orders under FISA. Section 103 of P.L. 109-177 extended the sunset date for \"lone wolf\" agents of foreign powers to December 31, 2009. Section 105 extended the duration of initial orders for electronic surveillances and physical searches to 120 days, with extensions up to one year. The duration for orders authorizing FISA pen registers or trap and trace devices was extended to one year for foreign intelligence information not concerning a U.S. person. Section 106(a) allowed the FBI Director to delegate authority for production orders regarding library circulation. Section 106(b) of P.L. 109-177 allows the FBI Director to delegate authority for a FISA production order, requiring a statement of facts supporting the relevance to an authorized investigation for obtaining foreign intelligence information or protecting against international terrorism. The Deputy Director or Executive Assistant Director for National Security can be delegated this authority, but they cannot further delegate it. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) allows for the approval of production orders by an FISC judge if the application meets statutory requirements. The order must include a specific description of the items sought, allow time for assembly, notify recipients of nondisclosure requirements, and be limited in scope. The production order under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act must adhere to nondisclosure requirements and only disclose information subject to legal orders. Recipients are prohibited from disclosing the order's purpose and must only share information with authorized individuals or for legal advice. Recipients must also disclose to the FBI the individuals with whom information has been shared upon request. Section 106(f) of P.L. 109-177 amends 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1803 to establish a petition review pool of FISC judges to hear challenges to FISA production or related nondisclosure orders. Section 106A directs the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Justice to conduct an audit of FBI investigative authority for calendar years 2002-2006. Section 108(a) and (b) amend requirements for FISA multipoint electronic surveillance orders. Section 108(c) of P.L. 109-177 expands the committees receiving semiannual reports on FISA electronic surveillance to include the Senate Judiciary Committee. It also requires the reports to include the total number of applications for orders approving multipoint electronic surveillance. Section 109(a) modifies the list of committees receiving reports on physical searches under FISA and requires the reports to include information on emergency physical searches authorized by the Attorney General. Section 109(b) of P.L. 109-177 mandates the Attorney General to include in his semiannual report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees on FISA pen registers and trap and trace devices the total number of emergency authorizations for pen registers and trap and trace devices, as well as subsequent orders approving or denying their installation and use. Section 109(d) of P.L. 109-177 allows the FISC and Court of Review to establish rules and procedures necessary for administering their responsibilities under this chapter. Section 128(a)(3) of P.L. 109-177 allows the FISC to direct communication service providers to provide specific subscriber information to federal officers using pen registers or trap and trace devices. This information includes the name, address, and contact details of the customer or subscriber during the period of the order. The provider may disclose network address, service length, types of services used, telephone records, usage periods, payment methods, and subscriber information for incoming or outgoing communications. The provider may disclose subscriber information, telephone records, service length, types of services used, and network address for incoming or outgoing communications. Section 128(b) of P.L. 109-177 added House and Senate Judiciary Committees to be informed about the use of FISA pen registers and trap and trace devices. Section 506 of P.L. 109-177 expands the definition of \"Attorney General\" to include the Assistant Attorney General for National Security. Section 3 of P.L. 109-178 amends provisions in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861(f) regarding judicial review of production orders and nondisclosure orders. Section 4 amends 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861(d)(2) to require disclosure of FBI requests for tangible things under a FISA production order to designated individuals. The report explores published decisions from the FISC and the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Court of Review, providing insight into the decision-making processes of the courts created by FISA. The FISC's decision was made public for the first time, offering a unique perspective on the statutory structure in FISA. The FISC approved the Attorney General's proposed 2002 \"Intelligence Sharing Procedures\" as minimization procedures, allowing coordination between the FBI, Criminal Division, and OIPR for investigations related to foreign threats. The FISC approved procedures for intelligence sharing and coordination between FBI, Criminal Division, and OIPR to address exchange of information, prevent obstruction, and ensure overlapping interests are achieved. OIPR must be invited to all consultations or promptly informed in writing if unable to attend. The FISC modified procedures to prevent law enforcement officials from influencing FISA searches or surveillances for criminal prosecution. The FBI and Criminal Division were tasked with ensuring compliance and preventing misuse of FISA tools. Additionally, a new Rule 11 was adopted to monitor compliance with FISC's order in criminal investigations related to FISA cases. The Court of Review rejected the FISC's interpretation of procedures regarding FISA applications and electronic surveillance. The Court of Review found errors in the FISC's interpretation of FISA procedures, questioning its authority over Justice Department procedures. FISA did not mandate a \"wall\" between intelligence gathering and law enforcement, allowing for overlap in investigations involving U.S. persons. The Court of Review distinguished between \"foreign intelligence crimes\" and \"ordinary crimes\" in FISA investigations involving U.S. persons. It rejected the \"primary purpose test\" for electronic surveillance authorization, stating it was not required by FISA or the Fourth Amendment. The Court of Review found errors in the FISC's refusal to consider the legal significance of the Patriot Act's amendments to FISA. Specifically, it focused on changes in certification requirements and the authorization for consultation between national security and law enforcement officers in electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence information. The amendment to require \"a significant purpose\" for surveillance acknowledged the distinction between intelligence gathering and law enforcement. The Court of Review recognized a dichotomy between intelligence gathering and law enforcement purposes, concluding that a measurable foreign intelligence purpose, other than just criminal prosecution, satisfied the test. The court found that if the government had a realistic option of dealing with the agent of a foreign power other than through criminal prosecution, the \"significant purpose\" test was met. The FISC may not have had authority to inquire into anything other than whether the information sought was foreign intelligence information before the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act. The Court of Review concluded that the FISA court has the authority to review the government's purpose in seeking foreign intelligence information. It emphasized that the government's purpose should be judged by national security officials and not by an inquiry into the origins of an investigation. The court also considered the constitutionality of FISA under the Fourth Amendment. The Court of Review found that FISA procedures met the minimum requirements for a warrant under the Fourth Amendment, deeming it constitutional."
