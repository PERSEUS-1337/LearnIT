    "content": "The General Mining Law of 1872 has its origins in 16th Century English and Spanish property and mineral rights laws. These laws were used in Colonial America to grant rights to lands containing minerals, including a share of the minerals. The Spanish \"Royal Code of 1783\" and English land charters to the original thirteen colonies also played a role in mineral rights ownership. Independence for the American colonies led to the need to resolve issues of land and mineral ownership between the national government, states, localities, and private individuals. Several ordinances were enacted to address these issues. The General Mining Law of 1872 has its origins in 16th Century English and Spanish property and mineral rights laws. The Ordinance of 1785, the Land Act of 1796, and the Preemption Act of 1841 did not address mineral royalties specifically. The California gold rush of 1849 and the silver strike in Nevada of 1860 led to a westward population migration for prospecting. Congress approved temporary leasing acts for minerals, but prospectors often disregarded them and laid claims on federal lands without paying royalties. Congressional policy post-Civil War aimed to encourage westward migration and economic development in the West. The General Mining Law of 1872, stemming from 16th Century English and Spanish laws, aimed to promote economic development in the West by granting access to federal lands for prospecting and claiming hardrock minerals without leasing them. Approved by President Ulysses S. Grant, this law allowed individuals and businesses to file claims on public lands for minerals like gold, silver, copper, and uranium. The General Mining Law of 1872 allowed individuals and businesses to file claims on public lands for hardrock minerals without paying royalties. Claim holders could obtain title to the land and mineral rights through patenting, promoting westward migration and economic development in the West. The Mining Law of 1872 allowed claims on public lands for hardrock minerals without royalties, promoting westward migration. Over time, other minerals were excluded from the law. Leasing systems were introduced for coal, oil, gas, and non-hardrock minerals, with leases negotiated case-by-case and royalties paid per ton. The Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 1976 focused on vast coal deposits in western states due to petroleum shortages. The Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 1976 replaced fixed royalties with ad-valorem royalties for coal mining, with rates of 12.5% for surface mines and 8% for underground mines. This royalty payment system is also used for oil and gas properties, with rates typically ranging from 12.5% to 16.67%. State governments also charge ad-valorem royalties for mineral extraction, while hardrock mining on federal lands requires a 5% royalty payment. The royalty rates for various minerals from federal lands are shown in Table 1. The system for paying royalties on coal, oil, and gas has evolved, but the system for hardrock minerals has remained unchanged since 1872. There is confusion over what a royalty is, but it is a factor payment made by the renter of the land to the landowner for the services provided by the land. The royalty is a factor payment made by mineral producers to landowners for the services of land containing mineral deposits. Exceptions include locatable minerals on public lands in the US where royalties are not paid. Rents for mineral lands can be paid through bonus bids, annual rentals, royalties, or combinations of these forms. Mineral rents can be paid in various forms such as bonus bids, annual rentals, or royalties, depending on the type of mineral and contractual agreement. For example, under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the federal government leases lands for oil and gas development through competitive bidding, with leases awarded to the highest bidder who pays a bonus bid upfront. Annual rents range from $5 to $9.50 per acre, with royalty rates of either 12.5% or 16.67%. These payments aim to capture returns to the land beyond labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. Mineral production involves uncertainties and risks, making it difficult to predict upfront rents earned by mineral lands. This uncertainty affects the division between royalties, bonus bids, and annual rentals. The division between royalties, bonus bids, and annual rentals in mineral production depends on how production risk is shared between the landowner and mineral producer. Royalties serve as a way for landowners to earn a return on their land while minimizing the risk of overpayment or underpayment. An ad-valorem royalty acts as a land rental, protecting both the mineral producer and the government against overestimation or underestimation of rents. Unlike a tax, royalties are a factor payment for specific services provided, not a compulsory levy for government financing. This distinction is crucial in arguments against imposing royalties based on net profits. The distinction between a tax and a rental payment is crucial in arguments against imposing royalties based on net profits. Forgoing royalty and other payments through the location system means that factor services are provided free of charge, which can distort the allocation of resources. The federal government is the steward of public lands, holding them in trust for the American public. The development of public resources should only occur at a fair market value return to the nation. The location system on federal lands allows industry to retain all economic surplus, which should be allocated to society at large. The theory of economic surplus return from natural resources suggests that it should accrue to society. Royalties should be based on the market value of the producer's output, with ad-valorem royalties being suitable for hardrock minerals due to the uncertainty in future productivity. The ad-valorem royalty is based on the value or price of the mining firm's output, with payments made over the life of the mine. The royalty amount varies based on the quality and value of the mineral produced, ensuring that landowners receive the market value minus the costs of obtaining it. The ad-valorem royalty is based on the value of the mining firm's output, ensuring landowners receive market value minus costs. The royalty rate applies to the aggregate value of the commodity, raising questions on when the value of a mine's output can be determined and when mining value ends. The production stage value is added or increased, and the transition from mining value to non-mining value occurs during various stages of extracting valuable mineral products from raw hardrock minerals. This process includes extraction, delivery to a plant, beneficiation, smelting or refining, and marketing of the metal or mineral. The production stages involve extracting valuable mineral products from raw hardrock minerals, with various points creating valuable outputs depending on the type of mineral and industry structure. Determining the mining output, value, and price can be complex, especially with different forms of trading like ore, concentrate, or precipitate. Vertical integration in firms or industries can further complicate the sales process. The value of mining output can be complex to determine, especially in vertically integrated industries where sales may not occur at every stage. Gross income from mining is used to calculate the percentage depletion allowance for tax purposes. This royalty base has been suggested in past debates and legislation, aligning with the economic concept of an ad-valorem royalty. The royalty base for percentage depletion in the hardrock mining industry has been in place since 1932. The term \"gross income\" used for this purpose can be confusing as it refers to sales revenue, not profits. The size of the royalty payment depends on when the price is measured and deductions allowed during the production stage. The royalty base for percentage depletion in the hardrock mining industry has been in place since 1932. The size of the royalty payment depends on when the price is measured and deductions allowed. Mining companies are allowed a depletion deduction based on gross income from mining, which includes sales revenue and treatment processes. The term \"mining\" includes extraction of ores, treatment processes, and transportation within 50 miles to treatment plants. IRC \u00a7613(c) defines treatment processes for minerals considered as mining for percentage depletion purposes. The term \"mining\" includes extraction of ores, treatment processes, and transportation within 50 miles to treatment plants. Treatment processes for minerals considered as mining for percentage depletion purposes include sorting, concentrating, sintering, loading for shipment, crushing, grinding, beneficiation by concentration, cyanidation, leaching, and precipitation. The term \"mining\" includes extraction of ores, treatment processes, and transportation within 50 miles to treatment plants. Treatment processes not considered mining for gross income purposes include electrolytic deposition, roasting, calcining, smelting, refining, and blending. The gross income from mining is the revenue generated by the sale of the first marketable mineral product created through extraction, before any non-mining processes are applied. After mining, the raw mineral ore is typically processed at a mill or plant to produce a saleable metal concentrate, which is then used as an input in the smelting or refining process for final sale. The ore concentrate is processed and refined for sale in wholesale markets. Gold refiners are the primary market for miners, where raw gold is purchased, processed, and refined. The value of the mineral in the concentrate determines its worth, such as copper from copper ore concentrate. Ore concentrates are sold to brokers or smelter refiners, or tolled for refining without sale. The funds received from the sale of ore concentrate are considered gross income to the miner. The actual price for which ore or mineral is sold determines gross income for depletion purposes under IRS regulations. The price of ore concentrate depends on the wholesale price of the final metal and the percentage of metal in the ore. Integrated mining firms with smelting/refining operations also apply non-mining processes. When a producer has smelting/refining operations and applies non-mining processes to ore concentrate before selling the final metal, there may be no sale of raw ore or concentrate, resulting in no price for the mineral firm's output until the metal is sold in commodities markets. Percentage depletion is based on \"constructive\" gross income, derived from representative market prices. If there is no representative price for the ore concentrate in other markets, gross income from mining is estimated using various methods. For example, the market price of final cast copper can be used as a hypothetical scenario. Under the constructive gross income method, gross income per tonne from mining operations is calculated based on the market price of final cast copper. For example, if a mining company produced 100,000 tons of copper ore concentrate, the total gross income from mining in one year would be $178.6 million. The net smelter return is a common term in the mining industry, estimating the price received for the mineral product sold by the miner. It is based on the price received by the smelter for the metal, minus smelting/refining costs. The Net Smelter Return is the amount paid to the mining operator for the mineral product, based on the current price of the mineral with deductions for processing costs and transportation charges. It is the amount received from the sale of the mineral product to the treatment plant for further processing. From the gross proceeds received, deductions may include costs for transportation, insurance, penalties, sampling, refining, and marketing. Net smelter return is the net value of minerals from the property, calculated as Gross Value minus permitted expenses like smelting charges, transportation costs, and insurance. Net smelter return deductions may include taxes, marketing costs, and smelter charges not exceeding those of an arm's length smelter. Legal language in contracts defines net smelter return as gross price less non-mining costs. The Purchaser agrees to pay a 2% royalty on net smelter returns to the Vendor. Net Smelter Returns refer to proceeds received from ore sales after deducting transportation costs. Warren or his successors will receive proceeds from sales of concentrates, metals, or products from the Claims. The net smelter return is the proceeds from ore sales after deducting transportation costs and other charges levied by third parties. It is the price at which cast copper could be sold after deducting smelting and refining costs. The net smelter return is calculated by deducting smelting and refining costs from the value of copper ore concentrate. Assuming a 30% pure copper content, the net smelter return for one tonne of ore concentrate is $2,143. If 100,000 metric tonnes are sold annually, the total net smelter return revenues would be $214 million, with an 8% royalty of $17 million. In the General Mining law debate, another royalty base mentioned is net profit, where the royalty would be a percentage of the miner's net after-tax profit. This is calculated as gross revenue less all costs, resulting in a smaller royalty base for calculating payments. Reducing royalty payments to the federal government is supported by the hardrock mining industry due to the variability of net profits and potential for accounting manipulations. This could result in mining companies claiming deductions that eliminate profits against which royalties are levied, potentially leading to smaller or no royalty payments. Advocates of the net after-tax profit royalty, such as the 1993 bill S. 775, propose measuring net profits at the mine mouth, which could further reduce royalties. A net profit royalty at the minemouth for hardrock minerals could lead to lower royalties and complications in cost allocation. It would expose the federal government to investor risks rather than landowner rewards, resembling an income tax rather than a factor payment. Another less common royalty base is a constant rate per unit of mineral output. The type of royalty instituted under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 for coal is a constant rate per unit of mineral output, such as $5/ton. This royalty is assessed on output alone, avoiding complexities of determining value, costs, or profits. Federal royalties for oil, gas, and coal are calculated based on gross proceeds from contract sales, typically using the contract price for oil and gas sales close to the wellhead. Royalties for oil and gas are based on posted prices to a pipeline company or various benchmarks for non-arm's length transactions. Transportation charges are deducted before determining gross proceeds. Coal royalties are assessed on gross proceeds from sales at the point of sale, typically at or near the mine-mouth. The Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 established a royalty of 10%-15% on federal leases for geothermal resources based on the value of steam or energy produced. Amendments in 2005 reduced the royalty to 1%-2.5% for geothermal energy used to generate electricity, based on gross proceeds from electricity sales. In the early 1990s, private royalty arrangements for geothermal energy typically involved ad-valorem royalties ranging from 2-8%, with an average rate of 5%. Publicly owned lands have laws determining resource returns, with competitive market rates influencing the rates. In most states with mineral resources, ad-valorem royalties range from 2-10%. On federal lands, leasable energy minerals have statutory royalty rates ranging from 5%-16.67%. For oil and gas, the royalty rate varies depending on the depth of extraction. Coal royalties are either 12% for surface mines or 8% for underground mines. The proposed 8% ad-valorem rate in H.R. 2262 is the same as the royalty rate on underground coal mines. The Congress has established an ad-valorem royalty rate of 5% on acquired lands. In international lease transactions, mineral royalties are typically ad-valorem with rates ranging from 2%-12%. There may be reasons for charging mineral producers a lower than market rate, such as stimulating industry development and settling the American West. Arguments are made against imposing a federal royalty on hardrock mining, citing economic stimulus benefits and damage to the industry from foreign competition. Some argue for national security reasons to subsidize certain hardrock minerals, but the impact on western communities dependent on the industry is also highlighted. These arguments are contested on various grounds. Subsidies for hardrock mining provide economic benefits to the industry and dependent communities. These benefits are not market failures but private benefits accounted for by the market system. However, they may come at the expense of other industries and regions in the US due to resource scarcity. The subsidy to hardrock mining in the US may lead to a loss of economic efficiency and private costs to other sectors. Removing the subsidies could result in a net welfare gain for citizens. Dependence on foreign producers for strategic minerals could pose economic disruptions or national security threats. Some argue that domestic stockpiling of strategic hardrock minerals could better address the threat of a supply disruption. Financial subsidies for these industries may be more efficient through tax subsidies rather than total royalty payment forgiveness. External costs associated with hardrock mineral production may outweigh external benefits. The external costs of hardrock mineral production, such as environmental degradation and damage to land utility, are not typically accounted for in business decision-making. This results in lower prices and higher output than optimal. In such cases, a tax may be more appropriate than imposing no royalty on land use. The economic rationale for the abandoned mineland reclamation fee under SMCRA is to impose a tax on land use rather than no royalty. Market conditions and industry competitiveness can affect the market-determined royalty rates, leading to potential issues of monopoly power or underpayment of royalties. These complex issues are challenging to analyze. The federal government's ownership of land for hardrock mineral production raises concerns about royalty payments. Despite the potential for obtaining economic rents, the government currently charges a royalty rate of zero, below market rates. Privately owned land may offer a more reliable indicator of competitive royalty rates. The structure of the hardrock mineral industry, both in the US and globally, is influenced by available data. The hardrock mining industry, both in the US and globally, is somewhat concentrated with large multinational mining conglomerates dominating. Top companies hold a significant portion of market capitalization. The market-determined royalty rate may be too low, but government should aim for a competitive rate for economic efficiency and social welfare. The hardrock mining industry is dominated by large multinational conglomerates. The royalty rate should be competitive for economic efficiency and social welfare. A variable royalty rate may not be necessary as the base is ad-valorem, automatically varying with mineral value. Constant royalty rates minimize economic distortions. The royalty rate in the hardrock mining industry should be competitive for economic efficiency and social welfare. Constant royalty rates minimize economic distortions, while private royalty agreements have varying rates based on mineral types. One suggested structure is to have royalty rates vary with mineral prices, starting at 8% for platinum and decreasing to 1% for aluminum. Another option is to tie royalty rates to percentage depletion rates. Introducing a royalty payment system for locatable minerals could have adverse economic effects on producers, leading to increased costs, decreased profits, and lower production. This would particularly impact marginal mines, resulting in closures and reduced employment in the hardrock mineral industry, affecting parts of the United States that rely on these industries. The introduction of a royalty payment system for locatable minerals may impact the competitive balance among mineral producers domestically and internationally. While hardrock mineral prices may not increase significantly due to international market factors, the industry has been booming in recent years, with growth in metals and minerals prices contributing to profitability. The mining industry has seen increased profitability and growth in recent years, with a significant contribution to the Gross Domestic Product price index. 2006 was a particularly successful year, and 2007 is expected to bring record financial results and industry consolidation. Rates of return on capital for the U.S. mining industry have been higher compared to other industries, reflecting a transition towards resource neutrality. The transition to resource neutrality in the mining industry has led to increased profitability and growth. Introducing a royalty payment system for locatable minerals is expected to have positive economic effects in other sectors and promote more efficient use of the nation's resources. The current policy of free access involves a trade-off between benefits to the hardrock mineral industry and other domestic economic sectors. A policy of royalty payments for locatable minerals would promote resource neutrality in the mining industry, leading to increased profitability and growth. This system would allow markets to determine the size of economic sectors. The payment of royalties to the federal government would increase revenues, with H.R. 2262 proposing an 8% or 4% royalty and higher fees. This approach aims to provide federal subsidies more efficiently than total forgiveness of factor payments. H.R. 2262 proposes a 4% royalty on existing claims and an 8% royalty on new claims, with deferred royalties for the first 12 months. Most revenues would come from existing claims, while new claims may not generate significant revenue due to the long timeline for mine production. The bill also increases claim fees and maintenance fees. The proposed higher fees in H.R. 2262 include a 4% royalty on existing claims and an 8% royalty on new claims, with deferred royalties for the first 12 months. Revenue estimates are net of federal income taxes, with a decline in income tax revenues due to deductibility of royalty payments. Federal agencies' fees are considered as offsetting budget receipts, reducing agencies' outlays. The U.S. hardrock minerals industry is subject to federal income, payroll, and other taxes, with a 35% corporate income tax rate for most corporations. Smaller corporations earning less than $10 million have reduced tax rates of 15%, 25%, or 34%. The U.S. hardrock minerals industry is subject to federal income, payroll, and other taxes, with smaller corporations earning less than $10 million having reduced tax rates of 15%, 25%, or 34%. Corporate stockholders pay individual income taxes on their corporate-source capital gains and dividends. Hardrock mining companies benefit from various untargeted tax incentives, including the \u00a7199 manufacturing deduction and accelerated depreciation. The \u00a7199 deduction allows manufacturing businesses to deduct a specified percentage of qualified production activity income, currently at 6% and scheduled to increase to 9% by 2010. The deduction for domestic mining industry, including oil and gas, applies to products manufactured, produced, or extracted in the US. Extraction is considered manufacturing for this deduction, benefiting firms extracting hardrock minerals. The deduction effectively reduces the marginal tax rate, with the current 6% deduction equivalent to a 32.9% marginal corporate income tax rate. Accelerated depreciation is another important tax provision for hardrock mineral companies. Accelerated depreciation is crucial for hardrock mineral companies, allowing for deductions on capital equipment and structures. The Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (IRC \u00a7168) determines the depreciation treatment, with assets depreciated using methods like the 200% declining balance method. The Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) determines annual depreciation deductions for mining equipment with a seven-year recovery period. Producers can choose a depreciation method that maximizes deductions over time, benefiting hardrock mineral producers due to their capital-intensive nature. The accelerated depreciation provision is important for the mining industry due to the high cost of equipment. Special tax breaks, such as expensing exploration and development expenditures, are available to hardrock mining firms before reaching the production stage. These costs include geological and geophysical expenses, as well as costs for determining the quantity and quality of the deposit. The costs associated with exploration and development in the mining industry are deductible rather than capitalized. These costs include staking claims, removing property line obstructions, limited overburden removal, sluicing, surveying, test pitting, trenching, drilling, and driving exploration tunnels. Expenditures for exploratory drilling to determine commercially marketable ores are considered mineral exploration costs. Additionally, exploratory drilling within a producing mine to identify a different ore deposit is also classified as exploration expenditures. Mine development expenditures, such as constructing mine shafts and driving tunnels, qualify for expensing treatment. Activities like building roads and clearing land for production are also considered development costs. However, there are limitations to expensing these costs, including only applying to domestic mines and allowing corporate mining companies to expense only 70% of exploration and development expenses. Foreign property costs must be depleted or amortized over a 10-year period. Mining companies can only expense 70% of exploration and development costs, with the remaining 30% amortized over five years. These costs must be recaptured once production begins or the mine is sold. A percentage depletion allowance is available for depleting mineral reserves, which is deducted from gross income for tax purposes. The depletion allowance for mining firms is a deduction for the depletion of mineral reserves, reflecting the loss of capital and physical depletion of the asset. It is similar to depreciation for equipment and structures, based on the actual investment cost and output of the mine. The percentage depletion deduction for a mine is calculated as a percentage of \"gross income\" (annual sales revenue) irrespective of the actual investment in the mineral reserve. This results in a tax subsidy or incentive as the total amounts that can be recovered through percentage depletion generally exceed the total investment cost of the property. The percentage depletion deduction for mines is calculated as a percentage of gross income, with limits on the deduction to 50% of taxable income. Table 4 shows depletion rates for various minerals, with rates ranging from 5% to 22%. The allowance is available to most mineral producers except integrated oil and gas producers, with the highest rates for hardrock minerals. The deduction is subject to limitations, including being limited to 50% of net income and a reduction for iron ore and coal mined by corporations. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 introduced a limitation on the depletion allowance for mining firms, reducing the depletion rate to between 17.6% and 22%. The imposition of a royalty increases operating costs but can be deducted as a business expense, lowering tax liability. However, there is an interaction between the royalty and the depletion allowance that limits the tax benefits. The imposition of a royalty on hardrock mining from federal lands increases deductible expenses and reduces tax liability. However, the reduced percentage depletion allowance would raise a mining firm's tax liability, resulting in a net increase in tax burden for every dollar of royalty paid. The tax deductibility of a royalty can reduce its burden, while the subtraction from gross income can increase it. For instance, an 8% royalty becomes effectively 6% at a 25% tax rate without gross income offset, but 6.44% with a 22% depletion allowance. Similarly, a 4% royalty is effectively 3% at a 25% tax rate without offset, but 3.15% with a 15% depletion allowance. The effective royalty can be calculated as a gross royalty minus an offset term. Under current tax laws, the offset for royalty deductibility can be negative, affecting the benefits from tax deductibility. The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 provides preferential tax treatment to the mining industry for mine closing and land reclamation costs. This provision allows deductions in advance, contrary to general tax rules. The cash method of accounting only allows expenses to be deducted when payment is made, while the accrual method allows for deductions in the year of economic activity. The Joint Tax Committee estimates a total revenue loss of $1.8 billion over five years from special tax preferences for the mining industry. The mining industry's special tax preferences resulted in a $1.8 billion revenue loss over five years, primarily benefiting corporations. The alternative minimum tax aims to limit these tax breaks to ensure all taxpayers pay some tax. The alternative minimum tax imposes additional tax on special tax breaks, including those important to the mining industry like depletion and development cost deductions. Using these tax preferences could trigger the minimum tax and reduce the value of special tax provisions. Mining companies benefit from special tax preferences and subsidies, like accelerated depreciation, resulting in low effective tax rates. They pay no royalties for mining on public lands and receive significant tax subsidies. Additionally, they pay various claims fees for administrative services provided by the Bureau of Land Management. The Bureau of Land Management charges fees for administrative services related to mining claims. The location fee is $30 per claim, the annual maintenance fee is $125 per claim, and there is a $15 processing fee. These fees help cover the costs of administering the mining law and regulations. The House of Representatives approved a substitute version of H.R. 2262, the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007. The bill aims to establish a new regulatory framework for hardrock mineral development, end the sale of public lands for mining, impose royalty payments for mining operations on federal lands, require additional permits for exploration, and create a reclamation program for abandoned mines. The substitute version of H.R. 2262 aims to establish new regulations for hardrock mineral development, including directing 50% of cleanup funding to the state where royalties were generated, prioritizing reclamation projects that protect public health and wildlife habitat, designating watershed areas as eligible for cleanup funds, and setting environmental standards for the mining industry. The substitute version of H.R. 2262 introduces new regulations for hardrock mineral development, including defining \"undue degradation\" of public lands, giving broader authority to the Secretary of the Interior to block harmful mining operations, allowing Native American tribes to petition for withdrawal of federal lands with cultural and religious significance, establishing guidelines for administrative and judicial review of mining activities on public lands, and permitting citizen lawsuits against federal decisions."
