    "content": "Under current tax law, firms can deduct up to $1 million of the total cost of new and used qualified assets they purchase and place in service in tax years beginning in 2018 under Section 179 of the federal tax code. They also have the option to expense the entire cost of qualified assets acquired and placed in service between September 28, 2017, and December 31, 2022 under Section 168(k). This expensing allowance, also known as bonus depreciation, stimulates business investment by reducing the cost of capital and increasing cash flow for firms. Economists consider these allowances as significant investment tax subsidies. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 increased the annual dollar limitation for expensing under Section 179 to $1 million, raised the phaseout threshold to $2.5 million, and expanded the range of assets eligible for the allowance. It also raised the Section 168(k) bonus depreciation allowance to 100% of the cost of eligible assets acquired and placed in service from September 28, 2017, through the end of 2022. This report examines the current status, legislative history, and economic effects of these tax provisions. Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code allows firms to expense the cost of new and used qualified property in the tax year when assets are placed in service. The maximum expensing allowance is $1 million for qualified assets bought and placed in service in 2018 and thereafter. Business taxpayers can choose to claim this allowance or recover capital costs over longer periods through depreciation deductions under MACRS or ADS. Qualified property eligible for the Section 179 allowance includes tangible property depreciable under Section 168, used in the active conduct of a trade or business. This includes machinery, equipment, research facilities, storage facilities, and off-the-shelf computer software. Additionally, improvements to nonresidential real property and various systems like fire protection, security, roofs, and HVAC may also qualify for expensing. The Section 179 expensing allowance applies to tangible property used in business, including improvements to nonresidential real property like fire protection, security systems, roofs, and HVAC. There are limitations based on investment and income, with a maximum allowance reduced by the cost of qualified property exceeding a threshold. The income limitation for claiming a Section 179 allowance restricts a taxpayer from exceeding their taxable income from the active conduct of a trade or business. If the taxable income is lower than the allowed Section 179 allowance due to the investment limitation, the excess amount can be carried forward for future deduction. Taxpayers cannot carry forward unused allowance due to the investment limitation but can indefinitely carry forward unused allowance due to the income limitation. Taxpayers can now revoke an election to claim the Section 179 allowance without IRS consent by submitting an amended return using a different depreciation method. Businesses may also claim a 100% expensing allowance under Section 168(k) for eligible property acquired after September 27. The 100% expensing allowance under Section 168(k) applies to eligible property acquired after September 27, 2017, until January 1, 2023. The rate is set to decrease to 80% in 2023, 60% in 2024, 40% in 2025, 20% in 2026, and 0% for property acquired after 2027. Initially, the bonus depreciation allowance was 30% for property acquired between 2001 and 2004, increased to 50% from 2003 to 2005, and reinstated in 2007 for property acquired in 2008. The Bonus Depreciation Allowance (BDA) was created to accelerate the depreciation of qualified property, reducing the cost of capital for investments and boosting cash flow for businesses. It was available for property acquired and placed in service from 2009 to 2015, aiming to stimulate business investment during periods of economic downturn. The BDA applies to new or used qualified property eligible for depreciation under the MACRS with recovery periods of 20 years or fewer. The Bonus Depreciation Allowance (BDA) was created to accelerate the depreciation of qualified property, reducing the cost of capital for investments and boosting cash flow for businesses. It applies to new or used qualified property eligible for depreciation under the MACRS with recovery periods of 20 years or fewer. However, changes in the BDA enacted in P.L. 115-97 exclude property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, by rate-regulated utilities. Additionally, from 2008 to 2015, C corporations had the option to cash in alternative minimum tax (AMT) and research tax credits instead of taking the BDA. The bonus depreciation credit was refundable and limited to a corporation's bonus depreciation amount, calculated as 20% of the difference between bonus and regular depreciation. From 2008 to 2010, the credit was capped at 6% of carried-forward AMT and research tax credits or $30 million. For property placed in service from 2011 to 2015, corporations could only claim the credit for unused AMT credits from before 2006. The increase in the bonus depreciation credit was treated as a refundable overpayment of tax for corporations, with specific criteria for eligibility based on cash flow and potential net operating losses. Different rules applied in 2016 and 2017, allowing C and S corporations to claim a refundable and accelerated AMT credit instead of bonus depreciation. Taxpayers could claim a refundable and accelerated AMT credit under Section 168(k)(4) instead of taking bonus depreciation for qualified property. The method for calculating the credit was complex, with rules varying for different circumstances. The credit amount was based on the difference between regular and bonus depreciation, limited by the maximum increase amount (MIA). The corporate AMT credit was based on the firm's minimum tax credit under Section 53(b) or its adjusted net minimum tax. It aimed to provide a similar tax benefit to companies investing in bonus depreciation property. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act repealed the corporate AMT and the option to exchange a BDA for unused AMT credits. Companies investing in assets eligible for Section 179 and Section 168(k) expensing allowances must recover their costs in a specific order. The taxpayer can apply bonus depreciation allowance to lower the company's basis in the asset, followed by claiming a depreciation allowance under MACRS using the double declining balance method. An example shows how this process works with a company acquiring machine tools qualifying for Section 179 expensing and BDA. The company can lower its basis in the property to $100,000 by claiming bonus depreciation and MACRS deductions. This allows the company to deduct nearly 89% of the purchase price of the machine tools in the year they are placed in service. The Section 179 expensing allowance has been a permanent fixture of the federal tax code since 1958, aimed at reducing the tax burden on small business owners and stimulating investment. Originally limited to $2,000, it was increased to $5,000 by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, with a gradual increase to $10,000 by 1986. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 increased the Section 179 expensing allowance from $2,000 to $5,000, with a planned increase to $10,000 by 1986. However, few firms took advantage of the allowance due to limitations on the use of an investment tax credit. Congress later postponed the increase to $10,000 to 1990 with the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984. Despite this, the use of the allowance increased significantly after the repeal of the investment tax credit. The Section 179 expensing allowance rose to $10,000 in 1990 after the repeal of the investment tax credit. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 increased the allowance to $17,500 and introduced tax benefits for impoverished areas. The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 scheduled increases, with the allowance reaching $18,000 in 1997. The Section 179 expensing allowance increased to $18,000 in 1997, $18,500 in 1998, $19,000 in 1999, $20,000 in 2000, $24,000 in 2001 and 2002, and $25,000 in 2003 and beyond. The Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000 added \"renewal communities\" to the list of economic development areas, providing businesses in these areas with tax benefits. Additionally, a premium of $35,000 was added to the regular allowance for qualified assets in economic development areas. Congress also established tax benefits through the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 to encourage new business investment in lower Manhattan after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the Section 179 expensing allowance increased for firms in the \"Liberty Zone\" in lower Manhattan. The Jobs and Growth Tax Reduction and Reconciliation Act of 2003 raised the allowance to $100,000 until 2005, then reset it to $25,000. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 added off-the-shelf software as depreciable assets eligible for expensing. The Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 created tax incentives for business investment in areas affected by Hurricane Katrina, offering an enhanced expensing allowance for qualified assets purchased between August 28, 2005, and December 31, 2007. The allowance could be up to $100,000 above the regular allowance, with a higher phaseout threshold and applied to a wider range of assets. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 extended changes in the allowance for depreciable assets through 2009. The U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Appropriations Act of 2007 further extended the changes through 2010, raising the maximum allowance to $125,000 and the phaseout threshold to $500,000. The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 increased the allowance to $250,000 and the phaseout threshold to $800,000 for qualified assets bought in 2008. The Section 179 expensing allowance was modified by several laws during the 111th Congress. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended the enhanced allowance through 2009, and the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act of 2010 further extended it through 2010. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 increased the expensing allowance to $500,000 and the phaseout threshold to $2 million for tax years in 2010 and 2011. Starting in 2012, the maximum allowance was scheduled to reset at $25,000. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Compensation Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 increased the maximum expensing allowance to $125,000 and the phaseout threshold to $500,000 for qualified assets acquired in 2012. The American Taxpayer Tax Relief Act of 2012 raised the maximum expensing allowance to $500,000 and the phaseout threshold to $2 million in 2012 and 2013. Off-the-shelf software purchases were also eligible for the allowance in 2013. In 2013, the expensing allowance for qualified improvement property was extended to $250,000. Congress extended the Section 179 expensing allowance in 2014 and 2015, setting it permanently at $500,000 with a $2 million phaseout threshold. Off-the-shelf software and certain property types became permanently eligible for the allowance. The tax revision bill (P.L. 115-97) in December 2017 increased the Section 179 expensing allowance to $1 million with a phaseout threshold of $2.5 million. The definition of qualified real property was expanded to include various improvements, and the $25,000 expensing limit for heavy-duty motor vehicles was indexed for inflation. The BDA, created by the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-147), was equal to 30% of a company's adjusted basis in new property. The BDA, created by the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-147), initially allowed for a 30% deduction on new qualified property. This was later increased to 50% by the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-27) and extended through the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 for property acquired in 2008. The Housing Assistance Tax Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-289) allowed C corporations to exchange BDA for a refundable tax credit. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5) extended the 50% BDA and optional credit through 2009. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-240) extended the allowance and credit to 2010. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Compensation Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-312) increased the BDA to 100% for property acquired from September 9, 2010, to December 31, 2011. The BDA allowance for property acquired and placed in service was extended through various acts from 2008 to 2019, with rates ranging from 50% to 100%. The optional refundable credit was limited to unused AMT credits from before 2006, and extended through 2013 for AMT credits carried forward. The BDA allowance for property acquired and placed in service was extended through various acts from 2008 to 2019, with rates ranging from 50% to 100%. The rate was scheduled to drop to 40% in 2018, and then to 30% in 2019. No allowance was available in 2020 and thereafter. The act also extended through 2019 the optional refundable credit without a specified dollar limit on the amount that could be claimed. The credit a corporation could claim was equal to its bonus depreciation amount, limited by certain criteria. Additionally, the PATH Act extended the BDA to domestic planted or grafted trees or vines with a preproduction period of over two years. The BDA rate for qualified property was set at 100% for property placed in service between September 28, 2017, and December 31, 2022. The rate decreases to 80% in 2023, 60% in 2024, 40% in 2025, 20% in 2026, and 0% starting in 2027. Trees and vines bearing fruits and nuts are eligible for the BDA, but qualified improvement property requires a 15-year recovery period to be eligible. The BDA allows for a 15-year recovery period for rate-regulated utilities' property acquired after September 27, 2017. Used qualified property in the same period qualifies for the allowance, as do film and television productions released after the same date. The option to claim a refundable AMT credit instead of a BDA is repealed starting in 2018. Lawmakers and business owners see Section 179 expensing and bonus depreciation as effective tools for small firm growth and cash flow improvement. Many economists have a nuanced view on the effects of tax allowances like Section 179 expensing. They argue that these allowances can lead to inefficient capital allocation, benefit upper-income business owners, and reduce tax compliance costs for smaller firms. These effects are evaluated based on efficiency, equity, and simplicity criteria. Since 2002, Congress has passed multiple bills to enhance Section 179 expensing and bonus depreciation allowances to stimulate business investment in equipment and machinery, aiming to boost domestic GDP. Enhancing Section 179 expensing and bonus depreciation allowances lowers the user cost of capital for investments, increasing cash flow for companies relying on internal financial sources. This influences business investment decisions by determining the after-tax rate of return needed for profitability. Lower user cost of capital leads to more profitable projects and higher desired capital stock. Expensing in tax law reduces the user cost of capital, leading to increased business investment in the short run. It lowers the tax burden on eligible investments, equivalent to a tax rebate from the U.S. Treasury. This results in a marginal effective tax rate of 0% on returns to eligible investments, influencing equipment spending sensitivity to changes in the user cost of capital. The elasticity of business spending on equipment in response to changes in the user cost of capital ranges from -0.25 to -0.66, with some economists suggesting it is around -0.50. A recent study found a much larger elasticity estimate of 1.6, indicating that a 10% decline in the user cost of capital could lead to a 16% increase in equipment spending. Cash flow and the use of retained earnings also play a significant role in business investment decisions. Younger firms investing in new technologies may struggle to raise capital from debt or equity markets due to limited access. For these companies, financing new investments through retained earnings is more cost-effective than external funds. Expensing can boost a profitable firm's cash flow in the short term by allowing full deduction of asset costs, but offers no benefit for firms with net operating losses. The role of cash flow in driving business investment is challenging to measure or verify. The contribution of cash flow to business investment, especially for small businesses, is difficult to measure. Studies show a positive correlation between a firm's net worth and investment spending, especially for firms with limited access to debt and equity markets. However, this correlation does not prove that firms with high retained earnings invest more than those with low or negative amounts. The strong correlation between cash flow and business investment may be due to other factors, not just the cost of internal financing. The relationship between cash flow and business investment is complex, with studies showing that expensing boosts investment in qualified assets. Research is needed to assess the impact of cash flow on investment, especially during the 2007-2009 recession. Studies differ on the effectiveness of Section 179 and bonus depreciation allowances in stimulating business investment. According to studies by Knittel and Cohen, small businesses did not significantly increase their use of the Section 179 expensing allowance and bonus depreciation after they were expanded in 2003. The share of small firms claiming these allowances remained relatively stable or even decreased despite the increase in allowance amounts. The study found that only 10% of C and S corporations considered bonus depreciation important in their investment decisions from 2002 to 2004. It suggested that many investments benefiting from bonus depreciation would have been made regardless, but timing was adjusted to qualify for the allowance. Bonus depreciation had no significant impact on investment in short-lived assets like computer hardware and software. Another study estimated a minor effect on GDP and employment in 2002 and 2003, with a possible increase of 0.07% to 0.14% in GDP and 100,000 to 200,000 jobs created. The bonus depreciation allowance had a strong impact on investment in qualified assets, with an estimated investment price-elasticity of supply ranging from 6% to 14%. The take-up rate for the allowance among corporations increased from 2002 to 2004, with rates ranging from 54% to 61% for C corporations and 65% to 70% for S corporations. The take-up rate for bonus depreciation among corporations increased from 2002 to 2004, with rates ranging from 54% to 61% for C corporations and 65% to 70% for S corporations. Possible reasons for corporations forgoing bonus depreciation include net operating losses and state disallowances for computing state income tax liability. Industries with few companies investing in long-lived assets, like telecommunications, had the highest take-up rates. Zwick and Mahon's study showed that bonus depreciation had a significant impact on investment in qualifying assets, increasing it by 10.4% from 2001 to 2004 and by 16.9% from 2008 to 2010. Their analysis considered financial frictions, leading to higher estimates of the allowance's effects. Small and medium-sized firms were more responsive to bonus depreciation than larger firms, especially those relying on internal cash reserves. The Section 179 and bonus depreciation allowances had a modest impact on the U.S. economy since the early 2000s. The design of the allowances limits their impact on overall economic activity, as they do not apply to investments in inventory, structures, and land. Additionally, spending on eligible assets accounts for a small portion of U.S. business investment. According to IRS data, corporations claimed $621.0 billion in depreciation allowances in 2013. In 2013, corporations claimed $621.0 billion in depreciation allowances. Section 179 allowances were $13.2 billion (2.1% of total) and bonus depreciation allowances were $217.1 billion (35.0% of total). These allowances represented less than 40% of total corporate depreciation. Expensing may have less impact during a recession as business investment is driven by economic conditions rather than tax incentives. The investment tax subsidy like expensing may not lead to a permanent increase in domestic capital stock. Companies with NOLs do not benefit immediately from expensing. The effectiveness of Section 179 expensing and Section 168(k) bonus depreciation depends on the asset's recovery period. Studies show that bonus depreciation boosts business investment, especially in long-lived equipment. The Cohen-Cummins study found that tax provisions like Section 179 expensing and bonus depreciation had varying effects on investment, with long-lived equipment seeing an increase. The net present value of the tax benefit was linked to the recovery period of qualified assets. Alternative policies, such as increasing financial aid to the unemployed, may be more effective in stimulating economic activity according to a 2010 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office. Efficiency in economic theory refers to resource allocation and its impact on consumer and producer welfare. Inefficient allocation results in missed gains from trade. For example, tax policies like expensing investment costs could have raised GDP more effectively than other measures. Expensing investment costs can improve resource allocation by shifting supply to low-cost producers, increasing economic surplus. It is preferred under consumption taxes but becomes a tax preference under income taxes, leading to tax arbitrage opportunities. Taxpayers can deduct the full cost of depreciable assets in the year they are placed in service and deduct interest payments on the debt incurred to acquire the assets. Expensing investment costs can improve resource allocation by shifting supply to low-cost producers, increasing economic surplus. Taxpayers can deduct the full cost of depreciable assets in the year they are placed in service, leading to a negative marginal effective tax rate on the returns to those investments. This affects the allocation of capital within an economy by distorting economic choices and creating deadweight loss. Expensing investment costs can distort resource allocation by favoring certain assets over others, potentially leading to inefficient levels of investment in the short run. This could deprive more productive investments with lower after-tax rates of return of needed capital. The tax benefit of expensing can be illustrated by how it affects the marginal effective tax rate on investment returns. The marginal effective tax rate on investment returns is influenced by expensing, which allows for a 0% tax rate in some cases. This tax provision reduces the total after-tax return and cost of an asset by the investor's marginal tax rate, effectively making the government a partner in the investment. The Section 179 expensing and bonus depreciation allowances impact the cost of capital and cash flow for small business owners. However, there is no evidence on how these allowances have affected the domestic capital stock in recent decades due to a lack of studies assessing their impact on capital formation. The Section 179 expensing allowance may have influenced domestic investment by accelerating timing of investments to take advantage of tax subsidy. Investment in eligible assets is driven more by growth expectations, asset nature, and market conditions than tax considerations. Data shows 22% of corporations claimed the allowance from 1999 onwards. The Section 179 expensing allowance, claimed by 22% of corporations from 1999 to 2003, accounted for 5% of gross domestic investment in equipment and software. This tax subsidy may divert capital from productive uses to tax-favored assets, contrary to economic theory advocating for neutral taxation of capital income. The allowance encourages investment in specific assets, leading to efficiency losses in business income taxation. The Section 179 expensing allowance and Section 168(k) allowances incentivize investment in specific assets, deviating from neutral taxation norms. This can distort firms' growth incentives, particularly for smaller firms aiming to benefit from the allowance. The marginal effective tax rate on income earned by qualified assets over the allowance's phaseout range can hinder growth. Douglas Holtz-Eakin labeled this effect a \"tax on growth by small firms.\" Equity in economic analysis refers to income distribution among individuals or households, especially after-tax income distribution in public finance. In public finance, equity refers to the fair distribution of after-tax income among households or individuals. Economists analyze two types of equity in income taxes: horizontal equity, which treats individuals with similar incomes equally, and vertical equity, which varies tax burdens based on ability to pay. A progressive income tax system is based on vertical equity, where tax liability increases with income. The current federal income tax system leans more towards vertical equity than horizontal equity due to existing tax preferences. The current federal income tax system leans towards vertical equity, where tax liability increases with income. Existing tax preferences result in individuals with similar before-tax incomes being taxed at different effective rates. The expensing allowance affects vertical and horizontal equity by reducing the marginal effective tax rate on income earned from eligible assets. The expensing allowance affects vertical and horizontal equity by reducing the marginal effective tax rate on income earned from eligible assets. Accelerated depreciation does not reduce federal taxes paid on income earned by an asset but delays tax payments by front-loading depreciation deductions, benefiting small business owners. The expensing allowance benefits small business owners by lowering their effective tax burden on income from eligible assets, but it does not change the nominal taxes paid over time. This policy does not have a lasting effect on the distribution of after-tax incomes. The Section 179 and Section 168(k) expensing allowances raise concerns about their impact on tax compliance costs for business taxpayers. Public finance economists believe that the federal income tax system imposes high costs for administration and compliance due to the complexity of tax laws. P.L. 115-97 may have worsened this trend with the new 20% provision. The new 20% deduction for passthrough business income under Section 199A may have worsened the trend of high tax compliance costs for small business owners. While expensing allowances simplify tax accounting for depreciation, they also complicate compliance with the tax code. Tax simplification remains a priority for many small business owners. The high cost of complying with federal tax laws for small businesses is a concern for owners. Studies show that in 2000, the estimated cost per U.S. employee for tax compliance was $665 for all firms, with higher costs for smaller businesses. A 2004 study found that the direct monetary cost per employee of complying with federal income tax varied based on the firm's total assets. Additionally, a 2010 study estimated the federal tax compliance cost per employee in 2008. The federal tax compliance cost per employee in 2008 was $1,584 for firms with fewer than 20 employees, $760 for firms with 20 to 499 employees, and $517 for firms with 500 or more employees, showing an inverse relationship between business tax compliance cost and firm size."
