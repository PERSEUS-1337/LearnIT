    "content": "The United States has developed a nuclear earth penetrator bomb, the B61-11, to target hardened underground facilities. However, there are concerns about its effectiveness in certain terrains. The Administration is considering modifying existing B83 nuclear bombs to improve earth-penetrating capabilities. The Air Force led a study to modify existing B83 nuclear bombs into earth penetrators, with NNSA overseeing warhead modifications. DOD and NNSA requested funds for the controversial Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) program, aimed at targeting deeply buried facilities in hostile nations. Supporters argue it deters threats, while critics fear it could lower the nuclear weapons use threshold. The RNEP program aimed to modify existing nuclear bombs for earth penetration, with concerns that it could lower the threshold for nuclear weapon use. Congress appropriated funds for the program, facing criticism and amendments to redirect funds to conventional means of attacking buried targets. Amendments were also adopted to require congressional authorization for further development phases of RNEP. In response to reduced funding, NNSA planned to focus on studying the B83 as an RNEP candidate, with little allocated for the B61 study. The B83 study was conducted by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories, while the B61 study was handled by Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories. Congress eliminated RNEP funding for FY2005 and the Administration requested funds for a sled test in FY2006. The Administration requested $4.5 million for DOD to study linking RNEP to the B-2 bomber and $4.0 million for a sled test. The Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act called for a National Academy of Sciences report on effects of nuclear and conventional earth penetrator weapons, which concluded that nuclear EPWs can hold high-value buried facilities at risk and that detonating a nuclear weapon at shallow depth increases energy. Detonating a nuclear weapon at shallow depth increases energy transmitted to a buried target, reducing yield by 15 to 25 times. Attacks using nuclear EPWs near urban areas could result in thousands to over a million casualties. A nuclear EPW could reduce civilian casualties in urban areas by a factor of 2 to 10 compared to a surface-burst weapon with 25 times the yield. In a nuclear attack on a chemical weapon facility, nuclear effects would likely kill more civilians than the released chemical agent. The report discusses the history of RNEP in Congress and the Administration for the FY2005 and FY2006 budget cycles, with potential consideration in the second session of the 109th Congress depending on the Administration's request for funds in the FY2007 budget. Congress required NNSA to provide a five-year budget projection in the National Defense Authorization Acts for FY1997 and FY2000. The FY2005 budget cycle marked the first detailed out-year projection for RNEP, with projected figures for FY2005-FY2009 totaling $484.7 million. The research program for FY2003-FY2009 was estimated to cost $498.3 million, with additional costs for development and production. The additional costs for the development and production of the selected weapon include completing production engineering and manufacturing components for an earth penetrator. These costs encompass NNSA expenses but exclude Air Force costs for the guidance unit. The total program cost estimate is not available as the cost study is incomplete. The Departments of Defense and Energy follow a formal set of phases for modified nuclear weapons, including feasibility study, design definition, development engineering, and production engineering. In FY2005, NNSA aimed to complete 56% of scheduled RNEP Phase 6.2/6.2A activities, including subsystem tests and a full system test. The following years had targets to complete 100% of scheduled activities for Phase 6.2/6.2A and Phase 6.3, with a focus on obtaining appropriate authorizations and completing production engineering tasks. The FY2005 request raised doubts about the nature of RNEP Phase 6.3 activity, with NNSA Administrator Linton Brooks clarifying that funds were included in the budget projections as placeholders pending Congressional approval. The law requires approval for the engineering development phase (phase 6.3) of the nuclear weapons development process. The NNSA faced budgetary challenges in FY2005 regarding the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator weapon program. Without out-year funds, decisions on proceeding with RNEP would be delayed or require reallocating funds from other programs. The budget projections included costs for potential future phases, but no decision had been made pending completion of a study on Phase 6.2/6.2A. The RNEP study faced budget challenges in FY2005, with changing appropriations each year. Delays and cuts affected the planned $45 million budget, with only $6.1 million spent in FY2003 and zero appropriations in FY2005 and FY2006. Critics raised concerns about the budget projections and plan presented in the FY2005 request. Representative Tauscher expressed surprise at the significantly increased funding for the program. Brooks noted a significant increase in activity for the 6.X process, indicating intent to develop modified nuclear weapons without completing feasibility studies. Critics argue that the administration is expanding U.S. nuclear capabilities without proper justification. Administrator Brooks responded to Representative Tauscher's questions regarding the RNEP activities, stating that the \"subsystem and full system tests of the proposed design\" are consistent with legislation passed by Congress. The activities for the initial year of 6.3 work on the RNEP in FY2007 would involve impact testing. Brooks responded that impact tests on surrogate penetrator bodies at Sandia National Laboratories are needed to assess survivability to ground penetration in required geologies for the Phase 6.2 feasibility study. Specific congressional authorization is required before proceeding to Phase 6.3 or subsequent phases of RNEP. Sled track tests at Sandia National Laboratories are planned as part of the 6.2/6.2A study, including full system tests with various components assembled in a penetrator body. The RNEP components are assembled in a penetrator body without a guidance system or fissile materials. Sled tests are conducted at high speed to assess survivability, with more advanced tests planned for Phase 6.3. In Albuquerque, NM, advanced tests for the RNEP would be conducted in Phase 6.3. These tests include \"vibration flyaround tests\" where a mock-up of the weapon is mounted on an aircraft to validate its stability and aerodynamics. Another test involves dropping a mock-up from an aircraft using surrogate material. Various other tests may also be conducted. Representative Tauscher inquired about the criteria for requesting legislative authorization to begin 6.3 work and the decision-making process involved. Administrator Brooks explained that the NNSA does not make the decision to proceed to Phase 6.3 or subsequent phases. The decision is made by the Nuclear Weapons Council (NWC) based on the feasibility, military utility, cost, and schedule established in the Phase 6.2/6.2A Study. Funding approval by the President and Congress is also required for NNSA to move beyond the study stage. The decision to move the Reliable Nuclear Warhead Replacement Program (RNEP) to Phase 6.3 would involve considerations of cost, schedule, feasibility, and military requirements. The Nuclear Weapons Council and ultimately the President and Congress would make the final decision on whether to proceed to Phase 6.4, Production Engineering. The decision on whether to proceed with Phase 6.3 of the Reliable Nuclear Warhead Replacement Program (RNEP) would be made by the President through the Nuclear Weapons Council. The FY2005 budget revealed unexpected costs for RNEP, raising concerns about congressional approval for further phases. Senator Domenici expressed surprise at the funding allocated for RNEP in future years. The DOE should not assume large sums in its budget without congressional approval. Senator Reid expressed concern over a half a billion dollar placeholder for bunker busting in the out year spending plan. Senator Kennedy also questioned the appropriateness of this path. Many are skeptical of the rush to develop new nuclear weapons, including mini-nukes and bunker busters, with a significant increase in budget from $45 million to almost $.5 billion. Senator Warner raised concerns about the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator budget, questioning the substantial increase in funding for 2006 without specific authorization. Secretary Abraham discussed the statutory provision governing the transition from research to engineering phases, emphasizing the importance of providing five-year budgets for proper assessment of potential expenses. There is no specific military requirement for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP), but it was identified in the Nuclear Posture Review as a solution for addressing hard, deeply buried targets in the 21st century. The administration's position is to investigate various approaches for dealing with hard, deeply buried targets, including the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP). The feasibility and preference of this approach over conventional weapons are still being evaluated by NNSA. NNSA has stated that DOD uses the term \"desired capabilities and characteristics\" instead of \"requirement\" before starting a concept study. The perceived need for a capability, such as in the case of RNEP, is documented in classified form. \"Requirement\" is also used for a specific weapon in the acquisition process, which DOD will not have until a well-defined system or component is available after the Phase 2A/6.2A study in the nuclear weapon life cycle. The House Armed Services Committee and Senate Armed Services Committee both approved the full amount requested for RNEP, $27.6 million. The House committee emphasized the importance of the RNEP Phase 6.2/6.2A study and referenced a Defense Science Board Task Force study recommending research on nuclear weapons with lower collateral damage. Any further efforts beyond a study would require approval from the President and funding from Congress. An amendment on RNEP to H.R. 4200 was defeated 204-214 on May 20. An amendment for additional funding for ordnance technology and strategic capability modernization was defeated 204-214 on May 20. The amendment proposed increasing funding for Air Force Conventional Munitions and Defense-wide Strategic Capability Modernization. Defense-wide funding is increased by $11,557,000 for Strategic Capability Modernization. This increase is offset by a reduction of $36,557,000 in weapons activities, with $27,557,000 from the Stockpile Services Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator study and $9,000,000 from the Stockpile Services Advanced Concepts program. Senators Kennedy and Feinstein introduced an amendment to bar the use of FY2005 funds for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator or the Advanced Concepts Initiative. Senator Bennett submitted amendment 3403 to S. 2400 on June 7, which aimed to require specific authorization from Congress for a full-scale underground nuclear test of the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator. The Senate debated and rejected the amendment on June 15, with a vote of 55-42. This proposed addition would amend Section 3117 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 to include the requirement for congressional authorization before conducting such a test. The Energy and Water Development Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee approved the FY2005 energy and water development appropriations bill without providing funds for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator weapon. The full committee also approved the bill without funds for RNEP, expressing opposition to diverting resources from the nation's nuclear deterrent management. The Energy and Water Development Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee remains unconvinced by the Department of Energy's assurance that the RNEP activity is only a study. The Committee prioritizes maintaining the nation's nuclear deterrent and integrity in halting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Department's focus on new nuclear weapons development goes against these priorities. The Committee directs the NNSA to focus on maintaining the safety, security, and viability of the existing stockpile. The House passed bill H.R. 4614, with no amendments to the Weapons Activities section. Disputes over the Yucca Mountain repository delayed the energy and water bill in the Senate. A compromise allowed energy and water appropriations to be included in H.R. 4818, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, breaking the logjam. The logjam was broken by eliminating RNEP and ACI, reducing nuclear weapons programs, and reallocating $800 million in the omnibus bill. Conferees increased funding for projects at Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories. Senator Domenici agreed to spending cuts for RNEP and ACI to secure funding for Sandia and Los Alamos. NNSA scaled back its program for FY2006, focusing on a study of the B83 warhead only, reducing costs to $4.0 million for FY2006 and $14.0 million for FY2007. Ambassador Brooks explained the reduced scope aimed at demonstrating the warhead's ability to penetrate rock and release energy into the ground. The NNSA scaled back its program for FY2006 to focus on studying the B83 warhead, aiming to demonstrate its ability to penetrate rock and release energy into the ground. The program includes activities such as conducting a B83 impact test, analyzing test data, and supporting integration meetings with the DOD. Funding for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) category was reaffirmed in January 2005, with the study scheduled for completion in FY 2007. The DOD requested funding for a sled track impact test at Sandia National Laboratories to assess the feasibility of case hardening and target penetration. The Air Force allocated $4.5M in FY 2006 and $3.5M in FY 2007 for a joint study on integrating a conceptual weapon on the B-2 platform, including analysis, specifying requirements, and estimating costs. The Air Force allocated $1.0M in RDT&E-AF and $3.5M in O&M-AF funding for pre-acquisition studies on the feasibility and cost of NG&C concepts for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) concept. The funding will also support logistics planning, aircraft integration, nuclear certification criteria development, and conceptual NG&C design. The O&M funding will support the development of a conceptual NG&C design, risk assessment, identification of B-2 software/hardware issues, and other related logistics and integration efforts. DOD affirmed support for RNEP in 2005, with funding included in the budget at the Secretary of Defense's request. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld requested funds to complete the RNEP study in order to revitalize the nuclear weapons infrastructure and ensure nothing is beyond U.S. power. The Defense Department's request was crucial for DOE's decision to include RNEP in the FY2006 budget. The House Appropriations Committee recommended eliminating NNSA funds for RNEP from the Energy and Water Development Bill, H.R. 2419, citing concerns about diverting resources from the nation's nuclear deterrent management. Despite Secretary of Defense consultation, the Committee expressed disappointment in the bureaucracy's focus on RNEP over sustainable stockpile initiatives. The House passed the bill without amendments on May 24. The House Armed Services Committee recommended transferring $4.0 million in NNSA funds to a separate program in DOD for a penetrator test to evaluate options for defeating hard and deeply buried targets. The House passed the bill without amendments on May 24, with no mention of the Air Force RNEP request. The House passed a bill to transfer funds for a penetrator test to evaluate options for defeating hard and deeply buried targets. The committee Democrats raised concerns about the test potentially involving nuclear payloads. Representative Heather Wilson mentioned that the study would move to the Department of Defense. The House Appropriations Committee's FY2006 DOD Appropriations Bill, H.R. 2863, allocated funds for a conventional penetrator study under the \"Hard and Deeply Buried Target Defeat System.\" The committee intended for the study to focus on nonnuclear means of defeating hard and deeply buried targets, not on the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP). The House passed the bill with no changes, and the Senate Armed Services Committee reported the defense authorization bill. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended eliminating $4.5 million in DOD funding for the RNEP study, stating that the Department of Energy's evaluation of RNEP feasibility is not scheduled to be completed before 2007. The committee suggested providing the $4.0 million requested by NNSA for RNEP. The Senate debated transferring RNEP funds to the Washington, DC, Army National Guard but the amendment was withdrawn. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $4.0 million for NNSA for the RNEP study in the energy and water bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee eliminated $3.5 million for RNEP in the Air Force operation and maintenance account and $1.0 million for RNEP in the Air Force research, development, test, and evaluation account. Additionally, $1.4 million for counterproliferation support was also removed. Senator Domenici issued a press release during the energy and water bill conference. Senator Domenici announced that NNSA had withdrawn its request for RNEP research funding, leading to the removal of RNEP funding in the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act. The focus now shifts to the Defense Department's research on earth-penetrating technology using conventional weapons. The authorization conference report did not allocate funds for RNEP but instead added $4.0 million to DOD for a Hard and Deeply Buried Target Defeat System. The Defense Department allocated funds for a conventional penetrator study under the Hard and Deeply Buried Target Defeat System, while deleting funds for the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP). Hearings in 2005 provided information on RNEP's yield, collateral damage, and military requirement. Representative Terry Everett participated in a colloquy during a February hearing. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld discussed the need for a study on reducing the power of existing weapons to penetrate the earth for national security purposes, emphasizing the importance of protecting the United States. The United States is considering a study on reducing the power of existing weapons to protect the country. General Myers and General Cartwright support the study, which aims to assess feasibility, not commit to a system. Concerns were raised about the radioactive debris that would result from any size of the proposed weapon. The United States is considering a study on reducing the power of existing weapons to protect the country. Administrator Brooks clarified that the RNEP study will not change the physics package of the warhead but will focus on repackaging the device for better penetration of hard geologies. He also emphasized that there are no plans to lower the yield of the weapons. The RNEP study aims to enhance the penetration of existing nuclear weapons without reducing their destructive power. There is no formal military requirement for RNEP, but there is interest from the Department of Defense to continue the study. The administration believes that any notion of non-destructive nuclear weapons is unrealistic. The RNEP study aims to determine the feasibility of enhancing nuclear weapon penetration without reducing their destructive power. Despite no formal military requirement, there is interest from the Department of Defense in the study. The conversion of a B83 bomb to an RNEP would not change its yield. However, RNEP would not penetrate deep enough to contain fallout, resulting in significant fallout and destruction if deployed. The NNSA disbanded RNEP teams in 2005 and closed out the project in 2006, with no funds requested for RNEP in FY2007."
