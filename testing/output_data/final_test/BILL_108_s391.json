    "content": "The Act titled \"Wild Sky Wilderness Act of 2003\" adds to the National Wilderness Preservation System. The Wild Sky Wilderness Act of 2003 designates approximately 106,000 acres of federal lands in Washington as wilderness, adding them to the National Wilderness Preservation System. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to file a map and legal description of the wilderness area with the relevant committees in Congress. The Secretary of Agriculture can correct errors in the legal description and map of the designated wilderness area, which are available for public inspection at the Forest Service office. SEC. 3. ADMINISTRATION PROVISIONS. The Secretary of Agriculture shall manage designated wilderness lands in accordance with the Wilderness Act and this Act, allowing for administrative efficiencies by integrating them with nearby wilderness areas. The Secretary shall also consult on new trails. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a trail plan for Forest Service lands, including hiking and equestrian trails within designated wilderness areas. A report on the trail plan implementation must be completed within two years, identifying priority trails for development. Within the Wild Sky Wilderness, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to use helicopter access to construct and maintain a joint Forest Service and Snohomish County telecommunications repeater site for improving communications. Floatplane access on Lake Isabel is permitted with restrictions, and the operation of the Evergreen Mountain Lookout is not precluded by this Act. Evergreen Mountain Lookout operation and maintenance will continue as before the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to acquire lands, prioritize \"Priority Acquisition Lands,\" and adjust boundaries of national forests. Access to private inholdings within the Wild Sky Wilderness must be ensured. Valuation of private lands for acquisition should not consider restrictions due to wilderness designation. Land exchanges are also addressed. The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to exchange lands with the Chelan County Public Utility District in accordance with specific provisions. If the District offers approximately 371.8 acres within the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, the Secretary must accept. Upon acceptance, the Secretary will convey a permanent easement to the District for helicopter access. The Chelan County Public Utility District is authorized to exchange land with the Secretary of Agriculture to maintain a telemetry site on 1.82 acres in the Wenatchee National Forest. The exchange will be completed if the District conveys acceptable title and ensures no hazardous materials are present. If the District no longer needs the site for monitoring snowpack, they must notify the Secretary to extinguish the easement. If the Chelan County Public Utility District no longer needs the site for monitoring snowpack, they must notify the Secretary to extinguish the easement and revert all rights to the United States. Passed the Senate on November 24, 2003. Attest: EMILY J. REYNOLDS, Secretary."
