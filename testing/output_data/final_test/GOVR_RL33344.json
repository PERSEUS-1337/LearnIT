    "content": "On May 1, 2007, the President vetoed the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Act (H.R. 1591), a bill with housing-related provisions. A new bill (H.R. 2206) was introduced on May 8, 2007, containing the same provisions. The bill includes additional funding for HUD's Inspector General, Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, clarifications on distributing FY2007 Section 8 voucher funding, extending Katrina voucher funds, and treating project-based voucher contracts. On February 15, 2007, President Bush signed a revised yearlong continuing resolution into law (P.L. 110-5) that funds various HUD programs at FY2006 levels, with exceptions for certain programs. Funding levels for Tenant Based Rental Assistance, Project-Based Rental Assistance, Public Housing Operating Fund, Indian Housing Loan Guarantee, Homeless Assistance Grants, and Salaries and Expenses were increased, while funding for Self Help Homeownership, Research and Technology, and Community Development Fund were decreased. The decrease in funding for the Community Development Fund does not affect the primary program funded. The decline in funding for the Community Development Fund is not due to a decrease in funding for the primary program, the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. Instead, it is because Congress chose not to fund the Economic Development Initiatives (EDI) program under the same account. The EDI account typically funds congressionally driven projects. To keep government operations running until final appropriations bills are passed, Congress attached a continuing resolution to the FY2007 Defense Appropriations conference report, which funded HUD programs at the lower of the House-passed or FY2006 enacted levels until November 17, 2006. On November 17, 2006, a continuing resolution (CR) was enacted to fund HUD programs at the lower of the House-passed or FY2006 enacted levels. A second CR was approved on November 15, 2006, and a third CR on December 8, 2006, extending funding through February 15, 2007. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $36.6 billion for HUD on July 20, 2006. The House passed an appropriations bill (H.R. 5576) providing $35.3 billion for HUD, with amendments adopted. The President's FY2007 budget requested $34.1 billion for HUD, representing a 2% increase over FY2006. Most funds are aimed at addressing housing issues for low-income households. HUD programs address housing problems for low-income households, including rental assistance, housing for the elderly, disabled, and homeless. Block grant programs like HOME and CDBG help finance housing and community development activities. HUD also focuses on increasing homeownership rates for lower-income and minority households through FHA-insured mortgages. In December 2005, President signed P.L. 109-115, the FY2006 Appropriations Act for HUD, rejecting cuts to CDBG and Section 811 programs. The bill included nearly $34 billion for HUD, an increase from the President's request. In December 2005, the FY2006 Department of Defense Appropriations bill (P.L. 109-148) was enacted, providing almost $12 billion in supplemental funds for HUD, with $11.5 billion allocated for the CDBG program and $390 million for Disaster Assistance Vouchers. A 1% across-the-board rescission reduced HUD's budget by $380 million. In June 2006, a second supplemental appropriations bill (P.L. 109-234) provided an additional $5.2 billion for CDBG assistance for Hurricane Katrina relief, totaling $16.7 billion. The President's FY2007 budget request for HUD shows a slight increase in overall funding but a slight decrease in appropriations. This is due to a decrease in offsetting collections and receipts. The President's FY2007 budget request for HUD shows a decrease in offsetting collections and receipts, leading to a drop in offsetting receipts by more than a billion dollars. This results in higher appropriations needed to maintain funding levels for programs like the Section 8 voucher program. The President aims to limit domestic discretionary spending increases to the rate of inflation. The President's FY2007 budget request for HUD aims to use taxpayer money more wisely and reform programs. This has led to proposals for flat funding or cuts for many HUD programs, including the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, which funds portable rent subsidies for low-income families. HUD currently administers over two million Section 8 vouchers through local Public Housing Authorities. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is funded by Public Housing Authorities and covers the cost of vouchers and program administration. The majority of funding goes towards voucher renewals, with over 2 million vouchers created by Congress. Funding for vouchers expires annually, leading to potential loss of assistance for families if not renewed. Funding for PHAs has shifted from being based on actual costs to a pro rata share of renewal funding. The funding for the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program has shifted from being based on actual costs to a pro rata share of renewal funding, which has sparked controversy among advocates. HUD supports the current budget-based funding formula, stating it complements the Administration's reform initiative. The President's FY2007 budget requested $14.4 billion for voucher renewals, an increase of 3.5% over FY2006. Most of these funds would have been distributed to PHAs based on their FY2006 eligibility amounts, adjusted for inflation. The Secretary could adjust agency budgets for specific purposes, with overall amounts reduced to fit within the appropriation. Agencies in the Moving to Work demonstration would be funded based on contracts, subject to proration. The budget request aimed to remove a clause from the FY2006 appropriations law. The FY2007 budget requested $14.4 billion for voucher renewals, with most funds distributed to PHAs based on FY2006 eligibility amounts. The House-passed bill removed a clause requiring upfront funding for renewals and lifted the ban on overleasing. An additional $100 million set-aside would be used for agency budget adjustments in response to unforeseen costs. The bill provided $70 million more than the President's request for voucher renewals. The Senate Appropriations Committee-passed version of the FY2007 HUD funding bill included an additional $70 million for voucher renewals, offset by a $100 million reduction in HUD's Working Capital Fund. Funding would be allocated based on agencies' leasing and costs over the past 12 months, adjusted by various factors. Budgets would be prorated to fit within the appropriated amount, with Moving to Work agencies funded according to their agreements. Up to $100 million would have been set aside for project-based commitments. The final FY2007 yearlong CR (P.L. 110-5) funded Section 8 voucher renewals at the President's request and adopted a funding formula similar to the Senate bill. Agencies are funded based on their leasing and cost data for renewals, adjusted for the AAF, with up to $100 million available for adjustments due to increased costs. Agencies are prohibited from overleasing, and Moving to Work agencies are funded based on their agreements. In FY2007, HUD changed the distribution of administrative fees for PHAs to contain costs, with a 4% increase in funding requested. In FY2007, HUD requested a 4% increase in funding for administrative fees, with the House bill proposing a cut of 8% and the Senate bill providing just under $1.3 billion for administrative fees. In FY2007, HUD requested a 4% increase in funding for administrative fees. The Senate bill proposed just under $1.3 billion for administrative fees, with $30 million set aside for PHAs needing extra funds. The FY2007 CR did not specify an amount for administrative fees, but the FY2007 supplemental funding bill (H.R. 2206) would amend the CR to fund administrative fees at the President's requested level. Tenant protection vouchers are provided to families facing displacement due to ending contracts on their assisted units. In FY2006, Congress allocated $178 million for tenant protection vouchers to assist families facing displacement from public housing. The President's FY2007 budget requested $149 million for these vouchers and proposed a new policy to replace only units under lease at the time of demolition or disposition. The President requested that FY2007 appropriations specify tenant protection vouchers only for units under lease. The House bill adopted this language and funding level. The Senate bill did not include the lease restriction but funded vouchers at the President's requested level. The CR did not specify funding, likely at FY2006 level of $178 million, $29 million more than requested. The FY2007 supplemental bill proposes funding vouchers at $149 million. Incremental vouchers have not been funded since FY2002. The Senate Appropriations Committee-passed FY2007 HUD funding bill contained $10 million for new incremental vouchers targeted to the Family Unification Program (FUP), which provides vouchers to families involved in the child welfare system and youths aging out of foster care. This account funds existing project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts between HUD and private landlords, renewing contracts and covering administrative costs. No new contracts have been entered into since the early 1980s. The President's budget requested a 13% increase in project-based renewal funding for FY2007, assuming recaptured funds would supplement the account. The House-passed HUD funding bill provided $200 million less than the request, while the Senate committee version funded it. The CR allocated over $300 million more for contract renewals than the President's request. Contract administrators manage contracts between landlords and HUD. The Administration aims to transfer contract administration to subcontractors for HUD-managed contracts. Funding for contract administrators depends on unobligated balances, with the CR funding at the FY2006 level. The House and Senate bills support the President's request for contract administrators in the Section 8 programs. The Administration requested Congress to rescind $2.5 billion from the Housing Certificate Fund (HCF) in FY2006, but Congress only rescinded about half a billion less. Congress directed the Secretary to inform the committee before using funds from other accounts. The Administration requested Congress to rescind $2 billion from the Housing Certificate Fund (HCF) in FY2007. The House bill matched the President's request, while the Senate committee-passed version included language directing the Secretary to take funds from other accounts if necessary. The Senate committee felt that the Administration did not provide enough evidence for the availability of $2 billion in the HCF. The CR rescinded $1.65 billion in unobligated balances from the public housing program, which provides rental units for low-income families. Funds are provided to over 3,100 public housing authorities for maintenance and modernization through the Operating and Capital Funds. The HOPE VI grant program helps redevelop distressed housing developments into mixed-income communities. In 2007, a new operating subsidy formula will distribute funds to public housing agencies, with some qualifying for increased funding. The President requested $6 million for agencies transitioning to asset-based management. However, the budget was not enough to fund agencies at 100% eligibility, with HUD estimating they would receive only 85%. Advocates believe the final proration could be even lower due to factors like rising utility costs. The President's budget includes a new set-aside for \"housing self sufficiency\" funds, replacing the Graduation Bonus initiative. The Senate bill provides a $100 million increase in funding for formula grants but does not fund the self-sufficiency initiative. Additionally, $30 million is allocated to aid small PHAs in adjusting to the new operating fund formula. The CR provided $300 million more than the President requested for the Operating Fund, but did not include transition or self-sufficiency funding as requested. The funding should be sufficient to cover agencies at around 83% of their formula eligibility. The President's budget proposed an 11% reduction for the public housing Capital Fund and a decrease in funding for formula grants. The Administration claims that the funding requested is sufficient to meet the estimated $2 billion in annual accrual of capital needs, with a backlog of unmet capital needs decreasing. Private financing has been used to secure over $2.5 billion in approved funds, with more pending requests. There was a 37% decrease in funding for the ROSS program, following a previous 29% decrease. The ROSS program funding was decreased by 29% in FY2006, and an additional 37% decrease followed. The program provides job training and supportive services for public housing residents transitioning to work, as well as independent living services for elderly and disabled residents. The President's budget proposed eliminating funding for Neighborhood Networks, which supports community technology centers. The House bill funded the Capital Fund at the President's request, with an added $30 million for the HOPE VI program. No language was included in the bill directing the funds. The Senate committee-passed bill did not specify if the additional $30 million for the Capital Fund would go to the HOPE VI program. Formula grants were slightly increased over FY2006 levels, with funding for the ROSS program at $30 million, $6 million more than requested by the President. The public housing Capital Fund was funded at the FY2006 level, despite no new funding requests for HOPE VI since FY2003. The Administration notes that the HOPE VI program was rated as ineffective in 2003 due to slow expenditure of funds and development costs. Despite largely meeting its goal of eliminating the worst public housing, the President requested no new funding for FY2007. The House version of the funding bill did not provide funds for FY2007 but added $30 million to the Capital Fund, with intentions for the HOPE VI program. The Senate committee-passed version of the bill did not specify an amount for the HOPE VI program, so it is funded at the FY2006 level ($99 million). The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA) reorganized federal housing assistance for Native Americans into a single block grant program. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) provides block grants to Indian tribes for affordable housing activities, with funding requested for FY2007. Both the House and Senate versions of H.R. 5576 would fund NAHASDA at nearly $626 million as per the budget request. HUD determines the allocation to each tribe based on specified criteria. Both versions of H.R. 5576 required HUD to calculate tribe allocations based on single-race and multi-race Census data, with the greater result determining the allocation. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concern over HUD's allocation formula changes and directed HUD to reassess through notice and comment rulemaking. The committee also provided $2 million to NAHIC for training and technical assistance in support of NAHASDA. An administrative provision in the bill required NAHASDA funds for Native Alaskans to be allocated to the same group. The NAHASDA funds for Native Alaskans must be allocated to the same recipients as in FY2005. The Native American Block Grant program was funded at $624 million in FY2006. HOPWA provides housing assistance for low-income persons with HIV/AIDS. The President's budget for FY2007 proposed an increase in funding for HOPWA to over $300 million, which would serve the same number of households as in FY2006 plus 3,500 additional households. The House version of the HUD funding bill (H.R. 5576) passed on June 14, 2006. The House version of the HUD funding bill (H.R. 5576) passed on June 14, 2006, would have funded the HOPWA program at the same level as proposed by the President. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported H.R. 5576 to the Senate on July 26, 2006, providing $295 million for HOPWA, an increase of $9 million over FY2006. The FY2007 yearlong CR did not specify funding for HOPWA, so the FY2006 funding level of $286 million applies for FY2007. The Rural Housing and Economic Development program received no funding in the Administration's proposal or the House-passed version of H.R. 5576. The Administration proposed funding the Rural Housing and Economic Development program through other HUD and USDA programs. The CR maintained funding for the program at the FY2006 level. The CDBG program is a key source of federal assistance for housing and economic development. The Administration's budget request aimed to eliminate several federal economic and community development programs. The Administration proposed consolidating 18 community and economic development programs into the \"Strengthening America's Communities Initiative\" (SACI). Congress rejected the proposal and allocated $4.2 billion for HUD programs, including $3.7 billion for CDBG funding. The FY2007 budget outlined elements of the SACI proposal, funding two of the 18 existing programs. The Administration proposed funding and retooling two community and economic development programs - HUD's CDBG and a new Regional Development Account (RDA) administered by EDA. The proposal includes a new CDBG allocation formula for needy communities, a bonus fund component, reforms addressing program shortcomings, and the creation of the RDA to replace current budget categories. Funding for planning grants and university programs would continue, along with the development of a common set of guidelines. The FY2007 budget proposed funding for Economic Development Districts and university programs, with a total of $3.360 billion allocated, including $3 billion for CDBG and $327.2 million for EDA assistance. A reform proposal for CDBG, The Community Development Block Grant Reform Act of 2006, aimed to replace the dual formula with a single weighted formula targeting assistance based on poverty levels. The Community Development Block Grant Reform Act of 2006 aimed to reform the allocation of funds by targeting assistance based on poverty levels, establishing new criteria for entitlement communities, and creating performance measures and accountability standards. The House approved the HUD funding bill, H.R. 5576 on June 14, 2006, which included $4.2 billion for the Community Development Fund, exceeding the Administration's request by $1.2 billion. The funding level recommended by the House included $3.9 billion for the CDBG formula program, $57 million for Indian tribes, $250 million for EDI assistance, $20 million for Neighborhood Initiative funding, and $15 million for HUD's Brownfields Redevelopment Program. Funding for brownfields was approved as an amendment during floor consideration of the bill. On July 26, 2006, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of H.R. 5576 (S.Rept. 109-293), recommending an appropriation of $4.2 billion for CDF activities. The President signed the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, P.L. 110-5, establishing a $3.772 billion appropriations level for the Community Development Fund account activities, with $3.711 billion for CDBG formula grants. None of the funds could be used for EDI, NI, and YouthBuild activities. No specific funding amount was identified for Indian Tribes CDBG activities. In recent budget cycles, Congress allocated funds for earmarked projects through the EDI and NI accounts. For FY2006, $307 million was approved for 1,126 EDI projects and $49 million for 50 NI projects. The Administration's FY2007 budget proposed rescinding unobligated balances from FY2006. The House-passed H.R. 5576 allocated $250 million for EDI and $20 million for NI, with a new 40% matching funds requirement. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $250 million for EDI and $30 million for NI. The House recommended $30 million in NI assistance, $10 million more than the Senate recommendation. P.L. 110-5 specified that CDF funds were not to be used for EDI or NI activities in FY2007. The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows states and communities to leverage their CDBG allocation for redevelopment projects. The House Appropriations Committee did not include funding for the program in the bill. During floor consideration, the House approved an amendment for over $2.9 million for the Section 108 loan guarantee program in FY2007, offsetting funds from HUD's management account. The Senate recommended $3 million for loan guarantee activities, and the FY2007 CR maintained funding at the FY2006 level. The Brownfields Redevelopment program assists cities in redeveloping abandoned industrial sites. The Administration did not request funding for the brownfield program for FY2007, but the House approved an amendment to allocate $15 million for it. This funding would have been offset by reducing funding for the IRS business systems modernization program. The availability of Section 108 loan guarantees for FY2007 could support HUD's brownfield program as authorized by law. The HUD program restricts brownfield funds to projects with Section 108 loan guarantees. Small communities face challenges accessing the program without state cooperation. In 2006, H.R. 280 aimed to separate the brownfield program from the loan guarantee program for easier access. The HOME Investment Partnership Program, created in 1990, provides block grant funding for affordable housing initiatives, including acquisition, rehabilitation, and new construction. The program also funds related initiatives like the American Dream Downpayment Initiative for first-time home buyers. HUD provides grants for housing counseling assistance to first-time home buyers, including counseling on predatory lending, Homeownership Voucher Program, colonias, and Home Equity Conversion Mortgage counseling. The President proposed a 7% increase in funding for HOME formula grants, following a previous decrease. The FY2007 requested level was slightly higher than the FY2005 enacted level. The House-passed bill proposed a 2% increase in formula grants funding over the President's request for FY2007. The Senate committee-passed bill included a larger increase, with a 3% increase over the President's request. The Continuing Resolution (CR) funded the entire account at the FY2006 level. The President requested $100 million for the Affordable Housing Development Initiative (ADDI) in FY2007, half of his previous requests. The President requested $100 million for the Affordable Housing Development Initiative (ADDI) in FY2007, which is half of his previous requests but four times more than what Congress provided in FY2006. The House-passed and Senate committee-passed bills proposed funding ADDI at $25 million, while the Continuing Resolution (CR) funded it at the FY2006 level. Congress has consistently rejected the President's proposal to fund housing counseling assistance in a separate account, instead of as a set-aside within the HOME program. One possible reason for this could be the jurisdictional differences between the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development and the Assistant Secretary for Housing at HUD. The House-passed and Senate committee-passed bills would have continued funding for housing counseling assistance within the HOME account at $42 million for FY2007, the same as FY2006 enacted level. The CR funds housing counseling assistance at the FY2006 level as well. This account was created in FY2006 to fund programs previously under the CDBG program, including the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP) which provides grants for self-help homeownership opportunities. The Section 4 Capacity Building grants aim to enhance the capabilities of community development organizations. Funding for SHOP in FY2007 saw a $19.9 million increase request, with no proposed funding for capacity building grants. Nonprofit organizations like LISC, Habitat for Humanity, and YouthBuild USA typically receive these grants. The House bill maintained funding for Self Help and Assisted Homeownership at FY2006 levels but with a different distribution. The Senate bill allocated $66 million for account activities, nearly $6 million more than FY2006. The FY2007 CR funded the Self-Help and Assisted Homeownership account at $49 million, with $20 million for SHOP and $30 million for capacity building grants. Funding was not provided for several nonprofit organizations that received direct funding in FY2006. Homeless Assistance Grants encompass four programs authorized by the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and administered by HUD. Three programs are competitive grant programs: the Supportive Housing Program, Shelter Plus Care program, and Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Assistance for Single Room Occupancy. The House of Representatives passed the FY2007 HUD funding bill (H.R. 5576) allocating $1.5 billion to Homeless Assistance Grants, an increase of $210 million over FY2006. The bill did not include funding for the Samaritan Initiative and Prisoner Re-Entry Initiative proposed by the Administration. The Senate version allocated $25 million less to Homeless Assistance Grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee version of the FY2007 HUD funding bill allocated $25 million less to Homeless Assistance Grants than the President's request and the House proposal. However, total funding was still increased by nearly $185 million over FY2006. The yearlong CR (P.L. 110-5) enacted on February 15, 2007, specified funding for Homeless Assistance Grants at $1.442 billion for FY2007, an increase of $115 million over FY2006. The Section 202 housing for the elderly program and the Section 811 housing for the disabled program provide capital grants and ongoing project rental assistance contracts to developers of new subsidized housing for these populations. The Section 202 housing for the elderly program and the Section 811 housing for the disabled program provide capital grants and ongoing project rental assistance contracts to developers of new subsidized housing for these populations. The Administration's budget proposed a cut in funding for the housing for the elderly program, but the House-passed version of the HUD funding bill would have increased funding. The bill allocated $747 million for the program, including an additional $12 million for the Section 202 program. Funding for service coordinators would also increase from $51 million to $59 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee's version of H.R. 5576 proposed an increase in funding for assisted living facilities by $3.5 million, bringing the total to $750 million. The yearlong CR for FY2007 did not specify funding for elderly housing, maintaining it at the FY2006 amount of $734.58 million. The Administration's budget for FY2007 suggested cutting funding for the Section 811 program in half to $119 million from $237 million in FY2006. The House version of H.R. 5576 proposed an increase in funding for the Section 811 program by $120 million more than the President's proposal, totaling nearly $240 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee's version would have slightly increased funding and provided $5 million for new vouchers. The yearlong CR funded Section 811 at the FY2006 level of $236.6 million. Insurance programs like FHA provide lenders with protection against losses from loan defaults by borrowers, enabling borrowers to access loans for various purposes such as home purchase, home improvement, and construction of apartments, hospitals, and nursing homes. The programs are administered through two accounts - Mutual Mortgage Insurance/Cooperative Management Housing Insurance fund and General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance fund. The President's FY2007 budget proposed reforms to make the FHA single family insurance program more flexible in responding to changes in the mortgage market. The FHA reform program aimed to provide a lower-cost alternative to borrowers and prevent predatory lending. The budget proposed transferring housing programs to the MMI fund. H.R. 5576 included some of the Administration's reform proposals. The House-passed version of H.R. 5576 sought to limit FHA-insured home loans based on area median prices or Freddie Mac limits. Loan limits for low-cost areas would have been raised. The Senate committee did not include provisions to allow FHA to insure 100% mortgages and determine down payments based on borrower default risk. Concerns were raised about moving FHA closer to becoming the lender of last resort. The budget and H.R. 5576 limited FHA mortgage insurance to $220 billion in FY2007. The budget and H.R. 5576 limited FHA mortgage insurance to $220 billion in FY2007, including commitments under different accounts. No FHA reforms were enacted before the close of the 109th Congress. The estimates of offsetting receipts for FY2007 are lower than FY2006, resulting in different total expenses amounts. In FY2006, the Congressional Budget Office estimated HUD would use $5 million in additional contract authority, which was not included in the House Appropriations Committee's estimates of the CR. For FY2007, the President's budget requested $10.6 million for administrative expenses related to the mortgage-backed securities program and proposed legislative changes for Ginnie Mae. The budget proposed shifting funding from mandatory to discretionary, including charging fees for Ginnie Mae securities. OFHEO, responsible for overseeing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, faced criticism for ineffectiveness. H.R. 1461 aimed to merge OFHEO with HUD's regulatory division into a new independent agency. The House-passed bill aimed to merge OFHEO and HUD's regulatory division into a new independent agency called the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Funding for OFHEO was not specified in the CR, so it remains at the FY2006 enacted level. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity enforces laws against housing discrimination based on various factors through programs like FHAP and FHIP. The Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) provides grants for fair housing education and enforcement. Both versions of H.R. 5576 aimed to fund the program at around $44.55 million, with slight variations between the House-passed and Senate committee versions. The budget also allocated funds for the Fair Housing Assistance Program and requested $19.8 million for FHIP, with the House bill proposing a slight decrease in funding. The House bill proposed decreasing funding for the Fair Housing Training Academy to $18.8 million, while the Senate committee aimed to fund it at over $24 million. Legislation to collect tuition fees from participants was not enacted before the end of the 109th Congress. The FY2007 CR maintained fair housing program funding at FY2006 levels. The Lead Hazard Control at HUD oversees programs to reduce lead-based paint hazards in homes, with the budget requesting $114.8 million for FY2007. The House bill allocated the same amount, while the Senate committee proposed $152 million. The Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R) at HUD is responsible for maintaining information on housing needs, market conditions, and programs. The Research and Technology account funds PD&R's core research, including Section 107 University Partnerships for neighborhood development. The Administration did not allocate funding for the PATH program in graduate-level community building curricula. The House and Senate bills included $5 million for PATH, but the CR provided over $50 million for the Research and Technology account, with none of the funds designated for PATH."
