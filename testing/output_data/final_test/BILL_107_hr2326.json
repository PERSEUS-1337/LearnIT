It excludes vehicles designed to operate solely on traditional fuels. The \"Alternative Fuel Vehicle Acceleration Act of 2001\" defines an alternative fuel vehicle as one powered by electricity, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, hydrogen, or methanol at 85% volume. It excludes vehicles designed to operate solely on gasoline or diesel derived from fossil fuels, unless determined otherwise by the Secretary of Energy. The term \"pilot program\" refers to the competitive grant program established under section 3. The \"Alternative Fuel Vehicle Acceleration Act of 2001\" defines alternative fuel vehicles and establishes a pilot program. The Secretary will establish a grant program for alternative fuel vehicles for State and local governments. Grants can be used for acquiring various types of vehicles for public transportation and airport operations. The Secretary will establish a grant program for alternative fuel vehicles for State and local governments, including infrastructure and operation/maintenance support. Applications must be submitted by the head of a government or transportation authority. The grant program for alternative fuel vehicles for State and local governments will include projects for direct transfer of passengers or goods between alternative fuel vehicles in a linked transportation system. The application must include project descriptions, ridership estimates, air pollution reductions, and plans for collecting environmental data. The application for the grant program must include a description of how the projects will be sustainable without Federal assistance, costs of each project, and details on which costs will be supported by Federal assistance or non-Federal partners. Partnerships with private entities are allowed in the pilot program. The Secretary will prioritize applications based on environmental protection, commitment to funding, and project sustainability beyond Federal assistance. Projects must exceed minimum requirements. The Secretary will not provide more than $20,000,000 in Federal assistance to any applicant under the pilot program. Additionally, the Secretary will not fund any applicant for more than 5 years and will aim for nationwide deployment of alternative fuel vehicles.

The Secretary will select all grant applications for projects under the pilot program through competitive, peer review. SEC. 4. REPORTS TO CONGRESS. The Secretary must provide a report to Congress within 60 days of awarding grants, detailing grant recipients, project descriptions, and mechanisms for knowledge transfer. Additionally, an evaluation must be conducted 3 years after the enactment of the Act and annually thereafter until the pilot program ends. The Secretary will provide Congress with a report evaluating the effectiveness of the pilot program, including benefits to the environment from projects and potential benefits from widespread use of alternative fuel vehicles. Authorization of appropriations: $200,000,000 is authorized to the Secretary for carrying out the Act, with funds remaining available until expended."
