    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers benefits such as medical care, disability compensation, education, and home loan guarantees to eligible veterans. The VA operates nationwide through three administrations and the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA), with the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) handling compensation, pensions, and education assistance, and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) maintaining national veterans' cemeteries and providing burial benefits. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides health care services, medical research programs, and education for veterans. It offers primary and specialized care, inpatient and outpatient services, and support to dependents through CHAMPVA. VHA also serves as a backup to the Department of Defense during emergencies and supports the National Disaster Medical System. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides health care services, medical research programs, and education for veterans. Eligibility for VA health care is based on military service and service-connected disabilities. Veterans must enroll in the VA health care system to receive medical care and may receive care from other sources like Medicare and Medicaid. VA-enrolled veterans do not pay premiums for care but may have out-of-pocket costs like copayments. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 aimed to improve access to medical care for veterans by establishing the Veterans Choice Program, allowing veterans to receive care outside the VA system if they meet certain criteria. Congress provided $10 billion in funding for the program over three years. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 established the Choice Program with $10 billion in funding over three years. An additional $5 billion was allocated to improve veterans' access to healthcare and VA infrastructure. These funds are separate from regular appropriations and are in addition to previous funding acts. In FY2016, the VA estimates there will be approximately 21.4 million living veterans, with around 9.4 million enrolled in the VA health care system. In FY2016, the VA estimates treating about 6.2 million unique veteran patients, with over 844,000 Operation. In FY2016, VA anticipates treating 6.2 million unique veteran patients, including over 844,000 OEF, OIF, and OND veterans, representing 12.3% of overall patients. The number of patients treated by the VA is expected to grow by 9% between FY2012 and FY2016. Additionally, the VHA will provide medical care to non-veterans, with a projected increase of over 11,000 patients in FY2016. Overall, the VHA is estimated to treat nearly 6.9 million patients in FY2016, an increase of 1.8% from FY2015. The report focuses on appropriations for VHA, with a brief overview of VHA's budget formulation and accounts. In 2009, Congress authorized advance appropriations for three VHA accounts. The Department of Veterans Affairs was required to request advance appropriations for VHA annually starting in FY2010. Congress provided advance appropriations for VHA accounts in subsequent fiscal years, including FY2011, FY2012, FY2013, FY2014, and FY2015. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 83; P.L. 113-235) provided advance appropriations for FY2016 and amended 38 U.S.C \u00a7117 to include three more accounts. Three mandatory VA accounts under the Veterans Benefits Administration are authorized to receive advance appropriations. Beginning with the FY2016 MILCON-VA Appropriations bill, those accounts would receive advance appropriations for FY2017. The VA budget includes both mandatory and discretionary funding. Mandatory accounts fund disability compensation, pensions, vocational rehabilitation, education, and other benefits. Advance appropriations are scored in the fiscal year they become available for obligation, not when enacted. Funding tables show advance appropriations separately under the label \"memorandum\" in the corresponding fiscal year column. The VA budget includes mandatory and discretionary funding for various benefits and services such as vocational rehabilitation, education, and healthcare. In FY2015, the total budget authority was $159.1 billion, with discretionary funding accounting for 40.7% ($65 billion) and the majority going towards VA health care programs. The VA's budget authority for FY2016 was approximately $164.6 billion, with mandatory funding accounting for 59.3% of the total budget. Disability compensation and pension programs received the majority of this funding. The discretionary programs budget mainly allocated for medical care for veterans, while mandatory programs focused on benefits like disability compensation and pensions. The VA begins formulating its budget request about 10 months before the President submits it to Congress. The VHA's budget request to Congress is based on the Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (EHCPM) and the Civilian Health and Medical Program Veterans Administration (CHAMPVA) Model, which estimate the resources needed for health care services. The EHCPM projects the number of veterans enrolled, utilization of services, and unit costs. Adjustments are made for VA healthcare characteristics and veteran demographics. The EHCPM and CHAMPVA Models are used by VHA to project resources needed for health care services for veterans. The EHCPM makes projections for future years based on data on health care utilization rates and economic trends. The CHAMPVA Model, adopted in 2010, estimates the cost of providing medical coverage to CHAMPVA-eligible beneficiaries through enrollment and claims cost projections. The VHA's appropriations account structure has evolved over the years, with funding coming from various sources including medical care, research, and administration. Congress made changes in FY2004 for better oversight and accurate fund allocation. The Department of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2004 funded VHA through four accounts: medical services, medical administration, medical facilities, and medical and prosthetic research. The medical services account covers expenses for inpatient and outpatient care, treatment of veterans, medical supplies, salaries, aid to state veterans' homes, and support services for family caregivers of veterans. The Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 authorized services for family caregivers of veterans. Funding for biomedical engineering services was transferred to this account in FY2013. This account covers expenses for managing, securing, and administering the VA health care system, including VA medical centers, community-based outpatient clinics, and Vet Centers. It also funds VISN offices, facility director offices, public health programs, and quality management. The VHA's medical facilities account funds expenses for operations, maintenance, and infrastructure. This includes utilities, administrative expenses, construction projects, leases, laundry services, grounds maintenance, and research programs focused on veterans' healthcare needs. The VA's research program includes various types of research funded by sources like the DOD, NIH, and private sources. Research is mainly conducted by VA investigators at VA facilities. Unlike other agencies, the VA does not grant research funds to non-VA entities. Congress has authorized the VHA to bill some veterans and health insurers for nonservice-connected care. The VA is authorized to bill veterans and health insurers for nonservice-connected care to help cover the cost of medical services. The VA estimates collecting $2.4 billion in 2016. The President's FY2015 budget requested $158.6 billion for the VA, with $56.6 billion allocated for VHA. The President's budget requested $58.6 billion in advance appropriations for medical care accounts for FY2016. The House passed the MILCON-VA Appropriations bill for FY2015 totaling $158.2 billion.
