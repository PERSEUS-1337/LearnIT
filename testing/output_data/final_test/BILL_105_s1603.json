Torture is deliberate mental and physical damage to individuals, with long-term effects. Repressive governments use torture to eliminate opposition and terrorize society. Torture survivors face ongoing threats, especially when perpetrators are not held accountable. (5) Many refugees and asylees in the United States have been victims of torture and deserve prompt consideration for political asylum. Torture survivors living in the US should receive rehabilitation services to become productive members of society. (6) A treatment movement for torture survivors should be developed. The development of a treatment movement for torture survivors has created new opportunities for action by the United States and other nations to oppose state-sponsored torture. A comprehensive strategy is needed to protect and support torture victims and their treatment providers, along with efforts to eliminate torture globally. The United States can help heal the effects of torture and prevent its use worldwide by acting to heal survivors and protect their families.

Aliens who claim to have been tortured or are believed to have been tortured are considered for refugee status, asylum, or withholding of removal. Officials must consider how torture may affect the applicant's responses and the challenges torture victims face in recounting their suffering. Victims also fear returning to their country. Refugees who have been tortured are given priority for resettlement in the United States under expedited processing. Special procedures are in place for aliens who are victims of torture, ensuring their consideration for asylum and withholding of removal. Aliens who claim to have been tortured are given expedited processing for asylum interviews or removal proceedings, ensuring prompt consideration for asylum or withholding of removal. Aliens claiming torture receive expedited processing for asylum interviews or removal proceedings to ensure prompt consideration for asylum or withholding of removal, with the option to delay proceedings if mental or physical symptoms from torture are present. Aliens claiming torture may require more time to recover before testifying. A finding that an alien is described in subsection (a) is a strong basis for granting parole instead of detention. Additionally, aliens described in the Survivors of Torture Support Act are exempt from expedited removal.
