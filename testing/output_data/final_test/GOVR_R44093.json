When considering the broader food and beverage sectors, the industry's share of the California economy was estimated at nearly 5%. Studies by the University of California have shown the significant economic contribution of major farming sectors, such as the dairy industry which contributed $20.8 billion in 2014. California's almond industry contributed $21.5 billion in total economic impacts in 2014, with a $1 billion increase in agricultural production resulting in a $2.63 billion increase in gross state product. The agricultural sector in California accounted for over 412,000 jobs in 2014, representing more than 2% of overall employment and up to 6.7% of the private sector labor force when including related processing industries. The agricultural sector in California contributes significantly to the state's economy, with estimates showing that each job in agricultural production and processing accounts for 2.2 jobs in the overall economy. California ranks as the leading state nationwide in agricultural sales, with farm-level sales totaling nearly $45 billion in 2012. Five counties in California, including Tulare, Kern, Fresno, Monterey, and Merced, are among the leading agricultural counties in the United States, with reported farm sales of $28.7 billion. California's diverse farm sector produces over 400 commodities, with the top 10 valued commodities in 2013 including milk, almonds, grapes, cattle, strawberries, walnuts, lettuce, hay, tomatoes, and nursery plants. Alfalfa and forage crops are essential inputs for the state's dairy and animal agriculture. California's agricultural sectors are crucial for the state's overall market value, with specialty crops like fruits, vegetables, nuts, and horticulture leading the way. The state is a national leader in agricultural production, accounting for over one-third of all specialty crops sold in the U.S. California also supplies the majority of U.S. production for crops like raisins, almonds, walnuts, nectarines, and pistachios. Additionally, many of these crops are important U.S. agricultural exports. California's agricultural sector is a national leader in specialty crop production, with a focus on fruits, vegetables, and tree nuts. The state's farms receive less federal support compared to the national average, as specialty crop producers do not benefit directly from commodity-specific farm programs. There has been a shift towards high-value crops in California, such as fruits and vegetables, leading to a decline in harvested acres of traditional field crops from 1960 to 2009. From 1960 to 2009, harvested and bearing acres in fruits, nuts, and vegetables nearly doubled from 1.9 million acres to 3.7 million acres. Total harvested acres decreased from 8.5 million acres in the 1970s to 7.7 million acres in 2009. In 2013, total harvested acres were 7.9 million, with drought years like 2009 and 2013 contributing to lower acreage. Overall, there has been a decline in total acres of farming operations in recent years, particularly in California. There is a shift towards growing more permanent orchard crops, such as fruit trees, which require long periods of maturation before bearing fruit. Unlike annual crops, orchard crops cannot be fallowed in dry years without loss of investment. Overall, there has been a decline in total acres of farming operations in recent years, particularly in California. There is a shift towards growing more permanent orchard crops, such as fruit trees, which require long periods of maturation before bearing fruit. Vegetables and other row crops are annual crops that are both sown and harvested during the same production year, sometimes more than once. From 2004 to 2013, overall harvested acres increased for almonds, walnuts, pistachios, raisins, grapes, berries, cherries, pomegranates, and olives, but also for certain grain and feed crops. During the same period, overall harvested acreage decreased for some field crops and certain orchard crops. By 2013, the number of harvested acres for some orchard crops had risen significantly. The Agricultural Commissioners' Reports in Figure 4 show discrepancies between projected and actual acreage levels. For instance, almond and pistachio acres exceeded 900,000 acres in 2013, surpassing the 1994 projection of 600,000 acres by 2020. In contrast, cotton acreage dropped to under 300,000 acres in 2013 from the projected 1.2 million acres by 2020. The shift to growing more permanent orchard crops seems market-driven, with farmers responding to higher prices and rising demand for fruits and vegetables. The rising demand for specific crop varieties in California since the 1960s has led to a shift towards less water-intensive crops like forage and oilseed crops. Producers may also invest in higher-value crops such as fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Despite a constant total crop acreage of 8 million acres, total crop production increased from 33 million tons in 1960 to over 73 million tons in 2009. Total crop production in California rose significantly from nearly 33 million tons in 1960 to over 73 million tons in 2009, driven by improved productivity and efficiency at the farm level. Despite declines in field crop acres, volume production increased, with fruits and vegetables showing the most significant growth. The availability of irrigation water played a crucial role in supporting this expansion, especially in areas with insufficient rainfall for desired crop yields. Estimates of water use in California vary widely, with sources like USGS and DWR providing different data on water withdrawals and use for irrigation agriculture. USGS estimates that roughly 60% of water withdrawals are used for agriculture, while DWR indicates around 40% is used for irrigated agriculture. In 2010, USGS estimated total water use in California at 42.6 million acre-feet. In 2010, USGS estimated that 61% of total water withdrawn in California is used for agricultural irrigation, amounting to 25.8 million acre-feet per year. This estimate includes water from surface and groundwater sources applied to various uses, but does not account for water consumed by agricultural activities. The California Department of Water Resources (DWR) estimates water use for agricultural irrigation at 33 million acre-feet (MAF), accounting for about 41% of total water use in a normal year. This total includes water from surface and groundwater sources dedicated to developed water supply, as well as water in streams and returned to groundwater and surface. The estimate differs from the widely cited 80% agricultural water use figure, which may have originated from other DWR or USGS publications. Different estimates of water supply and use in California are based on different survey methods and assumptions. Some agencies calculate water use by estimating the amount withdrawn from natural sources, while others use total water supplies as a baseline. Water uses can be defined in various ways, such as water withdrawn for use or total water withdrawn and used minus evaporation. When analyzing California's water supply and usage, it is crucial to consider whether the data reflects gross water use or water consumed in different purposes. Various agencies use different methods to estimate water supply and use, leading to a range of reported numbers. The Department of Water Resources (DWR) now includes natural flows and environmental allocations in their calculations, while the US Geological Survey (USGS) estimates total water withdrawn from natural and developed sources. The USGS estimates total water withdrawn from natural and developed sources, while DWR includes natural flows and environmental allocations in their calculations. Stakeholders in California's agricultural sectors dispute the 80% water use estimate, with some arguing that DWR's estimate of 41% is more accurate. Much of the water deemed as dedicated and developed by DWR is from North Coast rivers and streams, not readily available for use other than for environmental purposes. Most \"environmental\" water use occurs in the North Coast area. California has the largest number of irrigated farmed acres in the United States, with about 4 million acres irrigated with groundwater and 1 million acres with on-farm surface water. Another 4 million acres are irrigated with off-farm surface water. Total agricultural water use in California has remained steady since 2000. California and Texas are the largest water irrigators among western states. California and Texas are the largest water users in the United States, with California having the largest number of irrigated farmed acres. Irrigation plays a significant role in California's agricultural production, especially in the arid San Joaquin Valley. California's water use per acre is among the highest in the country, with irrigation water demand peaking in the spring and summer months. The data shows irrigation water application rates for selected California crops, ranging from 0.6 to 4.5 acre-feet per acre. Data is aggregated for most crops, but not available for individual orchard crops like almonds and vineyard crops. In California, irrigated acres are mainly used for orchards, vegetables, alfalfa, hay, pastureland, and grain crops. Different crops have varying water application rates, with some requiring more than 5 AF per acre, while most vegetables use under 2 AF per acre. Adjusting irrigation rates and acreage for individual crops is essential for efficient water management. Figure 10 illustrates the distribution of net water use in California across different crops, totaling around 20 MAF. Leading crops account for three-fourths of agricultural water use, with varying usage by crop category. Crops with high economic revenue per unit of water also have high employment and land area. California's high per-acre irrigation water use is attributed to factors like low rainfall, limited freshwater sources, long growing seasons, and dry conditions. California's high per-acre irrigation water use is influenced by factors like low rainfall, limited freshwater sources, longer growing seasons, and dry conditions. Despite investments in more efficient irrigation systems, flood and furrow irrigation still dominate, accounting for 43% of all irrigated acres in 2010. However, the adoption of drip and microsprinkler systems has more than doubled between 1991 and 2010, accounting for 39% of all irrigated acres in 2010. The adoption of more efficient irrigation methods in California may be due to reduced water supplies from droughts and cost savings. Drip and microsprinkler systems have the highest efficiency ratings, while surface irrigation systems vary widely in efficiency. The choice of irrigation system depends on factors like financing, soil type, topography, and crop type. Investment in efficient irrigation technology is influenced by factors like soil type, topography, crop type, and economic considerations. Drip irrigation systems are limited by cost, with estimates ranging from $1,000 to $3,000 per acre, excluding installation. Maintenance and repair costs can add another $100 to $300 per acre annually. The choice of irrigation method varies among hydrologic regions in California, with trends showing a shift towards more efficient systems from 1991 to 2011. In 2013, California farmers invested $600 million in irrigation equipment for irrigated land. Between 2003 and 2008, over $1.5 billion was spent on drip and microsprinkler irrigation technology, covering 1.3 million acres. Despite previous efficiency gains, ongoing efforts and investments in irrigation technology continue in response to current water shortages and drought conditions. The California Farm Bureau Federation (CFBF) reports ongoing investments in irrigation technology by farmers, including subsurface drip irrigation and other improvements. These investments have allowed producers to increase crop yields on the same amount of water. Studies suggest potential reductions in agricultural water use through improved technology and management practices. A 2009 study by the Pacific Institute and a 2014 analysis by the NRDC reported potential water savings of 4.5-6.6 million acre-feet per year from improved technology and water management in agriculture. Critics argue that these savings are overstated compared to previous studies by university researchers. Some object to a study's assumptions on crop shifts and market demand influencing farmers' choices. Concerns raised about claims of no impact on agricultural productivity from irrigation reductions, citing past studies estimating economic losses from drought. UC-Davis researchers project $1.8 billion in direct economic costs to agricultural sectors in 2015 due to drought, covering revenue losses and water pumping costs. Debate continues on water savings from improved irrigation efficiency. California's agricultural industry plays a crucial role in the state's economy and the nation's food supply, focusing on high-value crops like fruits, vegetables, and tree nuts. The shift towards these crops is market-driven, leading to debates on whether water savings from improved irrigation efficiency will result in overall water savings or support further agricultural expansion. Confusion over water usage for crop growth in California arises from differing definitions used by reporting agencies. Baseline differences in water use and supply definitions used by different agencies reporting data."
