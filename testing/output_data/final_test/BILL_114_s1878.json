    "content": "The \"Advancing Hope Act of 2016\" reauthorizes a program for priority review to encourage treatments for rare pediatric diseases. It amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to focus on serious or life-threatening diseases affecting individuals aged from birth to 18 years. The Advancing Hope Act of 2016 amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require sponsors of rare pediatric disease products to notify the Secretary of their intent to request a priority review voucher upon submission of the product application. Products submitted but not approved by the date of the Advancing Hope Act of 2016 enactment are eligible for a priority review voucher. Products submitted between 90 days after the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 and before the Advancing Hope Act of 2016 enactment, meeting criteria for a priority review voucher, are eligible. The sponsor of a drug application must notify the Secretary 90 days before submitting a human drug application with a priority review voucher. This notification is a binding commitment to pay the required user fee. The sponsor can transfer the voucher after providing this notice. The sponsor of a drug application can transfer the priority review voucher after notifying the Secretary 90 days before submitting the human drug application. The Secretary cannot award any priority review vouchers after December 31, 2016, and a sponsor of a rare pediatric disease product application cannot receive more than one voucher for the same drug. Nothing in the Act affects the validity of previously issued vouchers. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on the effectiveness of priority review vouchers for drugs treating rare pediatric diseases. The study will analyze the approved indications for drugs awarded with these vouchers under specific acts. The study will analyze the impact of priority review vouchers on sponsors' decisions to invest in developing drugs for rare pediatric diseases. It will also examine the indications and benefits of drugs approved with these vouchers, including addressing unmet medical needs and potential patient reach. The study will analyze the impact of priority review vouchers on drug development for rare pediatric diseases, including the number of patients treated, value of transferred vouchers, and time between award and use. It will also assess the FDA's resources in implementing the program and its effect on drug review processes and public health outcomes. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report by January 31, 2022, to the Senate and House committees on the study analyzing the impact of priority review vouchers on drug development for rare pediatric diseases. The report will include alternative approaches to improve the program's targeting towards developing clinically important drugs for rare pediatric diseases. The curr_chunk can be summarized as: \n\n\"Speaker of the House of Representatives and Vice President of the United States.\""
