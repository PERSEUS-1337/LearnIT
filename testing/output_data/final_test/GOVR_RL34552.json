The FY2009 international affairs budget requested $5.12 billion, with a focus on transitioning foreign affairs programs from anti-communism to anti-terrorism post 9/11. During the Cold War, foreign aid pursued various U.S. policy goals such as economic development, trade interests, education, health care, human rights, and environmental protection. In the 1990s, goals expanded to include nuclear weapons proliferation, drug trafficking, peace efforts in the Middle East, regional stability, religious freedom, and countering trafficking in persons. Since the September 11 terrorist attacks, U.S. foreign aid and diplomatic programs have shifted focus to contribute to the war on terrorism. President Bush's National Security Strategy in 2002 established global development as a key pillar of U.S. national security. Foreign assistance budget justifications began highlighting the war on terrorism as a top priority, emphasizing aid to countries cooperating in the fight against terrorism. The Bush Administration announced significant initiatives relating to diplomacy and foreign aid post 9/11, including a new transformational diplomacy initiative in 2006. This initiative repositioned diplomats to global trouble spots, created regional public diplomacy centers, localized small posts outside of foreign capitals, and trained diplomats in new skills. In 2006, the Bush Administration created the Director of Foreign Assistance (DFA) position at the State Department to oversee aid programs and promote coordination, coherence, transparency, and accountability. The Millennium Challenge Corporation, established in 2004, focuses on delivering higher amounts of U.S. resources to select low-income countries. In 2004, the Bush Administration aimed to concentrate more U.S. resources in low-income countries committed to reforms. President Bush pledged $15 billion over five years to combat HIV/AIDS through PEPFAR, focusing on 15 countries in Africa. Additionally, the President launched the PMI in 2005, pledging $1.2 billion to combat malaria by 2010, benefiting African nations and fulfilling the pledge to double aid to Africa from 2004-2010. The Bush Administration aimed to increase aid to Africa through initiatives like PEPFAR and PMI. In 2007, an additional $30 billion was committed to HIV/AIDS. Other foreign policy goals included supporting peace in the Middle East, democratization efforts in crisis countries, and combating international narcotics production. The international affairs budget, divided into State Department and Foreign Operations, has fluctuated in response to global events. The FY2009 budget request seeks $39.5 billion, including a new program called the Civilian Stabilization Initiative to aid countries transitioning from war to peace. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, FY2009 (H.R. 1105) was signed into law (P.L. 111-8) on March 11, 2009, with a budget request of $11.456 billion for the Department of State, including increases for international broadcasting and related agencies like the Broadcasting Board of Governors and U.S. contributions to the United Nations.

The FY2007 supplemental provided $50 million for establishing the Civilian Reserve Corps (CRC), with a requirement for authorization to spend the money. The Administration is now requesting $248.6 million for the Civilian Stabilization Initiative, including CRC, in FY2009. Concerns have been raised about the Department of Defense's expanding role in civilian overseas activities, with some suggesting that certain missions are better suited for civilian experts. NGOs have also expressed concerns about working closely with the military. Some analysts believe the United States needs civilian personnel trained to work with the military for post-conflict needs. The Bush Administration has started developing a small civilian capability through the Civilian Stabilization Initiative. The Bush Administration established the State Department Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) in 2004 to operationalize civilian agencies for reconstruction and stabilization missions. Congress endorsed S/CRS's creation and defined its responsibilities. S/CRS has worked on developing the Civilian Response Corps (CRC) for these missions. The CRC was developed for reconstruction and stabilization missions, with legislation introduced by Senators Lugar and Biden to support civilian capabilities. The latest bill, S. 613, and a similar bill, H.R. 1084, include authorization for the CRC. The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved H.R. 1084, which authorizes the $50 million appropriated in the FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill for the CRC. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 authorized the Response Readiness Corps and the Civilian Response Corps (CRC).

Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, foreign assistance has gained importance in U.S. foreign policy, being recognized as a tool of national security alongside defense and diplomacy. The U.S. foreign aid infrastructure has faced scrutiny for being outdated and inefficient. The U.S. foreign aid infrastructure, dating back to the Cold War era, is seen as cumbersome and lacking a national aid strategy. Recent initiatives have sparked congressional interest in re-evaluating foreign assistance policy. In 2006, Secretary of State Rice introduced a new position, Director of Foreign Assistance (DFA), to coordinate aid programs. The DFA, also serving as Administrator of USAID, developed a Strategic Framework for Foreign Assistance to align programs with strategic objectives. The FY2008 and FY2009 budget requests were guided by reforms to elevate foreign aid as a foreign policy tool. The proposed 8.8% increase in the FY2009 budget focuses on the war on terrorism, reconstruction in Afghanistan and Iraq, and assistance to front-line states. Significant increases are seen in initiatives like the Millennium Challenge Corporation.

U.S. foreign assistance would increase to all regions except East Asia and Pacific, which would decline by 18.7%, and Europe, which would decline by 6.4%. The EAP decline is due in part to accounting adjustments, while the decline in aid to Europe reflects the graduation from development assistance of 11 countries in the region. The Western Hemisphere region would receive the highest increase in U.S. aid, up by 39.7% over FY2008 estimates, largely due to the M\u00e9rida Initiative for Mexico. Africa would see a 2% increase in FY2009, with no increase in Global HIV/AIDS funds. The FY2009 foreign aid budget request includes significant increases for various programs in different regions, with some programs experiencing reductions compared to FY2008 levels. South and Central Asia would see an increase of nearly 3.3% in FY2009, largely due to increased ESF assistance to Pakistan. The Near East would receive a 5.1% increase, mainly due to Iraq assistance. Congress has shown interest in various aid sectors like education, democracy, human rights, trade, maternal and child health, family planning, reproductive health, agriculture, and environment. Some sectors face cuts in the FY2009 request, while others receive significant increases, such as a 54.3% increase in counter narcotics programs. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, supporting Mexico and Central America in combating drug activity, is a primary reason for the large increase. The FY2009 budget request includes significant increases in various programs in different regions, with a focus on combating drug activity. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, a multi-year proposal for $1.4 billion in U.S. assistance to Mexico and Central America, is a key component of the increased counter-narcotics support. Funding for global health-related programs, education, and civil society is decreased in the FY2009 request. The FY2008 supplemental appropriation request includes $500 million for Mexico and $50 million for Central American countries in U.S. assistance to combat drug trafficking and organized crime. The House and Senate approved $465 million for the M\u00e9rida Initiative, with softened human rights conditions. $400 million would be provided for Mexico, and $65 million for Central America, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. In FY2008, $2.5 million each was allocated to Haiti and the Dominican Republic within the INCLE funding, with no funding for FY2009. Additionally, $450 million was designated for Mexico and $100 million for Central American countries in the FY2009 budget request.

The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) requests have never exceeded $3 billion annually. In FY2008, Congress provided $1.544 billion, almost half of the Administration's request. The FY2009 MCC budget request is for $2.225 billion, reflecting a 44% increase over the FY2008 level. Supplemental resources for Foreign Operations programs have become a significant source of funds for U.S. international activities, especially for reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Administration has faced criticism for relying too heavily on supplementals for funding, making it difficult for budget comparisons. Critics suggest incorporating Iraq-related supplementals into regular appropriations. However, the Administration argues that supplementals are necessary for unforeseen expenses. U.S. foreign assistance to Iraq and Afghanistan has increased significantly since FY2002, with aid to Afghanistan rising from $590 million in FY2003 to $1.799 billion the following year. Foreign aid to Iraq and Afghanistan increased significantly from FY2002, reaching over $17 billion in FY2004 before decreasing to $1.6 billion in FY2006 and $2.2 billion in FY2007. In FY2009, requested aid for both countries was 5.3% of the budget, with regular and supplemental funding comprising 16% of total foreign aid spending in FY2007. The funding categories include Rebuilding, Transforming, Sustaining Partnership, and Developing countries. The Restrictive country category includes countries with significant freedom and human rights issues, as well as legislative or Secretarial-designated limitations on assistance. Some countries in this category are Belarus, Burma, China, Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Venezuela, West Bank and Gaza, and Zimbabwe."
