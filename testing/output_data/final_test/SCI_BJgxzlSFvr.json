A proposed attention-based deep neural network incorporates different query and search result embeddings with a decoder mechanism to learn ranks in a listwise fashion. The model's performance is demonstrated with image retrieval and text querying datasets. Learning to rank uses supervised or semi-supervised machine learning for information retrieval problems. Learning to rank involves ranking search results based on relevance to a query. Three approaches are pointwise, pairwise, and listwise, with neural networks being successful in modeling ranking probabilities. For example, RankNet applies a neural network to determine the probability of a search result being more relevant. Applying neural networks to calculate relevance probabilities for search results, combining query and result pairs into feature vectors for ranking priority scores. Another approach focuses on learning the matching mechanism between query and search result, particularly for image retrieval. Multiple embeddings of queries and search results could benefit learning to rank models, as seen in the improvement of digit and character recognition with convolutional neural nets. By incorporating multiple embeddings in a ranking neural network, the randomness of architecture can be reduced, improving accuracy and robustness. The attention mechanism is proposed for learning to rank, focusing on different input aspects to incorporate distinct features. Our model incorporates different embeddings with weights changing over time, derived from a recurrent neural network (RNN) structure. It applies the attention mechanism to listwise learning to rank problems and uses a decoder mechanism to rank search results. Double attention mechanisms are applied to both queries and search results. RankNet, similarity matching, and the attention mechanism are discussed in detail. The attention-based deep net for ranking is constructed in Section 3, with a focus on model calibration. Section 4 showcases the model's performance on image retrieval and text querying datasets. Section 5 explores potential future research directions and concludes the paper. For RankNet, each query and search result pair is transformed into a feature vector. The ranking probability in RankNet is defined as P(x0 \u227a x0) = e^(x2-x2) / (1 + e^(x2-x2)). The ranking probability is determined using a two-layer neural network structure, such as RankNet, which offers a pairwise approach. A deeper application of RankNet involves a five-layer model that adapts to personalized search. Other models like LambdaRank, LambdaMART, and Ranking SVM have also been proposed for ranking search results. Our approach integrates different embeddings with the attention mechanism and learns the matching mechanism between a query and search results using a similarity matrix. Unlike previous models, we apply the attention mechanism and develop an approach for both image and text queries. The approach integrates embeddings with an attention mechanism to learn the matching mechanism between a query and search results using a similarity matrix. Multiple deep convolutional nets are used to obtain embeddings for queries and search results, which are weighted differently by the attention mechanism for each state. This model has been successfully applied to various problems, such as neural machine translation. Incorporating an attention mechanism with embeddings to learn the matching mechanism between queries and search results. The model has been applied to various problems like neural machine translation and solving combinatorial problems. The attention mechanism helps in ranking search results from most related to least related for a query. Neural nets use bias and activation functions for classification. Softmax probabilities are used as embeddings, created with different network structures like CNNs. Attention mechanism generates weights with RNN structure to summarize embeddings in a decoder series. The attention mechanism in neural networks generates weights based on previous attention weights, embeddings, and decoder states to summarize information. Different attention weights are applied to embeddings to create a decoder series, offering a listwise approach. Separate attention mechanisms are used for queries and search results, with each query represented by multiple embeddings and each search result mapped to different embeddings.

Different attention weights are applied to embeddings to create a decoder series, offering a listwise approach. Separate attention mechanisms are used for queries and search results, with each query represented by multiple embeddings and each search result mapped to different embeddings. The embeddings of queries or search results can be raw data or the output of a parametric model like a CNN for images. Attention weights are assigned to the query and search results to implement an attention-based mechanism. The attention mechanism in neural networks assigns weights to query and search results embeddings to create context vectors for summarizing information. Different attention functions are used for queries and search results, with pre-softmax weights e t and f t being assigned to generate context vectors c t and d t. The attention weights \u03b1 t and \u03b2 t are determined using softmax functions, and context vectors are created based on the state of the decoder. The attention mechanism in neural networks assigns weights to query and search results embeddings to create context vectors for summarizing information. Equations (8-11) are iteratively carried out to output the decoder z t. Context vectors c t and d t are used to rank results r 1 to r T. For each result r t, a specific context vector d t,t is defined for comparison with c t. The softmax function is applied to similarity scores s t,r t to choose r t. The model is completed with Equations (1-6). The model is calibrated using stochastic gradient descent and beam search algorithm for ranking search results. The hinge loss function is considered as an alternative to the softmax function for comparing search results. The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent to minimize the loss function. Three datasets are studied: MNIST, CIFAR-10, and 20 Newsgroups. MNIST dataset consists of handwritten digits 0-9 with training, validation, and testing images. Images are randomly selected based on similarity to the query image. The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent to minimize the loss function on three datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, and 20 Newsgroups. For the MNIST dataset, images are randomly selected based on similarity to the query image, with 30-k unrelated images chosen. Five convolutional neural networks are pretrained with different L2 regularization rates and Dropout regularization for fully connected layers. The pretrained models are then used for digit classification, with softmax layers as embeddings in the full model. The full model is trained with five pretrained CNN embeddings, using a similarity matrix W initialized with the identity matrix. Training includes a batch size of 100, learning rate of 0.001, and 20 epochs. The algorithm is compared against OASIS, Ranking SVM, and LambdaMART for image retrieval tasks. Evaluation metrics include MAP and NDCG, with standard deviations averaged over five runs for each model. The \"Attention-based Ranking Network\" (AttRN) model is evaluated against OASIS, Ranking SVM, and LambdaMART for image retrieval tasks. Results show that AttRN-HL outperforms other methods, with AttRN-SM achieving the second best performance. OASIS-5 also outperforms other models according to error rates shown in Table 3. AttRN-HL outperforms other methods, with AttRN-SM achieving the second best performance. OASIS-5 clearly outperforms OASIS-1, demonstrating the benefit of multiple embeddings. Ranking SVM and LambdaMART are not suitable for the data. Investigating AttRN-HL's sensitivity to the number of embeddings, error rates decrease as the number of embeddings increases. Error rates stabilize with more embeddings, but training time increases by roughly 33% when using 7 embeddings. AttRN-HL outperforms other methods, with AttRN-SM achieving the second best performance. OASIS-5 clearly outperforms OASIS-1, demonstrating the benefit of multiple embeddings. Error rates decrease as the number of embeddings increases, but training time increases by roughly 33% when using 7 embeddings. AttRN is robust to changes in pooling functions and shows an increase in weights of convolutional neural networks after training. In Figure 3, three good and three poorer cases of retrieval from AttRN-HL are displayed. The poorer retrieval cases in the MNIST dataset are mainly due to query image distortion. The 20 Newsgroups dataset consists of online news documents with 20 topics, categorized into 7 superclasses. Each document is considered a query, with 30 retrieved documents chosen randomly based on topic distribution. We impose order on documents based on topic and superclass. The model is trained with different word2vec models and pretrained weights are used. The attention mechanism is applied to create a flexible word embedding structure. The model is trained with different word2vec models and pretrained weights are used to transform documents into 300-dimensional vectors. A softmax layer is imposed on top of word2vec for classification. The model is compared against OASIS, Ranking SVM, and LambdaMART. AttRN and OASIS use a batch size of 100, learning rate of 0.0001, and 50 epochs. RankNet is not suitable for this dataset. AttRN-HL is recommended for 20 Newsgroups, with robust performance across all data sets. NDCG scores are more realistic than MAP for superclasses. OASIS is more suitable than Ranking SVM and LambdaMART. The proposed neural network applies attention mechanism for learning-to-rank problems. The proposed neural network utilizes an attention mechanism to improve search result ranking, showing enhancements over current techniques. Future work may focus on enhancing the RNN structure and tailoring the neural network's embeddings. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of images from 10 classes, with 50,000 training images, 5,000 for validation, and 10,000 for testing. Each image is treated as a query, generating 30 search results uniformly distributed. The study utilized 30 search results with images distributed from 1 to 9, following a similar order as MNIST but with different classes. Five convolutional neural networks were used with regularization rates from Table 5, trained with a batch size of 50, learning rate of 0.0005, and 20 epochs for AttRN. Results in Table 6 show AttRN-HL outperformed AttRN-SM and OASIS-5 in terms of MAP. Changing pooling functions from \"mean\" to \"max\" had minimal impact on error rates, indicating AttRN's robustness. Figure 4 displays three successful and three unsuccessful retrieval cases from AttRN-HL. In Figure 4 below, related images are typically in the same superclass as the query but may belong to different classes due to image variation and blurriness."
