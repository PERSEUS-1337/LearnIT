    "content": "The \"Alaska Adjacent Zone Safe Oil Transport and Revenue Sharing Act\" requires oil from Arctic offshore leases to be transported by pipeline to onshore facilities. It also allows for the transportation of oil from these leases in preproduction phases by other means. Additionally, the Act includes provisions for revenue sharing from areas in the Alaska adjacent zone. Section 18 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to include revenue sharing from areas in Alaska Adjacent Zone, defining terms like 'coastal political subdivision' and 'distance'. The curr_chunk defines terms like 'Indian tribe', 'leased tract', 'renewable energy', and 'State' in relation to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act in Alaska. The State of Alaska will receive 37.5 percent of all revenues from energy development in the Alaska Adjacent Zone, including renewable energy sources. 25 percent of the State's share will be directly allocated to coastal political subdivisions. The Secretary will allocate payments to coastal political subdivisions based on their distance from leased tracts within 300 miles. The Secretary will divide and allocate qualified outer Continental Shelf revenues from leased tracts among coastal political subdivisions based on their distance from the tracts. Additionally, 25 percent of the State's share will be paid directly to certain Regional Corporations established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1606(a)) requires the Secretary to allocate payments to Regional Corporations based on the distance of Native villages within 300 miles of leased tracts from the geographical center. The Secretary determines distances between villages and leased tracts' centers. Revenues are allocated to Regional Corporations based on villages' distances within qualifying regions. Revenues received by each Regional Corporation are treated accordingly. Revenues received by Regional Corporations are divided annually among all 12 Regional Corporations in accordance with the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Regional Corporations further distribute 50 percent of the revenues to village corporations.

The Secretary pays 10 percent of any allocable share of the State directly to Indian tribes, based on the relative distance of the headquarters of leased tracts. The Secretary will allocate Outer Continental Shelf revenues to Indian tribes based on the distance between their headquarters and the leased tract. Payments will be inversely proportional to the distances, ensuring fair distribution among tribes. The Secretary will distribute a conservation royalty of 15 percent of Federal royalty revenues from leased areas to the land and water conservation fund. Additionally, an amount equal to 7.5 percent of Federal revenues will be allocated for deficit reduction.
