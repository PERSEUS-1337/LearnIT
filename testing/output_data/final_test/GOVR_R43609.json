    "content": "In an interconnected world, public health crises like salmonella outbreaks from imported cucumbers and fungal meningitis from steroid injections have caused numerous deaths. Counterfeit Heparin from China in 2008 led to at least 80 deaths in the US and contaminated drug supplies in other countries. Congress aims to ensure products consumed by Americans are safe and accurately labeled through the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 regulates various public health products like food, drugs, and cosmetics to protect consumers from dangerous products. It enforces standards for prescription drug approval, food safety, and covers items from their introduction into interstate commerce to delivery to consumers. The FD&C Act, enforced through various measures, prohibits distributing adulterated or misbranded products in interstate commerce. It retains its basic structure since 1938, with Section 301 outlining specific prohibited acts related to adulteration and misbranding. The FD&C Act prohibits distributing products that fail to meet its requirements, such as being held under insanitary conditions or having misbranded labels. The FDA enforces the Act to ensure the safety and truthful labeling of products in interstate commerce. The FDA enforces the FD&C Act to ensure the safety, efficacy, and truthful labeling of products in interstate commerce. It has pre-market authority to review products before they can be sold and post-market authority to monitor products already in the market. FDA can request information, inspect facilities, and order recalls to maintain compliance with the Act. The FDA enforces the FD&C Act to ensure product safety, efficacy, and truthful labeling in interstate commerce. It has pre-market and post-market authority, conducts examinations and investigations, disseminates information on health dangers or consumer deception, and uses enforcement tools like warning letters. FDA coordinates with the Department of Justice for litigating authority to enforce the Act through seizures, injunctions, and civil penalties. The FDA works with the Department of Justice (DOJ) to enforce the FD&C Act through various means such as product seizures, injunctions, civil penalty proceedings, or criminal prosecutions. Other agencies like the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) also play a role in preventing FD&C Act violations from entering the United States. The FDA collaborates with the CBP to enforce the FD&C Act by alerting them when regulated products arrive at ports of entry. If a violation is found, the FDA requests CBP to issue a \"Notice of Refusal of Admission\" and destroy any non-compliant shipments. Other agencies also regulate FD&C Act-covered products, with the FDA overseeing proper labeling by manufacturers and the FTC monitoring advertising for fairness and accuracy. The FDA collaborates with the CBP to enforce the FD&C Act by alerting them about regulated products at ports of entry. The FTC oversees advertising fairness and accuracy, particularly for over-the-counter drugs and medical devices. FDA has MOUs with various government agencies for regulatory cooperation. The FD&C Act is enforced by various agencies including the FDA, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of Management and Budget, and Securities and Exchange Commission. State governments can also enforce certain aspects of the Act in conjunction with the FDA. Private individuals cannot sue to enforce the Act, as enforcement actions must be in the name of the United States. The Supreme Court has emphasized that private parties may not bring enforcement suits under the FD&C Act. The FDA enforces the FD&C Act with regulatory authority granted by Congress to regulate interstate commerce. The Supreme Court's interpretations of the Commerce Clause allow Congress to regulate intrastate economic activity with a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The FDA enforces the FD&C Act with regulatory authority granted by Congress to regulate interstate commerce. One commentator noted that Congress retains virtually unlimited power to regulate intrastate production and sale of food, drugs, devices, and cosmetics. The nexus with interstate commerce can be established through various activities, such as directly selling and shipping goods to another state, selling or holding for sale misbranded articles after interstate shipment, regardless of how many intrastate sales occurred. Courts have upheld FDA jurisdiction over products under expansive interpretations of the FD&C Act. Recent federal court decisions have found that the FDA has jurisdiction over products containing a single ingredient shipped in interstate commerce, even for seemingly wholly intrastate activities. The FDA's authority to enforce the FD&C Act on intrastate activities is limited to certain articles, such as tobacco products prior to the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009. FDA regulations in 1996 addressed access to and promotion of regulated products. The FDA's authority to regulate tobacco products was challenged in FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., where the Supreme Court ruled that Congress had limited the FDA's jurisdiction over tobacco. Despite Congress later granting explicit authority to regulate tobacco, the case highlighted the limits of the FDA's power under the FD&C Act. Questions often arise regarding the FDA's discretion in enforcing the Act, as seen in the Supreme Court case Heckler v. Cheney. In Heckler v. Cheney, a death row inmate petitioned the FDA to take action against state officials for using a drug cocktail in his execution, arguing it was a misbranded drug. The Supreme Court ruled that the FDA has discretion in enforcing the FD&C Act, with Section 702 being permissive in nature. The Supreme Court ruling in Heckler v. Cheney established FDA's discretion in enforcing the FD&C Act, with Section 702 giving the agency the authority to initiate enforcement proceedings. Despite this discretion, nonenforcement decisions by executive agencies like the FDA are only presumptively unreviewable, and can be challenged if the substantive statute provides guidelines for enforcement. This was demonstrated in cases like Cook v. FDA, where the presumption against reviewing FDA's enforcement decisions did not apply to other provisions of the FD&C Act. In Cook v. FDA, death row inmates sued FDA for allowing state correctional facilities to import sodium thiopental, arguing it was a misbranded drug violating the FD&C Act. The D.C. Circuit Court ruled against FDA, stating that Section 801 mandates refusal of admission for certain imported drugs that are adulterated, misbranded, or unapproved. This limited FDA's discretion in enforcing Section 801, unlike in Heckler v. Cheney where FDA had more discretion under Section 702. The FDA's enforcement discretion is crucial in political disputes, facing decisions on safety issues that could lead to deaths or industry shutdowns. Enforcement actions for FD&C Act violations can be civil or criminal, with tools like warning letters, recalls, and civil money penalties. DOJ assistance is required for injunctions and seizures. Congress is consistently interested in the agency's enforcement discretion. The FDA usually provides individuals or firms with an opportunity to comply voluntarily before taking enforcement actions by issuing advisory action letters, including warning and untitled letters. Warning letters alert recipients of violations and request corrective action, with the expectation of voluntary compliance. These letters are considered informal and advisory, not constituting final agency action. The FDA issues warning letters as advisory actions to address violations, with the expectation of voluntary compliance. Untitled letters are less serious and are used for violations that do not merit a warning letter. FDA does not consider warning letters as final agency action, making it difficult to file a lawsuit under the Administrative Procedure Act based on a warning letter. FDA may issue import alerts based on evidence of potential violations of the FD&C Act, leading to automatic detention of articles at the border. Owners or consignees can then provide testimony on the admissibility of the detained articles, which may result in either entry or refusal into the United States. FDA may issue import alerts based on evidence of potential violations of the FD&C Act, leading to automatic detention of articles at the border. FDA's use of import alerts to detain articles prior to inspection has been challenged in court, with plaintiffs prevailing in cases where FDA changed admissibility rules without prior notice. For example, in Bellarno International Ltd.v. FDA, a court held that FDA violated the APA by implementing a rule through an import alert without notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. In Benten v. Kessler, a district court found that an import alert banning abortifacient drugs required notice-and-comment rulemaking as it was binding. FDA has used import alerts successfully to detain articles suspected of violating rules, as seen in Seabrook International Foods Inc. v. Harris. The court upheld FDA's decision to bar Indian shrimp imports due to sanitation issues at facilities. Recalls under the FD&C Act can efficiently remove hazardous products from the market, with most being voluntary. Firms or manufacturers must report voluntary recalls to FDA, which can request recalls for products posing health risks. FDA has limited authority to mandate recalls for certain products like medical devices and infant formula, but not for drug products. Ignoring an FDA-requested recall may lead to enforcement action. The FDA has limited authority to mandate recalls for certain products like medical devices and infant formula, but not for drug products. FDA can \"debar\" or prohibit corporations or individuals from participating in FDA-regulated activities based on their conduct, creating strong incentives for compliance. Debarment under the FD&C Act creates strong incentives for compliance by potentially requiring career changes. There are two types of debarment - mandatory and permissive, with different criteria and durations. FDA can propose debarment and individuals can request a hearing to challenge it. Debarred individuals can seek termination or appeal to the court for review. Under the FD&C Act, FDA can impose monetary civil penalties for various violations, such as prescription drug marketing practices, medical devices, and tobacco products. The penalties can range from $1,000 to over $1 million per violation, taking into account factors like the nature of the violation and the person's ability to pay. Penalties can be assessed against individuals and corporations. If deemed necessary, FDA can assess penalties without DOJ involvement. Under the FD&C Act, FDA can impose monetary civil penalties for violations, ranging from $1,000 to over $1 million per violation. FDA can assess penalties without DOJ involvement. If a penalty is warranted, FDA may assess it without court involvement. The process involves serving a complaint, answering it, requesting a hearing, and appealing decisions to the Departmental Appeals Board. Seizure of adulterated or misbranded goods is a remedy under the Act, considered the harshest civil remedy. Seizures under the FD&C Act can be small or large, involving multiple actions filed simultaneously. The U.S. Attorney can take seizure actions based on FDA's recommendation without notifying the manufacturer beforehand. Due process concerns are not raised by seizing products without a prior judicial hearing. Seizure proceedings under the FD&C Act can vary depending on the product type and alleged violation. Seizure actions can be initiated for food, drugs, and cosmetics when in interstate commerce or held for sale. However, for counterfeit drugs, adulterated medical devices, and tobacco products, seizure can occur at any time. FDA may not seize misbranded food due to advertising or if sold in an establishment not owned by the manufacturer. Companies can contest seizures by filing an answer to the complaint. The FD&C Act allows federal district courts to issue injunctions to prevent violations, including adulterated, misbranded goods in interstate commerce. Injunctions can be temporary or permanent and may involve prohibiting distribution or ordering corrective actions. FDA guidance suggests considering injunctions for significant non-compliance, especially when a health hazard is present. FDA recommends injunctions as a remedy for significant non-compliance, especially in cases of health hazards or consumer deception. Injunctions involve FDA and DOJ cooperation, with the U.S. Attorney filing in federal court to enjoin individuals or companies from violating the Act. Courts have granted injunctions when DOJ has deemed necessary. In general, courts grant injunctions when the DOJ shows violations of the FD&C Act. If an injunction is issued, immediate compliance is required unless a stay is obtained. Criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment, can be imposed for violating the Act, although criminal prosecutions are rare. According to the FDA's enforcement manual, criminal punishment is unlikely for minor infractions. The FDA usually allows compliance before criminal prosecution for violations that do not pose a health risk or are intentional. Criminal penalties can threaten individuals' liberty, and the FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations investigates violations. If prosecution is warranted, the alleged violator is notified. If the FDA finds prosecution necessary for violations, the Office of Criminal Investigations may recommend it to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for criminal proceedings. The DOJ typically follows FDA's recommendations closely and works in partnership with FDA attorneys. Criminal convictions under the FD&C Act require proof of three elements. The government must prove that the article in question is a \"food,\" \"drug,\" \"device,\" \"tobacco,\" or \"cosmetic,\" and that it is \"adulterated\" or \"misbranded.\" The article must also have been introduced into interstate commerce. Criminal liability under the FD&C Act is based on strict liability, without the need for a mens rea or \"guilty mind.\" This principle was established in two Supreme Court cases. The Supreme Court established strict liability for criminal liability under the FD&C Act, without requiring awareness of wrongdoing by the defendant. This principle was reaffirmed in United States v. Park, where the \"responsible corporate officer\" doctrine held individuals accountable for their role in furthering prohibited transactions. The Supreme Court established strict liability for criminal liability under the FD&C Act, holding individuals accountable for violations even without awareness of wrongdoing. The standard imposed is demanding but expected of those in authority in businesses affecting public health. Two defenses, including the \"impossibility defense,\" may limit the Act's criminal sanctions. The \"impossibility defense\" allows a corporate officer to shift the burden of proof to the government by showing they exercised extraordinary care but were still unable to prevent violations of the FD&C Act. The \"guaranty clause\" in Section 303(c) exempts individuals who receive and deliver illegal articles in good faith from criminal penalties. Pharmacists distributing misbranded or adulterated drugs are also protected under this clause if they received the products in good faith with a written guaranty of compliance. Under Section 303(a)(1) of the FD&C Act, criminal violations are generally treated as misdemeanors, punishable by a fine or imprisonment of a year or less. Violations may become a felony if it's a second offense or done with the \"intent to defraud or mislead.\" To incur a felony conviction, the defendant must have intended to defraud not only consumers but also government agencies. Section 303(a) establishes default criminal penalties for misdemeanors or felonies under the Act. The FD&C Act imposes fines and imprisonment for violations, with maximum fines of $100,000 for misdemeanors and $250,000 for felonies for individuals. Organizations face fines of up to $200,000 for misdemeanors. The Act allows for modifications to achieve uniform fine levels. The current maximum fine for an organization under the FD&C Act is $200,000, increasing to $500,000 for felonies resulting in death. Defendants convicted of violations receive a base offense level of six, with a potential prison sentence of zero to eighteen months. An \"upward departure\" in sentencing may be warranted for offenses causing bodily harm or significant loss."
