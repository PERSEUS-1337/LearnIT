    "content": "The \"Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to defer active income of controlled foreign corporations. It also modifies foreign tax credit rules for large integrated oil companies that are dual capacity taxpayers. The \"Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to defer active income of controlled foreign corporations and modifies foreign tax credit rules for large integrated oil companies that are dual capacity taxpayers. Specifically, it introduces special rules for such companies regarding taxes paid to foreign countries or possessions of the United States. The term 'dual capacity taxpayer' refers to a person in a foreign country or possession of the United States who pays income tax according to regulations or would pay if applicable. This does not affect amounts within the determined limit under subparagraph (B). The term 'generally applicable income tax' refers to an income tax imposed by a foreign country or possession on income from a trade or business within that country or possession. The term 'large integrated oil company' is defined as an integrated oil company with gross receipts exceeding $1,000,000,000 and an average daily worldwide production of at least 500,000 barrels of crude oil. The amendments made by this section apply to taxes paid or accrued in taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act, except where contrary to any treaty obligation of the United States. SEC. 4 amends the limitation on the foreign tax credit, while SEC. 5 addresses the treatment of foreign corporations managed and controlled in the U.S. as domestic corporations. These changes apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2013, except where they conflict with U.S. treaty obligations. SEC. 5 amends the Internal Revenue Code to treat certain corporations managed and controlled in the United States as domestic for income tax purposes, if their management and control primarily occurs within the U.S. This change applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2013, and overrides previous foreign tax credit limitations. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code treats corporations managed and controlled in the U.S. as domestic for income tax purposes if certain criteria are met, including stock trading on an established market or having assets over $50,000,000. The waiver provision allows a corporation to be treated as a domestic corporation for income tax purposes if it meets specific criteria, including not being regularly traded on an established securities market and having aggregate gross assets of less than $50,000,000. The exception from the gross assets test applies to a controlled foreign corporation that is a member of an affiliated group with a domestic corporation as the common parent, which has substantial assets for use in the active conduct of a trade or business in the United States. The Secretary will prescribe regulations to determine when the management and control of a corporation is primarily in the United States, focusing on executive officers and senior management responsible for strategic decisions. The regulations will determine the management and control of a corporation in the US, focusing on strategic decision-makers. Individuals not in executive roles but with day-to-day responsibilities will be treated as such. Regulations will also cover corporations primarily holding investment assets. The regulations will determine the management and control of a corporation in the US, focusing on strategic decision-makers. Assets of a corporation will be considered managed in the US if decisions on investments are made there. The amendments will apply to taxable years starting two years after the enactment of the Act."
