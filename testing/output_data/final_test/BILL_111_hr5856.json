    "content": "The \"Waste-to-Energy Technology Act of 2010\" may provide an investment tax credit for waste to energy facilities. The \"Waste-to-Energy Technology Act of 2010\" may offer an investment tax credit for qualified waste-to-energy property under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The term 'qualified waste-to-energy property' refers to a system that uses municipal solid waste or sewage sludge to produce fuel, certified by the Secretary for a tax credit. Landfill facilities with specific operations are excluded from this definition. The Secretary will establish a program to award certifications for qualified waste-to-energy projects eligible for tax credits. The program will award certifications for waste-to-energy projects, with a limit of $1,000,000,000 in credits. Applications must be submitted within a 2-year period and meet specific criteria for certification. The certification process for waste-to-energy projects allows applicants 1 year to provide evidence of meeting requirements. The Secretary selects projects based on commercial viability. The Secretary selects waste-to-energy projects based on criteria including the use of post-consumer materials, impact on air pollutants and greenhouse gases, and overall environmental benefits. The Secretary selects waste-to-energy projects based on criteria including low levelized cost of energy, minimal environmental and health risks, and limitations on credit allocation for qualified waste-to-energy property. The Secretary selects waste-to-energy projects based on criteria including low levelized cost of energy, minimal environmental and health risks, and limitations on credit allocation for qualified waste-to-energy property. Greenhouse gas leakage from the facility is determined by the lifecycle leakage of greenhouse gases, which is calculated based on the leakage rate during each phase multiplied by the proportion of lifetime greenhouse gases released by the facility in that phase. The lifecycle analysis includes accounting for greenhouse gas leakage from bio-based energy production facilities over their entire lifetime or as long as residual carbon allows. Leakage must be considered in the facility's greenhouse gas emissions. Leakage must be accounted for throughout the facility's life, including before the gas collection system and final cover installation, and after funds for cover maintenance are depleted. Leakage is relevant as long as the facility produces or has the potential to produce greenhouse gases. The term 'leakage' in the context of greenhouse gases refers to the gases released into the atmosphere from organic discards in a facility. A facility includes both energy-producing machinery and the entire landfill unit. 'Phase' denotes distinct time periods when greenhouse gases are generated at varying rates in a facility. The term 'phase' refers to distinct time periods in a facility when greenhouse gases are generated at different rates and gas collection varies. The term 'bio-based energy' refers to energy produced from the decomposition of plants or animals, while 'integrated basis' involves multiplying collection efficiency by the proportion of total gas over different phases of a landfill facility's life. The term 'bio-based energy' refers to energy produced from the decomposition of plants or animals. Integrated basis involves multiplying collection efficiency by the proportion of total gas over different phases of a landfill facility's life. A credit shall not be allowed for fuel produced at a facility where a credit is already allowed. The credit for a facility will not be allowed if a grant is received under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Additionally, a facility producing electricity from qualified waste-to-energy property will not be considered a qualified facility if a credit has been determined for the property in the current or prior taxable years. After allocating all energy credits for waste-to-energy projects, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Administrator of the EPA will report to Congress on the recipients and effectiveness of selection criteria. Recommendations for continuing the waste-to-energy credit will also be included in the report. Public disclosure of the credit certification will be made upon completion. The amendments made by this section apply to facilities placed in service after the enactment of this Act, with public disclosure of the applicant's identity and credit amount."
