Law enforcement personnel have the authority to investigate, apprehend, and transfer aliens for immigration law enforcement. They are not required to report victims or witnesses of crimes to Homeland Security. It is a criminal offense to arrest victims or witnesses for immigration violations. The Alien Smuggler Prosecution Act aims to enhance the prosecution of individuals involved in smuggling aliens. Alien smuggling is a lucrative and dangerous business, with criminal organizations generating billions in revenue annually. Smuggled migrants face abuse and exploitation, putting them at risk of physical harm and even death. The text highlights the risks of alien smuggling, including injury, abuse, and death. It emphasizes the need for uniform guidelines for prosecuting smuggling offenses to address the overwhelming workload faced by border-area United States attorneys and to deter additional smuggling activities. The Congress urges the Attorney General to adopt these guidelines within three months of the enactment of the Act. In each fiscal year from 2008 to 2013, the Attorney General must increase the number of attorneys in the offices of United States attorneys by at least 20 to prosecute cases under section 274 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.
