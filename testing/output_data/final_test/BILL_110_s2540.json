    "content": "Expensing for certain property placed in service during 2008 and 2009. Special allowance for qualified property placed in service during 2008 and 2009, allowing a 100% depreciation deduction of the adjusted basis of the property. The special allowance allows for a 100% depreciation deduction of the adjusted basis of qualified property placed in service during 2008 and 2009. Qualified property includes 3-year, 5-year, or 7-year property with the original use commencing with the taxpayer on or after a specified starting date. The property must be acquired by the taxpayer on or after the starting date and before the ending date, with no written binding contract in effect before the starting date. Alternatively, the property can be acquired through a written binding contract entered into on or after the starting date and before the ending date. The special allowance allows for a 100% depreciation deduction of qualified property placed in service during 2008 and 2009. The property must be acquired by the taxpayer on or after the starting date and before the ending date, and placed in service before the ending date. Exceptions include property under the alternative depreciation system and taxpayers making an election out. If a taxpayer elects out, this subsection won't apply to all property in the class placed in service during the taxable year. Special rules apply for self-constructed property and sale-leasebacks. If property is sold and leased back within 3 months after being placed in service, it will be treated as placed in service on the date it is used under the leaseback. If property is sold by the lessor within 3 months after being placed in service, and the user remains the same, it will be treated as placed in service on the date it is used under the leaseback. When property is sold, it is treated as originally placed in service on the date of the last sale. This rule does not apply if the user or related parties had a contract for the property before the starting date. The starting date for property is determined by when manufacturing, construction, or production began. For automobiles, the limitation under section 280F is increased by $7,650. The deduction for listed property is considered in computing any recapture amount under section 280F. The amendment allows for a deduction in computing minimum tax for qualified property without adjustments under section 56. The starting date is January 1, 2008, and the ending date is January 1, 2010. Effective for property placed in service after December 31, 2007."
