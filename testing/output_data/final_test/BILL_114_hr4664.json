    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Displaced Jewish Refugees from Arab Countries and Iran Act.\" Congress acknowledges the refugee populations in the Middle East, particularly the long-standing presence of Jews as minorities in the region. The United States expresses concern for human rights violations and plays a key role in seeking peace in the Arab-Israeli conflict, including addressing the Palestinian refugee issue. The Palestinian refugee issue has garnered global attention, while the plight of Jewish refugees from Arab and Muslim countries has been largely overlooked. Approximately 850,000 Jews were displaced from Arab countries and Iran since Israel's establishment in 1948. The United States is concerned about the mistreatment and rights violations of minority populations, including former Jewish refugees. A comprehensive peace in the region necessitates resolving all outstanding issues through negotiations involving all relevant parties. The displacement of former Jewish refugees from Arab countries is highlighted in agreements signed by President Jimmy Carter and Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan. The issue of Jewish refugees is acknowledged alongside Palestinian rights in the Middle East peace process. In an interview after Camp David II in July 2000, President Clinton discussed the issue of Jewish refugees displaced from Arab lands and proposed setting up an international fund for them. He also mentioned compensating Israelis who were made refugees after the birth of the State of Israel. On April 1, 2008, the House of Representatives passed House Resolution 185, expressing support for these initiatives. House Resolution 185 emphasizes the need for a comprehensive Middle East peace agreement to address all refugee rights, including Jews, Christians, and other populations. The President should instruct US representatives to advocate for resolutions on this issue in international forums. The resolution on Middle East refugees should also address the issue of Jewish refugees from Arab countries. The US government supports resolving the refugee issue in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf as part of a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace agreement. The international definition of a refugee applies to Jews who fled persecution in Arab countries and Iran. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recognized Jews fleeing as refugees in 1957. Israel's agreements with Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestinians emphasize the need for a just solution to the refugee crisis stemming from the Arab-Israeli conflict. Multiple government decisions in Israel support the rights of refugees from Middle Eastern and North African countries. In February 2010, the Israeli Knesset passed a law to preserve compensation rights for Jewish refugees from Arab countries and Iran. This initiative does not conflict with the rights of Palestinian refugees. All countries should be aware of the plight of Jews and other minority groups displaced from the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf. An international campaign is underway to document the history of Jewish refugees from Arab countries and Iran. Secretary of State John Kerry's negotiation framework includes a proposal for compensation for Jewish refugees. SEC. 3. STATEMENTS OF POLICY. Congress states the policy that a just Arab-Israeli peace must address the displacement of Jewish communities in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf. It emphasizes the need for equal recognition of rights for all refugees from the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, including Palestinian refugees and former Jewish, Christian, and other refugees from Arab countries and Iran. Any US Government statements referencing the resolution of the Palestinian refugee issue must also mention the resolution of the issue of Jewish refugees from Arab countries and Iran. SEC. 4. REPORT. The President must submit an annual report to Congress on actions taken by the Department of State and other relevant agencies regarding Jewish refugees from Arab countries and Iran. The report should include actions in bilateral and multilateral forums to address rights for Jewish refugees and measures to protect their interests. The President must submit an annual report to Congress on actions taken to address the interests of refugees displaced from Arab countries and Iran, including Jews. Efforts should ensure all refugees affected by the Arab-Israeli conflict are considered in any final settlement, with the report being unclassified but may contain a classified annex if necessary. The President must submit an annual report to Congress on actions taken to address the interests of refugees displaced from Arab countries and Iran, including Jews. The requirement to submit the report shall terminate when the President certifies an agreement between the parties to resolve the issues described in subsection (b)."
