    "content": "The \"Infant Crib Safety Act\" is the short title of this legislation. The purpose of the act is outlined in the findings and states the intention behind the regulations. Congress finds that injuries and deaths of infants in crib incidents pose a serious threat to public health and safety. Approximately 12,000 children under 2 are injured in cribs each year, with at least 30 children under 4 dying from crib-related injuries annually. The design and construction of baby cribs must ensure safety for unattended infants. The cost to society from crib-related deaths is estimated at $150 million per year. Secondhand, hand-me-down, and heirloom cribs are a concern as many infants are placed in them, leading to most crib deaths. Current legislation is insufficient to address the hazards posed by these types of cribs. Prohibiting the sale or placement of unsafe secondhand cribs can prevent injuries and deaths. The purpose of this Act is to prevent injuries and deaths to infants by making it illegal to manufacture, sell, or resell unsafe cribs, particularly secondhand, hand-me-down, or heirloom cribs. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines a \"commercial user\" as a person involved in manufacturing, selling, or dealing with full-size or nonfull-size cribs, including child care facilities and family child care homes. The Act defines a \"commercial user\" as a person involved in contracting to sell or resell, lease, sublet, or otherwise place full-size or nonfull-size cribs in the stream of commerce. A crib is defined as a full-size or nonfull-size baby crib, with specific definitions for full-size and nonfull-size cribs provided in the regulations. An infant is defined as a person less than 35 inches tall or less than 2 years of age. A nonfull-size crib is defined as a nonfull-size baby crib according to federal regulations, including portable cribs and crib-pens. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIBS. The Federal Hazardous Substances Act is amended to include new requirements for cribs. Manufacture and Sale of Cribs: It is illegal for commercial users to sell unsafe cribs for infants. Lodging facilities cannot offer or provide unsafe cribs. All cribs must adhere to safety standards. Unsafe cribs for infants, including nonfull-size cribs, portable cribs, playpens, or play yards, are presumed to be noncompliant if they do not meet specific safety standards outlined in federal regulations and ASTM consumer safety specifications. The ASTM F966 Consumer Safety Specification and federal regulations outline safety standards for full-size and non-full size baby cribs. Noncompliant cribs are considered hazardous substances. Exceptions apply for cribs not intended for infant use. Noncompliant cribs, including toys or display items, must be accompanied by a notice declaring they are not intended for infant use and are dangerous. The Act will become effective 90 days after its enactment."
