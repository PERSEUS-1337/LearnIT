Loans are available when the crop exceeds moisture content standards set by the Commodity Credit Corporation. The Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 is amended to provide recourse loans to producers for high moisture crops of feed grains from 1992 to 1995. Loans are available when the crop exceeds moisture content standards set by the Commodity Credit Corporation. Corporation standards for loans made under subsection (a) of this section include requirements for test weight and certified scale tickets from approved entities. The producer must obtain certified scale tickets near the harvest operation, certify the quantity of feed grain harvested on the farm, and participate in an acreage limitation program. Prior loans must be fully repaid to be eligible for a loan under this program. The interest rate for loans under this program will be determined by the Secretary but will not exceed the rate for other loans under subsection (a) of this section. Loans under this program are determined by the Secretary and must be repaid in three equal annual installments. The first installment is due 365 days after the loan funds are advanced, consisting of one-third of the principal amount and accrued interest. The loan under the program must be repaid in three equal annual installments. The second installment includes half of the principal amount and accrued interest, while the third installment covers the remaining principal and accrued interest. Failure to make a payment within 60 days allows the Secretary to offset the entire loan balance against other payments the producer may receive under agricultural programs. The Secretary may allow a producer to repay part or all of an annual installment by tendering feed grain of acceptable quality to the Commodity Credit Corporation. The grain must meet certain standards and be stored in an approved facility in the same or adjacent county to the producer's farm. The loan installment payment will be credited based on the county adjusted loan rate for the grain tendered. The loan rate for the grade and quality of grain tendered is multiplied by the total number of bushels tendered in payment by the producer as approved by the Secretary."
