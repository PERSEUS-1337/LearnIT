It conducts various missions to protect public safety, the environment, and national interests in maritime regions. The United States Coast Guard, founded in 1790, plays a vital role in homeland security, law enforcement, search and rescue, and marine environmental pollution response. With 42,300 active-duty personnel, they saved over 3,500 lives in 2012, protected millions in property, and intercepted tons of illegal drugs and undocumented migrants. The National Coast Guard Museum is being developed in New London, Connecticut with the help of various stakeholders.
