As the world's leading producer and consumer of many minerals and metals, China's rapid urbanization and rising middle class pose questions about the availability of critical raw materials for the U.S. economy. China is the world's leading producer and consumer of minerals and metals. The United States and China heavily import materials like platinum group metals, niobium, tantalum, manganese, and cobalt. These materials are classified as strategic or critical for defense systems and new energy technologies. China aims for a more sustainable GDP growth rate of 7%-8% annually, with economic reforms promoting market-based decision making. Reforms promoting market-based decision making are underway in China's Third Plenum. The economic slowdown in China has led to overcapacity and lower prices for raw materials like steel. This has global implications for countries exporting raw materials to China. Chinese steel producers are exporting high-valued steel products to Asia due to weak domestic demand. Prices may rebound once excess production capacity is reduced. China's mining industry in China is fragmented, with the government aiming to consolidate it to improve efficiency and address pollution concerns. Obsolete iron ore smelting plants and mines near Beijing have been closed due to air quality issues. The industry is focusing on technology upgrades to reduce pollution. Gu Zangqin from the China National Petroleum and Chemical Planning Institute highlights the challenge of eliminating excess capacity in the sector. Urbanization, a growing middle class, and industrialization are expected to drive further growth. In the long run, urbanization, a growing middle class, and industrialization will drive up demand for raw materials and consumer products. One vice president believes that innovation and sustainability, not overcapacity, are the main challenges. China's industrialization and urbanization present opportunities, but sustainability in the entire supply chain is crucial. Metals analyst Jack Lifton agrees with the analysis, predicting more industry restructuring and consolidations in the raw materials sector during the 13th Five Year Plan. China currently consumes a significant portion of the world's metals supply. China consumes 60-80% of the world's supply of various high-tech metals, aiming to manufacture high-value consumer goods and accelerate domestic consumption. Access to raw materials is crucial for sustaining the Chinese economy's growth in high-tech manufacturing. The quality of goods produced in China is important for the rising middle class and the country's consumption-driven economic model. The Chinese government's \"go global\" campaign aims to secure raw materials for their consumption-driven economic model. Established in 1999, the policy focuses on supporting exports, internationalizing domestic firms, and investing in strategic resources. Concerns over \"resource security\" have led to increased outbound direct investment in the mining sector to ensure access to raw materials. Despite a slowing economy, China remains aggressive in securing the resources needed for sustained growth. China's \"go global\" policy aims to secure raw materials for economic development through outbound direct investment in mining projects. The Ministry of Commerce plans to invest $390 billion in ODI over the next five years. China's demand for resources is expected to remain high, with most resource imports coming from non-Chinese corporations. The CFR study highlights concerns about China's growing presence in natural resource production overseas and the potential impact on global supply chains. Many on Capitol Hill are skeptical of China's economic reforms and environmental policies. China's \"go global\" policy aims to secure raw materials through outbound direct investment in mining projects. The report examines China's position in global mineral markets, its reserves growth, supply, demand, and imports, as well as the role of state-owned enterprises. It also looks at U.S. mineral import dependence, import reliance on China, and policy options. China's reserves in various mineral commodities have significantly increased over the past 20 years, with large-scale refining and production facilities established for aluminum, tantalum, and cobalt. China's mineral reserves have grown significantly in the past 20 years, with Chinese firms actively exploring and discovering minerals within the country. Major discoveries of zinc, lead, copper, and silver have been announced in provinces like Hunan. Despite accounting for only 4% of the global exploration budget in 2013, China lags behind countries like Canada and Australia, which have more active exploration sites and higher spending on major projects. China's rapid economic growth has led to increased demand for raw materials, with imports for copper concentrate and iron ore rising significantly. From 2005 to 2010, China accounted for over 80% of the global demand for metals and metal products. Investments in raw material exploration and production have been made both domestically and abroad to support China's economic development. China's rapid urbanization drove a surge in steel production, with China producing 717 million metric tons in 2013, up from 220 million in 2003. China became the top producer of various minerals and metals by 2012, with significant increases in iron ore and copper production. China's gains in production outpaced the rest of the world, dominating in several key minerals and metals. China became the top producer of various minerals and metals by 2012, including rare earth elements, silicon, tungsten, vanadium, and yttrium. China solidified its leading position by producing over 50% of the world's total minerals. These raw materials are essential for steel-making, infrastructure projects, and high-value electronic products like cell phones and laptops. Analysts describe China's current phase of development as the \"mid-phase of industrialization.\" China's mid-phase of industrialization is characterized by a higher proportion of manufacturing, including heavy industries like steel and automobile production. Despite slower growth, there is still an anticipated increase in production and imports of raw materials. Major iron ore producers outside China are expanding capacity, while inefficient domestic production capacity in China is being shut down. China's demand for natural resources is at historic levels and expected to rise further due to urbanization and the expansion of high-tech industries. The surge in demand for industrial metals like aluminum, zinc, and copper from 2003 to 2010 highlights this trend. However, it is uncertain if the high level of consumer demand needed for economic growth will materialize. China's demand for aluminum, zinc, and copper more than doubled from 2003 to 2010, with a significant increase in global market share. Additionally, China's consumption of niobium and manganese also saw substantial growth during this period. The country's demand for vanadium closely followed steel demand, rising annually from 2003 to 2009. Furthermore, China's dominance in chrome ore import demand and stainless steel production positions it as a key player in the global market. Vanadium demand is projected to double by 2025 due to its use in steelmaking and potential applications in renewable energy storage. China's demand for various metals like indium, cobalt, platinum, palladium, and chromium has been steadily increasing. China is a major importer of these metals, with a significant portion being used in electronics, batteries, and automotive catalytic converters. In 2010, China accounted for a significant percentage of global demand for these metals, highlighting its importance in the global market. China's demand for various metals like cobalt, tantalum, niobium, PGMs, and lithium has been increasing. Concerns have been raised in Congress about China securing long-term supplies of raw materials, including iron ore. Chinese companies have established long-term contracts, made equity investments, or entered joint ventures to secure needed resources. China's iron ore imports are expected to rise to 1 billion mt in 2015 due to high steel production levels. Rio Tinto is expanding its iron ore capacity despite lower prices, anticipating continued high volumes of lower-cost iron ore imports by China. China's increasing demand for metals like iron ore has led to high imports from Australia, driving prices up significantly. China's investments in Chile account for a large portion of its exports, mainly copper. The country's \"go global\" policy has made it more aggressive in pursuing raw materials worldwide, with the Communist Party exerting control over State-Owned Enterprises. China's State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) are controlled by the Communist Party of China (CPC) and align with national objectives. Economic reforms aim to increase private shareholdings in SOEs, which have been crucial in generating revenue for the government. SOEs dominate the mineral and metal producing sector, with some provincial officials prioritizing local interests over central government directives. The Chinese government is promoting larger, more efficient, and less polluting operations in State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to meet revenue goals and create local jobs. This involves merging smaller local SOEs into larger conglomerates, diversifying business practices, and investing in non-core areas like rare earth mining. The National Development Reform Commission (NDRC) and Ministry of Land and Resources approved a plan for 15 mineral commodities to integrate small mines into larger operations. The NDRC has the authority to approve major investment projects to improve efficiency. The Chinese government is promoting larger, more efficient, and less polluting operations in State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to meet revenue goals and create local jobs. The NDRC has the authority to approve major investment projects to improve efficiency. Rare earth producers are proposed to be merged into six firms, while iron and steel consolidations would likely involve major players like Baogang Group and Chinalco. The Central government's position to restrict expansion of some mining operations is not always well-received at the provincial level. Since 2012, new government regulations set minimum production capacity levels for iron ore and specialty steel. The policy aims to limit production capacity in energy-intensive industries like aluminum, steel, and cement, potentially leading to capacity reductions. Small State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) continue high production levels to boost revenues, but face regulations on technology and resource usage. Criticisms include market power abuse and price control. China can control access to capital through state-owned banks, reducing the number of SOEs while increasing their average size. China's State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) are becoming fewer but larger and more powerful, falling under the State Owned Assets Supervisor and Administration Commission (SOASAC). Many SOEs have been reorganized into limited liability corporations or joint-stock companies. State-owned, shareholding companies make up the majority of state firms and industrial output. The SOASAC aims to create \"national champions\" from some SOEs, giving them advantages over competitors. SOEs are now profit-driven but still influenced by government policies, including the \"go global\" initiative. In 2011, former PRC President Hu Jintao announced China's strategy to go global and encourage overseas investments by enterprises. China provides assistance to foreign countries through grants, low-cost loans, and concessional loans. The Bank of China offered $70 billion in loans in 2011 for foreign mineral acquisitions, with Australia being the top destination for Chinese mining investments, particularly in iron ore. Sub-Saharan Africa and Mongolia are also receiving Chinese attention for mineral projects. Chinese companies, especially SOEs, are expanding their global presence through acquisitions in Africa and Mongolia. The Jinchuan Group International Resources Co., China's largest cobalt producer, recently acquired Meet Reese in South Africa, boosting its reserves. Host countries are scrutinizing Chinese mining firms for corporate governance practices. Nick Lardy's book \"Markets over Mao\" suggests a shift towards market-driven growth with less state intervention, questioning the performance of SOEs in line with China's GDP growth. Nick Lardy criticizes the SOASAC model for inefficiency in producing national champions and argues that private firms are the main source of economic growth. He suggests that China could benefit from opening up certain sectors to competition, such as oil and gas. The United States has increased mineral imports from China over the past 20 years, becoming more dependent on China for raw materials by 2014. The United States is heavily reliant on imports for 19 critical minerals, with high import reliance on cobalt, titanium concentrate, germanium, zinc, and platinum group metals. Import reliance may not necessarily indicate supply risk, as factors like supplier reliability and availability of mineral supplies play a role. The United States is heavily reliant on imports for 19 critical minerals, with high import reliance on cobalt, titanium concentrate, germanium, zinc, and platinum group metals. Supply risks can arise from various factors such as limited electric power, skilled labor shortages, equipment shortages, labor unrest, weather or transportation delays, and opposition on environmental policy grounds. The U.S. is self-sufficient in minerals like iron ore and molybdenum, and has diversified supply sources for refined aluminum, zinc, and uranium through investments in overseas operations. The U.S. is heavily reliant on imports for critical minerals, with some materials being of higher quality, lower cost, and located in countries with extensive reserves. A 2008 NRC report states that critical minerals are essential and prone to supply restrictions. Indium, manganese, niobium, PGMs, and REEs are ranked critical with high supply risk. Among REE applications, some are considered more important than others. The U.S. heavily relies on imports for critical minerals, with some materials facing supply restrictions. Among rare earth elements (REEs), heavy REEs are at greater risk due to lack of substitutes. MIT and DOE identified energy critical elements (ECE) essential for renewable energy systems and high-value consumer products. DOE classified five REEs as critical, while others like cerium and lithium were deemed \"near-critical\". The United States and China import critical minerals from various countries such as southern Africa, Australia, South America, and Canada. While China has been a major source of certain mineral imports for the US, there are sufficient reserves in other countries. Mine production of key minerals like cobalt, platinum, chromite, tantalum, and manganese primarily occurs in southern Africa, Australia, Brazil, and Canada. The United States and China import critical minerals from various countries like southern Africa, Australia, South America, and Canada. While China has been a major source of certain mineral imports for the US, there are sufficient reserves in other countries. The current goal of U.S. mineral policy is to promote an adequate, stable, and reliable supply of materials for national security and economic well-being. The United States faces challenges in processing raw materials due to economic factors and cost competitiveness with other regions. Public policies and technology breakthroughs may help offset these disadvantages. Congress is exploring ways to reduce import reliance on critical materials for national security and economic stability. Mineral exploration spending in the United States has been consistently around 7%-8% of the global total exploration budget over the past 10 years, with the majority allocated to gold and copper resources. The value of U.S. mineral production has more than doubled in the same period due to high commodity prices, with varying production volumes for different minerals. Most minerals listed as import-dependent by the USGS can be found on public lands, but there is uncertainty about domestic production levels. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted the lack of information on mineral production on federal lands, with the Department of the Interior (DOI) lacking the authority to collect data from mine operators. Previous reports identified gold, copper, silver, molybdenum, and lead as dominant minerals produced on federal lands under the 1872 Mining Law. The majority of mining activity on federal lands is for gold, accounting for 88% of the total dollar value of hardrock minerals mined. Federal lands mineral production represents about 6% of all minerals produced in the United States. Legislation introduced in Congress includes policy options for critical minerals. Investment in R&D is seen as crucial by experts for the mining industry. Investment in R&D is crucial for the mining industry to support the development of new technologies addressing greater efficiencies in materials use, substitutes for critical minerals, and recycling. Congress could authorize funding for a USGS global assessment to identify exploitable mineral deposits and establish a Minerals Information Administration for supply and demand analysis. Companies mining on public lands may be required to report production data. Supporting greater exploration for critical minerals in the US, Australia, Africa, and Canada could be part of an international strategy. Few companies worldwide have the skills and technology for critical mineral development, primarily located in these regions and China. Joint ventures for R&D and exploration may be formed, including in the US. Congress may address restrictions on these efforts and oversee free trade issues related to critical mineral supply. The World Trade Organization (WTO) addressed two raw material issues related to China's export restrictions. The cases, settled in 2011 and 2012, involved restrictions on various minerals. The WTO ruled against China, stating that the country did not demonstrate a clear link between resource conservation and the need for export restrictions. The United States could support more trade missions and assist smaller countries in improving governance capacity. China's economic development will continue to have a significant impact. China's economic development will impact global supply of raw materials and products. Countries may need to adjust to secure resources for national security and economic growth. Many firms have moved to China for market access and lower production costs. China aims to transfer technology from these firms to enhance its manufacturing capacity. Despite current overcapacity, China may prioritize domestic manufacturing of higher-value products. Inefficient facilities may close, leading to increased imports. China's dominance in global raw materials supply and demand may be addressed through developing alternate sources, using substitutes, improving efficiency, investing in R&D for new technologies, and providing comprehensive minerals information. China's response to global market prices and potential reforms could impact domestic and export prices, leading to changes in the mining industry and increased imports. China's potential decrease in raw material exports calls for long-term planning by private and government sectors to meet U.S. national security and economic interests. Free trade issues should be monitored and addressed through the WTO if necessary. Further analysis is needed to assess U.S. firms' ability to adapt to supply disruptions, such as export restrictions, underinvestment, and other risks. Public policy measures may be required to mitigate these risks. Congress may need to consider policies to minimize the risk of supply interruptions of critical minerals and metals. H.R. 761, the National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2013, aims to streamline the federal permitting process for domestic mineral exploration and development. The bill passed by a vote of 246-178 on September 18, 2013, setting clear mine permitting goals and limiting the review process to 30 months. The Critical Minerals Policy Act of 2013, introduced by Senator Lisa Murkowski, aims to define critical minerals and establish a methodology for identifying them. The bill requires the Secretary of the Interior to maintain a list of up to 20 critical minerals and conduct a comprehensive resource assessment of their potential in the United States. Additionally, the bill seeks to establish analytical capabilities for monitoring mineral market dynamics as part of U.S. mineral policy. The Critical Minerals Policy Act of 2013 aims to assess critical mineral potential in the United States, focusing on federal lands. S. 1600 would update a 1999 report, examine mineral development regulations, and address abandoned hardrock mines. It would streamline the process for critical minerals exploration on federal lands, establish performance metrics for permitting, and promote R&D for alternatives and recycling. The Department of the Interior would produce an Annual Critical Minerals Outlook report. The Department of the Interior would produce an Annual Critical Minerals Outlook report providing forecasts of domestic supply, demand, and price for up to 10 years. Title II of the bill recommends mineral-specific actions for cobalt, lead, lithium, thorium, and rare earth elements. Title III would repeal the 1980 Minerals Policy Act and the Critical Minerals Act of 1984, authorizing $60 million for appropriation."
