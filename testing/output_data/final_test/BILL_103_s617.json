    "content": "The \"Desalinization Research and Development Act of 1994\" aims to address water shortages by researching low-cost desalinization and water reuse technologies for various beneficial uses. The Act emphasizes the importance of developing and conserving water resources through advanced technologies. The \"Desalinization Research and Development Act of 1994\" defines key terms such as desalinization, saline water, United States, and usable water for the purpose of addressing water shortages through research on low-cost desalinization and water reuse technologies. The term \"sponsor\" refers to any agency with the authority and capability to provide financial and property requirements for a desalinization facility. The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for managing the research and development program under the Act, coordinating with the Secretary of the Army. They will also jointly execute the Desalinization Development Program. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Army will conduct a research program to develop efficient methods for converting saline water into usable water through grants and contracts. The research program aims to find the best designs for desalinization processes, increase economic efficiency by using dual-purpose co-facilities, engage necessary personnel and institutions for research, and study methods for recovering byproducts to offset costs and reduce environmental impact. The management plan for the research program aims to reduce environmental impact from byproducts and ensure efficient conduct of the program. SEC. 6. DESALINIZATION DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for the Desalinization Development Program. The Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Interior have authority to design and construct facilities. Candidate facilities are submitted to the Secretaries for selection, subject to availability of Federal funds and cost sharing requirements. The Desalinization Development Program requires sponsors to pay at least 25 percent of the initial facility cost during construction, including design, construction, land, easements, and relocation costs. If the sponsor's contribution is less than 25 percent, they must pay additional amounts to meet the requirement. The sponsor must contribute 25% of the initial facility cost, not exceeding 50%, with a maximum cost of $10,000,000. They are responsible for operation, maintenance, and revenue from water sales. SEC. 7. PARTICIPATION BY INTERESTED AGENCIES AND OTHER PERSONS. Research and development activities by the Secretary of the Interior under this Act must be coordinated with other agencies including the Department of Commerce, Departments of Defense, Agriculture, State, Health and Human Services, Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, Agency for International Development, and other government and private entities. Other interested agencies may also participate. The Secretary of the Interior can receive resources from other agencies to support their activities. Research funded under this Act must be made available to the public, with exceptions for national defense and patent rights. Antitrust laws apply to individuals and organizations involved in grants and contracts from the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary of the Interior can accept technical and administrative assistance from State, public, or private agencies for research on water desalinization. Contracts or agreements can be made to share costs between the Secretary and the assisting agency. The Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of the Army can make grants, contracts, engage personnel, use facilities, and acquire property for research and development purposes under this Act. The Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of the Army can acquire property for research and development purposes, conduct inspections, participate in conferences, and cooperate with various entities for the advancement of water desalinization. The Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of the Army can collaborate with organizations, including foreign governments, agencies, and companies, to achieve the goals of this Act. SEC. 10. DESALINIZATION CONFERENCE. The President will sponsor an international desalinization conference within twelve months of this Act. Participants will include scientists, industry experts, government officials, and financial institutions to explore new technologies for affordable desalinization. Funding for the conference will be provided. Funding for the international desalinization conference may come from operating or program funds of the Agency for International Development, which will also seek support from other nations with desalinization technology or potential beneficiaries. SEC. 11. REPORTS. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of the Army, must prepare a report to the President and Congress every twelve months regarding the administration of this Act, detailing past actions and planned actions for the upcoming year. SEC. 12. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of Appropriations: $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1996, and necessary sums for fiscal years 1997-1999 for research and development. Up to $50,000,000 for desalinization development program from 1995-1999, split equally between the Department of the Interior and the Army Corps of Engineers."
