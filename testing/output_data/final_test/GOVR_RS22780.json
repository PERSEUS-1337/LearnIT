    "content": "During the first session of the 110th Congress, the Senate considered four nominations to the six-seat FEC. Nominees Robert D. Lenhard, Hans A. von Spakovsky, and Steven T. Walther served in recess appointments at the agency, while David M. Mason had been at the agency since 1998. The von Spakovsky nomination sparked controversy due to his actions on voting rights issues while at the Justice Department. The Senate Rules and Administration Committee hearing on June 13, 2007, focused on von Spakovsky, leading to the committee reporting all nominations on September 26, 2007. During the first session of the 110th Congress, the Senate considered four FEC nominations. The committee reported all nominees en bloc without recommendation due to inability to reach agreement. The stalemate continued into the second session, with only two commissioners remaining in office. Additional nomination activity began in April 2008. In April 2008, nomination activity for FEC positions continued. Lenhard withdrew his nomination, and President George W. Bush made new nominations, including Donald F. McGahn II and Cynthia L. Bauerly. Caroline C. Hunter was also nominated to the FEC. Von Spakovsky later withdrew his nomination. The Senate Rules and Administration Committee favorably reported the Bauerly, Hunter, and McGahn nominations. President Bush also announced his intention to nominate Matthew S. Petersen. In 2008, the White House announced the nomination of Matthew S. Petersen (R) to the FEC seat formerly held by von Spakovsky. On June 24, 2008, the Senate confirmed Bauerly, Hunter, McGahn, Petersen, and Walther. FEC appointments remained quiet until April 2009 when the terms of Commissioners McGahn and Walther expired. President Obama announced the nomination of John J. Sullivan to the Commission in May 2009. President Obama nominated John J. Sullivan to replace Commissioner Weintraub on the FEC. Even with fewer than four commissioners, the FEC could still carry out basic functions like gathering evidence and authorizing subpoenas. Existing campaign laws remained in effect, and the Commission amended its rules to allow remaining commissioners to execute some duties. The Federal Election Commission can meet with fewer than four members to approve general public information and appoint staff. However, at least four commissioners are required for important decisions like making rules, approving enforcement actions, and administering the presidential public financing program. In 2008, the FEC was without a quorum for over six months, but staff and two commissioners continued to provide information and prepare. In 2008, the absence of a quorum at the FEC delayed important decisions like rulemaking, enforcement actions, and administering the presidential public financing program. The Commission faced immediate issues such as implementing portions of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, pending enforcement cases, and ongoing litigation surrounding the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. Despite the challenges, the Commission continued to address these issues in 2009 and ensured that a policymaking quorum would not be lost unless fewer than four commissioners were in office. The 2008 \"shutdown\" may be of interest to the 111th Congressional consideration of oversight or appropriations issues."
