    "content": "President Bush and some in Congress support legislation for line item veto authority, with the President proposing the \"Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006\" to Congress on March 6, 2006. This proposal aims to allow Congress to vote on rescissions proposed by the President, following a Supreme Court ruling in 1998. The Supreme Court struck down the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, stating it gave the President unilateral power to change enacted statutes. The proposed Legislative Line Item Veto Act requires approval from both Houses for the President's rescission proposals, making it likely to pass constitutional scrutiny. This fast-track process is within the constitutional authority of each House to establish its own rules. The proposed Legislative Line Item Veto Act allows the President to suspend spending and tax provisions for up to 180 days, even if Congress rejects the proposal. This process differs from the Impoundment Control Act and the Line Veto Act of 1996. Congress must act quickly on the President's proposal, but there is no specified deadline for the President to submit it. The President's proposal under the Legislative Line Item Veto Act allows for a suspension of spending and tax provisions for up to 180 days, without a specified deadline for submission. The bills do not require provisions to be sent up together or limit the suspension period, raising questions about the extent of the suspension power granted. This raises issues similar to those addressed in the Supreme Court case Clinton v. City of New York. The discussion evaluates the proposed suspension provision under the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, comparing it to past impoundment practices. It suggests that the President's authority to cancel appropriations may raise constitutional issues, despite modifications made in the House and Senate. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 granted the President the power to cancel certain provisions in a law, including discretionary budget authority, new direct spending, and limited tax benefits. The Act required the President to follow specific procedures when exercising this authority, such as transmitting a special message to Congress within five days detailing the cancellations. The cancellation of provisions took effect upon receipt of the message by both Houses. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 allowed the President to cancel certain provisions in a law, with the cancellation becoming effective upon receipt of a special message by both Houses. The Act also outlined procedures for expedited congressional consideration of bills to disapprove cancellations and prohibited the President from re-canceling items already subject to disapproval legislation. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 allowed the President to cancel provisions in a law, with specific procedures for congressional consideration. The President sent 11 special messages canceling 82 provisions, leading to a veto override in one instance. The Supreme Court addressed two cancellations in Clinton v. City of New York, involving direct spending and tax benefits. The Supreme Court ruled in Clinton v. City of New York that the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, which allowed the President to cancel provisions in a law, violated the Constitution's Presentment Clause. The Court emphasized that statutory repeals must conform to the procedure outlined in the Constitution for enacting a law. The Supreme Court in Clinton v. City of New York ruled that the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 was unconstitutional because it allowed the President to unilaterally repeal parts of a statute, which was not authorized by the Constitution. The Court rejected the idea that Congress and the President could agree to such a process, stating that Congress cannot alter the procedures outlined in Article I, sec.7 without amending the Constitution. The majority opinion in Clinton v. City of New York emphasized that Congress cannot change procedures in Article I, sec.7 without amending the Constitution. Justice Kennedy's concurrence highlighted separation of powers concerns and the threat to liberty from concentrating power in one branch. He argued against the idea that political branches can freely reallocate their authority without risking liberty. The Constitution's structure requires stability beyond momentary convenience, as seen in various Supreme Court cases. The Court is vigilant against branches exceeding their powers, emphasizing the importance of separation of powers to protect liberty. The Supreme Court has articulated interpretations of constitutional directions that are rigid and not subject to \"balancing.\" It has struck down provisions of law that give one branch powers that should be diffused among separate branches or undermine the authority and independence of another branch. For example, the Court has invalidated attempts by Congress to exercise the responsibilities of other branches or reassign powers vested by the Constitution. The Supreme Court has ruled on cases involving the separation of powers, such as Congress not having the authority to control the execution of laws or confer Article III power on an Article I judge. Justice Blackmun highlighted cases where Congress established arrangements between agencies, the President, Congress, and the Judiciary under its Article I authority. The Supreme Court's role in disputes over agency arrangements is to ensure that the essential lines of authority between constitutional actors remain intact. This is done through a balancing test and a functionalist approach, as seen in cases like Morrison v. Olson and Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor. The Court upholds statutory provisions that do not pose a danger of aggrandizement or encroachment on core constitutional functions. In Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, legislation allowing the General Services Administration to control Presidential papers after resignation was upheld against a separation-of-powers challenge. The focus was on preventing the Executive Branch from fulfilling its constitutional duties. The Court is vigilant against assigning tasks to the Judicial Branch that belong to other branches and ensuring no law threatens the Judicial Branch's institutional integrity. Justice Kennedy viewed the Court's Item Veto decision as falling within the first line of cases, ensuring a proper balance of legislative, executive, and judicial authority. Separation of powers operates both horizontally and vertically, between each branch and the citizens. The citizen has a vital interest in the regularity of governmental power, as seen in the Chadha case. This case involves the expenditure of money or the grant of a tax exemption. The line item veto provision does not pose a constitutional issue in terms of the expedited rescission process it establishes. The President does not have direct authority to cancel spending or tax benefit provisions; he must submit them for review. Justice Kennedy emphasized that Congress cannot voluntarily relinquish its powers, as this compromises the political liberty of citizens protected by the separation of powers. The President is vested with authority to cancel spending or tax benefit provisions through a fast-track process, requiring Congress to act on proposals within a limited time frame. This process raises potential constitutional questions regarding the President's discretionary authority. The President can propose rescissions of spending or tax provisions, with the ability to suspend them for up to 180 days. The suspension can be ended earlier if it no longer serves the Act's purposes. The bills do not specify a time limit for the suspension period or prohibit combining rescission authority with the proposed Item Veto Act. The 180-day deferral does not automatically end with congressional rejection unless the President orders it. Critics have raised concerns that the 180-day deferral period for rescission proposals could delay funding until the end of the fiscal year, even if Congress acts swiftly to reject the cancellations. There are suggestions that pairing the fast-track rescission process with the old process could grant the White House additional budget impoundment authority. The Office of Management and Budget has downplayed these concerns, stating that the 180-day provision allows items for rescission to be set aside while Congress considers the request. The 180-day deferral period for rescission proposals allows items to be set aside while Congress considers the request. If Congress rejects a rescission request, the President can terminate the deferral immediately. Critics worry that this could delay funding until the end of the fiscal year. A reviewing court may look at past congressional actions to determine the extent of departure from past norms. Under the current Impoundment Control Act, rescission and deferral processes are tightly controlled. The President can propose rescissions at any time, and Congress has 45 days to approve them. If no action is taken, the budget authority must be made available immediately. Deferrals can be made up to the end of the fiscal year with a special message to Congress. The Impoundment Control Act allows the President to propose rescissions and deferrals with a special message to Congress. Deferrals are limited to \"programmatic\" deferrals and exclude \"policy\" deferrals, but a proposal to suspend the 180-day limitation could revive presidential policy deferrals. The act originally allowed deferrals not to extend beyond the fiscal year and could be terminated by a resolution of disapproval from Congress. The 1983 Chadha decision nullified legislative vetoes on deferrals. The 1983 Chadha decision declared one-House legislative vetoes unconstitutional, nullifying the deferral legislative veto provision. The D.C. Circuit's ruling in City of New Haven v. United States determined that Congress preferred no statute to one without the one-House veto provision, essential for controlling presidential deferrals. As a result of Chadha, Section 1013 of the Impoundment Control Act transformed into a license for impounding funds for policy reasons. The unconstitutional legislative veto provision in section 1013 of the Impoundment Control Act has been deemed inseverable from the rest of the section, leading to its invalidation by the District Court. The Court highlighted the difference between policy and programmatic deferrals, emphasizing that the former goes against congressional budgetary policies. The appeals court emphasized the distinction between policy and programmatic deferrals, stating that programmatic impoundments deal with routine and trivial matters. Congress later codified this distinction and prohibited Presidents from submitting new rescission proposals. The President's practice of submitting multiple rescission proposals for the same matter after Congress's inaction was prohibited by Congress. This prohibition remains in effect for the duration of the appropriation, spanning multiple fiscal years. The 1996 Veto Act included provisions to limit presidential authority, such as bundling all canceled items in a single message to Congress and transmitting the message within five days of enactment. The cancellation took effect upon receipt by both Houses, but if a disapproval was enacted, the funds had to be utilized. Congressional review lasted for 30 calendar days of session, with the option to bring it up again in the next Congress if filed within five days of the new session. A rescission bill had to be filed by the fifth day, reported to the floor by the seventh day without amendment, and could be amended in the House with support from 50 Members. New cancellation items could be added in the Senate if from the same law. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act proposal is being analyzed in light of past executive challenges to legislative spending controls. The question is whether the President could effectively cancel spending items using the 180-day rescission authority. The potential constitutional consequences and the application of prior separation of powers cases, such as the Clinton ruling, are key considerations in this analysis. The Supreme Court has ruled on cases that either concentrate powers in one branch or undermine the authority of another branch. These rulings do not allow for exceptions or balancing of interests, rejecting agreements made by political branches. In one case, a federal appeals court enforced a ruling when Congress tried to bypass it indirectly. An example is the Metropolitan Airports Case, where Congress attempted to give managing authority over airports to a regional authority. In the Metropolitan Airports Case, Congress attempted to give managing authority over National and Dulles International Airports to a regional authority. However, the Supreme Court found that Congress violated separation of powers principles by retaining substantial control over key policy and management decisions through a Board of Review consisting of Members of Congress. This control was deemed unconstitutional as it made the Board an agent of Congress, undermining the separation of powers. The Supreme Court ruled that Congress cannot delegate its legislative power to an agent, as it must adhere to the bicameralism and presentment requirements of the Constitution. The Court rejected the argument that the Board was a practical accommodation between the Legislative and Executive branches, stating that the statutory scheme challenged allowed for an extensive expansion of legislative power beyond its constitutional limits. Madison's warning about the legislature masking encroachments with indirect measures was cited. Within six months of the Supreme Court ruling, Congress passed new legislation regarding the Review Board. Members of Congress were no longer required to be on the Board, but their selection had to be from lists submitted by the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore. The Board's veto power was removed, but its authority was expanded in other ways. The Board could now review a wider range of actions and make recommendations to the Directors. If the Directors did not accept the recommendations, the matter had to be submitted to Congress for a 60-day review period. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reviewed the new legislation regarding the Review Board, finding that it violated the separation of powers. The Board's appointment process was changed, but the court determined that it still remained a congressional agent. The Directors were restricted to selecting members from lists provided by the Speaker and the President pro tempore. The Court of Appeals found that Congress retains control over the appointments to the Review Board, ensuring it serves as its agent. The court considered the practical consequences of the Board's authority to delay actions by the Directors, rejecting the argument that it only had advisory duties after losing its direct veto power. The Court of Appeals examined the Board's authority to influence the Directors' decisions by delaying actions. The Board's powers allow it to interfere with the Directors' independent responsibilities, choosing which decisions can be implemented immediately and which require congressional review. Congressional domination of the Board is ensured through its composition requirements. The Court of Appeals examined the Board's authority to influence the Directors' decisions by delaying actions, ensuring congressional domination of the Board. The amended statute expands the Board's review scope and allows it to compel the Authority to consider specific issues, with the power to delay critical decisions for up to six months through congressional review. This power incentivizes Directors to align decisions with the Board's preferences. The Court of Appeals expressed concerns about the Board's ability to influence Directors' decisions by delaying actions, potentially holding important decisions hostage to secure agreement on unrelated matters. The court referenced previous cases like Metropolitan Airports and Hechinger to highlight the potential for abuse of power. The proposed item veto revival was also discussed in relation to the constitutional separation of powers. The Clinton Court and Metropolitan Airports Court addressed concerns about reassigning power to the President and Congress' attempts to retain control. The Hechinger case struck down a revised scheme for potential illegitimacy. Challengers to the Legislative Item Veto Act of 2006 may raise questions about expanded suspension provisions. Modifications to the proposal in H.R. 4890 are being assessed. H.R. 4890 underwent hearings and amendments in the House, leading to its approval by the House Budget Committee and subsequent passage in the House by a vote of 247-172. The Senate Budget Committee also held hearings on S. 2381, which was substantially revised as a result of concerns raised during the hearing. The Committee substantially revised S. 2381, included in a budget reform bill as Title I of S. 3521, the Stop Over Spending Act of 2006. The President must propose cancellations within 45 days of the law's enactment, with the option to defer spending or suspend items for an additional 45 days. The practice may be extended if Congress is adjourned. The revised H.R. 4890 replaces current Parts B and C with a new Part B, retaining some provisions. Section 1016 allows suits by the Comptroller General, while Section 1013 limits presidential deferrals of discretionary budget authority. The amended H.R. 4890 includes changes to Section 1020(c) regarding budget authority cancellation proposals. The bill does not specify a time limit for deferral of obligations, potentially allowing for a delay of at least 135 days. Unlike current law, there is no requirement for funding to resume if Congress rejects the cancellation proposal. The House Report accompanying the bill states that the President must discontinue deferral authority once Congress acts on an approval bill. There is no statutory relation between deferral and suspension periods and the expedited congressional consideration period. The House Rules Committee Report indicates that the President must immediately suspend deferral of budgetary provisions in an approval bill that fails to pass in a House of Congress. The House Report raises constitutional concerns about giving the President deferral or suspension power and withdrawing it based on Congress's non-legislative action. It suggests that Congress must pass a new law or leave such decisions to the President's discretion. This reflects a misunderstanding of each House's constitutional authority and the Supreme Court's ruling in INS v. Chadha. The Supreme Court has broad authority to determine its own rules of proceedings, as stated in Article I, section 5, clause 2 of the Constitution. The power to make rules is continuous and absolute, as seen in the INS v. Chadha ruling. The constitutional defect found in Chadha was Congress attempting to exercise legislative power without proper authority. The Chadha Court disclosed that Congress tried to exercise legislative power without following constitutional requirements. The Court found unlawful actions seeking to reverse executive actions without presenting them to the President. The Constitution allows for legislative actions exempt from the Presentation Clause, citing exceptions in Article 1, section 7 and section 5. The Chadha Court recognized that the rulemaking power of each House of Congress may have an impact outside the legislative branch, as long as its primary focus is internal. It did not cast doubt on \"report and wait\" provisions previously approved in Sibbach v. Wilson. These provisions require a set period of time to pass without congressional action preventing an executive action from taking effect, or for Congress to take affirmative legislative action approving or disapproving its effectiveness. The expedited consideration provisions in pending line item veto proposals are examples of contingent legislation. The President's rescission recommendations require approval by both Houses of Congress within a specified time frame. If not approved, the suspension or obligation is lifted, showing that the President has no legislative authority but can only recommend rescissions. The President's rescission recommendations require approval by both Houses of Congress within a specified time frame. If not approved, the suspension or obligation is lifted, showing that the President has no legislative authority but can only recommend rescissions. Congress must give legal effect to any presidential recommendations through further legislation. Language in a bill authorizing the President to suspend or defer certain budget items is incidental to the expedited consideration process. Deferral of obligation authority is necessary to prevent disruption of the obligation process. The President's rescission recommendations require approval by Congress within a specified time frame. The Executive can defer spending during the 45-day wait period, supported by Section 683 and 2 U.S.C. 684. Congress may consider removing \"suspension\" or \"deferral\" language in a line item veto bill. The President's rescission recommendations must be approved by Congress within a set time frame. Congress is considering removing \"suspension\" or \"deferral\" language in a line item veto bill to avoid constitutional issues. It is suggested that a separate bill may not be necessary to end a deferral or suspension, as seen in previous court rulings. The debate in Congress revolves around reaffirming the President's rescission recommendations through legislative processes, potentially granting the President a line item veto power. Constitutional concerns arise regarding the discretionary lifting of deferrals or suspensions in H.R. 4890. The House Rules Committee report highlights discrepancies in the deferral periods and expedited congressional consideration timelines. The House Rules Committee report expects the President to immediately suspend budgetary provisions in a cancellation proposal if it fails to pass in Congress, potentially allowing the President to withhold funds for up to three months, leading to program starvation. The House Rules Committee report expects the President to immediately suspend budgetary provisions in a cancellation proposal if it fails to pass in Congress, potentially allowing the President to withhold funds for up to three months, leading to program starvation. Denying funds could force major appropriations like Amtrak to slash routes and fire staff, as long as the President retains the power of the purse. The legislation does not clearly state that the President must release funds immediately if a rescission is defeated. The Committee's statement of intent may not be held persuasive, as it purposely omitted an express direction to the President due to perceived lack of authority. The House Rules Committee report expects the President to suspend budgetary provisions in a cancellation proposal if it fails to pass in Congress, potentially leading to program starvation. The Senate Budget Committee identified concerns with the Administration's proposal, including the short period given for congressional consideration of presidential rescission proposals. A reviewing court is unlikely to find an enforceable right against presidential inaction. Title I of S. 3521 addresses concerns regarding presidential rescission proposals, including limitations on the number of special messages the President can send per year for rescinding discretionary budget authority, direct spending items, and targeted tax benefits. This proposal replaces Part C of the Impoundment Control Act and allows the President to propose up to four rescission messages annually. The President can send up to four rescission messages annually for discretionary budget authority, direct spending items, and targeted tax benefits. Messages must be sent within one year of enactment, with no resubmittals allowed unless Congress adjourns sine die. Deferrals or suspensions of budget authority require a cancellation message within 45 days. The President can send up to four rescission messages annually for discretionary budget authority, direct spending items, and targeted tax benefits within one year of enactment. Special rules apply to suspensions of direct spending and targeted tax benefits, with expedited consideration procedures in both Houses. The Line Item Veto scheme of Title I of the SOS Act appears to avoid potential constitutional difficulties. The President can send up to four rescission messages annually for discretionary budget authority, direct spending items, and targeted tax benefits within one year of enactment. Special rules apply to suspensions of direct spending and targeted tax benefits, with expedited consideration procedures in both Houses. The Administration's proposal and H.R. 4890 have identified deferral provisions with a 45-day limit, where obligation must occur even if Congress does not take final disapproval action within that period. The proposal does not require obligation if disapproval occurs before the 45-day period ends, creating a disparity in withholding and congressional consideration periods. The failure to repeal Part B of the Impoundment Control Act could raise constitutional questions. The President can send up to four rescission messages annually for discretionary budget authority, direct spending items, and targeted tax benefits within one year of enactment. Special rules apply to suspensions of direct spending and targeted tax benefits, with expedited consideration procedures in both Houses. The failure to repeal Part B of the Impoundment Control Act could raise constitutional questions regarding the deferral provisions and rescission process. The Impoundment Control Act allows the President to propose rescissions for discretionary budget authority, direct spending, and targeted tax benefits. There are special rules for suspensions of direct spending and targeted tax benefits, with expedited consideration procedures. The use of Section 683 could potentially extend the deferral period to over 100 days, raising concerns of manipulation. Repealing Part B or limiting the President's options could address these issues. The Supreme Court's ruling in Clinton v. New York City presents legal obstacles to giving the President line item veto authority. The Court's opinion suggests that any such authority must be carefully limited to prevent excessive power in the Executive branch. Line item veto schemes will face heightened scrutiny under separation of powers jurisprudence. A cautious approach is needed to prevent potential abuse of cancellation power by the President. The cancellation of targetable items shortly after a law's enactment, with automatic deferrals or suspensions ending with expedited congressional consideration, is likely constitutional. The extent of Executive authority remains uncertain."
