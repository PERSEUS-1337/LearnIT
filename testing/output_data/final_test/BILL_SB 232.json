    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 41326 of the Education Code is amended. The school district accepting an apportionment exceeding 200% of the recommended reserve agrees to conditions outlined in the article. Before seeking emergency funds, the district's governing board must discuss the need at a meeting and hear input from stakeholders. A qualifying district is one that accepts a loan as described. The Superintendent assumes all legal rights, duties, and powers of a qualifying school district's governing board. An appointed administrator, with expertise in management and finance, acts on behalf of the Superintendent under their direction and supervision. The appointed administrator must have expertise in management and finance. The Superintendent is exempt from certain requirements to facilitate the appointment of the administrator and necessary staff. The Superintendent may appoint an employee to act as administrator for a qualifying school district, with the employee retaining their retirement plan. Upon completion of the appointment, the employee can return to their previous position. The appointment as administrator for a qualifying school district allows the employee to retain their retirement plan and upon completion, return to their previous position with the same benefits. The administrator appointed for a qualifying school district can choose to be a member of the State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System. If already a member, they will continue to be one during their appointment. The Superintendent may require the administrator to be placed on the school district's payroll for contributions and other benefits. The administrator appointed for a qualifying school district is considered an employee of the district for workers' compensation benefits. They are also covered under errors and omissions liability insurance. The administrator's salary and benefits are determined by the Superintendent and paid by the district. They can hire staff as needed, including a certified public accountant, at the district's expense. The administrator has the authority to perform various duties. The administrator appointed for a qualifying school district has the authority to implement fiscal changes, revise the educational program, distribute the fiscal recovery burden fairly, and consult with various stakeholders for input. The administrator appointed for a qualifying school district has the authority to consult with stakeholders, seek recommendations, enter agreements, and request assistance from the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence. After one fiscal year of accepting emergency apportionment, the governing board of a qualifying school district may evaluate the administrator annually. An advisory evaluation of an administrator in a qualifying school district focuses on fiscal recovery and academic achievement. Criteria are agreed upon before the evaluation, including goals, commendations, and recommendations for improvement. The evaluation is submitted to the Governor, Legislature, Superintendent, and County Office Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team. Upon appointment of an administrator, the district superintendent ceases to be an employee of the qualifying school district, and severance compensation is determined according to specified guidelines. The administrator has the authority to terminate the employment of certain school district level administrators if they fail to take action to prevent fiscal insolvency. The Superintendent and administrator have authority until the qualifying school district shows probable compliance with recovery plans after one fiscal year. The Superintendent can return power to the governing board if performance under the recovery plan is satisfactory. The Superintendent has approved recovery plans, the County Office has completed improvement plans, necessary collective bargaining agreements are in place, all required reports have been completed, and future compliance with approved recovery plans is probable. After meeting specified conditions and notifying relevant parties, the qualifying school district's governing board regains its legal rights, duties, and powers, except those held by the appointed trustee. The Superintendent appoints a trustee to oversee the district's operations until certain conditions are met. If the qualifying school district violates recovery plans approved by the Superintendent, legal rights, duties, and powers may be reassumed by the Superintendent until future compliance is probable. The Legislature intends for legislative budget subcommittees to review qualifying school districts annually, evaluating their financial condition, the impact of recovery plans on their educational programs, and the efforts of state-appointed administrators to gather input from the community and governing board. The district superintendent is entitled to a due process hearing to determine final compensation, which can range from zero to six times their monthly salary. The outcome of the hearing must be reported to the Superintendent and the public, with an explanation for the compensation rationale. This provision applies to contracts negotiated on or after June 21, 2004. When the Superintendent assumes control over a qualifying school district, they shall review fiscal oversight with the County Office Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team. Within three months, a report with findings and recommendations will be submitted to the Legislature and Department of Finance. The Superintendent may take over fiscal oversight responsibilities from a county superintendent who has failed to fulfill their duties. If indicators of financial distress were not considered or appropriate actions were not taken, further investigation will be conducted and a report will be provided. The Superintendent may provide a report on the fiscal oversight practices of the county superintendent of schools to the appropriate committees."
