    "content": "The Act titled \"Carbon Leakage Mitigation Study Act of 2009\" includes definitions for key terms. The Act defines key terms such as \"cap-and-trade program,\" \"carbon leakage,\" and \"compensatory measure.\" The curr_chunk defines terms related to a domestic cap-and-trade program, including compensatory measures, greenhouse gas, and output. The curr_chunk defines the term \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Energy. The curr_chunk discusses the Industry Productivity and Carbon Leakage Study. The Secretary, in consultation with relevant federal departments, will conduct a study to assess the risk of carbon leakage and changes in output in US industrial sectors due to a potential cap-and-trade program. The study will also estimate the impact on sectors at risk of significant carbon leakage. The study will assess the impact of a cap-and-trade program on US industrial sectors, including production, imports, exports, energy intensity, greenhouse gas intensity, price elasticity, trade elasticity, and trade intensity. Other qualitative indicators like market structure and product differentiation will also be considered. The impact of a cap-and-trade program on US industrial sectors will be assessed, including factors like product differentiation, availability of substitutes, and constraints on foreign producers. The overall risk of carbon leakage by sector and subsector will be evaluated, along with impacts on production, profitability, greenhouse gas emissions, and employment levels. The study will assess the economic impacts of climate change policies on industries, including production costs, currency exchange rates, consumer preferences, and other relevant factors. The report will include recommendations for data collection and prioritize trading partners of industries at risk of carbon leakage. The study will assess economic impacts of climate change policies on industries and provide recommendations for data collection activities and subsequent studies by the Secretary. SEC. 4. STUDY OF MEASURES TO MITIGATE CARBON LEAKAGE. The Secretary, in consultation with relevant agencies, will conduct a study to evaluate compensatory measures to prevent carbon leakage from a cap-and-trade program. This study will assess measures used by other jurisdictions and the risk of carbon leakage from US industries under potential greenhouse gas emission prices. The study will evaluate compensatory measures to prevent carbon leakage from a cap-and-trade program, considering industries at risk, changes in market shares, and international trade commitments. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress upon completion of the study on compensatory measures to prevent carbon leakage from a cap-and-trade program."
