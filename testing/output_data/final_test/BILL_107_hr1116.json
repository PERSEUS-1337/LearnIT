    "content": "The \"Quiet Communities Act of 2001\" may be cited as such. The Act includes findings. Congress finds that approximately 28 million Americans suffer from hearing loss, with 10 million cases attributed to noise exposure. Noise from various sources like aircraft and traffic can lead to sleep loss, psychological and physiological damage, and work disruption. Chronic noise exposure is linked to cardiovascular disorders, learning deficits in children, stress, and reduced quality of life. Excessive noise can also result in decreased worker productivity. The Environmental Protection Agency established an Office of Noise Abatement and Control to regulate noise emissions and promote noise education and research. However, funding for the office was terminated in 1982, leaving the agency responsible for enforcing noise regulations without adequate resources. The Noise Control Act of 1972 prohibited State and local governments from regulating noise sources, leading to dormant noise abatement programs across the country. With population growth and increased air and vehicular traffic, noise pollution is expected to worsen. The Environmental Protection Agency should take a leading role in combating noise pollution for the health and welfare of citizens.

The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will reestablish an Office of Noise Abatement and Control with duties including promoting State and local noise control programs, conducting national noise research, and environmental assessments to address noise pollution impacts. The Office of Noise Abatement and Control will focus on developing and disseminating information on noise effects and control methods, providing educational materials and training programs for state and local noise abatement efforts, and establishing regional technical assistance centers. The Office of Noise Abatement and Control will assess the effectiveness of the Noise Control Act of 1972, emphasizing local and State noise abatement approaches, market incentives, and coordination with other agencies. The Administrator will conduct a study on airport noise, contracting independent scientists with expertise in noise measurements, effects, and abatement techniques. The Federal Aviation Administration will conduct a study on noise measurement methodologies, health impacts, and effectiveness of noise abatement programs at airports. A report with recommendations on mitigating aircraft noise's impact on communities will be submitted to Congress within 24 months. SEC. 4. Grants under Quiet Communities Program are amended to include training programs on noise abatement equipment and implementing noise abatement plans. SEC. 5. Authorization of appropriations for the Office of Noise Abatement and Control is set at $21,000,000 for fiscal years 2002 through 2006."
