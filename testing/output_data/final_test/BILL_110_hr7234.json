    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Integrated Risk Information System Authorization Act\". The Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) was created by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1985 to provide scientific information on chemical toxicity. It is a vital database relied upon by researchers, government officials, public health experts, and the public for information on health risks associated with chemical exposure. IRIS supports the development of risk assessments for chemicals, with approximately 9 million inquiries made to the database each year. The IRIS database struggles to keep up with the influx of 700 new chemicals entering the US market annually. The EPA's efforts to update the database have been hindered by a slow review process, resulting in only 2 new entries per year. More timely scientific assessments are needed to guide research and decisions regarding chemical toxicity. The IRIS database needs science-based inclusion managed by the EPA's Office of Research and Development to produce assessments more quickly without interference. The term \"Assistant Administrator\" in this Act refers to the Assistant Administrator for the Office of Research and Development of the Environmental Protection Agency. This Act also addresses research and assessment. The Assistant Administrator maintains a public database of scientific information on chemical toxicity, including hazard identification and dose response assessments. They publish final assessments for new chemicals and updates for existing ones annually. Nominations for assessments are solicited from various entities, and a list of proposed chemicals for assessment is issued 2 years in advance. Chemicals proposed for assessment must have their assessment completed and available on a database within 4 years. The list of chemicals for assessment is not subject to review by other Federal agencies. SEC. 5. ASSESSMENT REVIEW. The Assistant Administrator determines information for chemical assessment, includes public comment, internal review with other agencies, and peer review by independent scientists before publication in the database. The Assistant Administrator ensures that federal agencies with conflicts of interest are excluded from developing chemical assessments. Assessments are developed and reviewed without presidential or federal agency review before publication. SEC. 6 states that chemical assessments are not subject to certain bulletins. SEC. 7 requires finalizing and publishing assessments within 6 months for entries in development prior to the Act's enactment."
