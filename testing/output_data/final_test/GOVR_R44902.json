    "content": "An integrated CCS system involves capturing and separating CO2, purifying, compressing, and transporting it to a sequestration site, and injecting it into geological reservoirs. The capture step is the most challenging and costly, requiring significant energy. Transport and injection/storage steps are less challenging. Carbon dioxide pipelines are already in use for EOR in the United States. The capture step in CCS involves separating CO2 from other gases using post-combustion, precombustion, or oxy-fuel combustion capture methods. Current commercial CO2 capture systems can operate at 85%-95% efficiency. Challenges in CCS include economic, regulatory, and ownership issues, as well as questions about the permanence of CO2 sequestration in deep geological reservoirs. Carbon capture technologies can operate at 85%-95% efficiency, capturing CO2 before it is released into the atmosphere. The energy penalty in the capture phase could increase electricity costs by 80% and reduce plant capacity by 20%. 70%-90% of the total cost for CCS is associated with capture and compression. Post-combustion capture involves extracting CO2 from flue gas after combustion of fossil fuels or biomass. Carbon capture technologies, such as absorption using chemical solvents like amine, can capture large quantities of CO2 from flue gases. The captured CO2 is then released in a regenerator and compressed for storage. Currently, only the Petra Nova plant in the U.S. captures large volumes of CO2. The post-combustion capture process, like the one used at the Petra Nova plant, can capture over 1 million tons of CO2 per year. Precombustion capture involves separating CO2 from fuel by creating hydrogen through a process called gasification. This results in a mixture of CO2 and hydrogen, which can be converted into electricity after impurities are removed. Precombustion capture technology involves creating hydrogen through gasification, resulting in a mixture of CO2 and hydrogen. A chemical solvent like Selexol captures the CO2, leaving nearly pure hydrogen for electricity generation in an integrated gasification combined-cycle plant. An example is the Great Plains Synfuels Plant, which produces synthetic natural gas from lignite coal and sends high-purity CO2 for enhanced oil recovery in Canada. Oxy-fuel combustion capture uses pure oxygen for combustion. Oxy-fuel combustion capture involves using pure oxygen for combustion, resulting in a flue gas mainly composed of CO2 and water. The CO2 can then be separated, compressed, transported via pipelines, and stored. This method eliminates the large amount of nitrogen in the flue gas stream and is currently being tested at lab and pilot scales. Approximately 4,500 miles of pipelines in the United States transport CO2, primarily for enhanced oil recovery. Transporting CO2 in pipelines is similar to transporting fuels like natural gas and oil, requiring design attention, leak monitoring, and overpressure protection. CO2 is typically compressed into a supercritical state for transportation, making it dense like a liquid but fluid like a gas. Ships can be used for long-distance or overseas transport of CO2, similar to how liquefied natural gas, propane, and butane are shipped worldwide. While rail cars and trucks can also transport CO2, it may not be economical for large-scale CCS operations. Pipeline transport costs vary based on construction, operation, maintenance, right-of-way costs, and regulatory fees. The cost of transporting CO2 via pipelines depends on factors like quantity, distance, onshore or offshore location, and terrain. Ship transport costs are uncertain but may be lower than pipelines for long distances and smaller quantities. Developing a national CO2 pipeline network for CCS faces regulatory and economic challenges. A network for greenhouse gas reduction using CCS may require federal policy beyond current regulations. Stakeholders suggest building on state experience for CO2 pipeline siting. Three geological formations considered for carbon sequestration are depleted oil and gas reservoirs, deep saline reservoirs, and unmineable coal seams. CO2 is injected in a supercritical state below ground into porous rock formations to prevent migration. The process of injecting CO2 into deep geological formations for storage requires an overlying caprock to trap the CO2 underground. Existing technologies from the oil and gas industry are being adapted for long-term storage and monitoring. The DOE's Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership Initiative is conducting large-scale field testing to confirm the safety and economics of industrial-scale CO2 storage in different regions of the United States. The development phase began in 2008 and is projected to last through 2018. The development phase for CO2 storage began in 2008 and is projected to last through 2018. The storage capacity for CO2 in geological formations is potentially huge, with the United States alone estimated to have a total storage capacity ranging between 2.6 trillion and 22 trillion tons of CO2. The suitability of a site depends on various factors, and for CCS to succeed, it is assumed that each reservoir type would permanently store the majority of injected CO2. The United States is a world leader in CO2 storage technology, injecting approximately 68 million tons of CO2 underground each year for enhanced oil recovery. Using CO2 from industrial emitters for this purpose could offset capture and transport costs with revenues from oil and gas production. The United States leads in CO2 storage technology, injecting 68 million tons annually for enhanced oil recovery. Revenues from oil and gas production can offset capture costs. CO2 is used for EOR onshore or offshore, with most U.S. projects in western Texas. Saline reservoirs can also be used for long-term sequestration. Deep saline reservoirs are the largest potential for storing CO2, but unlike oil and gas reservoirs, they do not enhance production or offset costs. Unmineable U.S. coal beds can trap gases like methane, which can be extracted as coal-bed methane. CO2 binds even more tightly to coal than methane. Studies show that CO2 binds tightly to coal, displacing methane. Injecting CO2 into coal seams could allow for methane recovery, known as enhanced coal bed methane recovery (ECBM), to offset costs. This concept of carbon utilization is gaining interest in Congress and the private sector for capturing and storing CO2 in useful products to reduce emissions and offset capture costs. Carbon utilization, also known as CCUS, involves fixing carbon oxide through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis, converting it into a material or chemical compound for secure storage, and using it for commercial purposes. This process is defined in legislative language, such as in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, to reduce emissions and offset capture costs. Figure 2 shows various utilization pathways. The Department of Energy (DOE) sponsors research on utilizing CO2 for various purposes, including cement, plastics, mineralization, and enhanced oil and gas recovery. Currently, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is the dominant use of CO2 globally. Direct air capture (DAC) technologies are emerging in this field. Direct air capture (DAC) is an emerging technology that aims to remove CO2 directly from the atmosphere. DAC systems can be classified as net carbon negative if the captured CO2 is permanently sequestered or used in long-lasting products like cement or plastics. These systems can be located almost anywhere and do not need to be near point sources of CO2 emissions. Direct air capture (DAC) systems can be located near manufacturing plants that require CO2 as an input, reducing the need for long pipeline systems. However, DAC systems have a high cost per ton of CO2 captured compared to conventional CCS technologies, with estimates ranging from $94 to $232 per ton for commercially deployed plants. Legislation such as the USE IT Act aims to support DAC technology. The USE IT Act in the 115th Congress supports carbon dioxide utilization and direct air capture research, offering a technology prize for DAC projects capturing over 10,000 tons per year at less than $200 per ton CO2. The Carbon Capture Prize Act also incentivizes technology to reduce CO2 levels, including DAC technologies. Notably, the Boundary Dam plant in Canada and the Petra Nova plant in Texas are currently capturing CO2 in large quantities using post-combustion capture technology. The Nova-W.A. Parish Generating Station in the United States is the first coal-fired plant with CCS technology, capturing 5,000 tons of CO2 per day. The captured CO2 is transported to an oil field for enhanced oil recovery, with production expected to increase significantly. Petra Nova received over $190 million in federal funds for a $1 billion retrofit project, increasing oil production from 300 to 15,000 barrels per day after EOR. It is the only CCPI Round 3 project using Recovery Act funding that is currently operating, capturing more CO2 per year than Canada's Boundary Dam power plant. Petra Nova retrofit Unit 8 of the W.A. Parish power plant, capturing more CO2 than Canada's Boundary Dam. The project reduces CO2 emissions from the entire complex by about 11%. The W.A. Parish complex emitted nearly 15 million tons of CO2 in 2015. The Petra Nova project at the W.A. Parish power plant aims to reduce CO2 emissions by about 11%. The project demonstrates the economic feasibility of post-combustion capture and reuse for existing plants, with the potential to enhance the sustainability of coal-fueled power plants globally. The Boundary Dam project in Canada, costing $1.3 billion, was the first commercial-scale power plant with CCS technology. The Boundary Dam project in Canada cost $1.3 billion, with $500 million allocated for CCS and retrofitting the coal-fired generating unit. The project received $240 million from the Canadian federal government and started operating in October 2014. It captures and sells most of its CO2 for EOR, shipping 90% via a 41-mile pipeline to the Weyburn Field in Saskatchewan. The plant had captured over 2 million tons of CO2 by April 2018. The Boundary Dam project in Canada, costing $1.3 billion, captured over 2 million tons of CO2 by April 2018. The 115-megawatt plant aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 annually. CCS R&D has been funded by DOE since 1997, with over $5 billion in annual appropriations provided by Congress. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget proposes a shift in priorities, reducing the FER&D budget by $225 million compared to FY2018. The Trump Administration's approach to DOE funding for early-stage R&D would reverse previous policies, with Congress increasing funding for FY2018 and FY2019 compared to the Administration's budget request. House-passed legislation would increase funding by over $58 million for FY2019, while the Senate-passed bill would maintain funding at $727 million, substantially higher than the Administration's request. The Administration's FY2019 budget request for DOE CCS programs is $502 million, a 31% reduction from FY2018. Carbon capture and storage would receive $40 million, an 80% decrease from FY2018. The budget prioritizes the Advanced Energy Systems account with a request of $175 million. The budget request for FY2019 prioritizes the Advanced Energy Systems (AES) account with a request of $175 million, focusing on activities such as advanced combustion/gasification, turbines, fuel cells, sensors, power generation efficiency, and energy materials. Other accounts under the Coal CCS & Power Systems program area are proposed to be funded slightly above or below FY2018 levels, except for CCS activities which would see reduced funding. Additionally, funding for programs under Other Fossil Energy R&D is proposed to decrease by nearly $87 million, a 35% reduction compared to FY2018. The budget request for FY2019 prioritizes the Advanced Energy Systems (AES) account with a request of $175 million, focusing on activities such as advanced combustion/gasification, turbines, fuel cells, sensors, power generation efficiency, and energy materials. Program Direction and National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) Coal R&D provide support to CCS-related activities directly and indirectly. The budget request proposes to decrease funding for Natural Gas Technologies and Unconventional Fossil activities compared to FY2018 levels. Funding for Transformational Coal Pilot programs is proposed to be eliminated. Several bills introduced in the 115th Congress would potentially affect CCS in the United States, including provisions addressing tax credits for CO2 capture and sequestration. H.R. 1892, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, amended Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code. Other bills like S. 843 and H.R. 2011 would also amend the Internal Revenue Code to allow qualified CO2 capture facilities to be eligible for certain benefits. Several bills introduced in the 115th Congress aim to support CO2 capture facilities capturing 65% or more of their emissions through tax-exempt private activity bonds. These bills seek to reduce costs, accelerate deployment, and help the US meet environmental, economic, and national security goals. The bills address federal efforts to enhance CCS across EPA, DOE, and the Department of Agriculture jurisdictions, with S. 2602 authorizing EPA activities to support direct air capture and utilization of CO2. The legislation introduced in the 115th Congress aims to expedite the permitting process for CCS infrastructure projects by adding them as eligible covered projects under the FAST Act. The bills also authorize DOE to further CCS research, development, and deployment activities, with a focus on CO2 utilization and achieving net-negative CO2 emissions through biomass and fossil fuel projects. Additionally, S. 2997 authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to pursue biomass-related CCS R&D projects and use loans for CO2 capture and utilization activities. H.R. 2296, H.R. 4096, and H.R. 5745 focus on DOE CCS-related activities, including evaluating projects for funding, establishing a $5 million prize for technology development, and authorizing RD&D activities for carbon capture, sequestration, utilization, and removal. H.R. 5745 also includes a $15 million prize competition for direct air capture technology and the creation of a task force to assess a national CO2 pipeline system. The Petra Nova plant in Texas and the Boundary Dam power plant in Canada are the only commercial large-scale fossil-fueled power plants with CCS, capturing over 1 million tons of CO2 annually. They offset costs by selling CO2 for enhanced oil recovery. The expanded tax credit provision under P.L. 115-123 is seen as a potential incentive for more CCS development. CCS proponents also advocate for other incentives like tax-exempt private activity bonds and eligibility of master limited partnerships for CCS infrastructure. Private activity bonds and master limited partnerships are being considered as financial incentives for CCS infrastructure projects. Private activity bonds would provide tax-exempt debt to lower capital costs, while master limited partnerships would combine tax benefits with capital-raising abilities to reduce equity costs and improve access to capital. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to authorize these incentives and support CCS advancement. Several bills authorize technology prizes for advances in CCS R&D, including for utilization technologies and direct air capture. Enactment of legislation in the 115th Congress could provide additional incentives for CCS, influencing future activities and reducing costs through financial incentives. The success of legislative approaches will be measured by how they reduce costs for CCS adoption. The success of legislative approaches for CCS adoption will be measured by how they reduce costs through financial incentives and technology development. Decreasing costs for CCS technologies is crucial for broader deployment and reducing CO2 emissions to mitigate climate change. The potential of carbon capture and utilization technologies in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from point sources, such as fossil fuel electricity generating plants, refineries, and cement plants, has gained attention. The U.S. fossil fuel electricity generation sector alone emitted 1.8 billion tons of CO2 in 2016, accounting for 34% of total U.S. CO2 emissions that year. Emerging technologies for utilizing CO2 for various products have energized CCS advocates, with the challenge being the size of the market for carbon utilization products to have a measurable impact on climate change. Direct air capture (DAC) has also sparked interest in CCS. Direct air capture (DAC) has energized CCS advocates by offering the promise of net-negative carbon removal if the CO2 removed is permanently stored. The challenge for DAC is reducing the cost per ton of CO2 removed."
