    "content": "The Act titled \"Defense Contracting Ethics Oversight Act of 2007\" requires ethics compliance by Department of Defense contractors. The \"Defense Contracting Ethics Oversight Act of 2007\" mandates that Department of Defense contractors must have an internal ethics compliance program in place for the award of covered contracts. This program includes a code of ethics and internal controls to detect and address improper conduct. The \"Defense Contracting Ethics Oversight Act of 2007\" requires contractors to have mechanisms in place for periodic performance reviews, internal reporting of improper conduct, audits, disciplinary actions, and reporting to Government officials. The Inspector General of the Department of Defense must report suspected improper conduct among contractor personnel, including corruption involving Government officials, within 30 days of discovery. Mechanisms are required for full cooperation with investigators, recurring training for personnel on ethics compliance, and oversight by personnel with substantial authority within the contractor. The deadline for a contractor to have an ethics compliance program in place for a covered contract is 30 days after the contract award. The Department's contracting officer may seek assistance from the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense to determine program existence. Contractors failing to report suspected improper conduct may face suspension or debarment under the regulations. The ethics compliance program for covered contracts can be suspended or debarred by the Secretary of Defense if the contractor fails to report suspected improper conduct.
