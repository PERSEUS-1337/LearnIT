However, recent years have seen a shift in this thinking, with educators questioning the benefits of larger schools. The National Association of Secondary School Principals now recommends a more student-centered and personalized approach for high schools in the 21st century. The National Association of Secondary School Principals recommends restructuring high schools to create a more intimate setting where students are not invisible and can't \"melt into their surroundings\". Research shows that larger schools tend to stratify students into different tracks based on their backgrounds, leading to inequitable educational outcomes. To address this, schools should limit enrollments to 600 students, create schools-within-a-school, and allow teachers to spend more time with smaller groups of students. Research shows that in smaller, more personalized schools, the achievement gap between high-achieving and low-achieving students is smaller. Students in smaller schools perform better in core subjects, are more engaged in their courses, have higher attendance rates, and show more equitable achievement distribution, especially for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Small schools show significant achievement gains, as highlighted in a study by the Bank Street College of Education. Benefits include higher attendance rates, GPAs, and graduation rates for academically disadvantaged students. Teachers and parents also report greater satisfaction with small schools, citing a more collaborative learning community and better student support. Research shows that smaller schools are more accessible, responsive, and safer for students. A study in Georgia, Montana, Ohio, and Texas found that smaller schools reduce the negative impact of poverty on student achievement. Additionally, smaller schools in poorer Texas communities had higher test scores compared to larger schools. Smaller schools are also shown to be safer, with students being less likely to join gangs. Statistics from the Bureau of Justice show that schools with 300 to 1,000 students have lower rates of violence compared to larger schools, regardless of location. Larger schools on the urban fringe experience up to 4 times more serious violence incidents per 1,000 students. Many states, including Florida, are implementing strategies to reduce school sizes for safety reasons. A school safety bill mandated new high schools to have a maximum of 900 students to reduce violence rates. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to establish a Smaller Learning Communities Grant Program for high schools with a maximum of 900 students to enhance safety and reduce violence rates. The definitions in this section clarify terms like \"school,\" \"school-within-a-school,\" and \"smaller learning community\" within the context of the Smaller Learning Communities Grant Program for high schools with a maximum of 900 students. The Secretary may make grants to local educational agencies to develop plans for creating a more personalized school experience using effective strategies like career academies, magnet schools, restructured schedules, and mentoring systems. The Secretary may make grants to local educational agencies to develop plans for smaller learning communities and implement them through grants. Applications for these grants must be submitted to the Secretary in a simple and brief form. The local educational agency applying for a grant must provide information on the need for smaller learning communities, the process for establishing them, steps to ensure their viability, and non-Federal resources available for each community. The application for a grant must include details on the strategies, curriculum, and instructional practices for creating smaller learning communities within a school district. The grant application must detail the involvement of teachers and school personnel, the process for involving students and stakeholders, collaboration with community entities, and training activities for teachers and others involved in the grant activities. The grant application must detail the goals, objectives, assessment methods, relationship with smaller learning communities, and administrative aspects of the activities for which the grant is sought. The grant application must detail the administrative and managerial relationship between the local educational agency and smaller learning communities, coordination of grant funds with other sources, student grade levels, and placement methods within each community. The grant funds can be used for studying the feasibility, organizational strategies, curriculum development, and instructional methods for smaller learning communities. The grant funds can be used for professional development in innovative teaching methods, strategies for community participation, and other reasonable expenses like architectural fees for school facilities. Implementation grants can be used for creating smaller learning communities, implementing effective curriculums, and involving parents and local institutions in these communities. Implementation grants can be used for creating smaller learning communities, implementing effective curriculums, involving parents, local institutions, and community members in professional development activities for teachers or linking students with their local community. Grants also cover expenses like architectural fees for school facility design or remodeling, ensuring equitable distribution among urban, suburban, and rural areas. The Secretary requires grant recipients to report on fund usage. Additional authority allows for technical assistance and networking activities. The Secretary can use up to 5% of funds for program evaluation and technical assistance. The Secretary is authorized to provide technical assistance and networking activities for smaller learning communities. A study will be conducted to evaluate outcomes in different types of communities. $200,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2002 with additional funding for the following years."
