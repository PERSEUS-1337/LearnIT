    "title": "SB 1087",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1560 of the Evidence Code is amended to define \"business\" and \"record\" for the purpose of this article. The Evidence Code defines \"record\" as any record maintained by a business. A subpoena duces tecum served on a business requires the custodian of records to deliver a copy of the records to the court within a specified time period. In criminal actions, the deadline is five days, and in civil actions, it is 15 days. In civil actions, the custodian or qualified witness must provide a copy of records within 15 days of receiving a subpoena. The records must be sealed in an inner envelope with case details and then placed in an outer envelope directed to the appropriate recipient based on the type of subpoena. The copy of records must remain sealed and can only be opened at the time of trial, deposition, or hearing, as directed by the judge or tribunal, in the presence of all parties. Original documents not used as evidence will be returned, while copies may be destroyed. (e) In a civil action, the subpoenaing party can direct the witness to make records available for inspection at the witness' business address during normal business hours with advance notice. The attorney's representative must deliver any requested records as directed in the subpoena, failure to comply is punishable by law. If a search warrant for business records is served in a criminal investigation where the business is not involved, the custodian must deliver a copy of the records to the law enforcement agency within five days. Failure to comply is punishable by law. The search warrant procedures outlined in Chapter 3 of the Penal Code are not affected by this subdivision. Section 1561 of the Evidence Code is amended to require records to be accompanied by an affidavit stating the custodian's authority, authenticity of the copy, preparation in the ordinary course of business, identity, and mode of preparation. Section 1563 of the Evidence Code is amended to require records to be accompanied by an affidavit stating the custodian's authority, authenticity of the copy, and preparation in the ordinary course of business. The affidavit should also include the identity of the records and a description of the mode of preparation. If the business does not have all the records, the custodian must state so in the affidavit and deliver the available records as specified in Section 1560. Additionally, if the records were copied at the custodian's place of business, an affidavit by the attorney or representative must confirm that the copy is true. Section 1563 of the Evidence Code is amended to limit fees for witnesses and require parties serving a subpoena duces tecum to cover reasonable costs incurred by non-party witnesses in producing business records. The amended Section 1563 of the Evidence Code limits fees for witnesses and requires parties serving a subpoena duces tecum to cover reasonable costs incurred by non-party witnesses in producing business records, including copying fees, clerical costs, postage charges, and retrieval costs for offsite records. The witness may demand payment of costs for producing subpoenaed records, and must provide an itemized statement of costs to the requesting party. If costs exceed authorized amounts or if the witness refuses to provide a statement, they must justify the costs upon demand. The witness can request payment for producing subpoenaed records and must provide a detailed cost statement. If costs are excessive, the requesting party can petition the court to recover or reduce the costs. The court has jurisdiction over the witness upon filing the petition and may order the witness to remit the excess costs if found excessive or charged in bad faith. The court may order the witness to pay the full costs demanded, including reasonable expenses and attorney's fees. If costs are found to be excessive, the requesting party may be ordered to pay the witness's expenses for defending the petition. If a subpoena for business records is withdrawn or quashed, the witness can request reimbursement for costs incurred. If payment is not received within 30 days, the witness can file a motion for payment, and the court may award expenses and attorney's fees. If records requested under a subpoena are inspected or copied at the witness' place of business, the fee shall not exceed $15 plus actual retrieval costs. The custodian of records or qualified witness is entitled to witness fees, mileage, and additional costs as required by law."
