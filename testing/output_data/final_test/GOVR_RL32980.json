    "content": "Enforcement of child support often leads to an adversarial relationship between custodial and noncustodial parents. The noncustodial parent may feel disadvantaged as the custodial parent is supported by the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) agency and welfare agencies. Low-income custodial parents have access to federal and state resources that the noncustodial parent lacks. Members of Congress recognize that the \"best interests of the child\" are served when both parents are involved. Some argue that low-income noncustodial parents face barriers to work and education, emphasizing the importance of both financial and emotional involvement in parenting. Public policies are being considered to support fathers in their role as nurturers and mentors, including funding for access and visitation programs and marriage promotion initiatives in welfare reauthorization legislation. The pending welfare reauthorization legislation includes incentives for states to increase child support payments to families, enforce child support orders, fund programs promoting marriage among low-income individuals, and assist noncustodial fathers in meeting their financial and emotional responsibilities to their children. Supporters believe this legislation will lead to more noncustodial parents paying child support, with strong enforcement measures in place. The new attitude towards noncustodial parents includes offering services to improve their financial ability to pay. However, some custodial parents are wary that this emphasis on fathers may undervalue single-parent families maintained by mothers. This may lead to challenges in child support, custody, and visitation arrangements. The situation is often more complex than just a deadbeat dad vs. dependent mom scenario. The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) provides legal assistance to noncustodial parents to help alleviate high child support orders. Supporters believe this can lead to more reliable child support payments for custodial parents. The LSC is a federally funded corporation established in 1974 to offer legal aid to those who cannot afford representation. The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) provides legal assistance through grants to local programs for low-income clients. In FY2004, $316.6 million of its $335.3 million appropriation was distributed to 143 programs, with the remaining funds allocated for management and administration. The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) provides funding for civil legal services for the poor in the United States. Despite 45 million potentially eligible individuals in 2004, only 20% received services. Noncustodial parents owing child support may struggle to access LSC-funded services. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, enacted in 1975, aims to promote self-sufficiency for families with a parent living outside the home. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program ensures noncustodial parents meet their financial responsibilities to their children through various services. All states and territories operate CSE programs with federal matching funds. States administer the program, while the federal government sets standards and provides assistance. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program aims to secure financial support for children, often leading to adversarial relationships between state agencies, custodial parents, and noncustodial parents. Issues such as establishing paternity and child support orders can arise, with noncustodial parents sometimes facing challenges like false allegations of fatherhood and disputes over payment amounts. Noncustodial fathers and alleged fathers face various challenges in the child support system, including false paternity allegations, unfair support obligations, financial difficulties with arrearages, incarceration due to support demands, loss of licenses, strained relationships with children, and disconnection from their families and communities post-release. They argue that the paternity establishment process prioritizes efficiency over their rights to due process and representation, leading to uninformed decisions about acknowledging paternity. Noncustodial fathers may not fully understand the consequences of voluntarily acknowledging paternity. Some feel deceived into believing their child support payments would directly benefit their child, but instead, the money may go towards repaying the state for welfare payments. Advocates stress the importance of considering the due-process rights of noncustodial parents, even if it may not seem to be in the child's best interest. Advocates for noncustodial parents argue that paternity questions should be resolved through blood or DNA tests, even if the parents were married. However, many view these tests as a breach of trust. This can lead to animosity between parents, affecting cooperative parenting. Federal law mandates states to have procedures for paternity testing. Most states have a rebuttable presumption of paternity based on genetic testing results, with thresholds ranging from 95%-99.9%. This can lead to potential errors in assigning paternity and imposing financial obligations on the wrong individuals. Noncustodial parents who fail to appear in court for child support or paternity establishment proceedings may have a child support order entered against them. For more information on child support and paternity establishment issues, refer to CRS Report RL31467(pdf), Paternity Establishment: Child Support and Beyond. If the noncustodial parent does not appear in court, a child support order can be entered by default. This may result in the establishment of paternity and a child support order, even if the parent does not have a job or income. The court may base the child support order on information provided by the custodial parent or CSE agency if the noncustodial parent does not provide information about their job/income. Additionally, if the noncustodial parent does not present evidence, the court or CSE agency may impute their income based on incorrect assumptions. Some argue that default judgments in paternity cases have negatively impacted putative fathers who did not show up in court to deny allegations. Analysts suggest balancing the rights of putative fathers to proper notice with the child's right to timely support. Child support arrearages can accumulate through nonpayment according to state guidelines. Child support arrearages can accumulate through nonpayment, leading to unpaid support being added to the amount owed by the noncustodial parent. This can happen due to orders remaining payable even when the parent is unemployed or incarcerated, retroactive support being established, and arrearages remaining due even after the child reaches adulthood. Child support arrearages can accumulate for various reasons, including unpaid support, fees, and interest charges. Arrearages are enforced through income tax intercepts and property attachment to ensure parents meet their obligations. In FY2004, $130.3 billion in child support obligations was owed, but only $23.2 billion was paid, indicating a collection rate of 18%. The CSE program collected 18% of child support obligations in FY2004. Current collections were at 59%, while arrearage payments were less than 7%. $102.4 billion in arrearages was reported, but only $6.7 billion was collected. 60% of obligors continued to make payments on arrearages. In 1999, 53% of cases had arrearages, increasing to 68% in 2003. Despite child support professionals working hard to collect arrearages, the average amount collected per case is only $600 out of an average $9,000 arrearage. High arrearages often discourage noncustodial parents from paying child support, leading to a growing overall debt. This issue is exacerbated when parents perceive the system as unfair or the debt as insurmountable, decreasing the likelihood of payment. Many noncustodial parents mistakenly believe that their child support payments can be reduced if they fall behind due to financial difficulties. However, courts cannot retroactively reduce back payments owed. States have flexibility in modifying and reviewing child support orders, with parents able to request a review every three years. States are not required to regularly review orders. Advocates recommend changing child support modification laws to consider periods of incarceration, unemployment, or illness that affect the noncustodial parent's ability to pay. Denial of visitation rights should not stop child support payments, although historically visitation and child support have been treated as separate issues by Congress. Noncustodial parents argue that using federal funds to enforce visitation rights is unfair. Many noncustodial parents argue for reform in federal laws to enforce visitation and custody rights, not just child support obligations. They believe courts have favored mothers in custody decisions, neglecting fathers' visitation rights. Advocates stress the importance of preserving the connection between noncustodial parents and their children beyond financial support. The federal government should assist dead broke noncustodial parents in meeting financial and emotional obligations to their children and enforce child support laws against deadbeat parents. All states have laws to charge noncustodial parents who fail to pay child support, with criminal nonsupport being a long-standing offense. There are differing views on the use of criminal nonsupport laws, with some advocating for it as a last resort and others emphasizing the seriousness of nonpayment of child support. Nonpayment of child support is a serious offense with dire consequences for the custodial parent and child. Criminal nonsupport laws should be used when appropriate, leading to civil contempt charges for noncompliance. Jail time for civil contempt is a significant issue for low-income noncustodial parents, especially those in easily replaceable jobs. The consequences of jail time for noncustodial parents due to nonpayment of child support can be devastating, with long-lasting effects from a criminal record. Federal laws have been enacted to address this issue, including the Child Support Recovery Act of 1992 and the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998. These laws establish federal criminal offenses for noncustodial parents who repeatedly fail to financially support their children. According to a study by CLASP and Community Legal Services, about 1.5 million children have incarcerated parents, with over 10 million having been affected by parental imprisonment. Each year, around 400,000 parents return home from prison, often owing significant amounts in child support arrears. Inmates with open child support cases owe an average of $225 to $313 per month, accumulating arrearages of over $23,000 on average upon release, with more than half owed to the state for welfare costs. Ex-offenders face numerous challenges upon re-entering communities, including employment barriers due to criminal records, denial of housing and federal benefits, and high child support arrearages. These obstacles can push ex-offenders towards the underground economy, hindering their ability to reconnect with their families and communities. Ex-offenders may face challenges such as high child support arrearages, dissolution of parental rights due to criminal convictions, and deportation for immigrant parents with U.S. citizen children. President Bush announced a plan to help released prisoners transition back to society. President Bush announced a plan to help recently released prisoners transition back to society by providing transitional housing, job training, and mentoring. Although the proposal has not been authorized, there is a federal program that offers mentoring services for children of prisoners. Low-income noncustodial parents who owe child support may find assistance through legal services provided by the Legal Services Corporation (LSC). The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) provides legal assistance to low-income individuals, focusing on civil cases and not handling criminal or fee-generating cases. New limitations in 1996 restricted LSC-funded programs from engaging in certain activities, such as class actions and lobbying. The legal services delivery system is based on local priorities, national accountability, competition for grants, and a public-private partnership. Local programs are independent entities governed by Boards of Directors from the local bar and client community. The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) provides funding for civil legal services for the poor through grants to local programs. In FY2004, $316.6 million was distributed to 143 local programs, with the remaining funds allocated for management and administration. Approximately 45 million people were potentially eligible for LSC-funded services, but only about 20% had access to them. The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) reports that only 20% of eligible individuals have access to LSC-funded services due to funding limitations. Despite congressional support, the unmet legal needs of America's poor are significant. Current federal funding is insufficient to serve the legal needs of over 45 million eligible individuals. Many are unable to pursue justice, while others above the poverty threshold still cannot afford legal representation. During 2004, Legal Services Corporation (LSC) grantees closed 901,067 cases, with family issues accounting for 40% of cases, housing issues for 25%, income maintenance issues for 15%, and consumer finance for the remaining cases. Legal Services Corporation (LSC) grantees handle a variety of cases, with family issues accounting for 40%, housing for 25%, income maintenance for 15%, and consumer finance for the remaining cases. Legal services providers primarily resolve cases through advice and referral, with only 14% resolved in court, mainly for family law issues. LSC funds local legal services providers, known as \"grantees,\" which can include non-profit organizations, private attorneys, and government agencies. Local legal services programs are run by boards of directors, with a majority of lawyers and eligible clients. They must allocate a portion of their grant to involve private attorneys in providing legal services to low-income clients. These programs set their own eligibility criteria and offer legal assistance based on local priorities. Noncustodial parents are encouraged to advocate for themselves and raise awareness about their challenges in their communities. Low-income noncustodial parents face challenges in obtaining legal assistance for issues such as paternity establishment and child support. Only 20% of eligible recipients receive legal services when needed, leading to competition for limited resources. Legal assistance is crucial for resolving complex matters that involve significant income redistribution. Legal services are essential for low-income noncustodial parents dealing with complex legal matters like paternity establishment and child support. These services are crucial for individuals from diverse backgrounds, including families on public assistance, veterans, and victims of domestic violence or natural disasters. LSC-funded programs aim to provide legal information to help individuals understand their rights and responsibilities under the law, ultimately assisting families in maintaining their incomes, homes, and ties to their children. Legal services providers can assist noncustodial parents by providing information on fatherhood responsibilities, counseling on contesting paternity, warning about consequences of default judgments, advising on court appearances, and representing in child support cases. They aim to help individuals understand their rights and responsibilities under the law to maintain their incomes, homes, health benefits, and ties to their children and communities. Legal services providers can assist noncustodial parents by countering unreasonably high child support orders, advocating for modifications due to changed financial circumstances, representing clients in hearings, reinstating licenses, advising on custody and visitation rights, petitioning for custody/visitation, providing resources for emotional and financial responsibilities, expunging arrest/conviction records. The LSC has invested $3 million in the past few years. The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) has invested $3 million in recent years to create comprehensive legal services websites for all states. These websites offer self-help materials, referrals to legal and social services, and other useful links for self-represented litigants. Legal services programs are also working on improving client outreach and community legal education to help noncustodial parents with child support issues. This assistance is crucial for both mothers and fathers dealing with divorce, paternity, child custody, visitation, eviction, and other legal matters."
