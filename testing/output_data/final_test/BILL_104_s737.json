    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Power Act Amendments of 1996\" provides a limited exemption to hydroelectric licensing provisions for transmission facilities associated with the El Vado Hydroelectric Project. The Federal Power Act exempts the transmission line facilities of the El Vado Hydroelectric Project in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico from FERC jurisdiction. The facilities covered are a 12-mile long 69 kV power line near the Rio Chama, connecting the El Vado Project's switchyard to the Spills 69 kV Switching Station. The Federal Power Act is amended to include specific criteria for project works in Alaska with a power production capacity of 5,000 kilowatts or less, located within the state boundaries and not on certain designated areas. The State of Alaska has exclusive authority to authorize project works on designated Wild and Scenic Rivers System segments, instead of licensing by the Commission, upon meeting certain regulatory criteria. The licensee of a project licensed by the Commission may choose to make the project subject to State authorization. State authorizations for projects on Federal lands must be approved by the Secretary and comply with prescribed terms and conditions. Federal environment, natural, or cultural resources protection laws still apply despite State authorizations. SEC. 4. FERC amends Section 4(e) of the Federal Power Act regarding licensing of hydroelectric projects in Hawaii. SEC. 5. Deadline extension for construction of certain hydroelectric projects in Illinois. Project Number 3943 allows for extensions of construction time for up to 3 consecutive 2-year periods upon request of the licensee, subject to certain requirements and procedures set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Project Number 3944 allows for extensions of construction time for up to 3 consecutive 2-year periods upon request of the licensee, subject to certain requirements and procedures set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The subsection requires compliance with the Federal Power Act's good faith, due diligence, and public interest requirements, as well as the Commission's procedures. It will be effective for project number 3944 after the Commission's extension period for construction expires. SEC. 6. Refurbishment and continued operation of a hydroelectric facility in Montana. A political subdivision of Montana accepting a license for a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission project in Granite County and Deer Lodge County is exempt from paying charges for land use for 5 years. After the initial 5-year period, charges will apply as per the Federal Power Act. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or any other Federal agency may assess charges for land use, occupancy, and enjoyment of the licensed land, not exceeding $20,000 per year. Passed the Senate September 27, 1996."
