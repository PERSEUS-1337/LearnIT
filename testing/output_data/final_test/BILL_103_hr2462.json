    "content": "AMENDMENTS TO COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION, AND LIABILITY ACT OF 1980. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 is amended to redefine the term 'owner or operator' to exclude individuals who hold ownership rights solely for security interests in a vessel or facility without participating in its management. This includes any legal or equitable interest acquired to secure payment of a loan or indebtedness. The term 'indicia of ownership' includes evidence of interests in mortgages, deeds of trust, liens, surety bonds, guaranties, or lease financing transactions where the lessor does not control daily operation or maintenance of the property. The term 'holder of a security interest' refers to a person who holds indicia of ownership in property primarily to protect a security interest, including initial and subsequent holders such as loan originators or successors-in-interest. Holding title in property is not required to hold indicia of ownership. The term 'security interest' refers to an interest in property created to secure a loan, guaranty, or lease financing transaction. It includes holders of indicia of ownership to protect a security interest, receivers, and persons acting on behalf of a security interest holder. Security interests can arise from various transactions like sales and leasebacks, conditional sales, and factoring agreements, creating an interest in property to secure a loan or other obligations. The term 'participating in the management of property' refers to actual involvement in property management, excluding mere influence or control rights. It includes decision-making control over environmental compliance when the borrower is still in possession of the property. The term 'participating in the management of property' refers to actual involvement in property management, excluding mere influence or control rights. It includes decision-making control over environmental compliance when the borrower is still in possession of the property. The holder exercises control comparable to a manager of the borrower's enterprise, assuming responsibility for overall management encompassing day-to-day decision-making regarding environmental compliance and operational aspects. The term 'primarily to protect a security interest' includes ownership rights acquired through exercising holder rights in property management functions such as facility manager, operations manager, chief executive officer, credit manager, or chief financial officer. The holder of a security interest can take necessary actions to protect the security interest, comply with laws, preserve property value, recover loans, or address obligations secured by the interest. This includes acquiring full title or possession of the property upon default or foreclosure. Upon expiration, cancellation, or termination of a finance lease, the holder shall retain ownership rights to protect a security interest while actively trying to sell or re-lease the property. The term 'property' includes real and personal property, facilities, equipment, vehicles, and transportation modes. The term 'guarantor' encompasses guarantors, sureties, and issuers of obligations. Entities such as issuers of letters of credit, title insurers, and guarantors directly or indirectly acquire ownership rights to protect security interests. The term 'guaranty' includes various forms of guarantees, surety bonds, title insurance policies, and agreements with guarantors. The curr_chunk discusses the ownership title or right held by a fiduciary for the benefit of a security interest holder. It also mentions actions taken by a security interest holder to foreclose, sell, or protect property. The curr_chunk clarifies that actions taken by a debtor, obligor, or lessee to wind down operations, abandon property, or conduct environmental response actions do not constitute \"participating in the management of property.\" An environmental inspection by a security interest holder is considered evidence of preserving and protecting the property. The curr_chunk states that a holder of a security interest is not required to conduct environmental inspections to qualify for an exemption. However, if their actions directly cause or worsen a hazardous waste release, they may be liable for response action costs. The curr_chunk defines a fiduciary as an entity acting in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of another entity, as per the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. A fiduciary who assumes ownership or control of property without prior involvement in its management will not be considered an 'owner' or 'operator' under this Act. If the fiduciary causes a release of a hazardous substance, they may be liable for the cost of response action only if the release is directly linked to their activities. A fiduciary is not liable for response action costs for a release that started before they acquired ownership of the property. Claims can still be made against the fiduciary's assets or actions can be taken against them in their representative capacity. SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL ACT. The Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to exclude certain entities from definitions related to waste management. Amendments align definitions with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. The Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to align definitions with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. Section 1004(41) provisions apply in States with authorized programs. The provisions of this Act apply to indicia of ownership acquired before the enactment date for security interest protection and to fiduciaries for property acquired before the enactment date."
