    "content": "In the current debate on FY2016 defense spending, Congress is considering staying within Budget Control Act (BCA) caps. If appropriations exceed these limits, a sequester is required to achieve savings. OCO funding is exempt from BCA caps if designated by Congress and the President. The OCO designation requires consensus between Congress and the President on fund status. Concerns have been raised about FY2016 BCA defense spending caps being insufficient to meet defense needs. Compliance with current BCA caps is debated as achievable through various savings. Defense spending plans have largely adjusted to the amended BCA limits for FY2012-FY2021, meeting over three-quarters of the required reductions. An additional 5%, or $182 billion, in savings is needed for the FY2016-FY2021 period. The President's FY2016 national defense request exceeds the BCA cap by $38 billion, requiring a 6.8% cut to meet the cap. Congress would need to cut the base defense budget request by 6.8% in FY2016 to meet the BCA cap. Defense spending would be frozen at the FY2013 level for four years and then frozen in real terms for the next five years. Various bills propose transferring funds from the base budget to OCO-designated accounts. The OCO-designated accounts in Title IX transfer $37.5 billion from the base request, seen as a budget gimmick to increase base budget spending within BCA caps. OMB Director Shaun Donovan recommends vetoing bills due to OCO redesignation and other reasons, potentially leading to veto prospects for all appropriations bills. The Senate faced challenges in bringing up its DOD appropriations bill earlier in July. The Senate is discussing the need for a budget deal to raise BCA caps with offsetting reductions. If a deal is not reached, there is a possibility of a government shutdown in October. OMB Director Shaun Donovan has indicated that the President may veto the NDAA or DOD appropriations bills if certain provisions are included. The President believes defense and non-defense caps should be raised and objects to a budget gimmick that would raise defense spending without raising non-defense spending above BCA caps. Failure to designate transferred funds as OCO could breach BCA spending levels and trigger a sequester. If a defense appropriations bill is not enacted before October 1, 2015, defense spending could be wrapped into a consolidated or a CR appropriations act. Funding levels could be set at last year's levels to avoid sequestration, or exceed BCA caps and trigger a sequester. If defense spending levels exceed BCA caps and non-defense funding remains at BCA caps level, the President may not sign the CR. Government shutdown could occur due to disagreement on spending levels or raising BCA caps. Congress could adopt a hybrid approach with some savings in defense spending bills and accept a 1% to 2% sequester for additional savings. Congress often includes provisions for across-the-board cuts to meet budget limits. DOD requests have been cut by 3% to 5% roughly 40% of the time between FY1950 and FY2012. DOD officials argue that designating base budget funds as OCO and transferring them could complicate defense budgeting, leading to uncertainty in funding levels for future years. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter emphasized the need for stable, multiyear budgeting to support long-term modernization and readiness goals for the military and defense industry partners. Secretary Carter emphasized the importance of long-term military strategy in defense budgeting, highlighting the need for efficient and cutting-edge plans. He criticized the narrow focus on defense funding over non-defense, stressing the interconnectedness of national security with other departments like State, Justice, Treasury, and Homeland Security. Senator McCain supported increased defense funding, prioritizing it over other considerations. The Committee prioritized providing more funds for defense over transferring base budget funds to OCO, citing the urgent need for $38 billion in military funding. Some policymakers and Members of Congress have called for raising BCA caps for defense and non-defense, similar to the Ryan-Murray compromise in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Fiscal hawks have opposed raising the caps. Fiscal hawks oppose raising caps to preserve budget savings enacted by the Budget Control Act, while defense hawks advocate for increased defense spending in a dangerous world. A Senate amendment to delay spending $38 billion in base budget funds until caps are raised failed. Senator Bernie Sanders proposed offsetting all OCO funds with new revenue to cover costs of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The debate over transferring defense base budget funds to OCO-designated funds raises concerns about undermining BCA caps. Finding offsets for increased defense spending could be challenging, leading to potential government shutdown if funding levels are not agreed upon. The debate over transferring defense base budget funds to OCO-designated accounts raises concerns about undermining BCA caps. Some argue that maintaining current BCA caps would be inadequate for defense spending, while others believe defense spending levels are historically high. The Joint Chiefs of Staff warned that maintaining current BCA defense caps could jeopardize DOD's ability to carry out the national military strategy. DOD's proposal to meet sequester caps for FY2015-FY2019 focused on cuts to weapon system modernization. The Administration is concerned about Congress's reluctance to adopt proposals for lower pay levels, changes in military health care benefits, base closures, and retiring military systems like the A-10 aircraft. Various approaches have been suggested to meet BCA limits, including reducing force structure and finding efficiencies in administrative activities. The debate over defense spending levels and how to achieve them is ongoing. The proposed transfer of base funds to OCO could temporarily avoid decisions on consensus levels for the next several years of the BCA decade. Definitions of war funding have shifted over the past 14 years, with different definitions adopted by Congress and the Administration at various points in time. DOD excludes funds not directly related to war expenses in its tracking of war obligations. The proposed increase in DOD's war request from $50.1 billion to $88.9 billion includes funding for various expenses such as army reorganization, childcare centers, barracks improvements, and equipment for national guard and reserve forces. Congress has also transferred funds from Operation and Maintenance activities to OCO-designated accounts. Troop levels in Iraq and Afghanistan are expected to decrease, with the House-passed FY2016 NDAA exempting base budget funds transferred to OCO titles. The NDAA exempts base budget funds transferred to OCO titles from war funding criteria. OCO funds cover war-related expenses like imminent danger pay and base setup. Routine maintenance may be funded with OCO funds during war to relieve pressure on DOD's base budget. The definition of war and non-war expenses has evolved over the past 14 years, with DOD broadening its definition in 2006 to include modernization and upgrades to equipment. The Obama Administration later narrowed war-related criteria to focus on replacing war losses. The distinction between war and non-war expenses helps identify costs related to military operations versus long-term requirements. Congress has granted DOD flexibility for uncertain war-related programs. Some argue costs for war-related programs could be better predicted after 14 years of war. DOD is grappling with which expenses initiated during wartime would persist after war operations cease. Continued transfers of base budget activities to OCO-designated titles could reduce the need for a review. DOD has achieved significant savings since FY2012 plan through reviews to comply with BCA defense caps. Since FY2012, DOD has achieved a trillion dollars in savings through reviews to comply with BCA defense caps. Congress relying on transfers of base budget funds to OCO may make meeting the remaining BCA caps less likely."
