    "title": "AB 2571",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 11515 of the Vehicle Code in California is amended to require insurance companies to forward ownership documents, license plates, and a fee to the department within 10 days of settling a total loss salvage vehicle. An occupational licensee may submit a certificate of license plate destruction instead of the actual plate. If an insurance company, licensee, or salvage pool cannot obtain the properly endorsed certificate of ownership within 30 days of settling a total loss, they can request a salvage certificate from the department by providing documentation of their attempts to obtain the certificate and submitting license plates and a fee. Upon receipt of the necessary documents and fee, the department will issue a salvage certificate for the vehicle. The insurance company must notify the department if the owner of a total loss salvage vehicle retains possession of the vehicle. The owner has 10 days from the settlement of the loss to submit the certificate of ownership, license plates, and a $15 fee to the department, which will then issue a salvage certificate for the vehicle. Before the sale or disposal of a total loss salvage vehicle, the owner, owner\u2019s agent, or salvage pool must obtain a properly endorsed salvage certificate and submit it to the department within 10 days of the loss, along with the certificate of ownership, license plates, and a $15 fee. The department must provide the salvage vehicle purchaser with the certificate within 10 days of full payment. The endorsed salvage certificate can be used in place of the certificate of ownership when accompanied by the necessary application and fees. Violations of certain sections are considered misdemeanors or infractions, depending on the circumstances. A salvage certificate must include a disclosure statement for total loss vehicles, and failure to disclose may result in a civil penalty of up to $500. This does not affect other civil remedies, including punitive damages."
