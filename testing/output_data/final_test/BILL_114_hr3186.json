    "content": "The \"Baseline Reform Act of 2015\" may be cited as the official title. Section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to address the baseline. The Baseline Reform Act of 2015 amends Section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to define the baseline as projections of budget authority, outlays, receipts, surplus or deficit for the current year and the following nine years based on current laws. Baselines are prepared annually, and estimates for direct spending in the baseline are calculated based on existing laws. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 stipulates that programs with estimated outlays over $50,000,000 will expire in the budget year or outyears. New programs with similar outlays will be scored by the Committees on the Budget or OMB. When a provision of law is suspended and authorizes a program with outlays over $50,000,000, it will be assumed to continue operating upon expiration of the suspension. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 states that programs with estimated outlays exceeding $50,000,000 will expire in the budget year or outyears. When a law expires, programs with outlays over $50,000,000 will continue to operate as before. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 requires that the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund's receipts and disbursements be included in all calculations. Discretionary spending for the budget year and subsequent years will be based on estimated appropriations and current-year appropriations. The current-year appropriations for budget accounts are calculated based on the assumption that continuing appropriations cover the entire fiscal year. Transfers of budget authority among accounts are reflected in the current-year level. Up-to-date concepts and definitions are used in calculating the baseline for the budget year and outyears. Amounts from asset sales are included in the calculations. CBO shall submit the Long-Term Budget Outlook annually to the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate."
