    "content": "Congress has included exemptions in federal environmental laws to ensure military training is not restricted for national security. Exemptions allow suspending compliance requirements at federal facilities on a case-by-case basis, mostly granted by the President for activities in the \"paramount interest of the United States.\" No criteria are provided for determining if an activity meets these thresholds. The President or other authorized decision-maker has discretion to determine if an activity meets thresholds for exemptions in federal environmental laws for military training. The Department of Defense argues for broader exemptions to ensure military readiness, citing onerous case-by-case approvals and incompatible time limits on exemptions. In FY2003, DOD requested exemptions from six environmental laws to prevent restrictions on training activities. The Department of Defense has requested broader exemptions from six environmental laws to ensure military readiness, which has sparked controversy in Congress. Some argue that exemptions are necessary for combat training flexibility, while others believe it could weaken environmental protection without a clear national security need. The 107th and 108th Congress enacted exemptions from specific environmental laws in response to DOD's requests. The Department of Defense has requested exemptions from several environmental laws to ensure military readiness, sparking controversy in Congress. Opposition has been particularly strong against exemptions from the Clean Air Act, Solid Waste Disposal Act, and CERCLA due to concerns about human health risks. Despite requests in defense authorization proposals from FY2003 to FY2008, Congress has not enacted these exemptions. The Administration's FY2009 defense authorization bill does not include these exemptions. A stand-alone bill in the 110th Congress, the Military Environmental Responsibility Act (H.R. 3366), aims to clarify military compliance with environmental requirements. It specifies requirements for DOD and defense-related agencies, including limitations on exemptions. The impact of environmental requirements on military readiness, recent exemptions enacted by Congress, and Administration proposals for additional exemptions are discussed. Assessing the need for broader exemptions has been challenging. Assessing the military need for broader exemptions due to environmental requirements has been challenging. The House Armed Services Committee directed the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study the impact of environmental requirements on military readiness. GAO found that some training activities were affected, but overall military readiness was not significantly hampered. Similar findings were reported in prior work on this issue in 2002 and 2003. The GAO's March 2008 report found no adverse effects on the environment from recent exemptions, but the impact of exemptions from the Marine Mammal Protection Act was still unknown. The DOD had not provided a strong case for additional exemptions from the Clean Air Act, Solid Waste Disposal Act, and CERCLA. The 107th and 108th Congress enacted exemptions for military readiness activities from certain environmental statutes. The 108th Congress enacted exemptions for military readiness activities from environmental statutes, including the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act. There was debate over the necessity of these exemptions due to lack of data on their impact on readiness and species. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2003 directed the Secretary of the Interior to develop regulations for incidental takings of migratory birds during military activities. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act regulations were finalized on February 28, 2007, allowing incidental takings of migratory birds during military activities if conservation measures are implemented to minimize adverse effects. The Secretary of the Interior can suspend or withdraw takings authorization if conditions are not met. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2004 authorized the Secretary of the Interior to exempt military lands from critical habitat designation under the Endangered Species Act if an Integrated Natural Resource Management Plan provides a benefit to the species. The Act also directed the Secretary to consider national security impacts when designating critical habitat, leading to the exclusion of military lands from critical habitat by the Fish and Wildlife Service. The Fish and Wildlife Service excludes military lands from critical habitat designations due to INRMP protection or national security concerns. DOD is still subject to Endangered Species Act protections, with exemptions under the Marine Mammal Protection Act for \"national defense.\" Amendments require greater scientific evidence for harm to marine mammals during military activities. The amendments to allow the use of Navy's sonar were challenged by environmental advocates for harming marine mammals. The Secretary of Defense invoked exemptions to the Marine Mammal Protection Act for mid-frequency active sonar in training exercises. The Navy cited the need for critical training and environmental compliance planning. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concern about the Navy's exemption from the Marine Mammal Protection Act for its training exercises. President Bush exempted the Navy's training exercises from the Coastal Zone Management Act in January 2008. Environmental organizations have challenged the Navy's use of mid-frequency active sonar based on potential violations of other federal statutes. President Bush exempted the Navy's training exercises from the Coastal Zone Management Act in January 2008, citing the \"paramount interest of the United States.\" The Council on Environmental Quality used emergency regulatory authorities to find alternative arrangements for the Navy's exercises. Legal challenges are ongoing to determine conditions for the Navy's training while protecting marine mammals. Congress has granted exemptions from some environmental acts but has not acted on exemptions requested by the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense (DOD) requested exemptions from environmental acts such as CERCLA and the Clean Air Act in past Administration defense authorization proposals. However, the FY2009 defense authorization bill does not include these exemptions. DOD proposed to amend the definition of \"solid waste\" and \"release\" in CERCLA to exclude military munitions on operational ranges, which raised concerns about potential health risks from contamination. The exemption would not apply to ranges on closed bases after land transfer. DOD proposed clarifying regulations regarding the disposal of \"used or fired\" munitions on ranges to avoid legal challenges and maintain training practicality. Concerns were raised about potential broader implications of the proposed amendments. The proposed amendments could have broader implications, exceeding the scope of regulations and potentially removing state authority to monitor military ranges for contamination. The amendments could also circumvent the authority to compel cleanup and exempt military readiness activities from air quality requirements for three years. The DOD proposed exemption for military operations in areas with poor air quality to conform to emissions limits was questioned by some Members of Congress, states, and environmental organizations. Past proposals included provisions that would alter Clean Air Act requirements for \"nonattainment\" areas, potentially limiting states' ability to impose more stringent pollution control requirements in these areas affected by military readiness activities. Some questioned if provisions exempting military operations from emissions limits would weaken public health protections under federal air quality standards."
