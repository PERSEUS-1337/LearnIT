    "content": "Recently, DenseNet, a popular CNN model known for its feature-reuse effectiveness, faces overfitting issues. Existing dropout methods are not as effective due to nonlinear connections, hindering feature-reuse and weakening dropout effects. To tackle these challenges, a specialized dropout method focusing on location, granularity, and probability is proposed. This approach could potentially enhance the accuracy of other CNN models with similar nonlinear connections. Experimental results demonstrate that DenseNets with this specialized dropout method outperform vanilla DenseNet in terms of accuracy. DenseNets with a specialized dropout method show improved accuracy compared to vanilla DenseNet and other CNN models, especially with increased model depth. The importance of network depth for accuracy in computer vision tasks has been recognized, with ResNet addressing the vanishing gradient problem through skip-connections. DenseNet introduced identity skip-connections to improve information flow, replacing simple summation with concatenation. However, overfitting remains an issue, especially in deeper networks. Standard dropout is ineffective on DenseNet due to weakened feature-reuse and poor interaction with convolutional layers. In response to the ineffectiveness of standard dropout on DenseNet due to weakened feature-reuse, a specialized dropout method is designed to address this issue. The paper focuses on three aspects of dropout design: placement in the network, granularity, and assigning appropriate probabilities. The proposed method includes a new structure called pre-dropout, highlights the effectiveness of channel-wise dropout, and extends the dropout redesign concept to other CNN models like ResNet. The paper introduces a specialized dropout method for DenseNet to improve feature-reuse. It includes three distinct probability schedules and outperforms other models in accuracy. The method is based on DenseNet principles and offers insights for future practitioners. The DenseNet features dense blocks with special structure, where each block consists of convolutional layers outputting k feature maps. The key property is dense connectivity, where input to each layer is the concatenation of all feature maps from preceding layers within the same block, allowing for reuse of previous output features at later layers. DenseNet features dense blocks with dense connectivity, allowing for reuse of previous output features at later layers. DenseNet-BC reduces parameters by adding a 1x1 layer before each 3x3 layer. Stochastic depth extends dropout to layer level. Other alternatives include DropConnect. In a study of dropout methods, various approaches like DropConnect and Swapout have been explored, focusing on dropout granularity. This study delves into dropout design across location, granularity, and probability, aiming to improve accuracy while considering feature-reuse in DenseNet. Standard dropout methods may hinder feature-reuse in DenseNet, as dropped features from previous layers are not available to later layers. The study explores dropout methods in DenseNet, highlighting limitations of standard dropout on feature-reuse and spatial correlation. A pre-dropout structure is proposed to address these issues and enhance model generalization. The structure aims to prevent feature-reuse obstruction by retaining dropped features from previous layers for later use in DenseNet. The study introduces pre-dropout in DenseNet to enhance feature-reuse and model generalization. Pre-dropout places dropout layers before composite functions, allowing complete outputs from previous layers to be transferred directly to later layers. This stimulates more feature-reuse patterns in the network compared to standard dropout. The study introduces pre-dropout in DenseNet to enhance feature-reuse and model generalization. Pre-dropout places dropout layers before composite functions, allowing complete outputs from previous layers to be transferred directly to later layers, promoting better feature-reuse compared to standard dropout. Pre-dropout in DenseNet enhances feature-reuse by multiplying X pre 1 with different tensors before passing it to the next layer, promoting more feature-reuse patterns in the network compared to standard dropout. This method allows for the reuse of specific features even if they are zeroed out in earlier layers, leading to better model generalization. When designing a specialized dropout method for CNN models with shortcut connections like ResNet and Wide-ResNet, dropout granularity is an important aspect to consider. Standard dropout is unit-wise, useful for fully connected layers to improve generalization by breaking strong neuron dependencies. However, for convolutional layers, the spatial correlation hampers its effectiveness. Different granularities like unit-wise, channel-wise, and layer-wise can be explored for dropout methods. When designing dropout methods for CNN models with shortcut connections like ResNet and Wide-ResNet, different granularities such as unit-wise, channel-wise, and layer-wise can be explored. While layer-wise dropout may discard too many useful features, channel-wise dropout strikes a nice balance by dropping entire feature maps at a given probability. Channel-wise dropout has been found to work best for regularizing DenseNet, and it can be applied to other CNN models as well. However, there is room for improvement in applying channel-wise dropout to DenseNet, as it currently cannot add varying degrees of noise to different layers.

Channel-wise dropout has been found to work best for regularizing DenseNet, but there is room for improvement as it currently cannot add varying degrees of noise to different layers. To promote model generalization ability, a stochastic probability method is applied to introduce various degrees of noise to different layers.

Channel-wise dropout has been found to work best for regularizing DenseNet. To improve model generalization, a stochastic probability method is used to add varying degrees of noise to different layers in DenseNet. Experiment results show that the stochastic method achieves better accuracy. The challenge lies in assigning probabilities to different convolutional layers for optimal accuracy. Various probability schedules are designed based on observations and experiments, with the best one chosen for implementation. In designing dropout methods for CNN models with shortcut connections like ResNet and Wide-ResNet, different granularities such as unit-wise, channel-wise, and layer-wise can be explored. Channel-wise dropout has been found to work best for regularizing DenseNet. A linearly decaying probability schedule, referred to as v1, is proposed for DenseNet, where the starting survival probability at the first convolutional layer is 1.0 and the last one is 0.5. The schedule ensures that the dropout probability decreases monotonically with each layer. In designing dropout methods for CNN models with shortcut connections like ResNet and Wide-ResNet, different granularities such as unit-wise, channel-wise, and layer-wise can be explored. A linearly decaying probability schedule, referred to as v1, is proposed for DenseNet, where the starting survival probability at the first convolutional layer is 1.0 and the last one is 0.5. Meanwhile, a reverse version of this schedule, v2, is designed to reduce total randomness in the model by gradually increasing dropout probabilities from 0.5 to 1.0. Additionally, a new schedule v3 is proposed based on the observation that deeper layers in DenseNet rely more on high-level features. In schedule v3, survival probabilities for different layers' outputs are determined based on their distances to the convolutional layer. The most recent output is assigned the highest probability, while the earliest one gets the lowest. The properties of v3 can be summarized as p(i,j) = DISPLAYFORM0, where d(i, j) denotes the distance between layer i and j. When using v3 in DenseNet, low-level features from shallow layers are more likely to be dropped, while high-level features have a better chance of being retained. Survival probabilities decrease as layers go deeper, as earlier layer outputs have been used more. This concept can be applied to other networks as well. Experimental results were conducted on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, which are suitable for normal-sized models to avoid overfitting. When implementing DenseNet models, various structures like DenseNet-40, DenseNet-BC-76, DenseNet-BC-100, and DenseNet-BC-147 with a growth rate of 12 are used. Data augmentation includes horizontal flipping and translation. Training involves 300 epochs with a batch size of 64, an initial learning rate of 0.1, and dropout with a fixed survival probability of 0.5. Test errors are reported after each epoch, with final results reflecting errors after the last epoch. Further hyper-parameter tuning may improve results. In experiments using different DenseNet structures on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, specialized dropout showed superior accuracy without adding extra parameters. Results indicate consistent improvements over standard dropout, with a 0.8M parameter DenseNet-BC-100 outperforming a 1001 layer ResNet model. Data augmentation already enhances model generalization, potentially reducing the effectiveness of other regularization methods. Our specialized dropout method demonstrates better accuracy improvements on larger DenseNets, particularly on the CIFAR100 dataset. Comparing unit-wise predropout with standard dropout on DenseNet structures, the predropout structure achieves higher accuracy. This is attributed to better feature-reuse and stimulation of various features in the network. However, correlated features may compensate for dropped features in standard dropout, disadvantaging the predropout method. In comparing dropout granularities on DenseNet-BC-76 using CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, channel-wise dropout showed the best accuracy. Layer-wise dropout performed the worst due to discarding useful features at once. The study also explored different stochastic probability schedules, with v3 proving to be the most effective. Our study found that schedule v3 was the most effective for specialized dropout methods, with v2 being the worst. The results for DenseNet-BC-76 on CIFAR10 augmentation dataset showed that v2 reduced randomness but led to a loss of low-level features, impacting accuracy. Schedule v3 assigned higher survival probabilities to shallow layers, helping deep layers rely more on high-level features, making it better than v1. The specialized dropout method in DenseNet-BC-148 showed improved accuracy by providing strong regularization effects, leading to lower test error and better model generalization ability. This indicates that designing a specialized dropout method for DenseNet can enhance performance. The specialized dropout method was initially developed for DenseNet, and now the study aims to apply it to other CNN models like AlexNet, VGG-16, and ResNet. The method involves pre-dropout structure, channel-wise granularity, and adjusting dropout probability based on input size. Results show that models with the specialized dropout method outperform their original versions, indicating the effectiveness of this approach in improving performance across different CNN models. In this paper, a specialized dropout method was developed for DenseNet to improve model generalization ability. The method involves a new pre-dropout structure, channel-wise dropout granularity, and stochastic probability to add noise to different layers. Experiments show that DenseNets with this specialized dropout method outperform other CNN models in terms of accuracy."
