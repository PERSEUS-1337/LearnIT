It is jointly financed by the federal government and states, with an estimated cost of $494 billion in FY2014. Participation in Medicaid is voluntary for states, which have the flexibility to design their own version within federal guidelines. States incur costs by making payments to service providers and performing administrative activities. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that provides medical services to individuals. It is financed by the federal government and states, with states entitled to federal matching funds as long as they meet program requirements. Medicaid is an entitlement for both states and individuals, guaranteeing coverage to those who meet eligibility standards. This report gives an overview of Medicaid's financing structure, including federal and state financing issues, and discusses Medicaid expenditures in terms of national health spending, trends, economic factors, and state variability. The federal government and states share the cost of Medicaid, with federal funding being an open-ended entitlement to states. This arrangement aims to share the cost of providing healthcare services to low-income residents. The federal government's financial commitment to Medicaid incentivizes states to extend coverage to more low-income individuals. The federal government provides fiscal incentives for states to expand Medicaid coverage to low-income individuals, but states must share in the costs. Certain federal Medicaid funding, like DSH funding and programs in territories, are capped. Medicaid expenditures are mostly covered by the federal government through FMAP rates. The federal government determines the FMAP rate annually based on each state's per capita income relative to the U.S. average. FMAP rates range from 50% to 83%, with lower rates for states with higher incomes. Exceptions to the regular FMAP rate exist for certain states, situations, populations, and providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) included exceptions to the regular Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rate, such as the newly eligible federal matching rates and the expansion state federal matching rates. The newly eligible federal matching rate provides a 100% federal matching rate for individuals newly eligible for Medicaid due to the ACA expansion, phasing down to 90% after 2020. The expansion state federal matching rate covers individuals in expansion states eligible for Medicaid before March 23, 2010. The federal share of Medicaid expenditures has increased under the ACA, with the federal matching rate ranging from 72% to 92% in 2014. The federal share was 60% in FY2014 and is expected to remain around 60% through at least FY2023. Medicaid is a federal entitlement categorized as mandatory spending, bypassing the annual appropriations process. Medicaid is funded through annual appropriations acts, making it an appropriated entitlement subject to funding limitations set by Congress. The budget authority for Medicaid is based on benefit and eligibility criteria, with changes typically made through statute. The appropriations bill allocates funding for Medicaid for the fiscal year. The appropriations bill provides funding for Medicaid for the fiscal year and an advance appropriation for the following year. States have flexibility in determining funding sources for their share of Medicaid expenditures, leading to variation in funding sources. In state fiscal year 2013, 73% of the state share of Medicaid expenditures was financed by state general funds, with the remaining 27% financed by other state funds. States have used various funding sources (such as taxes, local government funds, tobacco settlement funds) to finance their share of Medicaid, with federal regulations prohibiting the use of federal funds for this purpose. Some states have utilized financing mechanisms to maximize federal Medicaid funds, including provider taxes and intergovernmental transfers. Medicaid expenditures, influenced by various factors, account for a significant portion of total health expenditures in the US. The ACA Medicaid expansion is expected to further increase Medicaid spending. There is considerable variation in Medicaid spending among states due to demographic differences, policy choices, and utilization of services. In 2014, Medicaid represented 16% of national health expenditures, while private health insurance and Medicare accounted for 33% and 20% respectively. Medicaid has grown as a percentage of national health expenditures since its inception in 1966, mainly due to expansions in eligibility criteria. It is now one of the largest payers in the U.S. healthcare system, particularly in categories like long-term services and supports. In 2014, Medicaid accounted for 56% of expenditures in residential and personal care, 36% in home health, and 32% in nursing. In 2014, Medicaid accounted for a significant portion of national health expenditures, including 56% in residential and personal care, 36% in home health, and 32% in nursing facilities. Medicaid's expenditure growth has been driven by expansions in eligibility criteria, with the ACA Medicaid expansion expected to further increase expenditures in the coming years. Medicaid expenditures in FY2014 totaled $494 billion, with federal expenditures at $299 billion and state expenditures at $195 billion. Federal expenditures grew by almost 14% from FY2013 to FY2014, while state expenditures only grew by 1% due to enhanced federal matching rates for the ACA Medicaid expansion. Projected Medicaid expenditures are estimated to reach $835 billion in FY2023, with ACA Medicaid expansion contributing $457 billion from FY2014 to FY2023. In FY2014, Medicaid expenditures totaled $494 billion, with federal government paying 93% of the $457 billion projected from ACA Medicaid expansion. Most expenditures are for medical assistance, with a 9.5% increase in spending for FY2014. Managed care accounted for 37% of Medicaid expenditures, while long-term services and supports made up 23%. Medicaid expenditures in FY2014 totaled $494 billion, with long-term services and supports accounting for 23% of all Medicaid expenditures. Per-enrollee Medicaid expenditures varied significantly by eligibility group, ranging from $2,807 for children to $17,352 for individuals with disabilities. Aged and disabled populations have higher per-enrollee expenditures due to consuming most long-term services and supports. In FY2013, Medicaid expenditures varied by eligibility group, with aged and disabled populations accounting for 64% of expenditures despite only representing 26% of enrollment. Economic, demographic, and programmatic factors influence Medicaid spending. Medicaid spending is influenced by state decisions on coverage, provider payments, and enrollment. Economic factors impact Medicaid enrollment, with growth during economic downturns. Total Medicaid spending is concentrated in the most populous states. State Medicaid expenditures vary significantly, with the seven most populous states accounting for almost half of the total spending. Demographic differences and state policy choices contribute to the variation in per-enrollee expenditures. Medicaid is a major source of general revenue-based health service spending, with significant federal budget implications. State Medicaid expenditures vary due to utilization, provider payment rates, and policy choices. Federal Medicaid spending is expected to rise due to the ACA expansion, making it a target for deficit reduction proposals. Proposed reforms include converting Medicaid to a block grant in budget resolutions. The FY2016 Senate Budget Resolution proposes converting Medicaid to a capped allotment for low-income adults and children. Senators Burr and Hatch, along with Representative Upton, released the CARE Act, which also suggests this change.
