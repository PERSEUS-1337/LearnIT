    "content": "The \"Hydroelectric Licensing and Incentives Act of 2001\" amends the Federal Power Act to improve the hydropower relicensing process by adding a new section for federal agencies to consider conditions for licenses. The \"Hydroelectric Licensing and Incentives Act of 2001\" introduces definitions for key terms related to conditions and consulting agencies in the licensing process for projects on Federal reservations and fishways. The \"Hydroelectric Licensing and Incentives Act of 2001\" outlines factors that consulting agencies must consider when determining conditions for project licenses, including economic effects, impact on public uses, compatibility with other conditions, and existing site conditions. The \"Hydroelectric Licensing and Incentives Act of 2001\" requires consulting agencies to document all proposals, comments, facts, and analyses to demonstrate compliance with conditions for project licenses. The \"Hydroelectric Licensing and Incentives Act of 2001\" mandates consulting agencies to submit documentation for proposed conditions to the Commission, allowing for public comment and a hearing. After an applicant files for a license, a consulting agency must provide a final condition within a specified timeframe. The Hydroelectric Licensing and Incentives Act of 2001 requires consulting agencies to submit final conditions for a license within one year of the Commission's notice. Failure to meet this deadline results in loss of authority for the consulting agency to recommend conditions, allowing the Commission to establish appropriate conditions if necessary. The Hydroelectric Licensing and Incentives Act of 2001 allows consulting agencies to propose conditions for a license within a year. The Commission can extend deadlines for good cause. Amendments to the Federal Power Act include changes to section 3(17)(E)(ii) and section 4(e). Section 14(b) of the Hydroelectric Licensing and Incentives Act is amended to replace \"its\" with \"it\". Section 18 is amended to change the prescribed authority from the Secretary of Commerce to the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce. Section 21 is amended to add a colon after \"$3,000\". Section 30(c)(1) is amended to add a comma after \"Service\". SEC. 3. HYDROELECTRIC PRODUCTION INCENTIVES. Incentive payments are provided by the Secretary of Energy to owners or operators of qualified hydroelectric facilities for energy generated and sold during the incentive period. Payments are subject to availability of appropriations and require an application demonstrating eligibility. Definitions for qualified hydroelectric facilities are outlined in the section. A qualified hydroelectric facility is a turbine or generating device owned by a non-Federal entity that generates hydroelectric energy for sale and is added to an existing dam or conduit. An existing dam or conduit is one that was completed before the enactment of this section and does not require construction or enlargement of impoundment or diversion structures for the installation of a turbine. The terms defined in this subsection apply regardless of other considerations. The terms defined in this subsection apply without regard to the hydroelectric kilowatt capacity, ownership of the dam, or the facility's operation start date. Payments for electric energy from a qualified hydroelectric facility can be made within a 10-year eligibility window starting from the enactment of the Act. The facility can receive payments for a 10-year incentive period once it becomes eligible. Payments for qualified hydroelectric facilities are based on the kilowatt hours generated, with a rate of 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour. The maximum payment a facility can receive in a calendar year is $1,000,000. Adjustments for inflation are made annually starting from 2001. In 2001, payments for qualified hydroelectric facilities are calculated based on kilowatt hours generated at a rate of 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour, with a maximum annual payment of $1,000,000. No payments can be made after 20 fiscal years from enactment, and no payments after 10 years of payment. $50,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2011. SEC. 4. HYDROELECTRIC EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT. The Secretary of Energy will provide incentive payments to improve efficiency by at least 3 percent at existing hydroelectric facilities. Payments cannot exceed 10 percent of improvement costs or $1,000,000 per facility. A maximum of $50,000,000 is authorized annually for this purpose. SEC. 5. SMALL HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECTS. Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to change the date. SEC. 6. INCREASED HYDROELECTRIC GENERATION AT EXISTING FEDERAL FACILITIES. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of the Army, will conduct studies on cost-effective opportunities to increase hydropower generation at existing federally-owned water facilities. Studies must be completed within two years and individual reports will be prepared for each river basin, identifying ways to improve efficiency through mechanical, structural, or operational changes. Opportunities to enhance water use efficiency in Federal projects for increased hydropower generation, create additional capacity at existing facilities, assess costs and environmental impacts. The Secretary of Energy may incorporate existing studies into required studies. Authorization for necessary funds is provided."
