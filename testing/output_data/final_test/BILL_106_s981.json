    "content": "The \"Violence Prevention Training for Early Childhood Educators Act\" aims to provide grants to institutions offering early childhood education training programs to include violence prevention training for individuals pursuing careers in early childhood development and education. Congress finds that early childhood aggression is a strong predictor of later violent behavior. Research shows that aggression is learned through observation and experience, putting children at risk if they witness violence. In a study, 1 in 10 children had witnessed a shooting or stabbing before age 6. Violence prevention programs for very young children can have economic benefits by promoting health and stability, as early childhood is a critical period for addressing the risk of violent behavior. Studies show that children exposed to violence in their families are more likely to exhibit violent behavior as adolescents, highlighting the importance of early intervention to support prosocial behavior and prevent aggression from becoming ingrained. Violence prevention programs for young children yield economic benefits by promoting health and stability, reducing costs for medical care, special education, and judicial involvement. Primary prevention through teaching interpersonal problem-solving skills can decrease problem behaviors. Family support programs for children under 5 are effective in preventing delinquency. The curr_chunk is a section titled \"SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\" The curr_chunk defines \"at-risk child\" as a child affected by violence and \"early childhood education training program\" as a program that trains individuals to work with young children in various educational settings.
