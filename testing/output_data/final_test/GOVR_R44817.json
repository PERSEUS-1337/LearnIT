    "content": "In June 2016, British voters supported Brexit, the UK exiting the EU. Members of Congress have discussed launching US-UK FTA negotiations, with President Trump expressing support for a quick agreement. Talks between Trump and UK PM May have laid the groundwork for future FTA discussions. The possibility of a post-Brexit U.S.-UK Free Trade Agreement (FTA) represents a shift in U.S. trade policy from previous focus on U.S.-EU negotiations. The U.S. and UK have strong trade ties, with the UK seen as a liberalizing force within the EU. Previous interest in a U.S.-UK FTA has been expressed, including the idea of the UK joining NAFTA. The UK's formal U.S.-UK FTA negotiations are delayed due to EU membership terms. Prime Minister May triggered the Article 50 exit process in 2017, leading to prolonged negotiations with the EU. Until the UK formally exits, trade is governed by WTO parameters. The United States and the UK could pursue informal discussions on a potential bilateral FTA, with Congress having important legislative responsibilities. Congress has the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and establishes trade negotiating objectives. The 2015 Trade Promotion Authority legislation grants Congress the authority to approve FTAs, with a decision on future implementing legislation for a U.S.-UK FTA to enter into force. The United States and the UK have a significant economic relationship, with U.S. goods and services exports totaling $121 billion to the UK in 2016. The UK is the second-largest trading partner within the EU for the United States. In global goods trade, the UK is the fifth-largest export destination and seventh-largest source of imports for the United States. The UK is the United States' fifth-largest export destination and seventh-largest source of imports. Top U.S. exports to the UK include civilian aircraft, gold bullion, pharmaceuticals, and art. The UK is the largest services trading partner for the U.S., covering sectors like financial services and tourism. The U.S. is the UK's largest food and agricultural trading partner outside the EU. Bilateral foreign direct investment is also significant in the relationship. In recent years, U.S. and UK majority-owned multinational enterprises have employed over 2 million employees at their subsidiaries in each other's markets. U.S.-UK FDI totaled $1.2 trillion in 2015, with the UK being a significant destination for U.S. FDI abroad and the largest source of FDI in the United States. Key industries in the U.S.-UK investment relationship include finance, insurance, professional services, and manufacturing. U.S. companies are attracted to the UK for its open business environment, skilled workforce, and access to the EU Single Market. Brexit is expected to give the UK authority to set its own external tariffs and trade policy, currently controlled by the EU. U.S. financial companies in the UK benefit from \"passporting rights\" to operate in the EU. UK majority-owned MNEs with U.S. operations contribute significantly to U.S. trade. The U.S. and UK have minimal trade frictions, but the UK is involved in a U.S.-EU dispute over Boeing and Airbus subsidies. Formal U.S.-UK FTA negotiations are pending. Until the UK completes its withdrawal from the EU, the EU retains control over the UK's trade policy. Informal discussions between the United States and the UK may precede formal negotiations for a trade agreement. The European Commission spokesperson compared informal discussions to reading a menu without ordering food. Brexit variables could impact a potential U.S.-UK FTA, including UK-EU negotiations on withdrawal, trade relationship post-exit, WTO negotiations, and transitional arrangements. The timing of Brexit negotiations could affect when the UK can pursue formal FTA talks with the U.S. The UK's trade relationship with the EU may influence bilateral FTA negotiations with the U.S. Terms negotiated with the WTO could set a baseline for U.S.-UK FTA talks. The UK's trade relations with the US depend on its relationship with the EU, which in turn hinges on Brexit negotiations. Clarity on the UK's internal market is crucial for US negotiators to start FTA talks. The UK prefers parallel negotiations with the EU on future partnership and withdrawal terms. Brexit negotiations involve the UK-EU future partnership and withdrawal terms. The EU insists on prioritizing withdrawal negotiations before trade talks. Questions arise about UK access to the Single Market and retention of EU regulations. Prime Minister May outlined negotiating objectives for exiting the EU in a 2017 speech. The UK's trade relations heavily rely on its integration with the EU. The UK is not seeking EU Single Market membership but aims for an FTA for trade. The agreement may include elements of the single market in certain areas. No trade deal is preferred over a bad one, according to the Prime Minister. EU officials and industry groups are involved in negotiations. The UK aims for an FTA with the EU for trade, not Single Market membership. The Prime Minister prefers no trade deal over a bad one. EU officials and industry groups are involved in negotiations. The UK government seeks new trade agreements post-Brexit and plans to establish a new customs arrangement with the EU. Chancellor of the Exchequer confirmed that the UK cannot stay in the customs union to independently negotiate trade deals outside the EU. The UK triggered Article 50 for Brexit in March 2017. UK Cabinet ministers affirmed the need for a \"time-limited\" transition period post-Brexit. The UK may focus on certain sectors like autos, chemicals, and financial services in trade negotiations with the EU. The UK's trade negotiations with the EU post-Brexit may focus on sectors like autos, chemicals, and financial services. The UK's membership in the WTO and potential redefinition of its commitments could impact future trade relationships, including with the United States. Formal U.S.-UK FTA negotiations are currently precluded, but informal discussions may still take place. The UK, a founding member of the WTO, currently holds WTO membership through the EU. Transitioning to an independent position in the WTO will require negotiating new goods and services schedules. Establishing tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) may be complex due to the reallocation of the EU's quotas. The UK, as a founding member of the WTO, needs to negotiate new goods and services schedules as it transitions to an independent position in the organization. This process includes establishing tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) which may be complicated due to the reallocation of the EU's quotas. There are concerns about securing approval from WTO members for the proposed schedule, with potential leverage from countries with territorial disputes with the UK. However, lack of formal approval should not hinder the UK from negotiating trade agreements with other countries. The UK needs to negotiate new schedules with the WTO as it transitions to independence. The EU's schedule has not hindered FTAs, and the UK aims to replicate its current obligations. This process does not affect future UK-EU trading arrangements. The UK's WTO commitments remain based on the EU's schedules until Brexit. In the absence of a trade arrangement, WTO terms govern UK's trade with countries like the US. US-UK FTA negotiations would follow US trade objectives set in the Trade Promotion Authority legislation. The US-UK FTA negotiations will be guided by US trade objectives, focusing on reducing tariff and nontariff barriers in goods, services, and agriculture. Market access expansion and tariff liberalization are key areas of discussion. Industrial tariffs between the US and UK are already low. The EU tariffs on automobiles are 10%, while higher tariffs exist on products like meat, fish, sugar, dairy products, soft drinks, and wine. Market access issues similar to those in the U.S.-EU negotiations may arise in a U.S.-UK FTA. Services trade could also be a significant focus in potential FTA negotiations. Regulatory barriers in services may be a key point of discussion. Regulatory and other barriers to trade in services, licensing requirements for professional service providers, rules on the movement of foreign nationals for business travel, and market access issues like public procurement could be key points of discussion in U.S.-UK FTA negotiations. Cultural exceptions and concerns about public procurement markets may also arise. In U.S.-UK FTA negotiations, concerns include transparency of EU public procurement policies and U.S. restrictions in sensitive sectors. President Trump supports \"Buy American\" policies, while the UK aims to use government procurement for innovation. Buy American policies may conflict with the WTO Government Procurement Agreement. In U.S.-UK FTA negotiations, investment rules could be a major part, including market access commitments, investor protections, and enforcement through investor-state dispute settlement. The treatment of ISDS is an open question due to potential implications for regulatory issues. The EU's proposal for an \"Investment Court System\" in recent trade agreements has sparked public debates on T-TIP. Digital trade, including cross-border data flows, is crucial for the U.S.-UK trading relationship. A U.S.-UK FTA could address ways to facilitate cross-border data flows and reduce barriers to digital trade. The position of the Trump Administration and the UK on the Investment Court System is uncertain. Discussions on digital trade and intellectual property rights (IPR) in a potential U.S.-UK FTA are highlighted. Privacy concerns over cross-border data flows may not be as sensitive as in previous negotiations. Both countries see IPR as a competitive advantage and may cooperate on issues like cyber theft and biologics protection. Geographical indications (GIs) may be less contentious in a bilateral FTA compared to previous agreements. A U.S.-UK FTA could address challenges on IPR issues like geographical indications (GIs), with the UK having over 60 registered GIs. Other potential areas of discussion include labor, environment, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and support for small- and medium-sized exports. The UK's strong environmental protections could alleviate concerns about outsourcing or lowering standards through the FTA. A U.S.-UK FTA could include commitments on regulatory cooperation, standard-setting, and addressing challenges on IPR issues like geographical indications. Sectoral issues of interest might include motor vehicle, pharmaceutical, chemical, and food safety regulatory regimes. The U.S. sees this as an opportunity to open the UK market to exports currently constrained by EU restrictions. The UK is more aligned with the U.S. on regulatory issues than the EU, but there are differences, such as consumer rejection of genetically engineered foods. Regulatory cooperation has been a major issue in the transatlantic relationship due to differing approaches. The U.S. prefers risk-based assessments, while the EU follows the precautionary principle. T-TIP negotiations faced challenges over food safety and regulatory concerns, but progress has been made in some areas. The UK plans to introduce a \"Great Repeal Bill\" to convert EU law into domestic law after Brexit negotiations, deciding which laws to keep, amend, or repeal. Regulatory cooperation and standard setting with the US in a bilateral FTA will depend on the UK reclaiming regulatory authority from the EU. The UK plans to introduce a \"Great Repeal Bill\" to convert EU law into domestic law after Brexit negotiations. UK regulations aligning with EU regulations may ease trading with the EU, but could pose challenges with US standards. Divergences in regulatory approaches could benefit UK trade relations with the US. Prospects for a US-UK FTA depend on various factors, including negotiations aligning with US trade objectives. Timing for negotiations depends on the outcome of Brexit negotiations. The UK has been rebuilding its trade negotiating capacity after outsourcing skills to Brussels for decades. Interest in trade agreements with countries having FTAs with the EU and those that do not has been indicated. The EU has over 50 trade agreements worldwide, raising questions on where a U.S.-UK FTA would rank in priorities once legal and procedural roadblocks are removed. If legal and procedural roadblocks to U.S.-UK FTA negotiations are removed, the process would be relatively easy and fast due to shared support for trade liberalization. Negotiating dynamics would be simpler with only two economies involved. Some analysts believe U.S.-UK FTA negotiations would be less difficult than T-TIP. Calls have been made for a U.S.-UK FTA to be implemented within 90 days after Brexit. The U.S.-UK FTA talks are in a pre-negotiation stage, with potential economic benefits depending on the depth of commitments. Broad macroeconomic factors play a significant role in affecting the overall economy. Despite the openness of both economies, further trade liberalization could result in modest economic gains. Further trade liberalization in a potential U.S.-UK FTA could benefit specific industries, but may not replicate the broader market access of the EU. Job losses and transition costs could occur, but may be less compared to other FTAs due to both countries being advanced economies. Congress would likely review studies to assess the agreement's impact on the U.S. economy. The economic impact of a U.S.-UK FTA is uncertain due to various factors, including Brexit-specific issues and the complexity of trade agreements. It is challenging to estimate the precise impact on the economy, especially in the short term. Congress would likely review studies to assess the agreement's impact on the U.S. economy. A U.S.-UK FTA could have strategic implications, setting globally relevant rules and strengthening the transatlantic trade relationship. It may also apply pressure on unlocking past stumbling blocks in T-TIP negotiations. This aligns with the Trump Administration's focus on bilateral trade deals. The Trump Administration prefers bilateral trade deals over multiparty ones to leverage U.S. economic strength and priorities. This contrasts with the Obama Administration's focus on regional trade deals like TPP and T-TIP. Once Brexit hurdles are cleared, the timing of U.S.-UK FTA negotiations remains uncertain amidst other potential trade talks. The administration aims to prioritize renegotiating existing FTAs before launching new negotiations. The Trump Administration is focusing on bilateral trade deals, including renegotiating existing FTAs like NAFTA and pursuing new FTAs with countries like Japan. There is debate over whether the U.S. should prioritize negotiating a U.S.-UK FTA, with some arguing for deals with countries that present greater trade barriers. The Trump Administration is prioritizing bilateral trade deals, including renegotiating existing FTAs like NAFTA and pursuing new FTAs with countries like Japan. T-TIP negotiations with the EU are on pause, with unresolved issues causing public opposition and questions about political momentum. The Trump Administration is currently evaluating the status of these negotiations. Brexit uncertainties impact T-TIP negotiations. UK's role questioned. Potential for U.S.-UK FTA pressure on EU. EU-Japan FTA may spur U.S. interest in T-TIP. The Brexit process may accelerate U.S. interest in resuming negotiations for a potential U.S.-UK trade agreement. The European Commission would continue negotiating on behalf of all 28 member states, including the UK. Formal negotiations for a bilateral FTA are at least two years away, but informal discussions can take place in the meantime. Congress plays a crucial role in examining potential trade agreements and negotiating priorities.
