    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" summarizes the title and key findings of a section. The \"Election Assistance Commission Termination Act\" cites findings related to the budget growth and management costs of the Election Assistance Commission (EAC). Funding for the EAC increased beyond authorized amounts, leading to concerns about management costs exceeding budget allocations. The EAC has distributed over $3.2 billion in election reform grants to states, with the most recent appropriations in fiscal year 2010. The EAC issued voluntary voting system guidelines in 2005, and 11 voting systems are currently certified by the EAC. The research division has completed required reports, but the EAC has faced calls for dissolution in 2005 and 2010. Since December 2010, the EAC has lacked a quorum of commissioners and has had no commissioners since December 2011. The EAC has been without an Executive Director since December 2011 and a General Counsel since May 2012. The existence of the EAC is deemed unnecessary for Federal elections and is seen as a wasteful use of taxpayer funds. Any essential functions of the EAC can be carried out by other government entities or private associations. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 is amended to terminate the Election Assistance Commission, including its Standards Board and Board of Advisors. The Office of Management and Budget will handle transition functions. The Office of Management and Budget will perform transition functions for the termination of the Election Assistance Commission, including handling contracts and agreements until their expiration and winding up the Commission's affairs. The termination of the Election Assistance Commission will not affect any existing contracts or payments made by the Commission. Contracts will remain in effect until modified or terminated by authorized officials or through legal processes. Recipients of payments can still use any unobligated funds after the Commission's termination date, following the original terms and conditions. The termination of the Election Assistance Commission will not impact existing contracts or payments. Recipients can still use unobligated funds according to original terms. For states receiving requirements payments, general federal terms and conditions will apply. If general terms and conditions conflict with specified terms under certain sections, the latter will apply. The termination of the Commission will not affect pending proceedings, with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget taking over. Orders, appeals, judgments, and payments can still proceed in such cases. Orders, judgments, and payments can continue even after the Commission is terminated. Any orders will remain in effect until modified by an authorized official or court. Regulations may be issued for the transfer of proceedings. Regulations for the transfer of proceedings under section 1002 shall be subject to judicial review to the same extent as if issued by the Commission. Judicial review requirements applicable to the Commission also apply to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. SEC. 1004 transfers certain functions under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 to the Federal Election Commission upon the Commission termination date. SEC. 1005 establishes the Commission termination date. SEC. 1005 establishes the Commission termination date as the first date following the expiration of a 60-day period after the enactment of this title. The Technical Guidelines Development Committee will be terminated on this date. The text chunk outlines the termination of the Commission, transfer of functions to the Office of Management and Budget, savings provisions, return of authority to the Federal Election Commission, and the Commission termination date. Conforming amendments related to the return of certain authority to the Federal Election Commission are also mentioned. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 and the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 are amended to transfer duties to the Federal Election Commission. The effective date of these amendments is tied to the Commission termination date outlined in the Help America Vote Act of 2002. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 added duties to the Federal Election Commission."
