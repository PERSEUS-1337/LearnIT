The Congress established criteria for creating new Federal judicial districts in 1978, including caseload, judicial administration, geography, and community convenience. The caseload criterion considers the total number of Federal court cases and the need for a separate judicial district in southern counties of New Jersey due to a substantial criminal caseload. The southern region of New Jersey has a high criminal caseload, with 281 federal criminal cases in 1998. This exceeds the caseload of 51 other federal judicial districts. The substantial civil caseload in the same area necessitates the creation of a separate judicial district. In 1998, the southern region of New Jersey had 2,116 Federal civil cases, handled by 8 judges. This caseload exceeds that of 52 other Federal judicial districts. Comparatively, the Southern District of West Virginia and the Western District of Tennessee, each with 5 judges, had fewer civil cases filed. The backlog of pending cases in the southern counties of New Jersey necessitates the creation of a separate Federal judicial district. The Camden vicinage has more pending cases than entire judicial districts with similar numbers of judges, indicating the need for a separate district. For example, there are 1,431 civil cases pending in Camden, with only 113 filed in 1999, compared to districts like Western District of Tennessee and Western District of Oklahoma with fewer pending cases. The District of Oklahoma had 1,359 civil cases pending in 1998 before 6 judges. In the Camden vicinage, there were 161 criminal cases pending, while the Southern District of Indiana had only 116 criminal cases pending in 1998. The criterion of \"geography\" refers to the accessibility of the central administration of the Federal judicial district. The distance between northern and southern regions of New Jersey creates a barrier to efficient justice administration. When a new Federal court district was created in Louisiana in 1971, the distance between New Orleans and Baton Rouge was a major factor due to travel difficulties impeding justice administration. The criterion of \"community convenience\" means creating a new district to better serve diverse populations. New Jersey's 8,000,000 citizens are inconvenienced by having only 1 judicial district, unlike the 25 states with a single district. New Jersey has the highest population among several states with smaller populations that have multiple Federal judicial districts. The creation of a new Southern District of New Jersey is being evaluated, with input sought from relevant authorities as per established procedures. The text establishes 2 judicial districts in New Jersey - the Northern District and the Southern District. The Northern District includes Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset, Sussex, Union, and Warren counties with court held in Newark. The Southern District in New Jersey comprises Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester, Mercer, and Salem counties. Court for this district is held in Camden and Trenton. The number of judgeships and bankruptcy judgeships for the Southern District is 8 and 4 respectively. In the Southern District of New Jersey, there are 8 district judges, 4 bankruptcy judges, magistrate judges, a United States Attorney, a United States Marshal, and a Federal Public Defender. Any district judge of the District Court of New Jersey in specific counties will be transferred to either the Northern or Southern District of New Jersey based on their official duty station. Vacancies in judgeships in either district will be offered to eligible candidates. In the District Court of New Jersey, vacancies will be offered to eligible judges based on seniority. Bankruptcy and magistrate judges in specific counties will be transferred to the Northern or Southern District of New Jersey. Bankruptcy and magistrate judges in specific counties in the District Court of New Jersey will be transferred to the Northern or Southern District of New Jersey. This Act will not affect the tenure of office for the United States attorney, United States marshal, and Federal Public Defender in office on the effective date. The Act transfers bankruptcy and magistrate judges to the Northern or Southern District of New Jersey. It appoints new officials for the Southern District and does not affect pending cases or juries. The Act and its amendments do not impact the composition or service of any juries in the Judicial District of New Jersey on the effective date of the Act. The Act and its amendments will take effect 180 days after enactment. The President and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit can make appointments under section 3(c)(2) at any time after enactment."
