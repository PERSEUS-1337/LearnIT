    "content": "Traditional models for question answering optimize using cross entropy loss, but this approach penalizes nearby or overlapping answers. To address this, a mixed objective combining cross entropy loss with self-critical policy learning is proposed, using rewards based on word overlap. Additionally, a deep residual coattention encoder inspired by deep self-attention and residual networks is introduced to improve model performance, especially for long questions requiring the capture of long-term dependencies. On the Stanford Question Answering Dataset, the model achieves state-of-the-art results with 75.1% exact match accuracy and 83.1% F1, while the ensemble reaches 78.9% exact match accuracy and 86.0% F1. The existing state-of-the-art question answering models achieve 78.9% exact match accuracy and 86.0% F1. However, there is a disconnect between optimization and evaluation in training approaches, where penalizing answers based on position can be harmful. The Golden State Warriors team of 2017 is considered one of the greatest in NBA history. A mixed objective approach combining traditional cross entropy loss with reinforcement learning is proposed to improve answer generation in question answering models. The text discusses a mixed training objective that combines cross entropy loss with reinforcement learning to improve answer generation in question answering models. It also introduces a deep residual coattention encoder in the Dynamic Coattention Network to enhance input representations and facilitate long-range dependencies. The use of skip layer connections and residual connections helps in signal propagation and gradient degradation alleviation. The deep residual coattention encoder combined with a mixed objective improves performance on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) BID20, especially on long questions. The model, DCN+, achieves state-of-the-art results with 75.1% exact match accuracy and 83.1% F1. When ensembled, it reaches 78.9% exact match accuracy and 86.0% F1. The model is based on the Dynamic Coattention Network (DCN) with a coattention encoder and dynamic decoder for question answering tasks. The DCN decoder iteratively estimates start and end positions, with a deep residual coattention encoder and mixed training objective. BID26 proposed stacked self-attention modules for improved signal traversal and long-range dependency modeling. The coattention encoder is enhanced with self-attention and residual connections to improve long-range dependency modeling. The encoder utilizes word embeddings for documents and questions to generate encodings. The coattention encoder incorporates a non-linear transform for question encoding and computes affinity matrix between document and question. Document and question summary vectors are computed, and a bidirectional LSTM is used for encoding. Multiple coattention layers are computed in a similar fashion. The coattention encoder uses a multi-valued mapping to process input sequences. The encoder differs from the original DCN in depth and use of residual connections. It incorporates ideas from transformer networks and residual networks to improve performance. The DCN produces distributions over the start and end positions of the answer. The DCN decoder produces distributions over the start and end positions of the answer, supervised using cross entropy loss. The question answering task has two evaluation metrics: exact match and binary score. The DCN decoder uses cross entropy loss to train the model to predict answer positions. Evaluation metrics for question answering include exact match and F1 score, which measures word overlap between predicted and ground truth answers. There is a discrepancy between the optimization objective and evaluation metrics, leading to a preference for F1 score in reinforcement learning. The reinforcement learning objective in question answering models is defined by the negative expected rewards over trajectories, using the F1 score as the reward function. A good baseline is used to reduce variance in gradient estimates and aid convergence. This is achieved by subtracting the baseline from the F1 word overlap reward. A self-critic mechanism is employed to calculate the F1 score during greedy inference without teacher forcing. The optimization problem in applying RL to natural language processing involves exploring a discontinuous and discrete space. RL approaches are often used for fine-tuning after pretraining, leading to constrained exploration. To address this, the optimization problem is treated as a multi-task learning problem. The optimization problem in natural language processing is approached as a multi-task learning problem, with tasks focusing on positional match and word overlap with the ground truth answer. The two losses are combined using homoscedastic uncertainty as task-dependent weightings. The gradient of the cross entropy objective is derived through backpropagation, while the gradient of the self-critical reinforcement learning objective is shown in equation 16. The mixed objective is computed to facilitate policy learning by pruning candidate trajectories. Without the former, policy learning struggles to converge due to the vast space of potential answers, documents, and questions. The model is trained and evaluated on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), showcasing its performance against other models. Preprocessing involves using a reversible tokenizer from Stanford CoreNLP and GloVe embeddings pretrained on the 840B Common Crawl corpus. Context vectors (CoVe) trained on WMT BID15 are concatenated with these embeddings. Word dropout with a probability of 0.075 is performed on the document, and out-of-vocabulary words have their embeddings and context vectors set to zero. Additionally, the first maxout layer of the highway maxout network in the DCN decoder is swapped with a sparse layer. The first maxout layer of the highway maxout network in the DCN decoder is replaced with a sparse mixture of experts layer. The model is trained using ADAM with default hyperparameters and implemented in PyTorch. The performance of the model, called DCN+, is compared to the baseline DCN with CoVe, showing a 3.2% improvement in exact match accuracy and F1 score on the SQuAD development set. DCN+ outperforms the baseline model on the SQuAD development set with a 3.2% improvement in F1 score. The deep residual coattention contributes the most to the model's performance, followed by the mixed objective. A sparse mixture of experts layer in the decoder provides minor enhancements. Training curves show that DCN+ with reinforcement learning initially lags behind but eventually surpasses the cross entropy model. The training curves for DCN+ with reinforcement learning and without reinforcement learning illustrate the effectiveness of the mixed objective. Combining cross entropy loss with reinforcement learning helps the model learn a reasonable policy and outperform the purely cross entropy model. Sample predictions show that both models retrieve answers with sensible entity types. The DCN+ model consistently makes fewer mistakes in finding the correct entity compared to other models. Examples show instances where the correct answer is identified despite misleading information. For instance, Gasquet referred to the plague as the \"Great Pestilence,\" but the phrase \"some form of ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague\" points to the correct answer. Similarly, Thomas Davis was injured in the NFC Championship Game but played in the Super Bowl. The examples highlight the model's ability to discern the correct entity in complex scenarios. Neural models for question answering, such as DCN+, use conditional attention mechanisms to find the correct entity in unstructured text. These models, like BID28 and BID22, build codependent representations of the question and document to improve accuracy. Gasquet's writings on the 'Great Pestilence' and Thomas Davis's injury in the NFC Championship Game are examples of how the model can identify the correct entity despite misleading information. Gasquet suggested the 'Great Pestilence' in 1893 was a form of bubonic plague. Thomas Davis broke his arm in the NFC Championship Game but still played in the Super Bowl. The complexity classes of decision problems depend on the chosen machine model, with the Cobham-Edmonds thesis stating that time complexities in different models are polynomially related. This forms the basis for the complexity class P, where problems are solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is FP. A language solved in quadratic time implies the use of a multi-tape Turing machine. Neural attention models, including self-attention and coattention, have been widely adopted in various natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and text summarization. The generation process in models involves a pointer network for predicting answer spans, with some models utilizing a dynamic decoder to improve accuracy. Coattention, bidirectional attention flow, and self-matching attention are techniques used in natural language processing tasks like question answering and text generation. Reinforcement learning methods have been applied to tasks with non-differentiable evaluation metrics, such as hierarchical reinforcement learning for text generation and deep Q-networks for learning policies in text-based games. Actor-critic temporal-difference methods have also been proposed for NLP tasks. DCN+ is a state-of-the-art question answering model that improves performance across question types, lengths, and answer lengths on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). It achieves 75.1% exact match accuracy and 83.1% F1, with an ensemble reaching 78.9% exact match accuracy and 86.0% F1."
