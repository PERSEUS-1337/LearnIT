    "content": "Some individuals in appointed positions in the executive branch may convert to career positions in the Senior Executive Service (SES) or excepted service, a practice known as \"burrowing in.\" This is allowed as long as laws and regulations are followed, often happening during transitions between administrations. These appointees are typically selected noncompetitively and serve in positions like Schedule C or noncareer SES, with salaries ranging from GS-12 to GS-15 levels. The Senior Executive Service (SES) includes noncareer and limited tenure members who receive salaries at GS-12 through GS-15 levels. Career employees are selected based on merit and without political influence, with job security that continues regardless of administrations. Career positions offer pay, benefits, and stability according to Paul Light, a government professor at New York University. The conversion of individuals from noncareer to career positions may not follow legal requirements and raises concerns about limiting opportunities for other employees. Burrowing in may be driven by the desire for job security, benefits, and pay, as highlighted by the President of the Senior Executives Association. The conversion of individuals from noncareer to career positions may raise concerns about limiting opportunities for other employees and increase tension between staff, hindering government operations. Appointments to career positions in the executive branch are governed by law and regulations. Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations outlines the procedures for appointments to career positions in the executive branch, ensuring compliance with civil service laws and preventing prohibited personnel practices. These actions must adhere to merit principles and prohibited personnel practices to maintain fairness and transparency in the selection process.

During the Presidential Election Period, certain appointees are prohibited from receiving financial awards, including senior politically appointed officers in noncareer SES positions, Schedule C employees in policy determining roles, and individuals in limited term positions. During the Presidential Election Period, certain appointees are prohibited from receiving financial awards. OPM and GAO oversee conversions of employees from noncareer to career positions to ensure proper procedures are followed. OPM requires approval before selecting a political appointee for a competitive service position during a Presidential election year. Beginning on January 1, 2010, departments and agencies must seek prior approval from OPM before appointing a current or recent political appointee to a competitive or non-political excepted service position at any level. Written authorization from OPM is now required for these appointments. According to a memorandum, OPM will conduct merit staffing reviews for proposed career SES selections involving political appointees before presenting them to the QRB for certification. OPM Director John Berry emphasized the importance of agencies ensuring that proposed SES selections adhere to merit system principles before being forwarded to the QRB. OPM will conduct merit staffing reviews for proposed career SES selections involving political appointees before presenting them to the QRB. Director John Berry delegated decision-making authority to career Senior Executives at OPM to avoid political influence. Pre-Appointment Checklists for Competitive Service Positions and Non-Political Excepted Service Positions were included as attachments to the OPM memorandum, outlining required documentation for submission. The complete file for the proposed merit selection includes vacancy announcement, recruiting sources, qualification standards, job analysis, rating schedule, applicant information, correspondence, compliance with regulatory requirements, documentation on declined offers, and referral lists. The pre-appointment checklist for non-political excepted service positions includes documentation such as position descriptions, explanation of current and proposed appointments, disposition of current political positions, and complete file for the proposed appointment. The pre-appointment checklist for non-political excepted service positions includes documentation such as evidence of fair and open competition, recruiting sources, qualifications, applications, veterans' preference consideration, and referral lists for the selecting official. It also includes contact information for the selecting official and rating panel members. OPM reminded departments and agencies in a 2012 memorandum not to create vacancies solely for political appointees or remove elements to appoint them. The Presidential Transition Guide provides guidance on ethical conduct, appointments, and compensation for federal employees. The GAO oversees ethical conduct, appointments, and compensation for federal employees, focusing on conversions from political to career positions. A 2010 evaluation found that 79 out of 139 conversions occurred in five agencies, with most conversions at the GS-12 level or above following proper procedures, but some may not have adhered to merit systems principles. In 117 conversions, agencies may not have followed merit systems principles or engaged in prohibited personnel practices. Congress monitors conversions, especially at DHS and DOJ, after Hurricane Katrina and improper procedures at DOJ. In a report to the DHS Secretary, the Homeland Security Advisory Council recommended considering political appointees with specialized skills for career positions. The DHS leadership journal discussed transition planning, filling top jobs with career professionals like Jay Ahern and Gale Rossides. The DHS is training senior career professionals like Gale Rossides for leadership continuity during transitions. Congress has reminded DHS and DOJ to examine personnel conversions to prevent political appointments in non-political executive positions. Some argue that allowing political appointees to fill non-political executive positions could hinder the new administration's policies. Representative Thompson urged Secretary Chertoff to prevent this practice. No public record of such a directive was found. Senators Feinstein and Charles raised concerns about personnel actions at the Department of Justice. Senators Feinstein and Schumer wrote a letter to Attorney General Mukasey urging vigilance against political appointees taking over career positions at the Department of Justice. They emphasized the importance of skilled candidates for maintaining agency professionalism and independence. Senator Lieberman later requested data on conversions from noncareer to career positions. Senator Lieberman requested data on conversions from noncareer to career positions for the period April 1, 2008, through December 19, 2008, including the number of requests approved, denied, and withdrawn by OPM, along with details on the review process and staff responsible. OPM responded to Senator Lieberman's request for data on conversions from noncareer to career positions. The agency stated that requests for conversion to non-SES positions are reviewed by ten staff members, including three career Senior Executives, while requests for conversion to SES positions are reviewed by eight staff members, including two career Senior Executives. OPM rigorously examines each request against mandatory legal requirements as the guardian of the merit system. OPM applies strict standards to uncover improper political influence in hiring actions. Agencies must submit a full record for each request, and any evidence of political influence results in withholding consent to the appointment. Senator Feinstein raised concerns about political appointees being improperly converted to career positions at the Department of Defense in 2009. In 2008 and 2009, there were concerns about political appointees being converted to career positions in various government departments. Senators Feinstein and Schumer expressed worry about this practice, known as \"burrowing in.\" In 2008 and 2009, concerns were raised about political appointees being converted to career positions in government departments.

OPM has a specific process for eligible individuals to apply for career positions, reviewed on a case-by-case basis by career employees. The Senior Executives Association requested evidence that the competitive selection process was followed for former political appointees transitioning to career positions, without political influence. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and the Associated Press reported on the conversion of political appointees to career SES positions. Congress may consider additional oversight measures to ensure transparency in the conversion process. Options include directing OPM to report to Congress on its policies for pre-appointment reviews. OPM may report to Congress on its policy for pre-appointment reviews, recommending potential amendments to Title 5, United States Code. The report could address improper conversions and remedial actions taken, as well as review awards programs and certify that awards were not granted during the Presidential Election Period. Congress could also direct OPM to assess the need for changes in the time period restricting financial awards to senior politically appointed officers. During the Presidential Election Period, financial awards to senior politically appointed officers are restricted by law. Congress could require detailed information on conversions in annual performance plans submitted with department and agency budget justifications. Officials with hiring authority may need to certify understanding of legal requirements on employee conversions. The curr_chunk discusses the need for training sessions on employee conversions, potential penalties for not following proper procedures, and the expedited transmittal of information to ensure timely remedial actions. It also suggests amending Title 5 United States Code to increase penalties for violating Civil Service laws.
