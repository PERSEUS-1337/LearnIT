It focuses on enhancing cybersecurity cooperation between the United States and Israel. The Secretary will establish a grant program at the Department to support cybersecurity research, development, demonstration, and commercialization of technology, in accordance with the agreement between the US and Israel on Homeland Security Matters. The Secretary will require at least 50% cost sharing from a non-Federal source for research, development, demonstration, or commercial application programs authorized under this section. The percentage requirement may be reduced or eliminated on a case-by-case basis. The Secretary may reduce or eliminate cost sharing requirements if deemed necessary. Awards for programs must undergo impartial scientific and technical merit review. Review processes may align with those developed under the Homeland Security Act. Eligibility criteria for applicants apply. Eligible applicants for cybersecurity research grants must address specific requirements determined by the Secretary. Projects must be joint ventures between entities in the United States and Israel or the Federal Government and the Government of Israel. To be eligible for a cybersecurity research grant from the Government of Israel, applicants must submit an application to the Secretary. An advisory board will be established to monitor grant awards and provide performance reviews to the Secretary. The advisory board for cybersecurity research grants will consist of three members appointed by the Secretary, including a representative of the Federal Government, one selected from nominees provided by the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation, and one selected from nominees provided by the United States-Israel Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation. The Secretary may accept funds from various sources to support this subsection. The grant program under this subsection allows funds to be used for projects without fiscal year limitation. Recipients must submit a report within 180 days of project completion detailing fund usage and project success. Grants are awarded only for unclassified projects by both the US and Israel. The program and advisory board will terminate seven years after the enactment of the Act. The Act prohibits additional funding for cybersecurity research and technology. Definitions for cybersecurity research, technology, and threats are provided in the Act. The Act (Public Law 114-113) defines the terms \"Department\" as the Department of Homeland Security and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Act (Public Law 114-113) was passed by the House of Representatives on November 29, 2016, with Karen L. Haas as the Clerk."
